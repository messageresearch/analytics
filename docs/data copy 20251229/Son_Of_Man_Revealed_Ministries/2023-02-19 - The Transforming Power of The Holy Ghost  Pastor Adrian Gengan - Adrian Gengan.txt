[Music] amen Romans chapter 14 and verse 17 he says for the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost amen the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost amen you may be seated amen so we'll speak this morning on the transforming power of the Holy Ghost amen amen so look at what this gives just by the title alone God giving us a gift but the gift is sent to transform us amen amen the gift is not to settle Us in this life the gift is sent to transform us amen you're the property saying God is going to have a church I don't care how many dark ages maybe seven Church ages are prophesied to come but he's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle you know there's a verse in the Bible that says there's gonna come a day A Dark Day a gloomy day that's prophecy amen everybody following me We Can't Stop prophecy the Bible says there's going to be a dark day a gloomy day right there's going to be a day where there's famine for the word of God we are living in that day amen we can't stop that prophecy but the prophecy continues he says but at evening time there shall be light amen amen hallelujah he says go start the shall cover the whole world amen but he says arise and shine there's another part of the prophecy and you and I are a part of the prophecy amen amen if if we continue in the way of the way of the world we will continue in a dark and gloomy way but we have got to make the word of God live and allow the word of God to transform us amen amen now God is transforming you from what you were amen maybe you're a daughter or son or whatever it is from a lovely family but God is placing you into his kingdom amen there's a difference between a normal human being and there's a difference between walking in the kingdom of God the one that's walking in the kingdom of God has been born again you can't compare yourself with a natural man who is not born again there are two different species people talk about discrimination there's discrimination right there people that are born in the kingdom of God are Heavenly amen amen and then there's the natural man walking according to the things of this world right two different beings one's heart has been turned Heavenly one is walking naturally amen so God is transforming you look where he brought you from he took you out of your family amen look at the things you have forsaken for the cause of the Gospel God what is he doing he's transforming you by the renewing of your mind and you don't even know except because sometimes In the Flesh you know we get sometimes all comfortable in the flesh and we think no maybe I can do this but the spirit of God doesn't allow you to do it right the spirit of God is there to keep you in line he's there to call you to prayer he's there to call you Amen to read the word he's there to call you to a time of fasting what is doing that the spirit of the Holy Ghost amen now what is Satan's plan Satan's plan is to make you conform to the world Satan's plan is to deform you right right the seed that is within you he wants to deform that sin amen is a deformer is a perverter and he's a corruptor of the Original Seed amen he deformed and corrupted the sea that was in Eden he caused the angels in heaven to fall and he's looking now to you in Satan's Heathen he wants to corrupt the seed word that's in you Amen in Isaiah 14 and verse 12 it says how have I fallen from heaven or Lucifer son of the morning how are they cut down to the ground which tips weaken the Nations Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also in the mouth of the congregation in the sides of the Lord that day is you Mount Zion holy Jerusalem is you Satan wants to establish his throne in your heart the place that God has established his throne Satan is saying I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the clouds either the clouds I will be like the most high what is he doing Christ the most high has put his holy spirit in you but Satan wants to put his Spirit In You he wants to help dominion over you he wants to set up rulership and Kingdom Life In You [Music] he wants to take the place of God in our lives [Music] now what are we doing with God's gift the Holy Spirit what are we doing with God's Gift in our life amen now Satan wants to distort the vision that God has for your life he did it in heaven right he went and he made the angels of heaven conform to his ideal if he made angels fall this guy is a shyster name if he deceived angels then he was kicked out of heaven he goes into Eden and the highest clear form of creation he starts to deceive Eve amen and he distorted the word in Eve he corrupted the seed in Eve and he got done to fall away from the world we are living in another time now where the world has been re-established church we are not at the starting phase this is not the Ephesian Church age amen we are at the end of the latest in church age and at the end of the Legacy in church age God has sent for the prophet of the age to restore the true word back to the people amen we cannot start back and rebuild we are not a justification we are not in Wesley's message we are not at the outpouring of the gift set uh amen the Jews are straight and the Pentecostal Revival amen we've got to understand where we are yes we are the finishing Amen in fact we can see the Finishing Line and we will run with all we have amen Satan wants to distort your vision amen put up the first quote in the power of transformation he says now you see like in your group here this morning you got a program you got a vision the past there's a vision amen The Minister's application amen but look watch for the corrupture amen you'll be Sly as slick as he can be you see but keep your vision amen keep your focus in 2023 keep your focus amen it's just February and some of us have already lost our Focus some of us have already lost our vision some of us have already lost our passion amen amen all the pledges we make to God in January we have forgotten about it because the cares of the life the corrupters come in to distort our vision amen the spirit of God is here this morning to tell you hold true to the vision amen stay the cause amen amen what is he doing amen he says oh keep holding to that keep holding to the vision right you'll say oh but I can't see any progress I can't see any results you know somebody who's got a body like me flat no muscle if I spend time training if I go to the gym and I start lifting up some weights I start changing my diet do you know the next day you're not going to see the results even though I start walking like this everywhere you see these guys one day they go to gym and they start walking like this hey but what happens if you are consistent in it if you go every day and you train and you change your diet you commit yourself suddenly you start to see a transformation start to see those muscle amen you start to see your body start to turn so it's a gradual thing that's why every day we've got to read the word of God and pray amen amen amen it's only one sort of thing it's a daily walk with the Lord Satan wants you to start the vision of God for your life and you know the prophet will tell us that sometimes it got so cold where they were and in the morning his eyes were shut because of the cold tell me if you read that and he says his mother would bring something and put it on the eye now we've got ourselves the word of God maybe every morning Satan wants to put it on our eye make it cold but beat the word take the ice job every morning and say Lord I do not know what awaits me during the course of this day because none of us do know I don't know what Temptation May await me but leave me not into temptation amen but Deliver Me From Evil yes read the word of God to encourage you and inspire you for the day it'll strengthen you amen not only that but being in the kingdom of God we are weapons at our disposal and we must use it in order to protect the world that's in our hearts Amen in order to protect our growth and our future we've got to make wise Investments we've got to protect what's ours Amen in the natural don't you get these financial advisors telling you protect your future protect your family's future invest wisely amen where are they getting the spiritual concept they're getting it from the word of God amen everything that man does on the earth they have taken from the word of God where do you get motivational speakers from they have copied the preaching of the word because it's only the word of God can motivate us and Inspire us yes amen amen where do you get psychologists and counselors from marriage counselors from the Christian faith the first counselors were pastors dealing with marriage problems with mental problems all of these problems they took it and they made careers out of it amen Hallelujah why did they get automated Gates from the Bible when they dropped them in prison and the angel of God came into prison and he opened up the gates automatically somebody admission for them the company from the word of God amen Hallelujah now we must not allow unbelief to lay in our hearts we must allow the Holy Spirit to transform us into His Image completely but I'm saying completely that word at the end is there for a reason because some of us are starting to allow the image to form and then we are stopping the image is not complete yet amen the image is a perfect image and you can reach perfection in Christ you say even in the flesh I can reach Perfection yes you can Satan wants to make you think that you will not attain perfection in his life but our Perfection is not resting Upon Our Own abilities our Perfection is in Christ amen amen the kingdom of God is righteousness didn't we just read that kingdom of God is righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost what is righteousness to be in right standing with God Amen who makes us in right standing because our righteousness is like filthy rags it is the blood of Jesus that covers us from our sins you see the moment we go and we tell ourselves hey I'm a sinner and and all of us have sinned that we all have thoughts and failures we are nullifying the blood of Jesus because when Jesus looks at us he looks at us through the blood and he's asking what sin are you talking about [Music] that is why when we go to the father what do we say father I come to you through the blood of your precious son we have a representation [Music] and the blood of Jesus Christ covers Us from all of our sins amen hallelujah so the kingdom of God is righteousness Satan will come and Whisper you're a failure you'd say you point to your faults and your failures and you know how he does that sometimes he'll make your husband and wife point it out he'll make your children point it out or you'll point it out in the children amen don't let Satan start to whisper to you and don't you speak life into a situation and make it worse amen don't go and aggravate a situation rather encourage a situation to get out of the situation amen amen if you see the husband the wife the son the daughter not conforming rather call them back to the word of God amen Hallelujah instead of fighting and fasting why don't you say let's pray you see the problem is that we don't want to surrender completely to the work of the holy spirit so we'd rather see our husband and our wives and our sons and daughters just carry on living in your life at home because we do not want to contribute fully ourselves that is why you don't call your husband out and tell him but we're supposed to be Christians let's pray over the situation why are we getting water why are we getting faster you can't make ends meet you're looking amen you don't know where you're going to get your legs loaf of bread from why don't you pray amen say Lord you said Lord you own a cattle on a thousand years you said if I seek your kingdom first Lord all of these things will be added unto me yeah now the neighbor is fighting with you you're telling them wait till my husband get home he's going to sort you out but now when the husband gets home the solution should be let's pray about it amen we can change the atmospheres and maybe in the past we haven't handled things correctly but the spirit of God is here to teach us the spirit of God is here to tell us amen how to act but we've got to be sensitive to the spirit's voice amen let's be sensitive to the spirit's voice this morning amen the reason why people still get caught up in impure and perfect things and fail in the daily walk is because they do not want the Holy Spirit to govern and Rule their lives in fact some some uh people are okay with their husbands not being too spiritual because if they know their husband gets spiritual and born again and filled with the Holy Ghost is gonna sort that old family out right amen you know what I'm saying people don't want the Holy Spirit which is the gift to govern their lives people don't want to surrender you know what the surrender is where every word every thought amen every action is healed to the spirit right hold on to the things of the world because this wants you to surrender completely when we surrender completely to the work of the Holy Spirit then the kingdom becomes righteousness to us amen that's why we can't understand the scripture sometimes that the kingdom of God is righteousness because we dwell in unrighteousness but the kingdom of God is righteousness We Stand righteously inside We Stand perfected in his sight amen and we must fight to maintain this righteous perfection in Christ amen daily we must fight to remain righteous in Christ how by not allowing the world to be taken away it's a daily struggle to overcome the flesh man but we can't let our God down and let the enemy in amen sometimes it's just in a moment like Eve and then she brought destruction upon the entire human race sometimes you can be just once why don't you take a little Puff why don't you have a little drink but remember the Holy Ghost came down to the prophet Don't drink don't smoke don't defile your body in any way for when you grow older I have a work for you to do amen we need to get to a point of desperation in our lives I know this is going over so many people's heads right now because they don't want to submit to the Holy Spirit they're saying preacher preacher sermon we want to go home but if you would hear what the spirit is saying to you this morning we must reach a point of desperation where we refuse to walk in places if his presence is not before us amen amen it is present is not before us behind us beside us and inside us we must refuse to walk in those places refuse to walk in places of negativity [Music] who said he was always associated with that person who's always negative just because they're a family member why don't you remove yourself from them walk in faith Muslim you must always remain around the company or people who are always in the flesh and thinking kindly and Earthly minded yeah to be a follower of Christ you must forsake everything we must have a relationship with God and become a friend of God where we can talk to God Amen if we get to points of desperation in our lives we can talk to God amen like a father-son relationship I'm going to give you an example now Abraham talked with the Lord like he was his friend amen the Bible says he was called the friend of God you know Abraham one time he's having a conversation after the Lord and give calling from the land and he said I'll take you to the new land you'll read there in the Bible he has a conversation with God and he says God you've given me all of these things and yet they add to all of this he's one Elisa Damascus servant in my house in conversation with the Lord but God drops down then and he tells him he shall not be your head I'm going to give you a son I mean if you read that in the Bible he's a friend of God he's talking to the Lord there's another time and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah at the descending of the mighty Angel you know the Three Angels come and he says my Lord he starts to have a communication with the Lord and he reaches the point of desperation for the souls that I saw them amen and he starts to bargain with the Lord right now if we are so fearful of the Lord and the Lord don't know our voice if there's no relationship there how can you speak to the Lord in that way there must be relationships amen maybe in the Next Room we can't talk to our fathers fathers can't talk to their sons in the natural but it's not so what our heavenly father or it should not be so without Heavenly Father amen let's learn to Exodus you know how to get to the scriptures Exodus 33 and verse 14 if he doesn't amen you turn in your Bibles I want to show you that Moses also had a relationship with God Exodus 33 and verse 14. he says the Lord is telling Moses now my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest you know isn't that a comforting word from the Lord everybody agreed that the comforting word from the Lord everybody got it Exodus 33 and verse 14. for the Joshua don't bring it into 23 I know what you're doing amen my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest now all of us would have walked away Lord I heard from you you gave me a promise your presence will go before me and you're going to give me rest but Moses talked back to the Lord and you can't talk back to the Lord this way there's no relationship amen you know what he says he's so desperate he says Lord If thy presence go not with me carry us not his amen thank you the Lord is telling you I'm going to take you out of this place and take you to the land of Israel he's saying Lord if your presence is not dead don't even take us there can we get to that point in our life where we are not prepared to go anywhere unless these prophets go before us amen and he said if that presence go not with me carry us not out ends let's get to 23 then number we're speaking on 23 23 you shall see the unveiling of God 23 brings down his presence 23 if you read go Mark Exodus 33 now from verse 14. and the Lord is going to tell him I'm going to appear he says go stand in the cleft of The Rock I'm gonna appear to you that's your homework to read there I just want to get to 23. because 23 is when you shall see the Supernatural and in 23 the Lord tells him he says I'm gonna have my hand before your eyes right and 23 says I will take away my hand and thou shalt see my backpacks but my face shall not be seen up until that point no man had seen God but here's a man who's so desperate for his presence that the Lord is willing to unveil himself to Moses this is the year God's going to take so that you feel him in a more tangible way you seem in a more tangible way or are you hearing the church you will experience the Lord in your life in a more tangible way he's going to take away the veil from of your eyes amen you shall see the Lord thou shall see my backpacks and my face shall not be seen now I want you to know that promise is to Moses but in this day that was before the Holy Ghost came in this day he says if you love me and you keep my words he said we are going to come and make our boat in you no longer will you need to feel your presence just nearby amen but the presence will be in you aim amen [Music] amen now every one of us are feeding off of something in this life the natural man must feed on food every day in fact they say three hours every three hours right I don't know if I see it every three hours not really but that's what they say you must eat every three hours sometimes we may skip a meal and some of us do intermittent fasting where we that if you don't know what intermittent fasting is you don't eat for a period of time in order to bring the flesh into a shape that you desire amen now as an extra man is eating eat nothing every day the spiritual man must eat of something every day whether you like it or not the spirit man is being fed but what is he being fed that's the question he's been something or someone is feeding our spirit who are we allowing to influence our spirit yes that first in the spirit man was put there by God and will either feed of the word and the things of God so that we thrive in his kingdom where we become like the tree planted by the rivers of waters and people can eat of our fruit amen oh we are feeling of things of the world and the spirit man is suffering he's in bondage has malnutrition and we become like a dried up tree when nobody can eat from our food because we have no fruit and all we have to offer the world is doubt and negativity and our lives become a reproach for the kingdom of God so physically the flesh man picks up his Bible and walks to church but everyone is saying look at that hypocrite amen let's get to the next four amen it says here you'll find that in God adding himself in Simplicity it says depends on what kind of a spirit that's in you what you're feeding on your life is feeding on something don't be a vulture eating the dead crackers of the old the carrying of the Earth feed on the Heavenly things the word of God Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God feed upon his word now sometimes you may not always have the ability to read the word but you can listen to good songs when I'm saying good songs that are documental debates amen amen and you can listen to a song that's got the word in it and you can feed your spirit man like that too you can listen to songs you can read the word you can pray the next one he says and I want you to hear this this morning God is here now Christ is in our midst and is willing to give you the Holy Ghost if you're willing to accept it yes what we need to do he says we need to be emptying out for the coming there's got to be a space there there's got to be something a hanger we are trying to persuade and pull this is what we are doing now sometimes as ministers we are guilty of this Church come to church listen what the property is saying we are trying to persuade and pull even some of you come to me why don't you speak to that brother speak to that sister tell them come to church thank you one word to come one week they're not sure the next week you see we are not a denomination [Music] the message is something totally different the message is called a predestinated seeds into the kingdom serving he says we are trying to persuade and pull we ought to be doing that what he say we should not be doing that if a man is hungry for God there's a place empty for him that's all but until there we can smother God into a place you know what he means we're suffocating God into one corner of our heart make email isms and chills and so forth and exchange but it won't work until that man himself wants God you see what I'm saying the man himself must want God so man-made programs are no good get in God's [Music] join Church shake hands formal baptism rituals rosaries nonsense it's a birth and he quotes a scripture blessing a day who would hung up to us for righteousness for they shall be filled you've got to have an empty spot what makes men hunger he says what makes men go out there and do what they do what makes woman God on the street walking in these Immortal clothes what are they trying to do they are trying to satisfy the anger and what do the angle for because they were created to hunger because their hunger how dare any person try to ask that Holy anger that God Made You to hunger for him and try to satisfy to the things of the world you don't have a right to do that right we live in Legacy of people's rights you don't have a right to do that he says dear brother sister if you haven't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost run into the kingdom of God as quick as you can stealing time is on the enemy is coming like a flood he is raising a standard against it the drama he said the church is going home just as certain as anything you haven't got always to wait friend you haven't got all the time to wait you better come now you better make it right today and make it now yeah he goes on to say the kingdom of God is within you therefore Legions and powers and the backing of the only Angels is in you do you see what what value there is in a kingdom what power days in the Kingdom he says you have the allegiance of angels and Powers at your disposal how by the deity of Christ by the baptismal are you reading that look for that amen you'll find it there he says the kingdom of God will be within you therefore the legions and powers and the backing of the Holy Angels is in you this morning by the deity of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we've gone too far amen he says he's pressing trying to get into you hmm the Holy Spirit right now is pressing trying to get into you do you do you hear the holy spirit laboring this morning interesting to get into you he says he's pressing trying to get into you and move into you today and you stand up and wonder and look in gaze and hold back a little while longer don't do that move right straight into the bosom of God the hour is here he is coming one of these days amen he goes on to say the church don't know the authority and he says holy ghost born men don't realize the authority and the authority that God has permitted to the church Christ said I'll give you the keys to the kingdom whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven amen whatever you lose will be loosed I give him Powers over serpents over all kinds of diseases nothing shall harm you he says exercise your faith Let it Loose amen brother you're all over the place this morning you were on the school just now I'm afraid the church don't know he says I give you powers over serpents he says exercise your faith Let it Loose let God have his way God will grant it to you amen stay on this one give me 500 people born of the spirit of God filled with the Holy Ghost and on fire for God I'll do more for the kingdom of God in one year's time then the whole church has done for two thousand years right we can get 500 people here in Phoenix we can get 500 people in Durban but they must be filled with the Holy Ghost and not fight for God he says I'll get them to do more for the kingdom of God in one year and for the last two thousand years what do we learn for that little man has been given to God giving to God God has used that amen pray for the Lord if you get into the heart of that quote what is he saying for two thousand years he's saying if I can get 500 people filled with the Holy Ghost and on fire for God will do more than two thousand years worth of work amen what is he saying because God can only use man as much as man would heal himself amen and now listen to this because the little we have given to God and we should be ashamed of it the little we have been used given to God he has used it powerfully but how much more if we surrender all right the little times we surrendered how much more we surrender daily to him we become his hands to become his feet we become his eyes we become his ears how many of you want to be one of the 500 this morning if you haven't got the Holy Ghost he says you're out of the king not believe the supernatural because you're never being born again and when you're born again you have to believe the supernatural because you're Supernatural yourself amen amen amen did you hear that yeah I'm gonna read it again because I want you to be imprinted in your memory if you haven't got the Holy Ghost you're out of the kingdom of God you can't believe the supernatural because you have never been born again and when you're born again you have to believe the supernatural because you're Supernatural yourself amen God has promised us in this hour to send us a true Prophet with the true word yes amen amen with a message a closing up pay attention I may take one hour to close but I'm closing it's God promised you with energy true Prophet with a true word [Music] put a message that will turn our hearts back to the original word of God and to the Faith of Our Fathers has he done it yes amen and what is it to bring back down the power of the Holy Ghost amongst the people amen why is he turning our hearts back to the Fate to bring back the power amen when the power that will raise up above all these things and take it in that's the quote I'm reading now if you didn't know he says to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost amongst the people but their power that will raise her above these things and take her in at the same time now I want all of you to know if it wasn't for you the message would be no good because the message came for a people yes there's got to be somebody to believe it amen and as long as it's coming from God there's got to be someone to believe it and receive the message for the day when God sends forth something when God sends his gift into the Earth there must be someone there to receive their gift the problem will explain it in one sentence and he says a deep has got to respond to the call of the deep amen amen now we that have been coming to the message of the hour that have heard the message of the hour that have heard the prophet's message God has saved us can you say Amen can you glorify God for saving us amen because sometimes people in the message can't praise God for salvation we become any and I minded amen the basic things like salvation we never thank the Lord for but I want to thank you Lord for saving my soul I want to thank you Lord for making me or give God praise amen for his salvation [Applause] and he has filled us with his holy spirit amen amen now that he's filled us with his holy spirit he said he's come to give us the mind of Christ and you would know what he wants done with his word amen Christ wants to transform us from the Natural Things of this life and he wants to bring us into the perfect will of God by transformation amen you say how is he going to transform Me by his word he's doing it in this hour by his word that's why denominations are rejecting the word because the word is transforming power if they will only receive the word the word will transform them amen so they reject the word because they don't want to be transformed but even if you have casually accepted the word of God you will find some form of transformation in your life but to you have fully embrace the word of God there's no way you are to redeem remain the same but the transforming power of the Holy Ghost has taken that word and brought it back to your remembrance and you are not what you used to be but you have been changed thank you Lord if God transformed the Earth in Genesis 1 which was void would that form and darkness cover the Earth it transformed it from chaos amen and he brought transformed the earth into a beautiful Eden I asked you how did he do it to the power of His spoken word amen [Music] then how is he transforming us now think of us we are like the Earth we were once like the Earth void Darkness cover the face of the deep David will go on to explain it like we were born in sin shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies but from the chaos of Darkness amen that point where we were lost and destined for help from the place God sent forth his word his word is like that light when he said let there be light from there we learned that we would have been lost and
