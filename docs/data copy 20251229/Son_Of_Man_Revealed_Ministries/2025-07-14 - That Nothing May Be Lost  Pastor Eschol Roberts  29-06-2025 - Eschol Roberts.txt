========================================

Amen. Amen. Amen. The Bible says in Revelation 30 11, "And I beheld another beast coming out of the earth, and he had two arms like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exercised all the power of the first beast before him, and cause of the earth, and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven &gt;&gt; on the earth in the sight of men. Amen. God bless you. May be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be found in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Around the revealed word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; And we are living now in a time and season where it's just not the revealed word. We got to take it out of being revealed to manifest it. &gt;&gt; It was revealed for a reason. &gt;&gt; So now for us to manifest it. &gt;&gt; So the scripture I just read, what you're watching now is when you see America flex their muscle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can go into a nation, bomb the nation, go out undetected. &gt;&gt; The world marvels at it. The prophet says this fire that fell here in Revelation 13 was atomic power. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the whole world is wheeling in fear of the United States because of the atomic power that they possess. &gt;&gt; Right now, you're watching that just in this whole week, he was able to start a war and finish a war. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Exercising the power of the first peace. &gt;&gt; In the same week, he signs a peace agreement of a long-standing war between Rwanda and Congo. Able to bring a peace agreement. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then between India and Pakistan also signed a peace agreement. What is this power? Amen. &gt;&gt; But don't be Amen. Alarmed by this kind of power. &gt;&gt; There's another power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A Holy Ghost power. &gt;&gt; Amen. Divine power &gt;&gt; being displayed in the body of Christ right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. That power is no match for our power. &gt;&gt; They can send an atomic bomb our way. Amen. But if it's not time for us to leave, we can cancel that atomic power because brother Brandham says the first born won't fall till this bride is gone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's a greater power within us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As sons and daughters of the most high God. &gt;&gt; So even as you start to see scripture start to be fulfilled, look for your part of this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look for your part of the word. Amen. Because faith, you won't get rapturing faith by somebody else's part of the word. You've got to see your part of the word to get rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. But I'm not preaching this morning. I don't want to get into the preachers territory and anointing this morning. Amen. Praise the Lord. So we're happy. Amen. We have with us our brother Ishko, our pastor Ishko. Amen. Let's welcome him. His dear wife Angel. Amen. Give him a good end. Praise the Lord. Amen. Is here with his sister, Sister Annie. And her daughter. I didn't get the daughter's name. &gt;&gt; You didn't even know her name. &gt;&gt; So, I don't feel so bad. Sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Welcome. Amen. Uh they've always been family friends to us. Amen. Uh if you don't know Pastor Eshko's dad is Pastor Christy Roberts and his mom, Sister Rachel, fellowshipped with us for many years here. Amen. She was a very faithful sister. Sister will love the Lord. Love the preaching of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you if you want to know something, go ask sister Annie and go ask sisterh brother Ishka. Just ask them who was your mother's favorite preacher. They will tell you. Amen. So that's one thing I hold up. My mother used to always say some there's some preacher that she knows that's a favorite preacher. I won't tell you. I'll leave it to guess. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So we really appreciated that you're being in the service. Amen. She was such a tremendous blessing to us. And remember faith doesn't die. &gt;&gt; The apostle Paul told Timothy, "The faith that I see in you, it was in your grandmother. &gt;&gt; It was in your mother. And I see that same faith in you." Wonderful. &gt;&gt; So faith can be transferable. Mothers, you can teach, you can grow up your children in the ways of the Lord that faith is recognizable. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we under a Amen. A great anticipation this morning for the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a few families not here. Brother Kenzo. Amen. His family not here. I see. Amen. Brother Clement and Brother Jared also not here this morning. Amen. We pray, Amen, that you'll continue to pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Continue to pray for one another even as you see the day fast approaching. &gt;&gt; Also make announcement very quickly. So tonight, this afternoon at 4 p.m. there's a combined meeting. &gt;&gt; Amen. Combined meeting for the believers, the pastors have a desire to unite the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when the head is uniting, let not the body and the tail separate. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know sometimes the ley say, "Oh, but the pastors don't want us to fellowship." to know we are creating an opportunity for you to fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it'll be at 400 p.m. at the Derban Girl Secondary School. Amen. That's where we have many of our command meetings. It's not an unfamiliar place. So for at 4 p.m. you come expecting a blessing. &gt;&gt; Now remember the prophet says don't look at the veil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Always look beyond the veil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because you may not like the veil, but that's God's chosen man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet always says, "You may not agree with a man, but you respect the office that he carries." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So we And remember what we've been preaching about now all these weeks. Character building, character training. So now maybe a test is coming. How you going to react to this situation? &gt;&gt; This brother's now preaching and this brother's now. How you going to react to it? Character building. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; God is building us. Why? He wants to unlock within us that divine power. &gt;&gt; Because power without character is satanic. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But power with character is good for to rule. &gt;&gt; You know there was a trait about brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; They asked the children, they asked everyone. They said, "You know what? You couldn't tell brother Brandham's enemies from his friends." &gt;&gt; Cuz he treated everyone with love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we can learn from these things. Amen. So I pray that you will come expecting a blessing. &gt;&gt; Also on Wednesday, we have Pastor Moses. Amen. From Zimbabwe who will be ministering for us here at 7:00 p.m. Amen. So everyone is welcome. You can invite. You're welcome to bring somebody along. And remember, even though you may subject us to preaching to chairs from time to time, these ministers are coming from Zimbabwe not to preach to chairs. &gt;&gt; They're coming to minister to souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. So make it make every effort to come into the house of the Lord &gt;&gt; to hear the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And faith cometh by the hearing of the word of the Lord. If your faith levels are low, you're wondering why you can't make headway or progress in the things of God. You're not exposing yourself to enough of the word. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by the hearing of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So take advantage of every opportunity we get to come into the house of the Lord because one day these opportunities, these privileges will be taken away. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we don't want to be found wanting them. So our pastor Eshkol, amen, is pastoring a church on uh is it Palia Drive. Amen. Praise the Lord. And uh he's a young man. Amen. Only 36 years of age. So I'm a decade older than him. So all the trump card, Amen. as his elder. Praise the Lord. But we've known him for many years. And Amen. has a desire to serve the Lord. Amen. Has a desire for the people of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's laboring in his part. Amen. And so you know when when when we are in a war, &gt;&gt; you got to unite with other generals. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the territory of Phoenix needs to start to feel a united front. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are not a divided body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be divided in your thoughts, but we as ministry are not a divided body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'd rather be on my brother's side than on the devil's side. I don't know if you can agree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Though we are many, we are one body in Christ. &gt;&gt; So when we unite you in Phoenix, demon powers have got to tremble &gt;&gt; because we take control of territories. We take control of atmospheres. We take control of things. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have an expectation this morning. I don't want to take much time, but we give you liberty to share the word of the Lord this morning. Pastor Esco, we thank you for accepting our invitation to come and minister the word of the Lord. Now, as a young man, you know that he's depending on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To operate the gift. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, amen.

We go after the enemy together. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Before you seated, let's turn to two portions of scripture. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; John chapter 6. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse five. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bible says when Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philillip, when shall we buy bread that these may eat? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse six says, "And this he said to prove him." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He already knew what he was going to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. He asked him a question. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Knowing what he already what he's already going to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Many things in the word is put in there to see what you're going to do about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; He says to prove him for himself knew what he would do. Philip answers him, 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little. &gt;&gt; One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said unto him, "There is a lad here which have five bales and two small fishes. But what are they among so many?" &gt;&gt; Maybe he was 10 years younger, brother Adrian. Amen. Verse 10. And Jesus said, "Make the men sit down." Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down in number about 5,000. And Jesus took the loaves. And when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the disciples to them that were set down. And likewise of the fishes as much as they would. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And they were filled. He said unto his disciples, "Gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm taking my text from there, right? &gt;&gt; But just before you see that, go to verse 47 &gt;&gt; because you must see the dispensation change. &gt;&gt; He says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me &gt;&gt; hath everlasting life." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I am that bread of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your fathers did eat mana in the wilderness are dead. Amen. Those that ate even food falling from heaven. It felt like heaven, but they all died. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something different from that bread that they ate in the wilderness and the one that I'm going to give you. Amen. That you shall have everlasting life. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. May the Lord have his blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Certainly glad to minister God's word this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh special greetings to all the elders, the office bearer. Amen. And the first first lady, I don't see her. Yes, it's the grace. Oh, she's at the back. God bless you. First, first then now first. Amen. Many times, sister, I in my own life, I know it after the pastor dies, they forget about the pastor's wife &gt;&gt; and they don't realize all the praying and taking care of at home, the big part that she played. Amen. After he died, they don't respect her anymore. And this morning, I want to give you respect and say, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this morning, I also want to thank my dear friend, Amen, Pastor Adrian. Amen. &gt;&gt; For giving me an opportunity to minister God's word, to have confidence in me to minister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh I want to say that I am glad to be associated with this gallon soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this is not a fake unity. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you here? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't believe in fake unity. &gt;&gt; If I don't like you, I'm going to tell you, but I'm going to say God bless you. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. And uh if you want to speak to me after the service, I will show you our God reveal to me supernaturally who's my true brothers, my true sisters &gt;&gt; via the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no fake unity amongst believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; There's a difference between brotherhood, like I said to you when I was here the last time, there's a difference between brotherhood Amen. And amen being in unity of one faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. You can go fishing. You can have bride. You can have picnic. Amen. All that is brotherhood. That's not what is needed in the message. What we need is true unity by one faith, one baptism, one message, one banner, one doctrine. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can two walk together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. We going to sharpen one another. Amen. We have to come to a place to realize. Amen. We need one another. We can't go into the rapture without one another. Whether you like me or don't like me, I need you and you need me. Is that right? Amen. We can't go into the rapture without perfect love. Amen. We need one another. And when you forget to pray for one another is where we are in a delay. But when you can realize you need one another. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where the cockus is, that's where the eagles gather. Not for gossip, not for debate, and they feed on the body word of the son of man. So I am glad this morning I am at the son of man revealed ministries. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he's revealed, Amen. then you know who your god is. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't worship an idol. You got to worship a one true living God. Amen. You got to know who's that God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Some say, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not gathered for brotherhood. &gt;&gt; We gathered for the unity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we contending. Both of us are contending for the one faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you let me down, Amen. then I'm going to be a little bit Amen. have a little bit more load. But if you can just hold on a little bit. Amen. Hold one another up. Amen. Moses won the battle away. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just give you my title. If I don't finish, it's not a problem. Pastor Adrien, my elder will continue. Amen. Hallelujah. My title of my message this morning is gather up the fragments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Gather up the fragments. &gt;&gt; And I've taken it from my subject, the anointing for rapturing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you watch the order of the service, our God begin to put things into place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. spiritual eyes begin to see spiritual things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. There must be an anointing for faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You can't just stop. Amen. And just faith. Because brother Brandham says, "Amen." That I preach what Paul preached. But I'm going to tell you this. When he begin to tell the church, when he shall come, Amen. He'll descend with a shout. He will descend with a voice. Amen. You will descend with a trump. Amen. Many people could not fully understand. Amen. Hallelujah. It took a end time prophet to tell you what the shout is, to tell you what the trumpet is, to tell you what our voice is. We are enjoying what Paul preached. Amen. It got to take you from fake. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you're going to go with me this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To natural faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe the most important thing to an end time believer is the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yes. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Oh, I can't hear you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believers here this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. The most important thing to you and I is the rapture. Amen. I see so many believers, which is a good thing to get excited about. They get excited about Russia. Amen. Joining Iran, they get so excited. Amen. About the pope, American pope. He get so excited. Amen. How Russia is going to bomb America, which is okay. You can get excited, but I'm going to tell you this morning that is not your promise. &gt;&gt; Your promise is the rapture. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That should do something for you. Amen. I know there's something happening in America. It doesn't affect me too much. It just gets me excited. But when I hear about the rapture, &gt;&gt; there's a change coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's not my promise. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm admonished by the word. Amen. That changes my life for a body change. Amen. Hallelujah. How does an American pop affect your life? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes, &gt;&gt; you're not fighting there. None of you say South Africa is joining the world war. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, most of you will be in the bunkers. All you brothers, Amen. They're not going to help you. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it got to have an impact. &gt;&gt; When we begin to preach the word of God, the revealed word of God to you, it got to do some changing. Amen. From mortal to immortality. Amen. First start with corruption to incorruption. Amen. Amen. Because there will be a body change. Oh my. I believe I'm not going to see Amen. anybody hopping into the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to see one eye going into the rapture. are not going to see one hand going into the rapture. Amen. There's a body change coming whe you have Oh my Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You bypass your inheritance, your theophony. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Watch the last song. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You bypassed it &gt;&gt; to be tempted by sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. But one of these days I'm picking it back up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. By my offering, my word body, what is happening? I'm trying to flip the image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I find so many times in churches, okay, let me start with my church cuz you might get offended. &gt;&gt; When the chorus leader say sing Why only something? &gt;&gt; I asked my church Wednesday because remember it's for worship. &gt;&gt; You know who supposed to sit and watch. &gt;&gt; Is God supposed to be present? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Why is it when we want to worship? Only some worship and the others don't worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to worship. I've seen many times ministers stand on the pulpit. Amen. I know I'm not fighting with anybody, right? But everybody is worshiping but they're standing and looking at the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Where is the worship going? &gt;&gt; Amen. When the leader says worship, you got to worship. When you say sing, you sing. When he say oh my. When I preach it, you got to say amen. What is it? I agree to the word. So let it be. Lord, be unto me thou favor. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to get this touchiness out. Hallelujah. Like all of us. Amen. Sometimes we are down with so many things. But when you get that thing out, you see the freedom come because you say, "Surrender Lord." Amen. I am nothing. I got nothing to offer you. But Lord, help me. Amen. That's a real believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; is that right? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lucifer wanted worship. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But you got to worship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying be like me. I'm a bit radical, right? &gt;&gt; In your own way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Worship God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It might be just a simple subject this morning, but you got to worship God. God is an object of worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say something. Maybe we won't get to that subject this morning, but you can't. If you have never changed since you in the message, I'm sorry to tell you, you're not in the message because I called the church on Wednesday. What is the shout?

It takes the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the fullness of the word has returned. Amen. And he says the fullness of the Holy Ghost is now in the bright. Amen. Is the fragments. Amen. That you're leaving one side. Amen. That because he says there is rapturing faith in the tapes and in the book. Amen. In the Bible, everything is in here.

He wanted to show that man has incap capabilities. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is it right? &gt;&gt; They are unworthy to do what's going to happen next. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And I believe if more ministers can understand to feed the masses, you have an incapability. Amen. And the surrender to the almighty God without the supernatural element is just a little killer. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Brother says that end time bride must meet end time conditions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He asked him where shall we buy bread that those may eat? He tested Philillip.

She just had something that needed to be in place. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know how many times people are failing with this thing that is on the head, &gt;&gt; the revelation of who Jesus Christ is one thing out. Oh my. But this end time bride and then because the Bible tells me at evening time she began to sweep and then she began to look Lord what am I missing Lord? Amen. There's something that is missing. I need to find it. What was it? The res the restoration of the head. &gt;&gt; Amen. John the Baptist and then they cut off his head. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But in 1963, &gt;&gt; I'm going to say to you, the head shepherd has returned to give you all. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What was lost? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Restoring of the edge up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Philip said to Jesus simply, "Lord, if we spend 200 pennies for bread, it won't be enough to even give each a little." &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I believe the test showed that the demand was greater &gt;&gt; than what they could afford. Man's thinking is limited. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll try to put two plus two together, I fail sometimes. &gt;&gt; No, I can say I know what two plus two, right? &gt;&gt; But when you try to fix the word together, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; And you say this thing sounds good. &gt;&gt; Eventually the Lord tell you not good. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I can understand. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That's the difference between ministries. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you try to make things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Let me go else you're going to fight with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Limitation of men. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; At your current condition, can you make the rapture? &gt;&gt; You have some limitations. Or else you'll be raptured. &gt;&gt; That went hard. But &gt;&gt; sometimes Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The truth unveils itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. As Jesus Jesus breaks the bread, he gives it to the disciples. Watch the order. &gt;&gt; Jesus breaks the bread. He gives it to the disciples and the disciples distribute it to the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The disciples never break the bread. Amen. Jesus breaks the bread and he gives it to the disciples and the disciple now goes and distributes it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's exactly how the revelation of the seven seals was made known to us in the end time. It was not no pop that done it. It was not man that revealed it. Brother Brham says, "Amen. It is Christ himself that breaks the seal." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:1, the mighty angel is Christ himself &gt;&gt; handing the book. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; To Revelation 10:7. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you put men's ideas in it, &gt;&gt; confusion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why it's important you're all under one headship of brother a pastor Adrian, don't look for other interpretations. &gt;&gt; If God called you to be a stay, Amen. And God will give him grace to feed you. Amen. You stay by the tapes. and your pastor. When you begin to listen to all types of interpretation, you corrupt everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No man. Why &gt;&gt; brother Shan? Because Amen. When he opened the seal, before he opened the seal, there was nobody worthy in heaven. &gt;&gt; Nobody was worthy on the earth. Nobody was worthy underneath the earth. So the revelation of the seals wasn't anything to do with the condition of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. Amen. Not because of your condition that he brought the opening of the seals. You might have been the on worst person, a rotter in your family. You might have been the lost of them all. But God still chose to open the seals. Amen. Because he needed you to change. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Oh, we bless your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not your condition. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. He needed his word to come to pass. Your He's promised that there will be a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he opened those seals and he gave it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then it moves you from being unworthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't say you unworthy anymore. If you have received this message of the hour, don't tell you unworthy anymore because all the worthy one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wasn't a condition of man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; No sir. It was a condition &gt;&gt; right for him to step down. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Christ himself, nobody was worthy. &gt;&gt; Caleb, nobody was worthy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nobody was worthy. We can go so many directions about this, not being worthy. And you see that mighty angel coming down from Genesis to Revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was not the condition of the man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, the lamb opens the seals &gt;&gt; and send it down to his messenger. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To reveal it to his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was Christ in a prophet doing it. Amen. And the spoken word is the original seed. Amen. It's already broken for us. Amen. Why are we still trying to break it? Amen. Is already broken for us. The problem is we have not eaten all of it. Something is left out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now watch the masses are fed. They followed a solemn command. Gather up the fragments that remain that nothing &gt;&gt; be lost. &gt;&gt; That is for a specific people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word is already revealed but we have a command to gather up the fragments. Amen. Revelation 107 revealed all the mystery. Not some all the mysteries but there is no because there's no new revelation but there is a part for you to play because if you stop at the recipe of Revelation 10:7 &gt;&gt; you don't have the full picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you become a parrot. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not a prophet of the same message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you don't stumble. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You become a messenger to the same message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's a quotation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? But you're not the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you stop at Revelation 10:7, you fail. But you have to take Revelation 7 because he's giving you all that you need of. You don't need anything of yourself, but you need all the word that was presented so that you become the messengers of the same message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let's make it a little bit plain. &gt;&gt; If I tell my wife I want a cake, &gt;&gt; I tell her, she tell me I need oil. I'm stuck now. She has to tell me what it is, right? Oil, flour, eggs, whatever. Whatever. Can see I don't bake cake. And I come back home and I'm expecting cake. If she give me back oil, &gt;&gt; eggs, flour, &gt;&gt; water. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If she gave me a cake, &gt;&gt; no, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything is lying. All the ingredients is lying in the message of the hour. Amen. To produce rapturing faith. Amen. Don't give me back the ingredients. Give me the product. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Powerful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, in the Old Testament, &gt;&gt; wonderful. &gt;&gt; It speaks about people planting grain. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the the person of the Lord of the harvest. Amen. It takes &gt;&gt; the harvest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But he leaves some. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He leaves some for those that are gleaning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He leaves some for them that are gleaning. Amen. Because they will be a root at the end time. Amen. That is gleaning. Oh, everybody that has left out something. They had some of the word, but they left some back that is for you and I. the end time root. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is for those that are gleaning. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't read your books and listen to your tapes. Amen. How are you going to glean? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sunday service and Wednesday service is not good enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't pick up those things &gt;&gt; that are left for you. Oh yes. Help us. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; I got to be preaching to those that are interested about the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Interested about the translation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it meets the conditions, we got to be gleaning for the things that are there for our translation. Amen. You can't be eating milk or drinking milk for 30 years, for 30 years. No sir, no ma'am. Amen. You got to get to the strong meat now. Amen. Because there is rapturing f lying in the tents and in the box. Amen. If we stay with the mer, how you going to grow? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Paul lived, he preached, he died. &gt;&gt; Luther lived, he preached, he died. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Pastor Christy Roberts, he lived, he preached, he died. &gt;&gt; Pastor Ronnie Genan, Amen. He lived, he preached, he died. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But those of us that are left behind, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; shouldn't go the same way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We got to go a little bit further. They've done their job, amen, to bring you thus far. But we got to go a little bit further. Amen. Take that very word that they presented. Let's go a little bit further. Amen. Because there must be a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham preached and he died. &gt;&gt; It's not his time &gt;&gt; to be translated. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But I believe &gt;&gt; we are here. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to be part of them that believe in the translation of this body change. Come on. Amen. We got to believe. Amen. Our very word. You stop believing you bring doubt. And when doubt she separ [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about entering conditions now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The fragments speak to me of a few things. One originality. &gt;&gt; What are left behind is not something new. &gt;&gt; It's from the original bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fragment is a result of the blessed bread. It's the balance of what has been. The revelation of the word would always be the same. But we may have to do some gaining. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The revelation will be further unfolding. And it's the joy of knowing it is the produce of the same hours, &gt;&gt; not a different. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't be in a message and deny the message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't be in a message and deny your prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're the product of the same harvest. Amen. Every preacher that go beyond the pulpit should be the product of the same. You can't be something so special about the &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Prophet sir, &gt;&gt; you're the product. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you want to be eight angels, nine angels yet, but you have to come out of the original. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's see what he says in the first series. &gt;&gt; Brother, do you have a watch? Can I is working? Sorry. Hope you got wrong time. &gt;&gt; It's half an hour slow. &gt;&gt; Half an hour slow. Okay. close. &gt;&gt; Let's see how it goes. I'll bring it to a close. Don't worry. Let's read that first quote from first se I want to show you that I'm not taking it off my own ideas. The first quote uh the first seal he says we have got to step further. We can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly. &gt;&gt; We got to have enough faith to be changed &gt;&gt; in a moment and be swept up out of this earth and we'll find that after a while the Lord willing find where it's written. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We have to go a little bit further. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says we've got to have enough faith to be changed, but what we have now is not good enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Baron says seven thunders are contained in the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why seven tunnels have to be revealed is to give you rapture and faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't lose it. Right. We'll come back to the court. You went before me, right? Don't worry. I want to see if they believe what I am saying first. Right. It's lying there. Amen. It's in those seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says, Amen. is this is not for comparing notes. This is not for argument. This is not for church politics. This is for manifestation. Amen. The word being manifested at the same time is not about taking a life and shooting one another. It's about making the word alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; What did the prophet say? What they had then was not sufficient enough to take them into the rapture. What they had could not produce the rapture. Pentecost could not produce the rapture. The message of the hour must take us a step further. Everything that is needed for the rapture is contained in the books and the text. But you have to gather the fragments, &gt;&gt; the nuggets. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't stop the recipes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you'll have a flock cake. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why don't you think you are greater than the word? &gt;&gt; Sorry for using this term many flop cakes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In the message. &gt;&gt; Why you stopped the recipe? &gt;&gt; You think you know it all. You somebody greater. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got more ministers than followers. But it's not about it. When we walking into the rapture is not greeds, &gt;&gt; pastor in the front. That one is No, we walking together. &gt;&gt; God has just called men of God to preach the gospel to get you right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Get you in the condition for the rapture. Amen. We all have to be living the word. Whether the pastor preach or don't preach, he also have to live what he's preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you take the book &gt;&gt; from the angel's hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you just leave it in your mouth. It chew and chew and chew and chew and chew and chew. &gt;&gt; Only chewing. &gt;&gt; Sorry for saying that. &gt;&gt; All in the mouth. Chew and chew and chew and chew. Amen. Because it's so nice to talk. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, what a lovely service. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you live, &gt;&gt; you left the word back in the pastor's head. &gt;&gt; But if you make it part of your system, &gt;&gt; man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Then where do you think the power of God is? Where do you see the revelation of the is Christ himself? Where do you see it? &gt;&gt; Where is it now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where you thinking faith should be now? Yes. &gt;&gt; When it's part of the system. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. There was a woman in the Bible that survian woman &gt;&gt; worried about her children child that was sick. &gt;&gt; She said Jesus can you help? He says not even how can I give the children's bread &gt;&gt; to dogs. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he says to her, &gt;&gt; she says to him, even the dogs &gt;&gt; can eat the crumbs. &gt;&gt; The fragments I'm talking about, &gt;&gt; the dogs can eat the fragments. Amen.

Just get the doubt out. &gt;&gt; Everything is lying in the tapes and the books. Just get the doubt out. Brother Brandham says, "Amen. If you can get the people to believe, not even cancer will stand in your way." Cancer is so close to death. If you're still alive, &gt;&gt; if you're still alive, &gt;&gt; that means you still have hope. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Just get the people to believe. Not even &gt;&gt; cancer. &gt;&gt; What's your problem this evening, this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; What is your problem? &gt;&gt; I don't know what is your problem. &gt;&gt; But the word knows your problem. &gt;&gt; He knows where you are lacking. Amen. Just get your doubt out. Amen. And you see God. &gt;&gt; Come on to see now. Amen. Not even cancer will stand in your way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He goes and teaches you about cancer. He says when the cell is bruised, &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; then the cancer gets attached to you. Yes. &gt;&gt; Many people are sitting here this morning that have been bruised. &gt;&gt; Spiritually &gt;&gt; by men, by women, by pastor all so much, &gt;&gt; Satan uses that as an excuse &gt;&gt; to get a hold of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And begins to spread. It begins to spread. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Spiritually, we talking now. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you can get your doubt out of the way this morning, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not even that hurt, Amen. will stand in God's way. There will be a bride that is able to produce this rapturing faith that I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me read one quotation because just bring this together, brother. Let me read the last the second last quote. and we'll all stand after that. He says, "I truly believe before the church can have the rapture, he's got to have rapturing faith." &gt;&gt; We can't even have faith for divine healing, let alone rapturing faith. Got to have a faith that will change and quicken this body. Amen. That's more than just the bread. Amen. Just amen. Healing your body. Amen. He says you don't even have for divine healing, later on rapturing faith. God will have a faith that will change and quicken his body and it will be taken away. I believe there's a church on its road tonight. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I say the same thing to you this morning? There is a church on it way this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A power of the living God that men will speak the word. Yeah. and your flash like lighting and the church is coming out. &gt;&gt; Not a psychologist, not some of this put on make believe, but a real genuine anointed Holy Ghost called out church. Amen. Can the church say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Church on his road down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go a little further. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me get just closer to the last quote. I don't want to leave it like this. It says, "God has a provided way." &gt;&gt; And now we're moving right on into another great age, &gt;&gt; the coming of the rapture of the church. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in this, we're living in the time of the restoration of the gifts. So when people tell you the gifts must not operate in the church, they have the open word, they out. &gt;&gt; It's the restoration of all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Restoration again. It stumbled many of them big fine churches. It sent Nazine backwards. It made fanatics out of a lot of Pentecost. But just the same, God is moving right on bringing in the rapturing faith for his church. That's right. So tonight, watch it. I represent that faith. The faith that was once delivered to the saints in a way of a divine gift. And then I'm going to say this morning, I want to be one that is representing that faith. Can we get more like that and then representing that faith by a divine gift? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you see we got to go fatherise? &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I take it in. &gt;&gt; Take me out of there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get your doubt away, saints. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Let's all sing and we're going to worship the Lord, right? [Music] &gt;&gt; My faith in it will it will take me out from you.

He says, "The first time I prayed, God answered." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was no need for you to come back in the line. &gt;&gt; Then he asked the prophet, "What should I do then?" He says, "Go and praise God." Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't look at your condition this morning, saints. Amen. Just when we leave here, just go praise God. Amen.
