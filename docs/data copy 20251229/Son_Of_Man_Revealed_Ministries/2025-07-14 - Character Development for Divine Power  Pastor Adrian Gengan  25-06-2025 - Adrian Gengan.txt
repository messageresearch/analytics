========================================

Amen. Much better attendance. See, I'm taking note and I'm complimenting the people that have not come last week or the other weeks. But even brother Kenzo, his birthday today. Come on, let's give him a hand. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, bless you, brother Kenzo. Amen. How old are you today, brother? &gt;&gt; 56. &gt;&gt; 56. That's the age the prophet was when he left this life. 56. Amen. Quite a young man, but the prophet always thought he was old. Remember 1960 when he's sitting there on the bed &gt;&gt; and he thinks he's very old. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Kenzo, the Lord bless you. The Lord keep you. Amen. Lots of birthdays this week. Brother Kenny's birthday was yesterday. Kenzo's birthday too. And somebody's birthday is tomorrow. Joseph and somebody else. Amen. Praise the Lord. We all know. Amen. So we pray that the Lord will be with you. Bless you. Amen. And let's turn to the Bible as we read our scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn to second Peter. We were reading that on Sunday. Amen. Brother Josh, can you read that for me? Amen. According to where he's talking about his divine nature and his power, just that one verse there. Praise the Lord. Second Peter chapter 1. Amen. Yes, that's it. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy, had begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith, and to salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time, wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, yay, I in heaviness through manifold temptations, that the trial of your fate, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ, whom having not seen, ye love, in whom Now ye see him not, yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. of ut salvation the prophets have inquired and search diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when he testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You may be seated. God bless you. See if I can get my notes here. Amen. So, we continuing from Sunday. Amen. God bless you with the Luke, Sister Pastel. Amen. Pray you be blessed in the house of the Lord. Amen. So, we were looking at there's no signal, dear brothers. Amen. Remember, we're looking at divine power. How many of you know we were following crowning our ministry as adopted sons? &gt;&gt; Amen. So remember when Jesus went on high, he said, you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you. &gt;&gt; And Jesus was not lying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The question they asked Jesus, when shall you restore the kingdom? &gt;&gt; They wanted a king like David. They wanted a king like Solomon. &gt;&gt; They thought Jesus had come to establish an earthly kingdom. &gt;&gt; But then Jesus switches their mind and say, "Hey, I haven't come here to set up an earthly kingdom. You shall receive power because you were made to be kings and priests on the earth. &gt;&gt; I'm equipping you as the king of the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he's sending back the power, the original spirit that Adam had that was lost in the garden of Eden. He now restores it back to Adam again, which is now the disciples. So, one aspect of divine power is what we are looking at is creative power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't get distracted by the screen. That's just to keep you awake. Amen. Praise the Lord. Creative power. &gt;&gt; It's an aspect of divine power. &gt;&gt; Now, we know there are many kinds of power. Love is a power. &gt;&gt; We were speaking about a character development and how your character now becomes a seed from which you rule. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because love is a character trait. &gt;&gt; Joy is a character trait. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Meekness, patience, temperance is a character trait. And we start to rule from the seat of power. And because we have the character of Christ now that becomes foot to rule. &gt;&gt; That's right, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because character with power is foot to rule. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, we're moving into a time and season now. Amen. Where God has got to get his sons and daughters positionally placed so that he can operate through her. God has not taken us through seven church ages and built us all the way from faith to Amen. the capstone of love for him not to use us completely. &gt;&gt; When I say use us completely, he wants to tabernacle our bodies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before I forget, I want to welcome sister Alicia. Amen. In the back, brother Shan's daughter. Amen. Let's welcome her. Amen. God bless you, sister. Good to see you there in the house of the Lord. Amen. We've been praying for you if you didn't know. Amen. So we'll continue to keep praying for you. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prophet of God says here now, Amen. So we've come through seven church ages, right? He says, "This age started just at the turn of the 20th century." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost. Amen. So I don't know. This one keeps doing its own thing. Praise the Lord. But pay attention to this. He's saying, "We know that there must be of necessity a return of dynamic power." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There must be a return of dynamic power. Now, why send the power? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Remember, we are in the Omega age. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, to know why send the power back in the Omega age, you got to know it was there in the alpha age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. When God said let us make man in our own image. &gt;&gt; The Bible says then God created man in his own image. &gt;&gt; Right? That was Adam had all the attributes of God. He had all the nature of God. &gt;&gt; He had all the qualities, the characteristics of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But the likeness part is which he was going to grow up in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was going to grow from faith all the way to the capstone of love. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Adam possessed within him the power to speak to animals. &gt;&gt; The power to name animals. He had the mind of Christ and he knew what to do with the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So remember now, don't lose this thought. In what state did God create Adam and Eve? In what part of the condescension? It wasn't in spirit form. Brother Brandham says it was in the state where he had condescended from spirit to word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was in the form of Melzdc who is the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he says out of this rich spirit came forth the logos. The logos is the word. &gt;&gt; You can get no higher state of the word or no more mature state of the word than mazdc. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Mazdc is the full state of the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Adam was growing up to be like Melazedc. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To possess creative power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God told Adam multiply and replenish the earth, he was expecting Adam to grow up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I know a lot of you are thinking, "Oh, how can Adam grow? How come Adam grow?" But the Bible says Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature. &gt;&gt; That's right. We can believe that Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature, but we don't want to believe that Adam grew in wisdom and in stature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But this is where the problem came. Eve could not wait. The prophet would tell us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. I think it's in the next one. You probably see it there when it flashes you away. &gt;&gt; Adam's bride could not wait. &gt;&gt; God had told Adam and Eve, "Multiply and replenish the earth." It was an oncoming promise. &gt;&gt; So for Adam to produce his part of the word to multiply his own God's species. &gt;&gt; I say it again. There was one species that has not been reproduced since Genesis. &gt;&gt; And it's only in this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not in the time of Ephesus. It's not in the time of Smyrna. It's not in the time of any other age. It's only in this time that God has got a bride that he can marry and reproduce the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, it's only now that God's specy can be reproduced. And that's why Romans 8 says all creation is waiting for Jesus Christ to reproduce himself so that sons and daughters of God can be back on the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, Adam's bride could not wait, but she mingled the seed illegally. The prophet says she illegally mingled the seed. &gt;&gt; He says we were supposed to believe God's word and alone, but Adam's bride could not wait. &gt;&gt; She went forth first. &gt;&gt; And and he says that's the way the church does. We always want to manufacture something. &gt;&gt; You find people with no gifts want to manufacture gifts. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; People with no gift of prophecy want to manufacture gifts of prophecy. &gt;&gt; People with no gift of healing want to manufacture gifts of healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. We always get in trouble when we move ahead of God's word. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Janice and Jamus look powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true. &gt;&gt; Their sticks also turned to serpents, &gt;&gt; but it was not of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; So, don't go chasing signs. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Jesus warned us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Don't be a generation that seeks after signs." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Got to work it up on the platform. He says, "Amen. She's got to have everything. Manufacture something." Amen. He says it's a phony. This would be Amen. He says if it wasn't a phony, he says the world would be a flame with the power of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The church would be on fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The dead would be raised and all kinds of things would be taking place. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now I ask you, if we are the true church of God, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the dynamic power must be in us. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say it as well that the dynamic power is in the bride. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; But she needs the character to operate the power. &gt;&gt; And she needs the faith to operate the power. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's where now let's be honest with ourselves. How are we advancing the kingdom of God when 24/7 our minds are on the things of the earth? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; We were called not to be, Amen. ordinary people on the earth. We were called to be disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But let's be honest. So the way the pressure of life is, we are so caught up in trying to uh get money to buy food or to provide a a shelter over our heads and clothing for our body that we do not possess the time. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; To advance the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But somebody needs to do it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who will say here am I Lord send me &gt;&gt; now? Now, now watch how God works. God always multiplies what we give him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Luke 6:38, "Give it shall come back to you. &gt;&gt; Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we can't be saying, "Lord, Lord, if you only give me the time, Lord, I would go and and and and win the nations through you. &gt;&gt; I would prophesy to nations. But you got 10 minutes and you're prophesying to nobody. &gt;&gt; Lord, if you only give me Lord money, I'll go across the seas for you. But you can't go across the street for him. &gt;&gt; Remember stewardship. What we give to him, he will take it and he will multiply it. &gt;&gt; So if we can say, Lord, honestly, all I have right now is an hour. &gt;&gt; Then give him the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give him the hour and watch what God will do with that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you're struggling in your prayer life and you say, "I can't stay on my knees for an hour." &gt;&gt; Well, why why don't you give him what you can &gt;&gt; If you can only manage 15 minutes now, give him 15 minutes. &gt;&gt; But pray with all sincerity. &gt;&gt; Amen. I ask you again. Amen. Let's reestablish our prayer life with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's reestablish our Bible reading with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's reestablish reading the message book because we say we believe a prophet yet we don't read it. &gt;&gt; We say we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ but we don't read his word. &gt;&gt; We say we we believe in the Lord and our connection with the unsealed realm is prayer but we are so disconnected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we ever get disconnected from internet all hell would break loose. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; We create our own hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we ever get connected where? Amen. We out of signal. You You almost like panic. &gt;&gt; I'm cut off. &gt;&gt; But soon as you get internet, it's mindless conversation. The first thing you do explain to 10 people, oh, I didn't have internet connection. Sorry, I didn't answer your call. We are so concerned being connected with earthly things. But when it comes, we lost our heavenly connection. I haven't prayed in a week. &gt;&gt; I haven't prayed in a month. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God wants you. He's waiting for you to connect with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says if the true power was in the church &gt;&gt; and not manufactured, he says the dead will be raised. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says the church would be on fire for God. &gt;&gt; When we come to church, we should be so prayed up. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be waiting to come to church to now work ourselves up in prayer. &gt;&gt; We should come knowing, being conscious, I'm going to meet with the King of Kings. I'm going to meet with the Lord of Lords. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those of you that are singing, ought to come prepared. Amen. A fire in your song. Amen. To come and minister to the people of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Everything is a gift unto the Lord. The musician should be Amen. prayed up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The musicians even before the service should not be having mindless conversation, idol conversations. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Watch musicians. They are like disappearing uh CIA agents. &gt;&gt; You'll see it more in the big meetings. Yes, small meetings. They'll get caught. They'll know if you they're not in the service. But you watch the big meetings in the conventions in the combines. You know when the the musicians are going see where they are gone. They're not sitting in the service. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They're roaming around outside. &gt;&gt; They're so thirsty. They went to the tuck shop to buy drinks and everything. And they spend the entire service criticizing how the sound was and how this was wrong and how that was wrong. &gt;&gt; Musicians, am I right? &gt;&gt; Hey, come. Do we have honest musicians here? Come. Can the musicians say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's what happened &gt;&gt; now. They were so upset with everything. But they now when the pastor says come after the service and play, they go back and they play now with all kind of dead spirits. &gt;&gt; They didn't hear a single word the pastor preached. All they had was Tropica. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Satan can impersonate any kind of gift that God has got. &gt;&gt; Hey, are you listening? &gt;&gt; Prophecy. &gt;&gt; Satan can impersonate it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But he cannot bring that word. &gt;&gt; So, what some of those people like to prophesy? They got no word. &gt;&gt; They got no depth of the word. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Word to transform the people and what to equip the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; When they prophesy, all they want you to do is look on me. &gt;&gt; Look at how powerful I am. &gt;&gt; Look at how powerful I am. &gt;&gt; But he says they can't bring the word. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, this I'm just reading this to back up what I was saying that Adam was going to grow up into the mature state of the word, which was to be like Melzdc because M Adam possessed the power to speak to winds. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Power to speak to waves. So which means he control the elements. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But when it came to creative power &gt;&gt; to speak like Melzdc, &gt;&gt; that's the image he was growing up into. And that's the thing that Eve could not wait. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So here what see what the prophet calls him. He calls him a spoken seed word of God. &gt;&gt; So you know the seed is not mature. &gt;&gt; Adam was a spoken seed word. &gt;&gt; Seed needs to be planted. Amen. &gt;&gt; Seed needs to now add to your faith virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness. So, Adam was going to grow up. How many of you can see that he was a seed &gt;&gt; word of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was going to come into the likeness of Melzdc. If you don't believe me, go and read Genesis 1:27. When it says, "And God created them in his own image." He leaves out the word likeness. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. Because that was the path that Adam was going to grow up into &gt;&gt; the likeness of God which is now in the end time. Peter describes it from faith all the way to love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he was given a bride to reproduce himself. That's why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Satan came in through the serpent and said, "I'm going to offer you another way. You can either wait for Adam to come to the mature state of the word and speak if you shall have a son and his name shall be called s and Eve was supposed to say be unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What Adam and Eve failed to do the holy the Gabriel spoke to Mary and confirmed that by creative power Mary could conceive. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. So, we find here that the serpent told Eve, we can produce another way. There's another way. You can either wait to produce God's provided way or there's an alternative way you can reproduce the animal way &gt;&gt; because remember God had put them in an animal body. &gt;&gt; So, he was not prepared to wait for the son of God to come to maturity and speak &gt;&gt; creative power. &gt;&gt; Amen. So she chose the animal way. &gt;&gt; She left the guide. Adam was her guide. Adam was her teacher. Adam was her spirit of truth. But she left the guy. She left the teacher. She left the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She fell. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're in the message. I I wish really wish you could have seen these things. Uh, brother Caleb, I think we really need to buy another thing because this unit is it's malfunctioning and anything that's not in his image and likeness is malfunctioning. &gt;&gt; So, if this thing is malfunctioning, let's change it. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's not very nice to be trying to show people quotes and they can't see it. So, in the message marriage and divorce, the prophet is now confirming that the bride was supposed to come from the word by spiritual multiplication. &gt;&gt; Yes. showing that Adam because remember God created what first a spirit man. &gt;&gt; So the type of man that Adam was supposed to reproduce was a spirit man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Everyone understand that point. &gt;&gt; He says we don't need new membership. We need a revival of divine power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And joy in human hearts that transforms them away from the things of the world and makes them new creatures. So the power of the Holy Ghost that he's put into our hearts makes us new creatures. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Old things have passed away. If you're old, all things have become new. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a revival of divine power. &gt;&gt; But you know, sometimes there's power that can remain dormant. &gt;&gt; The prophet calls it untapped resources. &gt;&gt; Why? The cares of life come to choke it. &gt;&gt; The cares of life. Oh, I can't express divine power because I've got to pay t. I've got to pay interwini municipality bill. I've got to pay for my water and lights. suppressing what is laying within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were called to be a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; God is more interested in your spiritual well-being than your natural being. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, Amen. He says it transforms us. Amen. Away from these things. And he says, "We expecting to see God pour out his divine power." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We expecting to see God pour out his divine power. &gt;&gt; Now, how many of you know that if you're not expecting something, you won't even look for it. You won't even appreciate it when it comes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. For example, if there was a crippled person sitting here and you never had an expectation in your house to see the supernatural or the miraculous, &gt;&gt; we prayed for that crippled person and they got healed. &gt;&gt; You know, you'd be enthused for a moment. &gt;&gt; You'll walk out of here unfazed. You might even forget about it in the morning because you were not expecting it. &gt;&gt; We sing that song, I've come expecting Jesus. But we don't really realize that what we are saying is we're coming to meet with him personally. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How many of us ever track our spiritual growth? &gt;&gt; Track our spiritual life. It every one of us young people even have a desire to grow spiritually in the things of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have a desire to grow up in the things of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. How long will we be? Amen. Just babes in Christ. We want God to rock us to sleep every night. &gt;&gt; When are we going to be sons and daughters of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who God can be proud. Amen. And say, "That's my son. &gt;&gt; That's my daughter." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can have confidence in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, why did he give us divine power?" The prophet of God is telling us that he gave us divine power to break the power of Satan over this life. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We've got to be able to break the stronghold of Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And many times we are running to everybody else, but the power is laying within us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many of you know that sometimes you lose your keys? And you're going and you're running to your wife, I lost my keys. Where's my keys? You're going to your children, where's my keys? But the key is in your pocket. Then now they tell you sit down, replace your steps, check everywhere. Then now when you feel the key in your pocket, you feel very stupid. You might, you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; So what am I saying? The power is within you. &gt;&gt; We need to shake off the shackles. &gt;&gt; We need to shake ourselves from unbelief. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith needs to stir up the divine power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and realize that the power is laying within me &gt;&gt; as much as yes maybe my faith levels are low now because there is levels of faith &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke to the woman oh we have little faith so people can have little faith &gt;&gt; and then he says I've never seen such great faith so faith is measurable &gt;&gt; so yes maybe sometimes I need to go to brother Jeff and and just get a boost &gt;&gt; like when my car battery goes low &gt;&gt; I need to borrow jumper cables, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I need to now connect it to his battery. &gt;&gt; And I need to start swinging my car. &gt;&gt; So if you're ever feeling down, don't ever feel down and out. &gt;&gt; Get a power boost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Don't you know the scripture says one of us can put a thousand to flight and two of us can send a legion fleeing. &gt;&gt; Amen. We get supercharged when we come to fellowship. &gt;&gt; We get supercharged. Amen. When we talk to one another and our faith levels are being built up, &gt;&gt; we realize, amen, who we are. We're a son and daughter of God. Amen. I'm not just called, Amen, as an ordinary person on the earth, but I've been called to the highest position on the earth. Right now, I am the most important person on the earth. Amen. I am more important than President Trump. I am more important than Amen. the Pope Leo. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. The major player on the earth right now that God is working with is the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can somebody agree with that? &gt;&gt; People are more excited about Putin. People are excited about the Pope. People are excited about Russia. People are excited about uh this guy Trump. &gt;&gt; But they don't realize the most important player right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that is in the three-fold mystery purpose of God that was locked up in the back part of God's mind that he's been working to achieve through all the ages is you and I &gt;&gt; pull us out of our condition. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to realize who we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there's only one thing the prophet says now in that day you know I am in the father, father in me, I in you, you in me. You all know that scripture. &gt;&gt; What day is that? What what is this intermingling? &gt;&gt; This I'm in the father, &gt;&gt; the father in me, I in you, you in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is this intermingling? &gt;&gt; Sounds to me like marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, come on. &gt;&gt; So the marriage is only in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What is the scripture? Everybody understands the scripture. &gt;&gt; I'm in the father, the father in me. I in you, you in me. &gt;&gt; It's the oneness of the godhead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the oneness of the godhead. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe Jesus is part of the godhead? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe you're the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; How many of you believe the two is one? &gt;&gt; So then where are you really? &gt;&gt; Mhm. If you're in the headstone, you must be part of the Godhead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The three-fold mystery purpose which was locked up in the back part of God's mind. You even came out from the at the cross when they pierced his side and the church was birthed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He released you at the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now in this end time, so he released you just before Pentecost, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He released you just before Pentecost. And on the day of Pentecost, he sent the spirit back to the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; To connect with the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now in the end time, he doesn't just leave you there. He comes back as the male person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the headstone coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's coming now to unite with the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch. He says that that day, he's trying to define what he means by that. That day he says because the same power of God was in Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ. The same power that rested in Jesus Christ rest in the placed sons in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; I want you to chew that and digest it quickly. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it slowly again. The power that was in Jehovah, the power to speak, &gt;&gt; the power to create. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says rested in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Then he says the same power that rested in Jesus Christ rest in placed sons &gt;&gt; in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm digesting it. I'm getting it slowly. You mean in Genesis 1 when God said, "Let there be and there was that power is in me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. But you see, it takes faith to believe that &gt;&gt; or you can't move it. &gt;&gt; Do you know it takes faith to believe that the power is in me right now? &gt;&gt; I can go up to my circumstance, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you know, you got to know how to pray. &gt;&gt; You go to that circumstance. You go to that situation. You go to that demon &gt;&gt; and you say, "All that was in the father, &gt;&gt; that was poured into Jesus &gt;&gt; is now poured into me." &gt;&gt; Demon shouldn't be able to ask you at this time. And Paul we know &gt;&gt; and this we know who are you? &gt;&gt; He's supposed to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know why demons don't even ask that question? We don't even challenge them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We we are very scientific and and professional in this age. &gt;&gt; We know the scriptures too well. &gt;&gt; Yes. So now when there's a demon possessed person there, we say, you know what, I'd rather leave him with the one demon because you know Jesus what he said if I cast that one demon out, I know this fell doesn't want to receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So now I'm going to cast that demon out. They go wandering in dry places and seven worst demons come upon him. &gt;&gt; So I'd rather handle this one demon. Amen. Very scholarly people. &gt;&gt; So we sit in the church with demons. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We sit in the church where the word doesn't have the power to convict you. &gt;&gt; You know like that woman the prophet was giving examples. He says I she was saying I could see my mother's soul fry in hell and it wouldn't even move me. &gt;&gt; We got people sitting in the church still. Ah, preacher. No matter how hard you preach, no matter what you say, I shall not be. I shall not be. &gt;&gt; That's their favorite song. &gt;&gt; Nothing moves them. &gt;&gt; They can see uh signs. They can see the prophet prophesy that the pope will come from the USA. &gt;&gt; Nothing moves them. &gt;&gt; They can see Israel at war. USA engaging in war. Nothing moves them. &gt;&gt; They can see Russia. Now people don't know why the war in Russia. &gt;&gt; If you go and read and you read there, why war in Russia? The war in Russia because the largest population of Jews &gt;&gt; was there in that European countries. &gt;&gt; Right. The word is called aliyah. You go and Google it, you'll see. Since the war in Russia, &gt;&gt; they have had the largest amount of Jews go back to the homeland. That's right. &gt;&gt; They were displaced. &gt;&gt; And if you're wondering why Russia can't make inroads into Ukraine, you got to read Revelation chapter 7. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's got four angels holding back the wings. &gt;&gt; Hold back the winds. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So even Putin is frustrated because he know he's got the military power. &gt;&gt; Putin has the military power. &gt;&gt; Putin is a superpower. Putin Amen. The the prophet prophesies that Russia will be the one that blows up the Vatican, &gt;&gt; will be the one that blows up the USA. So they have the potential, &gt;&gt; but they can't make any headwinds because &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Besides the four angels that are holding back the winds in Revelation chapter 10, there's an angel, mighty angel coming down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And putting his feet on the lamp and his foot on the sea. One foot on the sea, one foot on the land. You got to go to Revelation chapter 13 to see the two piece. One coming out of the land, one coming out of the sea. These powers are being suppressed by the mighty angel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So even though they are moving into gear and into position and into place, they cannot move because angels are suppressing them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And why? For the protection of the bride. &gt;&gt; Because if he allows them to go into the bride is not in position yet. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, get in position. Amen. Now, how much more must we show you sign after signal, &gt;&gt; sign after sign that we are in the end time &gt;&gt; and we showing you the greatest sign right now is to see that you are coming into position. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That suddenly now you are not interested in the things of God. Suddenly your heart is being turned to the things of God. &gt;&gt; Those are signs. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now watch. He says, "Let me say this. If you count me a fanatic from this night on, the very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done. What thing will be done, Brother Brandham? There'll be a power put into the church. &gt;&gt; Watch the way he says it now. He says there'll be a power put into the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now he's coming in. The Holy Spirit will so anoint the people, they'll speak the word. &gt;&gt; And it will create itself right there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for it to flash so you see it. &gt;&gt; They'll speak a word and it'll create itself right there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, which means that part which Adam didn't go up to, &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; you are now getting up to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say again, we are not in the legacy age. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People want to be in the legacy and age under Leosian spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are in the age of adoption. Adoption doesn't happen in the later scene age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adoption happens in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says as she near that headstone should be so much in his image and likeness. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to shake yourself from that legian condition. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know what happens when you believe you're in the legian condition? &gt;&gt; Do you know what where the greatest battle is fought? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's in the mind. Yes. &gt;&gt; So which means you can be staying in amlanga rocks &gt;&gt; but I convince you you are staying in low amlanga. &gt;&gt; So that's the state of mind. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let me not pick on Phoenix. Give me another area. Okay. Let's not pick areas. You're living in a palace. But I got you believing you're living in a squatty camp. So everything will be governed that you believing that your conditions are squatted cam conditions. &gt;&gt; So I'm saying I I'm actually bringing up to speed that we are not in the latest and age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He pulled us out. The shout pulled us out. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What was the eagle story all about? &gt;&gt; The shout came to pull the eagle from the chicken &gt;&gt; from the later age. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Which means you're no longer in Leosia. You're pulled into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I never said there's an in age. &gt;&gt; I said he pulled you out of that seven church age and he took you into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; The dimension of the shout. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It'll you'll speak. It'll create itself right there. Now, the problem is people don't speak. &gt;&gt; That as well. We don't believe we possess the power to speak. Mark 11:23, "If I say to this mountain, be thou moved. &gt;&gt; Don't doubt in my heart, but believe the words that I have said shall come to pass, it shall happen." He says, "We haven't seen powers like this coming to the church. I know it for a fact." Saint then he goes to the Now remember this is the scripture for little gods. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the scripture where Jesus was teaching the disciples how to speak like Adam. Amen. &gt;&gt; He spoke to the tree and the tree withered away. Then they come to him, "How did you do this?" Then he explains to them how sons ought to speak. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a scripture that was unlocked by one man. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; No other man brought the scripture. No denominational prophet. Or Roberts didn't do it. Billy Graham didn't do it. No preacher TL Asborn. None of Fosworth. Nobody operated the scripture. But one man in this age unlocked Mark 11:23 to us. &gt;&gt; He was sitting there in the woods uh wondering about the world. He's sitting there and he says he looked at his Bible. He says, "I always wondered about Mark 11:23." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord is going to teach another Adam now how to speak. &gt;&gt; He says, "Didn't you come here on squirrels?" &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, I did. Now watch your daily situations. Sometimes God is putting us in situations where what we are going for is not there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the things that we are looking for going you you find there's some disruption and it's not normal. We walk away frustrated. &gt;&gt; Are we looking for the God moment in that? &gt;&gt; Then the you know the the Lord tells the prophet, "Well, why don't you speak?" Mhm. &gt;&gt; And that's for the first time an amateur God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Operated the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now watch God in his grace. It wasn't high level on the platform when the third pull &gt;&gt; was opened. &gt;&gt; It was in the It was in a hunting place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was teaching his prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God is going to use you and teach you even in your own home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Maybe your cupboards are dry. You're running out of stuff. You wanted mutton biryani, but there's no mutton. Amen. Do you know there there are cases like that? Because we have luxury. We know if we don't have mutton now, I'll go ask my neighbor for 50 and maybe he'll give me. But do you know that there are places where they have no access? They can't even ask their neighbors, friends, family, or whatever. They've got to trust in God alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they pray that there's enough testimonies. &gt;&gt; They'll pray and they'll see it right there. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God training us, God showing us the power that's within us. This is divine power that came with divine character being came because of the divine nature. Right? He says the placing of the church. Now whenever he says placing of the church that's called adoption right and adoption is only in the headstone. When the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then the critics's mouth will be shut. It'll be for a short time. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Right. So it's going to be for a short time. So remember when something is pouring out in a short time you've got to be able to access it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now remember when time and season comes around it don't last long. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brothers I'm putting you on notice. The things we preached 3 months ago may not be applicable right now &gt;&gt; because that season has passed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But that was molding us and bringing us up to a level. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did we not read that God has new promises for each new year? &gt;&gt; This is the prophet speaking now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says God has promises for each new year. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, I want the promises for this year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But people still want to talk about yesterday. Mhm. &gt;&gt; The way the Holy Spirit was correcting us in the last season is not how he's correcting us now. Don't be stuck in a past season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're going through a season of drought in your finances, some people want to continually be stuck in that. But a season lasts 3 months &gt;&gt; in the natural. How about we go in the spiritual realm and command things around us and say a season ought to last three months alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm a son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say, "Let this season pass." &gt;&gt; Do you know there's something about a season? It makes you do things you don't want to do. &gt;&gt; You see, Brother Kenny don't like jackets. Don't like jerseys. But when it gets extremely cold, the season changes. The season forces him &gt;&gt; to put on a jacket. &gt;&gt; The season will make you do things that you don't ordinarily like to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people like to be warm, but when summer comes around, especially in Durban, it will force you to remove your jacket. &gt;&gt; Remove your scarf. &gt;&gt; You don't see brother Joshua coming in the heat of summer with his scarf and his head and everything. &gt;&gt; What commanded that? The season. &gt;&gt; So God has us in different seasons of our life and different season are commanding us and requiring of us different things in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. What am I saying? We've got to be moving with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I wish I had the quote right now. I was going to show it to you the other day. The prophet of God is saying that people want to be warmed by a painted fire. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. People want to be warm by a painted fire. He says they get into the sedoff trying to warm you up with the testimony from years ago. &gt;&gt; Hello. We are saying is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now we'll tell you about a testimony that happened. Amen. A few years ago, &gt;&gt; maybe even longer than that. &gt;&gt; And we're expecting you to get warm by that. How many of you know what 50 years ago is called? It's called history. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; History is a picture. &gt;&gt; And I can't warm you with history. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can it can it can stir your faith, &gt;&gt; right? But the stirring of your faith must be able to say that I'm feeling cold today and I'm going to take some wood and I'm going to make a fire today. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll say this again. How the Lord has been working with us. I'm not saying currently enough. &gt;&gt; We would normally go to a testimony and say how God worked in times gone by. Right? But we need to if we are really sons and daughters of God, we need to bring it to now. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; So which means the sick shouldn't be amongst us. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; We should be operating. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there be any sick amongst you, call the elders of the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let them anoint you with oil. That's if you can't come to church now. There's a scripture for that. &gt;&gt; You're not able to come to church. So call them to your home. Let them anoint you with oil. &gt;&gt; If you got the faith of the centurion, you can send somebody and say, "Speak the word." &gt;&gt; Somebody is sick at home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Somebody in hospital, go pray for them. We've seen enough testimonies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, yesterday I'll give it. It sounds like such a minute testimony, but I'll just tell you nonetheless. So my brother-in-law went to China or was on his way to China. But you know that Iran blew up the US army base in Qatar or somewhere there. So they closed the airspace, right? So my sister was panicking because they couldn't land in Qatar. They had to redirect the flight and he went to I don't know which country he went to, but they lost connection with him. Right? So this was Monday night. Monday night we were doing home visitation. So, I never saw the message till late at night. So, I messaged her in the morning and I asked her, "Have you heard anything from Joshua?" She says, "And I've got the voice recording and I've got the timeline of it." And I want to show you how precise things can be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She just sent me a voice note to tell me she has not heard from Joshua since. So, my response was to be consoling. &gt;&gt; And I said, "It's okay. You'll contact you shortly. It may have sounded like a consoling word, but in the next minute he messaged her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The very next minute he messaged her. She she sent me another voice message. He just messaged me now. I said, "Go read reread what I just sent you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amenise. &gt;&gt; But we're talking about divine power and &gt;&gt; the power creative word. &gt;&gt; Yes. somebody who's uh lost touch with her husband &gt;&gt; for hours was panicked not knowing what's happening because they're closing hair spaces and I just tell her he'll contact you shortly. &gt;&gt; I didn't know he was going to contact her shortly but something within me said tell her this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And within the next minute he messages her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You carry a power within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. The problem is we are not exposing ourselves to harness that power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know the prophet himself was rebuked. He said, "I let the sick lay." &gt;&gt; The prophet was so concerned about people. You know, there's a quote like that. He says, "But I let the sick lay. I didn't do enough. I always waited for him to push me to do things." &gt;&gt; You know, all of these things, right? He says, now I'm going to close here. The church still has power. &gt;&gt; God never taken his power from the church. Yes. &gt;&gt; But the church don't have faith enough to act upon it. That's all. It's just that simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, just to type here what what what the prophet is saying, there's coming a time in this nation. Now, watch. He's also speaking here this in prophecy when this nation is going to exercise all the power that the beast had before it. And I'm telling you, we are seeing it now. &gt;&gt; We are seeing this nation exercise the power of paple Rome. Right? See, this nation will do that. Revelation 13 explains it. Okay? I want to get past this. I'm going to show you something here. Right? So, he says you'll have to be in the world council of churches. And now on persons like ourselves, we're going to be cut out of all that all together. Amen. It says he's tightening. And when that time comes, the press comes to a place where you're pressed out. And then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes. Watch the third pulled in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, it'll be absolutely to the total loss. It'll be for the bride and for the church. And I say this by the power of the revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen. Everyone in our doctrine, in our baptism, we've come to a place, but there's some key to unlock something here. Now watch he's saying we need a key to unlock the power. &gt;&gt; Don't miss this now. I'm closing. He says we need a key to unlock the power. And watch what he says. Then he goes now once he says we need a key to unlock the power. He says he saw a book on seven seals. Daniel saw the same. And when the thunders utter their voices don't write, but it'll re be revealed in the last days. We're at the time. We're at Kadesh right now. So what are you saying? The thunders will unlock the power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; We need the power. But he's saying the seven thunders will unlock the power. &gt;&gt; Right. Praise the Lord. He says here in paragraph 180, he says, "Wait till them seven thunders utter their voices to that group who really can take the word of God." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we a group that can take the word of God &gt;&gt; and hand it there? &gt;&gt; It'll slice and cut. Now let me tell you something. Slice and cut is not a pretty thing. &gt;&gt; Slice and cut is a time of war. &gt;&gt; You got to be a warrior. &gt;&gt; Slice and cut means you are going to cut and chop. It's not a picnic. &gt;&gt; You're not cutting birthday cake here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're in a war. &gt;&gt; Seven thunders. The sword of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You slice and you cut. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they can close the heavens. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen. &gt;&gt; They can close the heavens. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They can shut this or do that &gt;&gt; whatever they want to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. He'll be slayed by the word that proceeds from his mouth. Now watch how he's saying it. From his mouth. And I don't know if you know there are quotes where the prophet is saying, "God don't have no mouth but your mouth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God don't have no hands but your hands. &gt;&gt; God don't have no feet but your feet. So out of his mouth, out of the mouth of the bride, &gt;&gt; thank you. &gt;&gt; He's coming forth the word. They can call for 100 billion tons of flies if they wanted to. &gt;&gt; Whatever they say is going to happen because it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's his word. He always uses man to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God could have called him flies down there in Egypt, but he said, "Moses, that's your job." Praise the Lord. We know that point. Amen. We're moving now. He says, "The church is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It's his own mouthpiece." Talking about denominations. God is turning on her. He will confound her through the prophet and the bride. &gt;&gt; For the voice of God will be in her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hey, I know some of you like to read that the voice of God is in the prophet. &gt;&gt; But that's passed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you reading this? He will confound her through the prophet and the bride. But then he says, "For the voice will be in her." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what is God calling on us to do now? There must be of necessity the return of dynamic power. And I'm saying the dynamic power is already in us. We need to have the faith to operate the power. We need to have the character to operate the power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then again, it's coming down. I could have said all of that and excited you that you have the power. But if you don't have the consecration, you can never unleash the power. &gt;&gt; Do you know how many hours Jesus spent on the mountain praying? That's right. &gt;&gt; How many hours he spent morning, noon time, evening time &gt;&gt; to come maybe do one miracle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he prayed and he fasted all night &gt;&gt; when he was going to choose his 12 disciples. &gt;&gt; Yes. He comes down from up the mountain and he chooses his wealth. &gt;&gt; We when going for job interview, we tell the whole world to pray for us. You spend more time phoning everyone, hey, pray for me. Pray for me. Pray for me. Pray for me. I'm going for this. You yourself don't end up praying. &gt;&gt; You're sick. You're telling the whole world how sick you are, but you yourself are not praying. &gt;&gt; You're thinking you're sounding spiritual. Pray for me. Pray for me. Pray for me. What happened to your mouth? Amen. Amen. We've got to realize &gt;&gt; that the power of God is tabernacling us. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; I am the anointed one for the hour. &gt;&gt; When I'm saying that now, I mean, you must say that. Don't come quote me and said I said I'm the anointed man for the hour. Right? Which means Caleb is the anointed man. Both Calebs. Amen. Brother Kenny is the anointed man of the hour. Brother Nathaniel, brother Sunonny, brother Willie. Amen. Brother Joshua, brother Jeffford, brother Amen, brother Tyler, Brother Luke, Brother Kenzo. I am the anointed man of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I carry the power of God within me. What kind of power you talking about? Let me show you. You see this power that says, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My prophet who I believe said that power lays in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I really thought it had gone over time, but they hadn't. So, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're on time. &gt;&gt; Enough time to pray now because this is our winners in that prayer meeting. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, after preaching about dynamic power, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There shouldn't be one case here. &gt;&gt; That leaves this place &gt;&gt; without the prayer being answered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember I don't I think it was sister Crystal's testimony the last time when brother Joel came. Remember she sister Christelle came forward for prayer. Amen. And she had a nerve problem in her back. She came prayer line. She says she went home and it was gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There must be of necessity be a return of dynamic power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's brother Joshua sitting here. &gt;&gt; Here's the evidence next to him. She probably got tired of his complaining about the back pain, &gt;&gt; but she knew there was an untapped resource that she could tap into. &gt;&gt; So they were there in the family altar and after they had all dispersed, brother Joshua was still having their pains, &gt;&gt; she comes back to him with and brother Joshua says, if you all know sister Vanessa, she's not very super spiritual. I can say like keep boasting and saying, you know, if you know what I mean. She doesn't portray herself as a super spiritual woman that say the Lord. But he says the countenance on her was different this time when she came and she says you're always complaining about your back. Let me pray for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many wives &gt;&gt; wonderful &gt;&gt; would have the courage to go pray for their husbands. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hey, they can shout at the husband. &gt;&gt; They can complain &gt;&gt; but pray. pray for the husband. So she goes and pray for him and she goes back simple prayer and brother Joshua has never taken another tablet. &gt;&gt; The pain completely left him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's never had a repeated episode. Even now we can testify it's been two years &gt;&gt; 2023, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now it's winter. Did the winter cold affect you? &gt;&gt; No. But that's divine power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see the power. Now, how many years were you suffering with that, brother Joshua? &gt;&gt; Long. Very long. &gt;&gt; Very long. But it took somebody who was said I now will access divine power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We know it was a a year filled with high powered preaching on the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's what stirred the faith of the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we were talking about reestablishing the prayer life in everyone's home. Amen. And we started to see so many miracles and healings and testimonies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One after the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know all know the testimonies that were coming out. &gt;&gt; What am I saying? We can know something and then it can go dormant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Like I'm saying, you got light bill, you got bread to buy, you got this, that, and the other. I'm saying with all of that, let's not forget that we are sons and daughters of God with a kingdom mandate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To advance the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God didn't of the south for nothing. He wants to use you and I in the same time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And whether you like it or not, God is coming now. You remember when he came to uh Sarah in Genesis 18, she was not ready. But whether she was ready or not, it was time and season. When when the angel came to me to Sarah, was she still doubting? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Was she still doubting? &gt;&gt; Did she laugh? &gt;&gt; But time and season. You remember I'm telling you about time and season? The season will bring upon you things and make you do things you never thought you would do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When the boy was returning back to his father, the prodigal, he was going with the mindset of I'll be a servant. But the season had changed. When he got home, his father said, "It's time for adoption." I don't know what you're talking about servant here. &gt;&gt; Time and season has changed, church. Let's stand together. Give God praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Amen. Hallelujah. The power of God is in the church. &gt;&gt; The power of God is within me, within you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. God God can change circumstances. &gt;&gt; Young lady, young man, if you trust God, you'll start to see things happen in your life even now. &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you have even begin to start to witness things, things you never thought would happen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; God can establish you. God can do a work in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Glory be to his name. Amen. What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; What a holy God we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when the power of God is released, &gt;&gt; remember what he says. God will put a power into the church. &gt;&gt; Maybe thinking now, where's the power? Well, you need to pray the power. &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Ghost, the power comes with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and there's nothing wrong with asking for a refilling of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the prophet says the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you don't need to leave this place the same way you came in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to start now to put the word of God in your mouth. &gt;&gt; And I want you to begin to to start to speak things &gt;&gt; because nothing will happen on this earth. Earth is effective by the power of your voice. Yes, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham will go on and he preaches message and he'll tell you how the spoken word is the original seed. &gt;&gt; Nothing else. The spoken word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the revealed word must become the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's just Amen. Let's just sing. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's sing uh welcome Holy Spirit. We do it from E. Praise the Lord. Amen.
