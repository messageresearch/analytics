name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen Our God and our King amen and he's our soon coming King yes amen that's a promise we are waiting for amen hallelujah so we greet everyone in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen let's turn to our Bibles to Genesis Chapter 18 for scripture reading amen amen so we can see things uh happening in the world transpiring according to Bible prophecy amen and there's another prophecy that's also being fulfilled and that's the bride is making herself ready amen each one of us are making ourselves ready we thank God for his grace in our lives amen amen let's read from Genesis 18 and 1. it says and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and low three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground amen what reverence that is amen and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I prayed thee from thy servant the spirit of the Lord just wants me to say this right now amen Abraham had reverence to that angel and he bowed down before that angel people must bow down before the angel that came down in Revelation 10 amen but people have disrespect to the angel amen but we thank God that we have reverence towards death amen when that Mighty Angel descended amen he says let any little water I pray you be fetched and watch your wash your feet and rest yourself under the tree so remember you already have communion with him amen these ordinance has been restored to the church and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore I come to your servant and they said so do as thou I said God won't stop you doing anything for the kingdom amen you may be seated God bless you amen go title this morning we're going to speak the own land of the Bride which is the message of the hour amen our safe place the message of the hour amen so we know that God just to background it a bit God always has a way of getting his people to the place where he wants them positionally amen if you want you in a particular geographical position he will change circumstances and situations to get you to that place amen you remember he asked Abraham to leave his country he was changing his geographical location and going into a land that God would show him Noah was in one geographical location but after the flood God took him to another land amen hallelujah Enoch was living in the land of the Earth but God took him to the heavenlies he changed his occasion amen so God what he does sometimes he changed political conditions he changes the religious conditions the ecclesiastical conditions he changes economic conditions you remember what happened to Naomi and a husband he changed the economic situation so they left the land amen amen so spiritual conditions have also driven people away read that in the latest in churches amen and and when they were down in Egypt God changed the conditions to get them out of a comfortable lifestyle in Egypt they were becoming rulers in Egypt amen they were becoming a great and mighty nation they were building cities for pharaoh but that was not the god ordained purpose your purpose in life is not to work and make your boss rich but your purpose in life is to serve the King of Kings and the Lord of lords amen hallelujah we should never lose focus of that amen so what will God do God will shake up a nation God will bring plague upon plague upon a nation if they refuse to let his people go and if demon powers are holding God's people down God will stop at nothing but he will raise up a standard in this day and in this hour to shake the sinner's Kingdom amen so that these people can go free this morning amen God's not going to let demon powers hold his bride down amen but he whom the son of man is set free he is free indeed this morning amen hallelujah so God is going to change your situation in our lives to bring us to our ought to be conditioned amen amen and we resist God God's gonna bring an even creature shaking in our lives amen hallelujah amen God will shake up Pharaoh's Kingdom God will bring down that that dynasty the family dynasty of pharaoh amen he will kill the succession to the throne and he killed Pharaoh's son right yes that's how God values his people amen Hallelujah and when if God had not sent the mighty angel in Revelation 10 that peace was going to do a walk with us he was going to deceive the old word and we were going to be deceived also yes yes amen oh yeah I did not beat for the coming of that Mighty angel with the open book in his hand to open up the revelation of the word we wouldn't have been able to identify the Beast but we thank God for revelation 10. amen then he came down look at what God did he stopped and nothing to rescue Raya people may think it was a pursuit of Jericho just to conquer the city but there was a predestinated scene in Jericho that day and God checked into motion a plan to rescue rehab and her family God wants to rescue you and your family amen get your loved ones under this covering under the token of the hour amen rehab didn't go about just being haphazard about it but I believe she persuaded a mother and a father of brothers and a sisters and all her loved ones to come into the house that day what did she have in the house she had the Scarlet thread which was a sign of the token amen amen amen a military operation to get through to rehab and rare in the eyes of the world where the woman to be looked down upon but God is rich in his Mercy amen he saw a predestinated seed that must marry a general in the Army because this was going to be the great grandfather of King David all right amen yes amen amen they have a son and his name is Boaz the mighty Redeemer hallelujah amen amen let's go to our first quote hear what the prophet is saying God can only bless Israel when she says in her Homeland she is there now as a nation she's been there for 70 years church and Jesus said when you see this Victory generation begin to put forth its buds amen he said that generation will not pass away until all of these things come to pass and we see it's coming time now when that generation is going to pass away so God must finish the work amen he says and the church is called out she's just waiting for the rapture of the Bride taken out amen ask me a part of their people that's waiting for the Rapture he says next War perfect type of the church today the only place spiritual food is given out hallelujah amen spiritual food cannot be found anywhere else amen amen this is the Church of God Amen by one Spirit we are all baptized into the body of Jesus Christ and spiritual food is given in Jewish season from The Church of Jesus Christ amen you cannot get it sitting at home yes amen stop making excuses amen you cannot get it stay at home but coming to God's provided place of worship the other day the five-point Ministry how is it how are they getting spiritual food through the fivefold ministry thank you amen hallelujah how many of you watch a nice adverts on TV you see a nice steer that bird and the burger there I don't know if you can take that burger and eat it you see a KFC advert with a chicken and the way it's crammed we need 11 spices and your pallets gets awakened you see the Nando's with that sauce said how many of you can grab and take it you can't if you want it where you must go amen yes so I'm typing that with people that are streaming online you're missing the anointing [Music] yes he says perfect type of the church today the only place spiritual food is given out is in the Kingdom of Jesus Christ he goes on to say the spirit lays in the born-again Church of the Living God is only where there's food amen oh Hallelujah amen so we see for 70 years Jews are in the Homeland amen they were scattered by the Four Winds of the earth scattered by the Roman Empire when they rejected the Messiah amen she was driven to Every Nation Under the Earth amen but God has brought you back again how did he do it amen he loose The Sixth Seal sorry the trumpet he loose that sick trumpet amen let's see now that the message of the hour is connected to the Jews coming back to the Homeland amen the property is telling us his account and he says the very hour that Israel was signed in to be a nation it was the very same hour very same day very same month I was at Green's Mill when the angel appeared to me and sent me out on the field with this I want to declare this morning it's the same angel that Abraham met came to our prophet amen he says he met me down on the river that's the Ohio river and told me what would take place we all are learning students of the message we know what he said at the Hawaii River he said as John the Baptist yes amen Quran the first coming your message will forerun the second coming amen amen and he said told me what would take place then commissioned me that was 1933 he says 11 years later which is 1946 now he says the same hour Israel was signed in as a nation it's all connected together amen do you know what he's saying he is typing he's calling please don't pay attention to what's happening in the house amen let's focus What's Happening Here amen he says the same time Israel became a nation the angel of the Lord appeared to him so you see the connection our message is connected to them it's connected to them becoming a nation and they're receiving the Messiah is connected to us going away amen thank you amen they can't do without us yes amen now you know what he's saying maybe the main quote of today the angel of the Lord is on earth now nobody left the Earth the angel of the Lord is on earth now but he didn't come in Revelation 10. the angel of the Lord is on earth now but he's coming to the Jews don't lie say what the prophet is saying okay the angel of the Lord is on earth now what is he doing he's moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord amen amen amen hallelujah when you sing was in Strife the angel of the Lord is fixing things sometimes they cite him and all the other angels and they call it UFOs they wonder what the strange light is but the angel of God is on the move amen he says the angel of the Lord is on earth now he's moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord and it's the same Angels oh yeah it is now here's what he's saying we just went about the angels in Genesis 18. yeah he is trying it he says it's the same angels that heard the sin when they went down to Sodom amen oh Hallelujah those angels are not ace those angels are stood here fixing things like how they fix things in that day what were they doing going to rescue Lots from destruction the same Angel is here fixing things in order to save us from destruction he says the same angel that hurt the sin it's the same angels that went down to Sodom we have come down to see if these things are so what we've heard didn't Jesus say amen as it was in the days of Sodom in Luke 17 30 so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man he says see those angels will be on earth doing the same thing he says but this fella are here than the sign Supernatural sign to Abraham and his Bunch which for sure she let what is he talking about then he's saying that the angel performed the sign with his back turn to the tent he says he's done the same thing to the church elect now here he's got that saved the Lord and Gabriel's instruction to Daniel he says hear me thus saith the Lord God will not deal with his church till she comes back to the Homeland amen what's the Homeland you ask he says the message of the hour come back to the original amen we've let down the bus amen but he says come back to the message of the Hour come back to the pure and adulterated word of God the way the prophet laid it out amen Hallelujah amen where are those rugged Christians amen hallelujah that's able to take the word of God where are the where's the love for the message of the hour like those early days remember when you came into the message how you love to get to church how you love to get to Fellowship how you love to hear the prophet's voice Amen in this day and age when God is raising up a standard Amen Let the standard be the message of the hour play those things again in the homes drive out every demon spirit amen amen what thank you the reason we can't have the victory in the homes reason we can't have the victory in the families is because we've let down the bus anymore we become too relaxed and too lazy amen and that's why amen our children can't even look at us for example than a testimony because we live like Devils every day of the week but on Sunday we sing like angels but it's a life lived before we leave it out there in the public let's leave it out at home yes amen amen amen how many of you can say Amen to that this morning amen if you like the sword of the spirit this morning amen amen to burn out every trust in our life to cut aside every act just Waits The caption of the whole season the camp this morning oh yes amen let's turn to that Revelation here's revelation 9. church we got to be on fire for God Amen because demon powers have let loose upon the Earth amen Supernatural demons if you read the fourth seal he tells you the ride on the horse his name is Jeff and Hell Followed him the prophet when he's named JCPenney store he saw those women and he said it's the same demon powers I saw in Hell so how can we fight it with flesh and blood amen hallelujah Revelation you got it amen Revelation chapter 9 verse 14. amen you know what he's saying now so this is the sixth Angel at the trumpet he's saying loose the Four Angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates you remember a few months ago we showed you how the review of phrases is drying up it was a natural type because when a River dries up you can't hit what's in the river You Can't Hide what's in the river so the natural types of spiritual spiritual you've created us dried up you can't hide the demon powers in there anymore because they've been let loose upon the Earth amen amen let's read he says the four angels will lose we're prepared for an hour a day a month a year to slay a third part of man you say going to happen I say already happened right we'll read the quote now and the number of an army of osmen were two hundred thousand thousand that's 200 million right and I heard the number of them and thus I saw the horses in a vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of Fire and of Jason and brimstone heads of horses as were the heads of lions and out of their mouth issued fire and smoke and broomstone notice those three words the prophet will describe it to you how they unloose their wrath upon the Jews with fire smoke and broom Stone when they gassed him they burnt them amen and they shot them he said by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths for their power is in their mouth and in their tails they have a good Tales to tell you they tell you about their sins he says not a t-a-i-e-l but a t-a-l-e they got A Tale To Tell You for their Tales were like unto serpents and add heads and with them they do hurt that sounds painful right if you have to see the physical demon or physical Beast that the Bible is describing but these are spiritual demons that are already let loose that we have to encounter every day and these are the demon powers we are fighting let's go and see what the prophet breaks it down he says there was a natural horses they breathe fire they had breastplates of Jasper they had tales and the end of the tail looked like a serpent a snake's head on the end of its stinging it was spiritual horses spiritual Devils charges that have been bound in the Euphrates all these years Supernatural Devils yes now he goes to describe it what was it the old Roman empire being revived the persecution of the Jews they have been bound nearly 2 000 years at the river Euphrates couldn't cross to the promise a religious sect that was trying to get to the other side your French as you know came through Eden and they were bounded two hundred thousand thousand Devils of persecution hmm what's always going to tie to us now not just reading what happened in history he's going to bring it down to us and he says notice what happens under that sixth trumpet Supernatural devils then Loose by Stalin Hitler and upon the Jews you say well that isn't Roman it's the same spirit they've done the same things they did to the Christians in the old Pagan Roman days right now watch the natural Israel the spiritual church now as we separate it here hmm right goes on to say 200 000 demons turned loose upon the Jews when they burned them They Crucified them they put bubbles in their veins they killed him till they had no more gas to kill them they shot them till they had no more bullets to shoot them with they done everything they could they cremated their bodies and everything hung on fences children and all innocent people because they were Jews they were down that way but God said he would give each one of them a rope okay look at what these Supernatural Devils did they brought a physical persecution upon six million Jews that's a six million that died but they brought in upon millions of Jews and six million of them succumbed to these Supernatural devils Stalin Hitler Mussolini Hitler amen what will these demons do to you if you are not covered by the blood if you are not under the protection of that Mighty angel you say I'm under the protection of the mighty Angel yes you are amen just read your Bible a little you'll see that angel is standing upon the land amen and upon the sea yes and if you go to Revelation 13 you see the Beast is coming out of the land and the Beast coming out of the sea yes amen so he's suppressing those two powers so you are under Divine protection of the Angel of the Lord amen let's bring it to us now see what the prophet is saying he says we find out that that natural power and the natural tune so that he's talking about the natural Israel right now you tell us the ecclesiastical realm has been open now amen it's been loosed what has he done in cunningness he coming like accessories and what has he done he's bringing the Protestant economical Council of work churches have we seen it yes did we go through it yes amen amen you remember the guy that was instrumental in bringing the Protestants and the Catholics amen he says the spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride look at when this is happening when the shout is going out he's the shout to call the bride it's the same time the ecclesiastical power that let loose he says how loose in the ecclesiastical Church Spirit loosed upon what none upon the denominations upon the bride amen you see how much of Grace we have in this hour yes amen thank you to fight off these Supernatural demons he says notice the loosing of the ecclesiastical Spirit now 20 years later after the war we see the losing of the ecclesiastical spirit under what I know what sealed he says under the seventh seal I know what seal is the mighty Angel loose under the seventh seal so when all hell is turned loose against the children of God you're wondering why you're struggling in life why you're fighting sicknesses and disease you are coming against Supernatural demons yes but God has not left you to fight these battles in the Physical Realm but God has given you the holy spirit amen God has sent his Angel to protect and guide you every step of the way that's why we've got to be under the anointing we've got to stay under the anointing he says under the seventh seal the seventh trumpet to the Jews he says look at the Moon darkening out you remember those six phases of the moon he says what under sea drawn out what was happening he said the son of man was being drove from the church thank you yes what is it joining in with the ecclesiastical Bunch the economical move and with the World Council of churches you have to surrender all you Evangelical teachings and things and Jesus said how can two walk together lest they be agree he says they can't but he says the bride can walk with the word which is Christ amen it must be in agreement not the ecclesiastical system but the word you have to agree with the word to walk with the word amen [Music] the prophet goes on to say that Supernatural Devils unseen to the eye you may be asking the question this morning how come I'm not aware of these 200 million Supernatural demons the prophet says unseen to the eye but he goes on to say but you can see what they're doing yes yes you see why it's important for you to come under the fivefold amen God's spiritual Watchmen in the hour with the spirit of discernment to discern anything amen when they are just reading World they had lines and you find it in every headline they're talking about an economic collapse and a crisis coming upon the world what are they doing it was already revealed in the seals they must crash the economies of the world to bring it to a one money system but the promise to the believer I will keep you in the hour of Temptation amen thank you he will not put his bride through persecution but as you cook this bride a super race say man a Super Woman amen you say I don't feel super well the body is quickly framed oh yeah in the body you have fingers you have toes you have eyes you have ears you have feet right saw a super church and a super race you may say but I don't feel super sometimes you might be a super tall or super ear or a super eye yes yes or super town but you're still quickly framed in the body and collectively we are making up the army that is rising up in this hour a super Church amen yes thank you some of us don't believe it we don't even have the victory this morning to say Amen devil God our Tongue Tied yeah yeah amen something wrong if devil got the Tongue Tied right you're wondering where all is the supernatural Devils working he already turned your tongue say Amen this morning get the Breakthrough get the victory let the demon leave you a bit Amen Let the demon look at you and say what happened to this person now it's like I thought I was possessing this vessel amen now we're almost done see I like to say that then everyone is awake now they're ready for part two Hallelujah let's go the prophet is now describing their own land he says now in the Homeland waiting for the Peace of the trumpets remember natural Israel types spiritual Israel recognizing the atonement did we have our atonement did we recognize our atonement what was it it's in the message he's preaching recognizing your day and its message and then when you recognize the message of the hour you are recognizing the atonement he says and they to wait for the coming to mourn for the rejection of the first time they rejected it they in the Homeland for that everything is positionally placed oh yes I'm going to put the link I'm going to put the link on the group you watch it they release the documentary just from Friday you remember when the spirit revealed to us the real reason for the war in Ukraine they have now documented it and it you can hear it from them now telling you how the Jews are being rushed to the Homeland but you watch how the spirit caught it first amen before it was in the news yes amen amen that's the angel of God fixing things to get the people ready amen so you watch that documentary it's about 20 minutes but it'll show you the history of how they first came into the Homeland and now they are still political Wars driving the Jews to the Homeland amen amen amen something further I must tell you when you're watching it watch they don't just leave you to come to the Homeland they provide you air tickets they provide you Food they'll provide you accommodation God doesn't leave you when you come into the message of the hour to provide you spiritual food amen it provides you a home in the message of the hour and is providing you with a ticket a one-way ticket from this Dimension to the next Dimension give God praise [Applause] he says he has a minister of the Gospel I can't see one thing left but the going of the Bride or be awakened this morning amen and the bride has to be taken away before they can recognize what's happened waiting for the going of the Bride so the prophet of Revelation 11 can call them to the Feast of the trumpet to make them recognize what they have done amen hallelujah thank you Lord can't press that button for that bomb even though every day is threatening to use nuclear war because Revelation says seven says four angels are holding back the winds Windsor was in strife yeah amen he can't touch that button until the bride gets out of here thank you he says God has separated us from all dead religions separated us and opened us to a new land amen what are we preaching the homeland of the Bride the message of the hour he says he's opened us a new land a new message for this day the message of the hour is our homeland that's right find your nourishment in the message of the hour amen find healing in the message of the hour trying to deliver it to the message of the hour amen I want to break down the court for you brother Brandon says God heals through music yes God heals through medicine God eats through food amen he says God has different ways of healing but you know some of us reject God's way of healing because we are thinking healing is a miracle so if God is telling you he heals through music how about we listen to some good holy ghost film music and let him bring healing if our body is sick how about we eat the right types of food and let him heal our bodies with food you see what we are doing we are trusting God for healing but expecting a miracle why don't you ask you for a miracle in the first place say Lord I don't even want the healing through music I don't want the healing through food I don't want the healing through medicine I need a miracle a miracle is instant but healing is a process [Music] but this bunny China is looking too good but it'll take sacrifice do you really want your healing because he's given us wisdom amen yes didn't he give us wisdom you read it in some age he says wisdom was there before the foundation of the world Amen if in fact if you go and read Genesis 1 you'll be very sad because God is telling Adam the herbs is for your meat hey he bypasses all the cattle and the Animals he's looking at this big juicy state and then God says the up shall be your meat and the fruits of the tree amen let's go on so what did he say he opened up a new land denominations know nothing about this land believe me malema know nothing about this land he can't take this land without compensation because he didn't die for this land yeah the Redeemer died for this land amen he opened up the seals Mandela can't give it to you yes the message new message for this day he said what did he do watch how he opened up the land he opened up the Seven Seals of the last message you notice that the Seven Seals which all the mysteries of the seven Church age were sealed with Seven Seals the reformers didn't have time to do it in the days they didn't live long enough but this blessed revelation amen let's say it again yes let's let's embrace it like that this blessed revelation of the seventh seal is open to us in this last days from a prophecy that went out in Arizona what was it go to connect with the Angel's message then he had to go back east he says then we've got the Revelation in the last days for the message of the Lord together is bright together no other age has been promised it's been promised in this age amen Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Saint John 14 12 Joel 2 28 those promises is just exactly like John the Baptist identified himself in the scripture he says the church won't be able to receive it that's their pattern neither will the church receive it today he says they didn't receive it then they won't receive it today but listen what he says but through the elected Hallelujah God is calling to the election calling this morning it says they know it calling The Virtuous bride the word the last day Church the elected Lady of our Lord Jesus Christ were amen amen amen now in closing I want to tell you this when they got to the land and they signed the Declaration in the U.N and they told them Israel is now a nation when they went to the land the land was like a desert who had to walk the land yes they couldn't be lazy Jews now I know it reminds you of someone very close by here another Nation close by they want the land but they don't want to walk the land day thinking as soon as you get the land the rates lights and water everything is paid for they don't understand how it works there'll be pay rates we pay for lights yes we pay for water we pay for everything we pay for them to have 10 children then collect the grants but they think it's free because all they do is get a sassa card and go collect at the end of the month now they have to work the land natural Israel I had to walk the land to receive a natural Harvest how about spiritual Israel now that the land has been opened up to us spiritual Israel must walk the land to get the fruits of the spirit to get the fruit of the land to get a harvest in this time and you know what this bride has not been lazy ever since she received the message of the hour from the pioneering fathers that received the message of the hour they went forth amen under Revelation 10 8 even though they may not have known a brother Joshua they didn't even know they were fulfilling Revelation 10 8 to 11 but they began to prophesy again amen and they began to preach the word of God they were not lazy men you heard Pastor Dan last week how they went out intense amen Hallelujah and now they labored and sacrificed and spread the word that even the message came across our way and we received the message of the hour they labeled so that they could be fruits in the land amen now I want to close with this natural Israel is in their Homeland perfectly positionally waiting for the Messiah what did Brother Branham says they have their own Nation they own money they own six point star flag flies their own land their own Army watch all these points now I'm telling you they are thereby Divine promise of God waiting for the bride to be raptured so that Moses and Elijah can appear to them until through Revelation 11 and the two prophets will unleash that Sixth Seal here's my closing statement now spiritual Israel also is in our homeland the message of the hour in our homeland the Seven Seals have been opened to us spiritual food in due season we also have our own you know they have their own money on flag everything they own we have our own signs our own wonders our own Miracles yes the same Holy Spirit moving amongst us the same manifestation the Jews have a six-point star of David but we have seven stars in the right hand of the son of man who is the son of David amen amen they got an actual six-point star but we have Seven Stars that were revealed to us in the hand of the son of man we have our own currency National Israel has their own currency the bride has their own currency and we say come by without money come by without price amen what can our currency buy we are rich in Mercy amen We Are The Riches of his glory we are they are a physical Nation but we are a holy nation amen we are they have a natural Army but we have an invincible Army a royal priesthood amen and the mighty Angel has come down to open up the access to the Royal Branch we'll leave it there maybe next time we'll go into what the Royal brand really is because in the Expressions amen the mighty Angel

deprive you of living of this land amen sometimes you find these quarters trying to erect you you need to move them up within 24 hours [Music] otherwise it becomes illegal to your victim talking about a natural law right don't allow Satan when you see the enemy coming like a flood the spirit of God raises up the standard [Music] if you don't know what the standard is this morning and you don't know how to raise the standard when you see the spirit working in your home play the tape let them listen to the anointed Seventh-Day Angel message yes let them drive those demons away play it Loud in your house you cannot believe in children living around you playing loud thank you Lord that anointing that's on the tape to write those demon powers you know what type of woman was sick face when we're closing the service I don't understand there was a woman that was waiting for the moving of the spirit of God and she was praying for healing and she said brother Branham I was listening to the tapes
