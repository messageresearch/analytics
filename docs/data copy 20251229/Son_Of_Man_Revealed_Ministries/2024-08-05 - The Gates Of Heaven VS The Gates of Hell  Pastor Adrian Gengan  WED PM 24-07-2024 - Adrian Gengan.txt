Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen let's worship him and give him praise amen and let's go to our Bibles hallelujah amen we speak a little thought amen the Gates of Heaven versus the Gates of Hell amen and I say that the Gates of Heaven is the gates of Revelation yes and the gates of hell is the gates of deception amen amen amen hallelujah Gates of Hell doesn't look like fire and you know like hey he comes by deception so the Gates of Heaven is revelation versing the Gates of Hell which is deception amen let's go to Matthew chapter 16 go to opening verse there Matthew chapter 16 praise the Lord we'll read from verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying who do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou are John the Baptist some Elias and and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets so they were totally out of focus amen if they were looking through a rangefinder they were totally out of focus they couldn't scripturally identify who Jesus was amen amen he said unto them but who say he that I am amen now they are walking with the word Jesus so let's see how they focuses and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ that's the anointed one that's the Messiah the Son of the Living God Amen and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou how many of us can say tonight that amen that he is the Christ the son of the Living God Amen then the next words apply to us blessed are thou Simon B Jonah for flesh and blood and not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven now here Jesus is going to get prophetic and he says I say unto you unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven yes amen and whatsoever thou shallal loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven yes amen amen then charged these disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ amen hallelujah amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so the Gates of Hell amen are under attack hallelujah amen because the Gates of Heaven Revelation has been opened up amen hallelujah yes now we we were reading on Sunday about the the horse rider the foros rider and we know that's the rider that's going forth in Leia and he is riding now with a mixed color o meaning that all of those three powers have United and the prophet says every time there's a there's a mystery opens up it causes a religious disturbance it causes political disturbances I want you to know that the Gates of Heaven has caused political disturbances even now yes yes Hallelujah amen hallelujah when the Gates of Heaven are being preached when Revelation is being preached it's causing religious disturbance you see it shaking up political Realms you see it shaking up demonic Realms such is the word that we have today Hallelujah those four writers that we read as the apocalypse and it's doomsday coming amen not against the church that's a weaker Army than the army of Jesus Christ the army of Jesus Christ is an invincible Army she's a super Church she's a super race amen Satan and his army are no match for this bride of Jesus Christ she is fully equipped to the word she is fully equipped to the mind of Christ am amen now we know that only sons of God can come to maturity in this hour and you don't give the armor of God to Children yes therefore we're reading Ephesians 6 M Ephesians 6 is coming at the end of the Ephesian the book of Ephesian and then he's equipping the one who was predestinated unto adoption in Ephesians 1 amen now come through a journey you must go through Ephesians 4 which is the five form Ministry amen because the five form ministry will bring you to your adoption amen amen therefore he progresses from Ephesians 4 Ephesians 5 then Ephesians 6 when the church is fully mature when the church is ready to be adopted he now takes her and he puts her in a ceremony and he gives her the Garment amen gives the armor Hallelujah so only you don't give armor to children in training one who is under tutors and guides you don't give them armor then hallelujah but armor belongs to a Man armor belongs to a fully matur son and daughter of God Amen who is in the position and who knows how to use the weapons of their Warfare amen God doesn't give his power to Children yes he says unto Sons amen hallelujah amen amen he gave power to become the sons of God Amen power to sons of God Amen Hallelujah that's the gospel of Salvation amen hallelujah praise the Lord God can only give power to his sons who have come into adoption yes amen Hallelujah therefore you'll find a separating line now and we are not saying the ones without power are lost no because there's the gospel of salvation but then there's the gospel of Kingdom with Gospel of the Kingdom with power amen and that is for Sons not children the gospel of Salvation requires that you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ that's fine you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for your salvation but I'm looking for more amen I'm looking to take back everything that was stolen from me you say was it stolen from you it was stolen from me in the Garden of Eden I have condemnation by representation I physically didn't sin in the Garden of Eden but because of representation I am associated with the fall in the beginning amen so the title deed that was taken back the title the holy spirit that was taken away from Adam amen hallelujah I want it back I want it back in its fullness because that's what Redemption means I hope some of you amen get like me and speak with authority and say what I want yes Lord amen we're coming to Father's house we must say what we want father this is what I want I want back my full Authority amen don't be like the prodical son and ask for some portion of the inheritance I want my fullness of my inheritance I want the fullness of my Redemption amen amen amen amen so there's the gospel of salvation and those people won't be lost they'll even go through the tribulation and come out saved we're not saying they are lost we're saying there's a gospel of Salvation that requires believing in the Lord Jesus Christ but we are looking amen for the gospel of the Kingdom amen the gospel of the Kingdom must be preached now yes amen amen the kingdom of God amen hallelujah hallelujah amen didn't come in word of only but it came in power yes and in demonstration yes amen but amen but yet to operate in the kingdom of God you've got to have power and power is not given to Children power is given to Sons to rule in the midst of your enemies power is given to rule in the midst of all circumstances that's a king ruling in Authority amen amen Sons Amen in whose heart is a desire for the kingdom of God amen amen they have no private agenda we've got no private agenda here pursuing the kingdom of God this is not to establish some Ministry this is not to establish some church but this is to take back our god-given ground push the church forward push the church forward amen Lord hallelujah thank you amen hallelujah we're not doing this to be in Ministry amen hallelujah when our assignment here is finished we don't mind sitting there in the Pew and saying Amen to the word of God because we know we advancing the kingdom yes amen we're not doing this for an output show amen even amen your ministry in the church whatever you're doing no matter what you do amen you're not doing it for show but you're doing it for the kingdom amen thank you Lord amen you go to your closet and you're praying for people you're interceding for people nobody is seeing it but the Lord the Lord says what you do in secret I will reward you openly but you're not even looking for that reward openly because because you realize your purpose in the kingdom and what you are called to do yes Lord thank you Father praise the Lord thank you Lord amen people get healed people get saved people get delivered because there are people that are praying I pray we have some praying people here tonight amen I pray we have some people who don't love sleep too much but can wake up and pray amen yes Lord

deception it's one of fine beauty that you'll think it's the Church of God that's right but it's doubt and reasoning and the Bible says if it were possible the elect would be deceived but what he's holding back us from being deceived it's the revelation of the hour it's because we've come under the anointing of Malachi 4:5 and 6 because we've come under the anointing of Revelation 10:7 amen that we have not been deceived amen because this I I tell you it's God's provided way amen yes oh I need more of you to connect with this some of you are ashamed of the message of the hour some of you are

walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh yes praise the Lord some of us want to pick battles in the flesh you dislike this person you dislike that person you got no reason to dislike them you

causing religious disturbance amen yes amen hallelujah amen you know where that because he says if we take it in context now he says the only thing holding back the Rapture is the Readiness of the church so what will happen if the bride is an an accelerated growth process right oh yes then political events must speed up yes religious things must speed up why there's a people getting ready amen praise the Lord yes amen amen you know very interesting I was listening to this today they were interviewing the director of the FBI they're doing this hearing as to what happened do you know they cannot understand they have no evidence hardly anything to go by here was a 20-year-old boy call him a man and his name is Crooks he's got Thomas Matthew you but he's a crook and the head of the secret agent funny enough her name was cheetle so you got a crook and a cheat hey you got a crook and a cheat the head of the FBI doesn't know how this guy came into a highly they got full of Secret Service agents there how he came how he got on the roof and they saying you worked alone you'll find as this thing un covers they won't find the answers they won't find the answers but watch how the spirit of God picked it up and he showed you what the sign is what did Z just say now he said ears amen am Z just said ears amen amen we showed you the scriptural sign on Sunday that is not me being beside myself amen that is posting the church prophetically into what that was why it's a rejection they have totally rejected the message of the hour yes they have totally rejected Christ now amen amen not only when we saying Christ is on the outside meaning that the bride because the the bride and Christ are one yes praise the Lord hallelujah amen so watch in Butler Pennsylvania we told you they took him to the door post and all is driven through the year signifying that he's a slave all the days of his life not just him now he's representing the USA because it happened on July 13th 13 types the USA praise the Lord amen now watch very important now what we're trying to tell you I want to show you something what the prophet is saying now he says God can't save you because he already done it the only thing you have to do is accept it amen so now you see in the Kingdom you've got to understand these principles he already saved you I accept it it's already done I wasn't saved 20 years ago I was saved 1900 years ago but 20 years ago I received it and accepted it if I hadn't the first sin I done God would have wipe me off the face of the Earth cuz he said he would and he has to keep his promise I was healed 1900 years ago amen but I've got to accept it yes now watch watch what he's saying now the only thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 years old because a spirit h hung over me a devil saying wait a little longer what is stopping Destiny a spirit hanging over you that's the reason you wasn't saved when you become the age of accountability I'm challenging every one of you the reason you haven't progressed to your adoption is because there's a spirit hanging you you think Spirits want you to reach adoption no so they're going to do everything to stop you they're going to stop you from coming to church you're going to think a how come every week you can't come to church yeah it can't be every every service every this every second service every third there's a spirit hanging over you sons of God daughters love they can't wait for the door to be open yes that's a quote from the prophet praise the Lord there's a spirit hanging over you a spirit you got in a crowd and that overed over you and kept hanging over you you wanted to do right there's not a man here that's got his right mind but what wants to do right but there's something won't let you do right that's the devil Christ paid your healing and salvation now here he is you get ready he commissioned his church to cast them Devils out amen now you know why you don't want to come to church because that Spirit that's hanging over you don't want to be cast out there you are in my name they shall cast out Devils Amen in fact sometimes it seems that as we are breaking through the atmosphere as we are progressing the Heavenly realm demon Spirits are cast out out here yes amen they go out but they come back with seven worst demons that's why the next service is so tough amen you ain't going to heal nobody because you're going but you're going to cast The Devil away from them so they can accept the healing that's already done amen you see what you're doing that's why I say Amen demon Spirits have attached themselves to your body illegally attach them El to people's body illegally so as sons of God we go to bind that spirit and cast that Spirit out so that the people can receive the healing that was paid for 2,000 years ago thank you Jesus but we've got to know our Authority yeah right preachers stood on the platform and preached the gospel devil scatter the man come to the altar under conviction say I want to be saved he never saved the man he cast out the devil that's right and the man got saved oh watch HH the prophet is taking us into another realm now showing us the prophetic eye showing us Revelation open the boys's eyes are we seeing amen our eyes becoming open through the prophetic realm now amen hallelujah so we don't save the man we cast The Devil out yes you see why preaching is so important Amen to the foolishness of preaching amen amen we are casting demon Spirits out so they can now hear the word of godj Amen they can come and be accept accept his salvation the same thing by Divine Healing you sick people here this morning believe that and have been born again and are Sons and Daughters of God Christ already healed you the only thing keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you that won't let won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promise that he's done it amen yes amen they came to the prophet Elisha this is 2 Kings 6 now they came to him for assistance to see in the prophetic realm whether they were going to go and Conquer this territory but because there was a spirit hanging over the prophet he says Elisha says as the Lord of host liveth before whom I stand surely we not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king I would not look toward thee nor see thee Spirit hanging over him but now bring me a Minstrel and it come to pass when the minstral played that the hand of the Lord came upon Him amen you see how we can come to church with bad attitudes with wrong attitudes wrong atmosphere wrong motives and we say the preacher was preaching he didn't speak anything for me yes there's a Spirit hanging over you amen now the prophet will go into this we just want to read one quote in make the valley full of ditches he says then when the prophet got all sted up so he got angry and they said bring me and said bring me a minstral when the minstral began to play the hand of the Lord came upon the prophet and if music brought the power of God then it will bring the power of God now amen yes amen that's just exactly God's still the same God you might not be the prophet but you could be the minstral or you can be part of it anyhow to bring the power of God Amen you may not be the preacher but youve got a part to play that can bring the power of God in his service amen amen maybe you're praying Saturday night maybe you're praying amen the night before on a Wednesday amen that you're praying but you are bringing the power of God to the service amen right praise the Lord amen what happened when Daniel got to pray and he was pondering the scriptures there was a spirit hanging around there that was preventing him from receiving his answer yes there was a spirit hanging around there Angelic beings had to interfere yes amen God had sent Gabriel to go and give an answer to the Prophet Daniel but there was Spirits hanging around demonic warfare that was preventing the answer from coming you've been praying for so long the Bible says the day that Daniel Prayed God dispatched the angel the same time but the answer didn't come until 21 days later what happened if Daniel got a attitude about it and he said Lord how long must I pray you I'm your son how long I must wait for this answer amen he didn't know what was going on in the Supernatural world in the spiritual world in the principalities and powers and rulers of Darkness there was a spirit there that was preventing the word of God hallelujah you see week after week some may be saying the pastor is repeating so many of these things why some are not getting getting it there's a spirit blocking it amen amen there's a spirit blocking it so we've got to engage Warfare amen praise the Lord so Angelic beings they had to call Michael the warrior angel Amen to get rid of that spirit so that Gabriel can come to the word to and bring a word to Daniel do you know the prophet couldn't pray for a baby because there was a spirit hanging over him yes amen he spoke a lie the spirit was hanging over him and he could not pray he had to go and confess that lie to the tax

us to make us let's go further we don't want to cross the line of full surrender we love the idea of being in the Shak Glory but we've got no hidden [Music] life the secret is the hidden life because what you do in secret God will reward you openly the reason we can't see the glory of God in the church is because there's no secret life we like the idea of being in the message we like the idea that we have of the full revelation of the word but there is no secret life praise the Lord something is preventing you from coming into your inheritance there's a spirit hanging over you stopping you from doing what God called you to do in this hour you want to surrender to God but something is hanging over you you're getting convicted in the service you're saying Lord I'll surrender to you but
