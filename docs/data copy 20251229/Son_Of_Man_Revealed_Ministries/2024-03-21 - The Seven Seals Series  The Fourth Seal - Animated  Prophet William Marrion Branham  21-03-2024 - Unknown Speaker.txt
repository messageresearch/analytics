========================================

and U now we're going to try tonight by the grace of God to take this fourth seal and um see what the holy spirit will have to say to us in it now I'm going to read the uh Revelations the 6th chapter and beginning with the seventh verse seventh and eth is always two verses the first is the announcement and the second verse is what he saw and when when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fource fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that set on him that set was was death and Hell Followed him and power was given unto them over the four parts of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with beast of the earth and um the fourth Beast the living creature Like an Eagle said to John come see what the fourth mystery of the uh Plan of Redemption has been hid in this book and he said come and see the fourth mystery of the book of redemption that's been hidden in this book come see and John went to see and he saw a Pale Horse and again the same riter upon this Pale Horse now he has a name called Death now notice none of the other Rider none of the other horses or no time that this rider ever wrote they didn't have that man had no name but now he is called death it's not mentioned he's revealed now what he is is death but now when it comes forth the eagle age that's the one that God always Likens His prophets the Eagles he calls himself an eagle the eagle goes so high he ain't nothing else can touch him amen not only is he up there but he's built for that position when he gets up there he can see where he's at 68 million in Protestants as we talk from from Smuckers uh uh glorious reform the of the mology of Rome last night we find that up to the 1500 Mark I believe it was or 18 I don't remember exactly now but it was 68 million put to death to protest the first Roman Church oh no wonder he could impersonate himself but in the personified uh name of and called Death you sure was now God only knows how many he caused to spiritually die by his anti-bible word teaching this is the one he put 68 million to the sword and kill and probably literally billions died spiritually on his false teaching no what you can think the name of death the fourth stage of his ministry is's called the beast and in this fourth horse if you'll notice all the first one was white and then the next one was red and the next one was black and the fourth one all of these other three was representing it because pale is red and and uh White and is so mixed together see it it is all mixed in this one horse now I want you to notice the four of them notice the off Mark of four of the spiritual mathematics God is threes this is four he's in four here first Antichrist white second false prophet red third viker of heavens and earth and and purgatory black forth the Beast Pale Horse Satan being kicked out of heaven you want to read that Revelations 12 and 13 Satan being kicked out of heaven then in Revelations 1318 he is Incarnate in the person of the Beast he's first the Antichrist yes just the teaching called Nicolia then he becomes from that to a false prophet if he an antichrist Antichrist is against anything that's against God's word is against God because a word is God and then when he come to crowning time then he become the false prophet of his Antichrist teaching get it then he gets a sword because he unites his powers together then he don't have to ask nobody he's governor of state he's governor of Heaven receives a Triple Crown makes himself an idea called we find it put it on down through the Bible count his numeral numbers and everything else here is playing right back here in number four not number three number four see now let's turn Revelations 12 let's just read this just a little bit because we we'll have time to do it and um let's read uh Revelations the the 12th chapter and the 13th verse and when the dragon saw and he was cast out into the Earth he persecuted the woman with which brought forth The Man Child now I see he was cast out of the earth and becomes incarnate as the Antichrist Spirit become incarnate into a man that man changes from one thing to another from an antichrist Spirit to a false prophet and then the Beast comes into him how we find out here that this Satan after being kicked out of heaven incarnates himself in the Beast and now he is a beast and Antichrist false prophet now beast and given the name of death and Hell follows him amen fully Satan on his throne oh my on the earth is Satan representative on the earth that he now is head of the kingdoms of the world the very same kingdoms that he offered to the Lord Jesus and Matthew 4 Satan now becomes a full King all right notice now he be given a heart of a beast at that time and Satan will incar himself because when the church goes up Satan's cast down it's done man all these accusing is done see as long look as long as the intercessor is still on the throne Satan can stand there and accuse because he is the attorney of the other side he is the opponent of Christ but when our Lord appears here on Earth he will be riding on a Snow White Horse and he'll be completely fully the emmanu the word of God incarnate in a man how much different there is in that's the difference of it notice the Antichrist is on a pale horse mixed colors of horse is a beast that represents a power his power is all mixed up why it's politics it's um it's National Powers it's uh religious Powers it's demon powers it's all kinds of powers mixed together a mixed Pale Horse was he's got all kinds of powers but when Jesus comes it's on a one solid color horse the word amen amen hallelujah fourth stage of the riter watch the fourth stage of this writer is called death death means Eternal separation from God Amen that's what death means to be Eternal separated from God separation from God is death Eternal death and this fella is called death so keep away from me amen there you are friend here's the four seal open and the Riders of the four horses is revealed to the best of my knowledge now this is all that took place on Earth next seal we see is in heaven where souls are under the altar
