people a lot of things that are needful tonight in the name of jesus christ we ask these mercies with much thanksgiving amen and amen amen greetings to you brothers and sisters in the wonderful name of our lord and our savior jesus christ and while we're standing we're going to turn to the book of genesis chapter 28. genesis chapter 38. and congratulations to him and his family on the birth of the little girl baby and also the blessing to the home and of the church genesis 38 from verse 1 and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his brother and turned into a certain abdullah might whose name was haira and judah saw their daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shua and he took her and went into her and she conceived and bear his son and called his name up and she conceived again and bear's son and she called his name onan and she yet again conceived and bear son and called his name sheila and he was at shahzeb when she bare him and judah took a wife for his first born whose name was tamar and uh judah's firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord him and judah said unto on go in unto thy brother's wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother and ona knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brother's wife that he spoke on the ground they said he should give seed to his brother and the thing which he did displease the lord wherefore he slew him also then said judah to tamara his daughter-in-law remained a widow at thy father's house to shella my son be groaned for he said lest periventure he died also as his brother did and tamar went and drove in her father's house verse 12 in the process of time the daughter of shua judah's wife died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepsheaders to timnah he and his friend hira the abdullah might it was told tamar saying behold thy father-in-law uh go up to timnah to share his sheep and she put her widow's garments off from her and covered her with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to timnet but she saw that sheila was grown and she was not given unto him and unto him to wife and she was not given unto him to wife and when judah saw her he taught her to be and harlow because she had covered her face and he turned unto her by the way and said go to i pray here let me come in unto thee for he knew not what she knew not what not that she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will thou give me the dharma is coming out to me and he said i will send you a kid from the flock and she said well thou give me a pledge till thou send it he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy this is her request and thy segment they bracelet their stuff that is in thy hand and he gave it to her he gave it to her and it came and he came in and she conceived by him and she arose and went away and laid by her veil from her and put on the garments of a widowhood and then we want to just quickly look at deuteronomy chapter 25. verse 6. or verse 5 from verse 5 it says if brothers dwell together and one of them die and have no child the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger a husband's brother shall go in unto her and take her to him to wife and perform the duty of her husband's brother unto her and it shall be that the firstborn which she buried shall succeed in the name of his brother which is the dead that his name may not be put out of israel if the man like not to take his brother's wife and let his brother's wife go up and then let his brother's wife go up to the gate and to the elders and say my husband's brother refused to raise up unto his brother a name in israel he will not perform the duty of my husband's father then the elders of his city shall call him and speak unto him and if he stand to it and say i like not to take her then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders and loose issues some of his foot and spit in his face and shall answer and say so shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house and his name shall be called in israel the house of him that had issue loose lord bless the reading of his word you can take a seat uh just for a title for our sermon uh we're gonna tell these tokens of tokens of her virtue and um just happy to see um our precious uh brother tonight and uh the rest of the church and um so tonight the title is a tokens of a virtue and this woman tamayo is a uh is a virtuous woman in the bible amen and judah her father-in-law said she is more righteous than even what i am those were his words and judah we know he types christ and tama types the bride and the question is how can the bride be more righteous than he is and see um but it was not her righteousness alone because her she held the tokens in her hand and the tokens that she held in her hand belonged to him the stop the bracelets and the sickness so in other words it was not her righteousness alone that she was speaking about amen and um the things that she had in her hand was uh his identifications and in other words like blah blah says the two parts of the word are becoming one in this last day she attacks the bride and so when we speak about the story and we speak about her act of righteousness you will learn that um you learn to understand that the law in the old testament was that if a man had died without having any children then his younger brother could marry uh could marry his wife in order to raise up seed in his brother's name means that he was to raise up seed in the name of the dead to keep his name alive in israel and so if you look back at the old testament you find out here that there was a um there was a young man called abel and abel was killed in eden abel died and the bible records no children uh to able he uh if you look at the genealogy of adam you find uh abel is not there because abel had no children yeah so uh yeah evil had no children but the scripture says yeah that the blood of abel was crying out from the ground amen and we know like says the life life is in the blood amen and the prophet says that life is the spirit the holy spirit in the blood of jesus christ means that the the spirit in the blood so in other words the spirit of abel was crying out from the ground and then the bible says here that set was raised in the state of abel in other words uh seth was raised to replace abel to take abel's place in other words so seth took the place of abel and set once to complete the work that abel had started set was to raise seed after abel in other words and abel we know he typed jesus christ he typed christ the lamb that was to be slain the lamb that was going to die but set type the resurrection brother said amen the one that raised up titling the holy ghost and abel typed jesus christ the lamb that was going to be crucified and dying amen and so yeah seth was raised up to take the place of abel said times the holy ghost we said abel we said had no seed but set had seen amen and we know jesus in his earthly body because abel types jesus jesus in his earthly body that he had come in he had no seed he had no children and he died having no children having no seed but we know that when they pierced him at calvary but the man says he says the blood cell burst at calvary and the light that was in the blood cell which is the spirit that spirit came out of that blood cell and came down on the pentecost into the believers amen and what did the holy ghost do on the day of pentecost the holy ghost brought forth seeds amen the only ghost manifested sons and daughters unto god so in other words you see jesus abel being a type of jesus died having no seed but set being a type of the holy ghost he brings forth seed and jesus promised before his death he says he says uh he says um that uh the comforter will come after me and when the comforter comes he will bring to your remembrance all the things that i have told you and he will come in my name yes amen means that the holy ghost which type said was to bring children in the name of jesus christ meaning the name of one that died not bringing forth sin it's a tight brother and sisters and we know here that paul uh met the poor of fire on his way to damascus and when paul was struck by that light paul asked the question who art thou lord yes and the answer the lord gave me says i am jesus that doubt persecutors and the man said it was the pillar of fire that struck down paul and the pearl of fire said my name is jesus i am jesus and we know like the lamb says the same power of fire dividing himself in the upper room amongst those believers and when they had seen them there were leaks of fires upon them so burma said the same pearl of fire divided himself in the apparent means it was jesus himself like he said the prophets i am jesus jesus divided himself amongst the believers in other words the holy ghost is raising up children in the name of jesus amen amen and that's why when you read the bible you see peter on the day of pentecost he had the revelation of that name amen amen and uh remember we uh said the law was that if a man would not uh not raise seed in his brother's name then he was to be taken to the high priest or the elders and they would take yeshua off and they would spit on him and so when you look at the old testament brothers and sisters god himself was husband to israel the bible says he called himself husband to israel but israel did not manifest children to the promise of god's word they rejected god in the old testament they rejected his word and they did not manifest that promised word meaning they did not bring forth seed and uh if you read the old testament they kept going into idolatry and fought back and forth back and forth and so they were not able to bring forth seed but god had changed his form god changed his tent god became kinsmen god come in the form of jesus christ in order to recede in his own name amen in other words the reason that jesus had come was so that now he could raise seed in god's name and jesus said i come in my father's name amen amen amen means that the name that he was carrying was his father's name yes but his father in the old testament could not bring forth seed with israel so he had to come in the form of jesus christ to bring forth that seed yes but we finally when he had come to israel they had taken jesus to the high priest to the elders and what did they do they spit on his face they took up his clothes they took off his shoes nakedly hung on the cross amen means they they had rejected it wasn't jesus that had rejected bringing forth sin in the name of his father but they had rejected jesus and they went and took off his shoe they spat on his face and they said he did not bring forth seed but it was not him it was them amen they killed him and then we know the gospel turned to the gentiles and then his spirit came down and they are pentecost to raise up children unto his name and so you see this this law being fulfilled in time you can read the book of uh the story of ruth and boaz you'll see this law being fulfilled also there now in the story of tama we find out here that she was married to the eldest son of judah and his name was uh and tama is a gentile woman and she is brought into the jewish tribe of judah by marriage yes she is the first woman to be mentioned in the genealogy of jesus and the bible mentions uh and says that it was evil in his ways and god killed him because of his evil ways now for a type tonight brothers and sisters uh types the sadistic church age means that he come out from roman catholicism under the teaching where the pope was the intercessor for man he was sitting in the place of god in the place of the son of man and uh but luda with the revelation that he had received that there was only one mediator between man and god and that was not the pope but the man jesus christ and when uh luther began to read romans chapter 1 verse 17 and then the revelation struck his heart and he said the just shall live by faith means faith in jesus and his finished work at calvary means that uh luther it come out of the system of catholicism and he come and received the name of jesus amen that's right but we know like behind said instead of bringing forth seed in the name of jesus the true word instead of raising children in the name of jesus in a sadistic church age the church there denominated amen in other words like brother says is once they denominated they died yes so ah so so the suggestion churchill uh type of the sadistic church age dies not bringing forth seed in the name of jesus then judah we know was given to uh judah giving tamar to onan to raise seed in the name of his brother in the in the name of jesus and shish and and and should have brought for children but onan refused to do that the scripture says he spoke the seed means it wasted the word that they had received because after john was after john wesley and he began to preach certification the philadelphia church age denominated also amen another word that that age never raised children um children in the name of jesus christ the true word but they had their own name which is methodist yes lutherans had lutherans amen and they denominated and just like onan the philadelphia church died when they denominated that's true amen amen calls those names blasphemous names then judah promised tama he says that when my youngest son grows up he said i'll give him to you that by him you could receive in the name of the eldest son but we find out in the story that judah did not do that yes and the youngest sagnya is the type of the pentecostal church and so the bible says when the son had grown up and he was at the age to have children he was not given to tama and tamar realized that she was forgotten but the bride refused to be forgotten amen she knowed what the scripture promised was for her all right she had known the promise that was given that the scepter shall not depart from judah amen amen she had known that the king was going to come out of judah and she known that the scripture says that the the ruling staff shall not depart from him amen until until the tribute comes to him in other words she known that the ruler who is messiah and will be king will come out of the tribe of judah amen was well aware of the prophecy that had been spoken regarding judah but there was two sons dead one son of life somebody there was a womb that was needed to bring forth their seed yeah and tama had a revelation and believe that she was the right room for that promise and she would not let go of that promise brothers and sisters and you could see in the scripture here is she's holding on to that promise the promise that that seed is going to come through my home meaning i'm that promised elected woman and when the bride catches a revelation of that word today she doesn't let go of the promise amen it doesn't matter what comes and what denominators comes from who dies brothers and sisters but the bride that catches a revelation of the promised word for a day holds on to that promise amen amen hallelujah and so tamaya is holding on and she's holding on till she is blessed just like jacob in the bible jacob that wrestled with the angel he said i will not let go of you until you bless me amen and so we see the same spirit upon tamar and i believe the same spirit is upon the bride tonight that will not let go of the promised land [Music] means until the word materializes in her home she is pregnanted by the word for her day she will not let go beautiful thank you now we said here that onan he refused to raise seed in the in the um in the natural in his brother's name because i want to tell you children become here and um they become head to the father's inheritance so in my opinion maybe onan was eyeing out his brother's inheritance for himself and paul says in ephesians 3 verse 6 says that the gentiles should be fellow heirs of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel meaning that children born into this gospel in the name of jesus christ become here amen there is an inheritance that we become here to brothers and sisters like adam and eden was here and had an inheritance of all things amen now she was promised this youngest son and she did not receive him but she was not interested in him when you read the scripture it's such a strange thing because she was given the she was married to the first born she's given the second bond she's promised the third born but when you read the scripture she has no interest in the third born uh when you read the scripture she did not ask for the third bond she never asked for that youngest son she did not send a message to judah he says uh to say what the little boy is your age and as for your promise he needs to receive to his brother's name she did not do that brothers and sisters and uh and he types the pentecostal church and you know this the condition of the pentecostal church the spiritual condition but the madam came to call a bride out of pentecost amen not take us into pentecost and tama is a type of bride she's not looking to go to pentecost to be stimulated by the guests she's not asking for the gifts tonight but tamar is looking for the giver of the gifts himself amen in other words tamara was a type of the bride she's saying i don't want a measure anymore but what you want is the fullness of judah himself and so she's not looking for a part she's not looking for a measure but she wants the fullness himself and that's what the bride is looking for we're not looking for justification we've had justification we've built onto certification all had a measure apart pentecost was apart and the bride is not looking for a measure tonight but the bride wants to fall amen the bride wants judah himself tonight so the bible says here that judah's wife had died and he was a go to to tim that to share his sheep now you want to place that that that little event in the church ages the sharing of the sheep is when they remove all of the clothing or the will of the sheep right means that the sheep are naked and sheep type people and the ladies in churches the sheep or the people are naked blind and wretched yes so when you read the story at the time of the sharing of the sheep means it's a time of the laodicean churches amen and in the time of the liturgical churches there's a coming of judah to timnah means that the line of the tribe of judah is coming king the opening is coming in this little distinction yes the word himself is coming in the lioness and church age and revelation chapter 10 verse 3 says when he cried out with a loud voice it was as if a ryan a lion roared amen in other words in revelation 10 the king himself is coming to timnah amen in revelation chapter 10 the king is roaring like a lion and seven candies are uttering their voices amen so in the time brothers and sisters judah is sharing his sheep it's the coming of judah in the low distant church age i mean it's a coming in time it's a coming of our judah the line of the tribe of judah revelation chapter 10 in this age that we are living in wonderful amen yes means that the labels in church age is his coming age yes and uh brian tamar recognizes his coming the bride will always recognize his coming and what tom had done when she recognized his coming she made herself ready to meet with him amen that's what she done brother sisters when the bride recognizes the coming of the line of the tribe of judah in this age she quickly makes us out ready amen and this room in here the bible says she is dressed as a harlot to go and meet him and that's speaking of a certain condition and brother barum says he says we were born in a hard condition we bought adulteresses we bought off uh uh born out of our adulterous parent eve says not by our choice it's our our natural birth by our natural birth we are born adulterers we are born in sin shaking integrity we come into the world speaking lies in other words we are born a harlot means that the coming of this angel is coming to a woman that's in a hard condition by our natural birth amen we are veiled in a row of flesh which is a rope of a harlot amen and when we meet him we meet him in this harlot condition and the prophet said it's our human nature it's our sticky nature yes amen but judah when he comes he comes he's coming and there's a purpose in this coming he wants to have a relationship with this bride amen in other words he wants to have a union with this bride and remember the purpose of this is to raise seed in the name of the dead amen amen in the name of jesus and so anyway in this coming she asked him what will you give me and uh he said i promise to give you a kid and you know a kid is a goat yes and what the goat symbolizes is redemption and um your brother and sister remember this this bible is a sealed book yes it's hit from the wise and the prudent and reveal that to babes such as with love amen because the story here to a normal reader of the bible can be a really disgusting story yes yes and people that read it with the natural eyes can quickly turn the pages away from their story and um but when you have this spiritual binoculars on and um and your focus is adjust to the word for your day and you sing it through the eyes of this prophet amen then it's it becomes very clear that there's a hidden mis message in the story and you know brother man says he says whenever you read the bible if you don't see jesus christ you're going to go back and look yes amen but [Music] he says when you read the bible you're going to see yourself in the scripture in other words when you read the story of tamar and you've got to apply tamar to you you've got to see yourself as tama you're going to see yourself as rebecca you're going to see yourself as rude brother and sister there's a hidden mystery that's laying in there and the virtue that's laying is there is a virtue that you must possess yourself and so you could read the story and and say it's disgust means there's a virtue of disgust that muslim you or you can read the story and say you know what there's a there's a is a better virtue a holiness laying in the scripture that you have to possess and so yeah when you when you focus your binoculars you bring it begin to see a hidden message in the story and it's a love story and it's a love story at least coming the lion of the tribe of judah christ himself that's coming that is in a union with his bride and so he promised our kid means that he is he promises the bride a redemption all complete atonement now you remember on the day of atonement they take the blood of a goat for redemption that's right so yeah judah is promising this bride i'm gonna give you redemption and that's what we are waiting for brothers and sisters we are waiting for redemption amen we are waiting for a day of redemption we are waiting for the day when this body will be redeemed we will have a change of body we are waiting for that redemption in other words at the coming of this uh of this of judah the line of the time of judah he's promising the bribe that i am going to give you redemption amen amen yes but she says to him until you send that kid because that kid was not there you read the bible he said he says tomorrow i'll send you that kid now tomorrow if you take it literally is tomorrow but spiritually tomorrow is some time right so in other words he's saying to her look we are going to have a union a spiritual union but my promise to you after this union is i'm going to give you redemption tomorrow and so what she is saying to him until you give me redemption until you send that kin until i get my redemption i need some pledges before that i need some tokens before i get full redemption before a body change that he is going to give her before full redemption will be the tokens that will prove that this bride is a virtuous bride keeping the law keeping the word the bible says that she asks for his signet his bracelets his staff and you remember remember in revelation chapter 10 john the temple the bride he said give me the book amen yet tama is saying give me the signet give me the bracelet give me the staff and the bride in revelation 10 john is saying give me the book amen mean it's the bride that is asking for those things the signet is his ring and that's his signature that's his seal and uh remember he promised her a kid he promised her redemption but he gives her a ring he gives her his seal in other words grieve not the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption amen means that the seal comes before redemption the bride is going to be sealed before she receives redemption amen and uh the seal becomes your protection until you receive full redemption amen hallelujah and the seal became her protection until she received full redemption amen the seal is the holy ghost amen the holy ghost is our protection yes it's our shield until we come to full redemption amen and we are sealed by the holy ghost we are a seal product of christ himself and nobody can break that seal now the prophet speaks about the ceiling you read it in the holy ghost book the inspection of a cow and he says uh he said when the car is inspected it's sealed and the seal cannot be broken until it reached its final destination yes amen and the same thing with the bride of jesus christ you find bill lamb says that when the bride is sealed he says it's it means that a whom is closed amen amen i'm sure you came across that yes he says the bride is sealed with a whom and a room is closed and she won't receive any creed any dogma any man-made system because she's sealed from receiving any man-made doctrine amen any other seed because she's sealed by the holy ghost amen which comes in the form of the word yes praise the lord in other words brothers and sisters that when we when we have this union with christ we become sealed to anything else [Music] now the signet we said is a man's signature and it means the authority of that man and that authority here is given to the bride and we know that the voice of the bridegroom is in the bride and the prophet says the she becomes the final voice to the final age he gives his seal he gives his signature he gives out
