They said they need to deliver the insulation, but they need money right away. We need to give them $12,000 something right away. I'm like, woo, after all the great recovery we did, what am I going to do again? I say, okay, no problem. I say, you know what? We got to do what we got to do. &gt;&gt; And then when I came out, but Robert gave me a testimony. There is somebody from the invisible audience who's looking for the address to send money &gt;&gt; to send $5,000. &gt;&gt; You don't know how to clap for God. You don't know how to clap for God. You see what God is doing. Do you see what God is doing? When my mind is spinning trying to figure what to do, someone is calling boop and want to send money. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if from 12,000 five is already coming, what do you think the other one? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I see five, I begin to glorify God for 12. &gt;&gt; When I see 12, I glorify him for the next step. Amen. God is teaching you on the pulpit and he's teaching you by an example right there in your face what he can do not only for the church building but he can do for your individual life that how can God take care of the building &gt;&gt; and he doesn't take care of the true building he's he's dwelling in &gt;&gt; if he's taking care of this building what about this building &gt;&gt; what about your housemen Amen. &gt;&gt; Lift up your faith, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the midst of chaos, people are crying, whatever is going on, I'm not looking at what the national economy is going. I'm looking at the economy of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Both visible and invisible audience. Amen. Any family members here? God richly bless you. And the new subscriber online, God bless you. Invisible audience, I got you uh taken care of. The invisible audience complain. You got a bigger church than this. They says that uh after service they cut the the the streaming too quick and they want to continue worshipping with brother John and whoever is uh leading the song. So I told that I already instructed the technician after service give them at least 15 20 minute they want to continue. Some of them say we want to pray while brother John is singing or brother Tony or whoever is singing. So let's keep them alive. Amen. Give them another 20 minute or so or whatever the Lord lead so they can continue to uh be part of the service. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of them are even coming to visit the church. &gt;&gt; I won't I won't say other thing. I need to block some of them. Let's just leave it alone. You will see it what God is doing. Amen. God is using you to bless people all over the world. &gt;&gt; So you have been blessing people when you pull the word right here. Somebody's getting healed in Australia. Somebody's getting healed in Europe. Somebody's getting healed in America somewhere. You you have no clue until eternity will tell us exactly what is going on. Amen. Because we are in the season of the thunders. &gt;&gt; Now the seven thunders are clear to everybody. &gt;&gt; You see that the thunders are not complicated sir &gt;&gt; until they say thunders. Thunders you wonder what is a thunder. A thunder is the voice of God. &gt;&gt; It is God speaking to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why do we follow the message? Because God was veiling a man &gt;&gt; and God was using a man voice to speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh when when you hear when you listen to the tape &gt;&gt; and the sister prophesy, &gt;&gt; did you ever hear that voice coming a voice of a man? &gt;&gt; What do you hear? You will hear, "Yay, the Lord speak." And it's a woman speaking, &gt;&gt; but it's not a woman. &gt;&gt; It is God. &gt;&gt; Ah, because I say woman, some of you are quiet. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is God who's speaking, who's prophesying through a sister. He's going to use the sister's voice, &gt;&gt; but we know it's not the sister. &gt;&gt; The tone is a woman voice, but it's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, when we listening to the tape, we're listening to the voice of God. &gt;&gt; It is God who use a vessel. But we know that there is no way a man can interpret the Bible the way brother Brham is interpreting. It must be God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you begin to discern God not only on a pulpit and on a tape, you will see God on one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will be talking to a sister and the sister didn't know what is going on and the sister begin to tell you something like you know what I was meditating and it's exactly things that you were pondering at home. How did that sister know what you were pondering at home when you were not when she was not even there with you? It is God confirming you through another sister that I'm there. I was I was hearing I I I was looking at all your meditation and I'm confirming to you that I'm there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Learn to see God beyond the veil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, welcome to our convention. It's a Wednesday one. I'm not preaching. It's brother Polycarp who's going to preach and brother Albert who will be translating. I will be sitting there enjoying and as a backup. So, I told him I say you should be on fire today. Amen. When brother Polycap is here, you are over there. Amen. Amen. So let's sing. Only believe. Oh, believe all things are possible. All believe all things are possible. Ever I believe Jesus. Lord I believe I believe I believe that all Thank you to Miss. May God bless you richly. &gt;&gt; For the Bible says when you lift the son of man, &gt;&gt; that's when you'll know who he is. &gt;&gt; Who is he? He is the one that resurrect the dead. &gt;&gt; Who is he? &gt;&gt; He is the one that changes the situation. &gt;&gt; He changes the circumstance. He changes the problem. &gt;&gt; Just when you lift up his name, the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. When the people heard that name &gt;&gt; without laying of hand, people were receiving the Holy Ghost. Those that were sick and healed from their sickness. That's why it's in our advantage to lift up that name, the name that knows no failure, &gt;&gt; the name that does not go back. The name of Jesus Christ, the name that brings life to what was dead. &gt;&gt; May God bless you. &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped. greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Even those that follow us online, &gt;&gt; may God bless you all that we love you. &gt;&gt; I thank the pastor &gt;&gt; for this opportunity that he gave us to make a little bit of noise for the Lord. May God bless you all. If we can read a little bit of something as you're all standing. Go to the book of Naom chapter one. &gt;&gt; Naom chapter one. &gt;&gt; In the book of Naom chapter one. Verse nine. We read in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What do you imagine against the Lord? &gt;&gt; He will make an utter end. If affliction shall not rise up the second time, the second. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could pray. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, creator of heaven and earth, you're the one who just came for will not appear twice. It doesn't matter the circum doesn't matter what the enemy doesn't matter. the Red Sea army of Pharaoh behind. Christian shall not arise up. You're the one who creates. There's someone here. They need to create a real doesn't matter how squeezed the person is. They're capable of all things. And that's why we're standing here lifting my hand to show presence that I am representing your people. This hand represent those that have intercession for you that needs a conference with you that need to talk with you. That's why Lord wherever when we hear you recite your name the Lord they accept when you bring the solution to the problem to all your children. Lord we're a man. Without you we could do nothing. May you remove us from the way. You may speak to your people. May not be our thoughts. may comfort for it is written that the evil are nurtured from mountain. We also want to be nurtured in the name of Jesus Christ. Cast out any type of evil in the name of Jesus Christ to be cast TO BE REMOVED FROM CAST IN THE NAME OF Jesus Christ to remember that It is the 17th. We see the numbers and we see the for when we add it in eternity before God may manifest yourself. It's not by happen when we're presented before. May you bless to the last room. give us the energy pro to do your work for we ask in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Our &gt;&gt; subject this evening affliction shall not rise up the second time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All it takes maybe you went through a trial, &gt;&gt; you went through a problem, &gt;&gt; but the affliction will not rise up the second time. &gt;&gt; That is not a man's word. But it's the word of God, the creator, the author of life, the master of circumstance and time. He is capable of all things like of affliction. &gt;&gt; It's a feeling of abandonment of solitary of being in powerless in front of a situation that we find difficult &gt;&gt; of a danger or a suffering. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's a place where you feel abandoned. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A desperate situation. That's right. &gt;&gt; A great pain in the spirit. That's right. A pain in the heart &gt;&gt; caused by excessive pressure &gt;&gt; and difficult &gt;&gt; of circumstance that are traumatizing or heartache heartaching. And usually that's also spoken of when we see boats or airplanes. &gt;&gt; When those when their agents are in dangerous situations, dangerous places, imagine there's an airplane up in the air and there's a situation. people are inside or they may feel in that they'll find themselves in distress. &gt;&gt; Same thing also with the boat in the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you do not know when you may go. You find yourself in a difficult situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why the Lord is telling it doesn't matter what situation you find yourself in affliction shall not rise up the second time in your life. The book of Jonah chapter one. &gt;&gt; Jonah chapter one. Jump or I'll read a little bit fast. Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amiti saying &gt;&gt; Arise and go to Nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me. Fore! Foreign! Foreign! But Jonah But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarses from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Jopah, and found a ship going to Tarses. So he paid the fair thereof, and went down into it to go with them unto Tarses from the presence of the Lord. But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. Then the then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his God and cast forth the words that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the sheep, and he lay and was fast asleep. So the shipmaster came to him and said unto him, "What meanest thou, oh sleeper? Arise, call up, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us that we perish not." And they said everyone to his fellow, "Come and let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us." So they cast lots, and the law fell upon Jonah. In verse eight, then say they unto him, tell us, tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause is this evil upon us? What is thy occupation? And when comest thou? What is thy country? And what people art thou? And he said unto them, "I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, which have made the sea and the dry land. Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord because he had told him. Thus say they unto him, what shall we do unto thee, that the sea may become unto us? For the sea wrought and was temp tempted. And he said unto them, "Take me up and cast me forth into this into the sea. So shall the sea become unto you, for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you." May God add more blessing to the lecture of his word. Our subjection are subject that the affliction shall not rise up the second time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just came from reading in Jonah. We just came from seeing that Jonah is a prophet. &gt;&gt; Who is Jonah? &gt;&gt; He's a prophet. &gt;&gt; He's a servant of God. He's a pastor. &gt;&gt; He's an evangelist. &gt;&gt; He's a deacon in the church. He's a singer. &gt;&gt; He's a brother in the church. &gt;&gt; HE IS A CHRISTIAN. BUT NOW, he has a mission and he ran away from the mission from God AND HE WAS CALLED UPON. He was called over here the the doors of &gt;&gt; of curses. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in this context that Jonah a man of God now he became a door of curses. a pastor, an evangelist, a Christian BECOME A STUDENT FOR HIS BRETHREN. There was a lot of sin in Nineveh and God had mandate him. God cannot judge a man if he does not PRESENT YOU HIS WORDS FIRST. &gt;&gt; IF HE does not WARN YOU FIRST, BECAUSE GOD IS JEALOUS OF HIS SIGNATURE. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THAT HIS SON OR HIS daughter is representing him. &gt;&gt; So when his daughter or his son does something WRONG OR GOD IS jealous of his savior, he will do everything so he can save. That's exactly how God described Jonah to Nineveh. &gt;&gt; But the surprising thing is Jonas took Jonah took from his affair and pay the ticket to run away from the presence of the Lord. Amen. Amen. went into the boat. &gt;&gt; Now, open parenthesis. A boat that I'm preaching by the grace of God. A boat represents a family. It represents a church. It represents um affairs. It represents a job or business. &gt;&gt; And you will notice it was only men of businessmen. Meaning there was families that was there. Amen. Amen. Now when Jonah enter into the boat, &gt;&gt; there were temp there was storm. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was storms in the boat. &gt;&gt; When Jonah enter into your life, &gt;&gt; THERE will be storms that will come. There the storms of misunderstanding. There will be a storm of loss in your merchandises. It will play WITH YOUR HEALTH. WHY? BECAUSE there's a storm. AND what caused the storm? &gt;&gt; The presence of Jonah in your life. &gt;&gt; And you notice that Jonah had hidden. And when the people noticed that there was a storm, everyone started to pray upon their God. Everyone started taking conference WITH THEIR GOD. TO START EXAMINING THEIR LIFE. &gt;&gt; JONAH, was carefree WAS CALM, &gt;&gt; HE hid himself in a corner. But because the people were in a conference with God, the pastor was looking UPON HIS SHEEP. HE WENT AND FOUND JONAH WHO WAS HIDING IN THE CORNER WHO WAS ISOLATED. &gt;&gt; You will see Jonah and you bring Jonah into your family. But when you notice IN A FAMILY, SOMEONE THAT'S ALWAYS ISOLATED, YOU DON'T KNOW what type what type of affairs that they're doing &gt;&gt; or YOU'RE IN A FAMILY OR IN A RELATIONSHIP. IF SOMEONE IS ALWAYS RETRACTING THEMSELVES, maybe you're married, for example, and then you'll see, YOU'LL SEE YOUR partner &gt;&gt; with the with THEIR PHONE. ALWAYS WITH THEIR EARBUDS. BUT what do you NOT WANT FOR YOUR WIFE TO LISTEN? What conversation there are? ARE YOU HAVING TO KNOW OTHER THAT WHY? Because there's A ENTERED SOMEWHERE PEOPLE HAD noticed Jonah. That's right. all the way to the prophet till to the shipmaster discovered Jonah. &gt;&gt; Our pilot this EVENING IS THE LORD. DOESN'T MATTER what situation they are IN THE FAMILY. HE WILL HE will uncover it. Amen. Amen. Because he wants peace for his people. Because there was A JONAH THAT WAS &gt;&gt; WHO IS JONAH? He's the open door of curse. &gt;&gt; He's the one who was supposed to bring the THE IN THE BEHALF OF GOD &gt;&gt; to bring on the orders of God. But you'll find Jonah perverting the WORD OF GOD TO twist the word of God to change it into into something wrong. &gt;&gt; Into something wrong. Amen. Amen. That was Jonah. You notice in the life in this manner, &gt;&gt; we'll speak a little bit about something in Isaiah. Isaiah chapter one Isaiah chapter 1 verse 18. &gt;&gt; Listen to what the Lord says here. &gt;&gt; It says, "Come now and let us reason together. says the Lord, for your scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. &gt;&gt; Though they be red like crimson, &gt;&gt; they shall be like woe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here the Lord is a conference saying come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let us reason. Come and let us reason no matter your come before the Lord there and he will find the solution. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. of the prophet Jonah that it was a open door in the business in a door of curse in a door of curse in the family. Jonah enter into the boat &gt;&gt; paying his affair. &gt;&gt; A lot of people that enter into our life It's by a code. It's us that are giving them a code for them to enter &gt;&gt; or they may enter into your family to destroy you &gt;&gt; or to cause a to cause a disaster in your life. When Jonah enter into your life or into your relationship, &gt;&gt; he will he will look for a isolated corner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to pay close attention. When someone is retracting the self when you're in a family, amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're a couple must pay close attention know that Jonah is somewhere else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jonah can retract himself from his own house to do whatsoever to do things in secret. Amen. Amen. Because when it happens, when you notice it, &gt;&gt; he will bring betrayal. &gt;&gt; Jonah, the servant of God, &gt;&gt; who became the the door of curses, the door of curses for the family. A lot of men of God became a door of curse for the church, for the family. &gt;&gt; Last week in my house, I received a couple. I was with my wife and they had to buy a little bit of something and we were speaking to them about the word of God. They said it been a long time that they've been here. It's been about 13 years that they've been here. But why are you not going the time of the church? &gt;&gt; I'm denying the time of the church misinterpreted it. &gt;&gt; You misunderstood it. You don't need to go attach yourself to a church. Your your journey is to GO ALL THE WAY. WHEN YOU ENTER INTO the church, you're listening to the word of God. Don't limit yourself to have a relationship with God. Don't limit yourself TO BE SEEN BY YOUR WORKS. So you MAY BE SEEN BY GOD. YOU must be vaccinated. People are falling left AND RIGHT BECAUSE they had NOT RECEIVED THE DOSE. &gt;&gt; THE DOSE OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE not vaccinated. That's why they're falling. They're limiting THEMSELVES IN THE INSTEAD of doing a journey all the way to Christ &gt;&gt; who is the truth and the life and the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. talking to sad and then I was saying &gt;&gt; they live to the uh service of our pastor and they were shocked. Why? Because they may have a situation. They may pass their problem to a brother, to a sister, to a pastor or to whosoever, &gt;&gt; to officer IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AND THAT person would TAKE WOULD TAKE to communicate it to someone else, someone that cannot bring a solution. Someone who can even pray for that person. So now when the person they they run away from the church and they cast themselves from the church. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they heard that day that they trust the public to a man of God and after they go find it, they go hear it else. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in the sense A lot of men of God have spurs for the people of God because they have their parents of holy Others even have the audacity to target a lot of couragees and zeal to do sin to do sin using the word of God like Satan in the garden of Eden. Sound himself In the churches that are dead, they are not manifest in the power of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; You will notice a deacon like me and my wife were watching who was married with a wife and they did five years without children. Now this deacon And this deacon became a newly Christian. this this um this deacon pregnant a newly Christian um and that she was telling &gt;&gt; she was telling this woman that you're my friend that I was never your friend but we start thinking that in church that's where we're really the true brothers and sisters This woman says, "I'm in need of a house and that your husband may go. &gt;&gt; What am I going to do?" &gt;&gt; Now, you will notice this type of deal. You're protected by THE PASTOR. AND IN CHURCHES LIKE THAT, there's no power of the HOLY GHOST THAT'S EVEN detect the evil detect the sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here. Join us. The servant of God &gt;&gt; had accumulated evil &gt;&gt; in the business of businessmen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He attracted evil. &gt;&gt; And when they found Jonah, &gt;&gt; what did they say? &gt;&gt; They asked him, "What do you want us to do after?" &gt;&gt; So this storm can be calm. HE SAID, "TOSS me in the WATER IN THE SEA." &gt;&gt; LIKE, LIKE ALL the Jonah in your life, &gt;&gt; YOU must cast HIM TO THE SEA. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE, IF YOU HAVE PITY FOR THEM, THAT'S IT. Doesn't matter the time that he TOOK the Jonah and toss HIM IN THE SEA. THE JOINER THAT'S BRINGING YOU THAT'S BRINGING YOU PROBLEMS, you must toss them. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when you'll notice those businessmen, &gt;&gt; they toss AWAY THEIR MERCY. &gt;&gt; THEY toss away THEIR JOY. They toss away their their trust. WE WERE TAUGHT Their hopes were tied because of Jonah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why they started to have God. &gt;&gt; They started having to everyone started praying to God and the shipmaster discovered Jonah is but you had to call out to God. Maybe he will remember he will have pity for us what we will do with you. &gt;&gt; And they saw upon Jonah, where do you come from? Who are you? &gt;&gt; And he says, I AM A HEBREW SACRIFIC. I AM A HIGH PRIEST. &gt;&gt; I AM A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; I AM A DEACON. &gt;&gt; I am an evangelist. &gt;&gt; That's why they asked for HIS IDENTITY. NOW what do you want us to do with you? Say cast me into the sea in our family. There are wrongs THAT COME, EVIL. IF YOU DON'T PRAY, Jonah will not be discovered. AND WHEN HE'S NOT DISCOVERED, IT'S DEATH. IT'S DEATH THAT WILL ENTER death that will ENTER INTO THE FAMILY. WHY? BECAUSE JONAH is hidden. Conference with God, &gt;&gt; God will intercede &gt;&gt; to detect Jonah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We read something in Exodus chapter 14. &gt;&gt; We read something. &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 14. I'll start in verse 13. And Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye not, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will show this evening that are listening this evening. For the Egyptian that you have seen today, no more forever. for you and YE SHALL THE Egyptian that you'll see through you shall never see THEM AGAIN THAT YOU SEE THAT YOU'RE never see them again that you HAVE TODAY NEVER SEE THEM THAT YOU'RE THAT NO longer commit them. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NEVER the death THAT HAD ENTERED. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; May God be praised. &gt;&gt; And Moses had a conference with God. May God be praised. Prophet We'll read the prophet &gt;&gt; a little bit. We continue. &gt;&gt; But you must remember like we're in John. If Jonah had already entered into your life like they did in a boat, &gt;&gt; we'll take him and toss him in the sea. Amen. Amen. We'll take him and toss him in the sea. Issue to this businessman. Maybe he toss away the projects of PEOPLE IN THE FINANCE of people. When those people were tossing, IT WAS THEIR FIN. IT WAS THEIR HOPE. It was their life into the water because of that and all of that. But I GIVE YOU POWER TO WALK UPON UPON SNAKES, all type of powers of &gt;&gt; and nothing will do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing will harm you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we'll use that power this evening. We'll start from the message the conference of 63. Three city. Uh, the conference 1963 0608 paragraph 193 107 197 Okay. There Moses was given authority. &gt;&gt; He went down there and did miracles. And here they are right in the line of duty. And there's the Moses called a conference. &gt;&gt; God must have selected a place over behind the rock. Moses goes over there and says, "Lord, paragraph 197. If you walk, if you're walking in the line of duty like us this evening mandate by the to stand here in the exercise of I am calling a conference that's why we came. That's why we've come to pray for. That's why we're sent to the hospital. That's why we go to the sick bed for call a conference. Oh my, I feel religious right now. Call conference. That's what the Pentecost people need today IS CALL A CONFIDENCE. WHAT'S THE MATTER UP? There's a wedge in the there's a wedge in the conference. MOSES CALLED THE CONFERENCE SAID, "LORD, I've did just as you told me." &gt;&gt; And when where we just get from read reading, you've noticed this book about &gt;&gt; uh something that's forbidden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like they found Jonah in the boat. &gt;&gt; He was a dog person that could not be among businessmen. &gt;&gt; But here the prophet speaks about the um the forbidden When God forbid to touch something, you need to observe his law. When someone touches the forbidden, that is what the forbidden is. And that's what brings. That's what brings trials, storms into the congregation. That brings death. Amen. Now Moses had called for a conference. &gt;&gt; Jump a little because of time. Moses called the conference said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; and here we're death is coming, moving upon us like a patient with death is moving and Moses and Moses stood there till they had stayed there until God spoke. He knowed his voice. He was the prophet, meaning me and you were also capable. Moses when he saw that things weren't working out for a conference with God, &gt;&gt; he didn't HE DIDN'T UM HE DIDN'T MOVE until he obtained the solution &gt;&gt; for that problem. &gt;&gt; He didn't retract himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But here today 199 I GIVE YOU AUTHORITY. TAKE THOSE PEOPLE. GOD gave you AUTHORITY POISON TO SOMETHING GOOD. GOD GAVE YOU AUTHORITY TO REFUSE SICKNESS. GOD GIVE YOU AUTHORITY TO CREATE A WAY WHEN THERE'S GOD GIVE YOU AUTHORITY TO CHANGE. GOD GIVE YOU THE CHANGE ALL THE SITUATION. WHY ARE YOU CRYING? WHY ARE YOU CRYING? &gt;&gt; You need a call. You need to CALL FOR VIOLENCE. You're lacking. Amen. He was the one who ordained the mandate for fish to bring &gt;&gt; to bring money so they can pay their debt. He's capable this evening. He's the same this evening. He can do something. It doesn't matter whatsoever, whatsoever the situation, he's cap, he's capable this evening. &gt;&gt; Only if you could believe. Only if you could believe &gt;&gt; now this evening &gt;&gt; I'm bringing you so you can have conference with God in the book of Genesis. Genesis chapter 3 that was when God did his first conference. It was God alone who called for that conference. What purpose did God call that conference to save his children? He gave an order. He said don't touch this. Don't do this. When you do this, you shall die. But because he was jealous of HIS OWN, HE WAS JEALOUS OF HIS OF HIS MASTERPIECE, THE THE MAN HE CREATED. HE'S JEALOUS OF YOU WHO GOD IS JEALOUS OF he descending to the into the unto the trees and had conference with his children. That's why he has slain them and he gave them as a covering and he saved them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That shows us THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME when we have a problem, we need to have a conference like we read in Isaiah chapter one. God has said, "Let us THE ONE WHO'S CALLING THIS CONFERENCE. He said even if your sin is there to render it only if you would &gt;&gt; recognize your faults. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just keep on talking about the first conference. We were in second with God December the 20th &gt;&gt; paragraph. Then I can call in my memory another conference of running prophet that had decision. is talking about Moses and he thought that pray and he had run away and married him and got back into the wilderness and been there FOR 40 YEARS PROPHET ANOINTED GREAT commission in the world a PROPHET but yet at the very of his mistake he had take it in his own hands in his in his own hands. &gt;&gt; Instead of following the instruction, &gt;&gt; he killed a man and the threat of the fear. He ran he run into the wilderness and there was 40 years And the and the slaves of Egypt, &gt;&gt; the test was so great. &gt;&gt; Their backs were so sore. Their hearts were so broken until their cry. So he was forced to to a conflict. There was a way TO PROVOKE A CONFLICT. There's a way of forcing a conference. You can do it in your life. The showdown the prophet is telling you that it's in you that you also can do it. You can also have a conference. You can have a you can have a conference with God. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter your situation. The burden and the cries was so had to be forced to come. It cost When God makes a decision, it's got to be that way. &gt;&gt; So he had already before the foundation of the world had po's book of life for the perm people. All things was pre-planned by God. That man said to Moses, his servant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, jump certain things. Moses was chosen to deliver his people. And Moses had failed God. lost confidence and courage. &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying, "You think you failed?" &gt;&gt; Well, Moses also had failed. &gt;&gt; He who had the time of intimate with God, but he failed. He saw the miracles operate. God operating miracles. But he failed God. But he did. He wasn't tired to give you also courage. &gt;&gt; So come have conference with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We who have found who have hope as a church people call a conference. it over with. See what he'll see what decision will der will derive at. &gt;&gt; I'll jump a little. God has sent Moses &gt;&gt; because he heard the cries of his people. In paragraph, &gt;&gt; in paragraph 76, Moses had his words back with God. &gt;&gt; He was a man like you and I. when you're in a class if YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING BUT RETURN TO THE altar tell him what can I do in this situation I'm in FRONT OF A SITUATION WHAT CAN I DO WHAT CAN I say and he will orientate this ask the question who am I WHAT'S WHAT ARE THE EVIDENCE Just like you CAN ASK ME, I am a Christian. &gt;&gt; Do I have the Holy Ghost? Who is that? DO YOU HAVE THE EVIDENCE? &gt;&gt; NO. IT'S A PROMISE THAT IS FOR YOU TO YOUR CHILDREN and that and many are called and Moses, &gt;&gt; he was a man, &gt;&gt; he said, &gt;&gt; but who am I? I can't talk in this conference Moses the mouth of men to talk to come. You who are this is God. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you're a member of God WHOEVER IS IF YOU'RE NEAR HIM, TOUCH HIM SPEAK AND HE WILL SPEAK. &gt;&gt; HE WILL LISTEN because when you say the name OF JESUS CHRIST, &gt;&gt; he will listen. HE WILL THIS MAKES THE DEATH. ONE TIME JOHN WAS IN PRISON. &gt;&gt; The one who represented Christ. &gt;&gt; HE REPRESENTED CHRIST. CHRIST TO THE people &gt;&gt; that he was the people. HE WAS THE PERSON. BUT JOHN BAPTIST IS in prison. HE WAS PRAYING. &gt;&gt; HE WAS IN DISTRESS. He was praying. &gt;&gt; He was discouraged. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he said, The evidence of prayer is the result. Just pray, pray, pray. And there's no resolve. He took his disciples. He sent them to Jesus. He said, "Go ask." Is he the one that we must wait for or is it someone else? Someone else. Why? Because he was the he could not see the fruit. and listen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "Go tell them." &gt;&gt; The the blind see, &gt;&gt; the deaf hear, &gt;&gt; the dumb are listening, &gt;&gt; the the um paralyzed are walking. &gt;&gt; Those that limp are walking. the sick of the good news is being ministered. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The disciples returned. &gt;&gt; And John Baptist understood that the same thing with you or with me. If there's no evidence in your prayer, there must be evidence. There must be fruits. There must be fruits. &gt;&gt; And here it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter who Christ gives you the authority. Amen. It doesn't matter the degree of I give you the authority. It doesn't matter the degree of the situation. I give YOU AUTHORITY. DOESN'T MATTER THE DEGREE OF THE SITUATION. I GIVE YOU THE POWER. It doesn't MATTER THE DEGREE OF POVERTY. I GIVE YOU THE POWER. IT DOESN'T MATTER THE DEGREE OF I GIVE YOU THE POWER. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus who I said. &gt;&gt; May God be praised. May God be praised. And Moses still see God's glory. And he said, "Moses, if you want to know who I am, I am a miracle from God." Throw your stick down on the ground and you turn into a serpent. He said, "Take your hand in your body and pull it out." And he was lepous out. It was healed. &gt;&gt; He was It was healed. &gt;&gt; You know who I am. You know who I am. I am the God that performs miracles. I AM THE GOD THAT HEALS THE SICK AND THE AFFLICTED. I am Jehovah God. Moses said, &gt;&gt; "I SEE YOUR GLORY one more thing. I want to know before this is closed, will I tell that sent me?" He said &gt;&gt; tell him &gt;&gt; that I am. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; NOT I WILL TODAY. &gt;&gt; It's today. &gt;&gt; I am I WILL BE &gt;&gt; BUT always the same yesterday and forever. I am. &gt;&gt; I am is present tense. Now it takes future past tense. &gt;&gt; I am has sent you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, &gt;&gt; may God be praised jump a lot of things. paragraph. He says, "List 29. I I want you to notice something over here. &gt;&gt; It's very Moses had ordained to take to take the hands and put in the um the blood of the lamb to redeem this one in the in the door. &gt;&gt; The blood evidentially represented &gt;&gt; the blood of Christ. the was a common weed. You could find it anywhere. Pick it up. Just pick up that blood so simple to apply to protect faith. GOD IS SAYING FOR FORMULA JUST JUST faith just take faith only if you could believe apply the blood in your heart &gt;&gt; and apply it go tonight God is telling you to apply it to your heart amen Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll jump a little. were on their march after being separated and called out and they came across the Red Sea and they had they couldn't cross Joshua had sound a trumpet to stop quit marching there's an obstacle before us I'm jumping about Joshua in the march &gt;&gt; during the march like you a Christian they're coming every day to your you're missing this you see something the great general when he saw obstacle he said stop and the process is when you stop. That's when the problems begin. Never stop. &gt;&gt; Oh, I did this. Oh, I HAVE FAILED. THE PROPHET SAID, "DON'T STOP. LOOK, look in front of you. Keep moving. MAKE A CONFERENCE. PRONOUNCE THE WORD AND CONTINUE TO MARCH. DON'T STOP. OKAY. Paragraph 81 where spirit Christian soldiers sold knowing the strateg when they saw the the distance from their margin. There was the Red Sea perhaps two or three. There was a high mountain. They could there would be like there would be like sheep scattered a target and behind them before stop come the enemy is friends. the march today towards the promised land. The enemy is just a or two behind you. WE CAN'T STOP at this revival. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Don't stop." &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't stop at this revival. Yesterday you had the sensation. You you spoke in tongue and you stopped there. You have to keep moving forward. Paul, &gt;&gt; just keep moving. &gt;&gt; Go on. Presence of the Holy Spirit with you that night before last night. Now continually move on into that. Don't call. Don't call no hope for the enemy is close behind you. &gt;&gt; Well, John, very good things. What can we do? &gt;&gt; Okay. He was I don't know if someone present here is sick. Amen. is probably like one of you who's suffering from cancer like our brother here in the wheelchair. Like maybe you sitting there with cancer or with a heart trouble. or something that you know you're just going to die right now. &gt;&gt; The enemy has stopped you. &gt;&gt; He brought you to a halt. Maybe you come to a halt before the enemy cause you to halt. Maybe there's something in your life that caused you to halt. Whatever it is, you still have the privilege to have a conflict. Maybe you did something. Maybe you're reproaching something and because of what you've done, you cannot you can no longer comprehend. You can't pray because of this course, because of the thing that you've done. The prophet is telling you, you still have a privilege conference. &gt;&gt; You have a conference with your father. Let's find something about no matter what the enemy is. He's never too great for our God. We need a constant So Moses went up behind a certain place and held a conference with God. He didn't know what to do. You don't know what to do. Maybe you're a sinner. You've done so much. Maybe you smoke so you can't smoke more. and can't quit it and you can't stop. Maybe you've drank till you can't drink no more and you can't drink. You have come to a place where you're so full of sin and lost. &gt;&gt; So you had to look upon every woman you see wrong. Every woman you see wrong OR MAYBE YOU'VE EVEN OWN natural resources. Maybe you've come &gt;&gt; to a block. I don't care where you are. God is still ready to come to you in a conflict and talk it over with you. Maybe you broke your home. Maybe you've left your husband or your wife. Maybe you run off from there. There might be things in this life the enemy has tried you into. But remember my brother, my sister, you still have the right. You have a conference with God. Yes, sir. Talk over with time of trouble. Then we see &gt;&gt; perhaps this great leader of Israel. I have done all this at your command. I have led just as you have told me to do. I have called people by the blood. brought them down of the plagues. I've done everything that you've told me to do. &gt;&gt; And he was trapped. &gt;&gt; What must I do, Lord? This conference with you. Let's take probably this paragraph. See the problem of the church today. Paragraph 101. That's what's the matter with the church today. And he wants to give you gift after gift organization and grace after gift. But you organize yourself again because the church won't see there's there's no God for denomination. There's no any certain the go forward God's word just keep on going keep moving. God says it's right. If God says, "You've got your permission." If they say, "Well, I went to my church and they told me to have to that church now about whether I should have the Holy Ghost or not." The promise is yours to you and to your children. Amen. Amen. Honestly, we must close. must come down because of time. &gt;&gt; God be praised. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter the situation. &gt;&gt; God is capable this evening. If you bring him, call him to a conference. If you call him to a conference, he will be there &gt;&gt; to answer you. He will be there. &gt;&gt; He will be there. It takes that you might be that you might be trapped without a way out. The enemy is behind you &gt;&gt; and the rest see before you. had mountains in both sides. &gt;&gt; It's exactly. &gt;&gt; That's where Israel was also. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the Red Sea, &gt;&gt; it's probably where you are. It's probably where you find yourself blocked by sickness. Broken by sinitized by the situation that are impossible and discouraged. But there exist a way &gt;&gt; to force God &gt;&gt; TO INTERVENE &gt;&gt; NOT BY FORCE &gt;&gt; BUT BY A CONFERENCE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; By a conference when you feel powerless in all domain in all aspect OF YOUR LIFE. WHEN THE ENEMY has locked and all the doors resembles to be closed. There's only one thing left to do this evening and it is to call a conflict. Speak to the altar. Oh, you're tired. I don't know the situation. Maybe the children are sick. Remember the family is sick. The merchandise is not working. Maybe the circumstance is not working. Remind you one thing. Peter had fished all night. He didn't catch any fish. But in the word of the Lord, &gt;&gt; FISHES CAME IN THE SAND. GOD is fish in the net of Peter sand. He's capable to send money into your business. He's capable. It doesn't matter your matter your situation capable deceiver is coming the man of God is coming forward. Stand up. Stand up or in your heart or you may lift up your hand. So it may signal your prayer before God. You are in need of a conference. In need of a conference with him while the man of God is coming. No matter your situation. The commission has been given. The commission has been given. And that these are the signs that will accompany those that believe. They will pray for the sick and the sick shall heal. No matter the degree of situation, no matter the degree of the situation, we don't know exactly what Jonah went through in the bedroom. We don't know who is Jonah in your life. Maybe you are the Jonah, &gt;&gt; but there is a way out. &gt;&gt; God spoke that affliction shall not the second time. No matter what may be deception, maybe you had a relationship and then everything didn't work out. Remember, affliction shall not rise. All you have to do is call for a conference with God. When Adam sinned, God himself came and he had a conference. When the people of God when they were trapped in Egypt, God called for a conference, Moses had a conference with God in Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF, BROTHER, BROTHER OF GOD THAT GOD himself had a conference and the comfort and God and DELIVERANCE CAME. NO MATTER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, the situation you're going through, &gt;&gt; no matter the situation tonight, we are calling for comfort with our God. Lord God, we are lifting up our hand and this hand is representing our presence before your presence. You know that in your presence sick people are healed. If somebody's dead, no matter which part is life will come because every time YOU DIE FROM THE DEAD, life always coming because you have because you are the resurrection. every part of the body that was dead quickly. Look, Lord Father, the children that are going to look at THE SITUATION OF YOUR CHILDREN. Give them Lord Father good grade in school, those that ARE IN OUR FAMILIES, those that have infirmities, those that have difficulties speaking difficulties. difficulty, &gt;&gt; those that have difficulty. Father, we calling upon you THAT YOU COME DOWN. MAY YOU BRING HEALING. EVERY TIME THEY CALL UPON THE SICK WERE HERE WHEN THEY CALL UPON your name, sick people are here. Oh Almighty God, the God of the apostles, YOU ARE STILL THE SAME. LIKE THE PROPHET, we are in the line of the commission you have given. We praying for the decree OF SUCCESS.

But how many remember that it was spoken that affliction would not come. We will not rise up again the second time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you notice Jonah was in the boat and he was quietly sleeping. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say he was even sleeping deep fast. &gt;&gt; It's a deep sleep. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you notice people that cause trouble usually are &gt;&gt; carefree. Let's leave it my friend. You will go home. I will not uh get into it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one that is in the midst of the storm, that is the author of the storm. &gt;&gt; He seems like he's not even caring. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't come to church, he's fine. &gt;&gt; If he miss a meeting, that's fine. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't pray, that's fine. He's more comfortable &gt;&gt; than those that around. &gt;&gt; Those that around are seeking for solution. &gt;&gt; But the one who caused the problem is usually the one who doesn't even seek for solution. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking today about our friendship, &gt;&gt; our associate. &gt;&gt; Who do we associate with? &gt;&gt; Who hang around with you? Who's your body? &gt;&gt; And tonight God is bringing Jonah. &gt;&gt; I was thinking about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see people deviating, people backs leading. Watch carefully. Watch who's around. &gt;&gt; Watch who's connected to that person. &gt;&gt; Either they have a worldly friend &gt;&gt; that begin to pull on them. &gt;&gt; They have a friend that is taking them to sport. or they have a so-called message believer friend that does not live the life correctly &gt;&gt; because when I say the world many will rise up. Let me leave the world. &gt;&gt; Let me go in the message. &gt;&gt; Let me go in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your child is misbehaving all the time. &gt;&gt; Push the brake. Watch who is hanging with your child. &gt;&gt; Uh we will get into this. Amen. &gt;&gt; We will get into this time is already gone. We will get into this. But you need to be careful who you hang out with. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can get yourself in big trouble in this message. &gt;&gt; When I'm saying this, you having a hard time to understand. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, I'm saying get among preachers. &gt;&gt; H Now, now I shock you with that one &gt;&gt; because you didn't believe that one. Do you need a quote for that one? He said get among a bunch of preacher. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand I'm saying and you get in trouble. &gt;&gt; If if if among a bunch of preacher there is trouble, what do you think? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sit down and examine who hang out with you. &gt;&gt; What is their spiritual life? &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; How is their life? &gt;&gt; A man that is already complicated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A sister complicated. Everything don't work in your life. Everything is blockage. And this is the person you hang out with &gt;&gt; to be the savior. &gt;&gt; Let's leave it alone, my friend. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If something your boat is rocking left and right, rocking left and right, storm after storm, you need to push the brake &gt;&gt; and begin and get the light and begin to shine all over your house to see where is the problem coming from. Is it myself who's causing the problem &gt;&gt; or is it somebody in the family or somebody in my surrendering &gt;&gt; that has been the author of all the trouble that I'm going through? &gt;&gt; Because as long as Jonah is not taken care of, you're going to lose the the the where &gt;&gt; all the merchandise &gt;&gt; that was in the boat was in the sea. Everything that you took to go make business in the sea. You begin to lose after one thing after the other trying to lighten up the boat. &gt;&gt; The problem was not to lighten up the boat. There was only one solution to lighten up the boat. If they would have pick up Jonah quickly, everything else, the merchandise could have been saved. But the longer we take, the more we keep losing. The longer we take, the more we keep losing. The longer I know what I'm saying is strong, but I don't have any choices. Amen. It's impossible for you to be way up here and suddenly boom. No, no, no, no, no. Something is wrong in your life. If you want to pro to progress in your life, seek really true, good Christian, solid people. &gt;&gt; People that would tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; People that would not compromise with you. &gt;&gt; People that would look at you in the face and say, "Brother, dare you were wrong." &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "Brother, this is time to go to church. We need to quit." Amen. &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "Hey, I didn't see you in church. We need to go to church. Where were you at?" &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "Listen, my friend, this is church time. I'm going to church." &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "The pastor spoke six months about this meeting. I am not going to miss. IF YOU STAY, I'M GOING TO BE THERE." THESE ARE THE people that you hang out with. &gt;&gt; Not people that are pulling you back. &gt;&gt; SINCE YOU GOT THAT FRIENDSHIP, now you drop in your spiritual life. You need to push the brake and come out quickly. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; You didn't understand me. &gt;&gt; Watch who you trying to associate. &gt;&gt; Watch who you trying to hook. &gt;&gt; Watch who you are hooking with. &gt;&gt; Your new discovery that you love &gt;&gt; that is keeping you on the telephone all the time. that is keeping you busy with others people life &gt;&gt; and never talk about the message of the hour &gt;&gt; take Jonah put them in water &gt;&gt; ah God will take of the God will take care of them in the water put them in the water &gt;&gt; you didn't get me God will take care of them in the water they will have the conference in the belly of A WELL &gt;&gt; BUT AS LONG AS YOU HANG OUT YOU GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE OH, &gt;&gt; you I I I don't I I don't know if you understand what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you understand what I'm saying. You a married woman. Your friend are divorced. &gt;&gt; What? What? What is What do you think you're going to do? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? You're a married woman and you're going through marital problem. surrender yourself with people that are strong in marriage. &gt;&gt; So, YOU BEGIN TO SUCK ANOTHER ENERGY. &gt;&gt; You begin to suck a different anointing that will push you through and move on. Not some Have you ever seen somebody who is uh who went through a problem? They will usually hang out with a person who went through the same problem and they think they helping each other. No, they have been like uh crabs. Are we together? &gt;&gt; No. They are condoning, they are comforting one another in that level. So whenever you call, it's about the same conversation. Ah, you know how people are. We don't we don't believe anyone. We don't believe church people. I was disappointed. And this one say yes. I was disappointed. No, God cannot live without a witness. We got to find a true Christian, a true believer, somebody that reflect the word. &gt;&gt; Look at who you are associating with. &gt;&gt; Young sister, look at who you are associating with. &gt;&gt; Young brother, look at who you are associating with. &gt;&gt; Married people, look at who you are associated with. &gt;&gt; Look at which couple are you hanging around with. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Look at the one that is positive, THAT IS FULL OF ENERGY. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY THAT SISTER, PRAISE A LOT, I NEED TO LEARN ABOUT THAT SISTER. I NEED TO BE CONNECTED to that sister. &gt;&gt; I must, you must come in my life to bring ME UP. &gt;&gt; NOT COME IN MY LIFE TO BRING ME DOWN. &gt;&gt; IF SOMEBODY OH, &gt;&gt; you don't understand what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Surrender yourself with people that are strong. You say that a pastor, I will call the pastor. I will ask the pastor question because when I talk to him, he talked to me about God. He talked to me about this one. I'm going to call brother so and so. Because every time you sit with him, when you come out from his presence, it feels like you are charged. You were talking about this. I learned something I didn't know. Those are the people that you surrender with. The hour is late. &gt;&gt; He's my friend. Especially young sister. is my friend. We need to show love. &gt;&gt; You need to show love. &gt;&gt; How many times have you shown love &gt;&gt; with your love? Your love. Your love. We need to show support. &gt;&gt; If they struggling, BRING THEM TO THE PASTOR. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. If they struggling, bring them to the deacon. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; There was a young man, now he's married with children. He was hanging around with someone. I say, "What are you doing with that woman?" Oh, no. We are uh I mean witnessing to the woman and everything. I say, "How long are you going to witness to the woman?" &gt;&gt; Because you keep hanging around this woman. &gt;&gt; If you already told them you are going to church and they know the church, take the woman and turn her to the deacon &gt;&gt; and let the deacon hang off. I mean take over because you are struggling. He ended up sleeping with the woman. See there. See there. &gt;&gt; And now it was a problem OF PRAYING TO PULL HIM OUT FROM THE WOMAN. &gt;&gt; Trying to do things that you don't even know what you're trying to do. If somebody is struggling, hey, your love, your sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love. Forget it. Call the deacon. You say, "Please, please see the deacon. Please see somebody that we can pray for you and get this thing out of it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This message is not psychology. No, &gt;&gt; this is not a psychology to be comforting the people. We need to show support. Everybody left him. No, SHE GOT A PASTOR. GO TALK TO YOUR PASTOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You cannot carry your own burden. How are you going to carry 20 people's burden? You are young and before you know it, ah a lot of stuff are going because you carrying stuff that are not yours. YOU TOO YOUNG. FOCUS ON YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; PRAY FOR THE SISTER. FOCUS ON YOUR LIFE. ARE we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY, "SHOW ME WHO YOU HANG OUT WITH. &gt;&gt; I will tell you who you are." &gt;&gt; Bird of the same water. &gt;&gt; They flock. How &gt;&gt; you are spiritual like this? Your friend is low. &gt;&gt; And you want me to believe you spiritual? Both of you are together. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Examine your life. See what's going on. If you are Jonah, my friend, call for a conference and get everything out before you causing disaster to the family. &gt;&gt; If somebody is a Jonah, say, "My friend, I see that we've been friend for a long time. But I believe the problem that you're going through, you need a spiritual leader to go handle this problem." &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not qualified to have a doctorate degree and give prescription. &gt;&gt; So quit giving your prescriptions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I even have sister blocking another sister from going to the pastor. &gt;&gt; Don't bring your stuff to the pastor. I say no problem. Whatever happened to that sister, you will pay for it &gt;&gt; because you are the psychologist of the message. Where sister will call you to tell you what is wrong. You are not there. When a sister come and begin yeah you say you see brother Steven he can talk with you four hours me I will pray for you but go see brother Steven over there. Go see the deacon over there. Amen. Amen. Because when they go God provided way God is under obligation &gt;&gt; to s to to come and surrender. Amen. Amen.

You go deal with that person and call the deacon and you pull back and you start praying &gt;&gt; before you find yourself in the middle of a mess that you don't know what you're doing. And that mess cause you problem when you were climbing up spiritually on Tuesday you pray on Tuesday you pray on Tuesday you pray you begin to clam with the Lord and suddenly a Jonah &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Call on for a conference. Examine your life well. Check your family. Check what is going on. Quit your how you are spiritual. Whatever. Put it down. You say, "Hey, this situation has been going on for a long time. We don't see any problem here getting resolved." What is the problem? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh, somebody want to go home. Let's stop here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just helping you summarize everything and putting together so you understand what the Holy Spirit want to tell you because God cannot speak like this and affliction come back again. Affliction must now rise up again the second time. Whatever you going through will be one shot and you come out of it and you go. Amen. But remember, surrender yourself &gt;&gt; with people that are spiritual &gt;&gt; people that can help you in life, &gt;&gt; not negative energy under the name of the message. &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad they are. I don't care how they are. I don't care how much message they look outside. If what they producing is not true, just know you're going to work twice to try to build them to your position. And if you try, then they cannot come to your level. You will be the one dragging down because they will suck all your energy. Every time you leave them, you have to repent. After you stop the communication with them, you must ask forgiveness because you murder yourself in the things that were not yours. Cast that Jonah into the water. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, and those that are online and those that miss tonight and those that will listen to this, get Jonah out in the water. Let Jonah go back to Nineveh to preach the gospel over there before you suffer a lot of losses in your life for stubbornness. Trying to work the situation out, trying to work the situation out, try to work the situation out. Who are you to be working the situation out? Do you know the cause of the situation? You are going with what somebody told you. &gt;&gt; Did you Did you listen to the other party? &gt;&gt; Did you listen to the other party? &gt;&gt; You heard on from one mouth and you begin to act according to one. I don't know why I'm saying this, brother John. Forgive me. I'm going to let you go home. You are You heard from one mouth and you begin to do things according to one mouth. And the day you going to hear the second mouth, I am so sorry. &gt;&gt; I am sorry. I thought I thought. How many times are you going to learn?

Father, may you interpret this in the life of your children both visible and invisible audience so that Lord Father your children can be delivered and what seems to be Lord Father a trial today can turn to a testimony that never we will go back that road Lord. Father, I didn't see a time when David was Lord attacked by the bear the second time. It was one time and he used it as a testimony. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, I pray that whichever battle and suffering and affliction your children are going through, Lord, as you send your word, may you give us grace so that this will be the one time we are going through. May nobody fail the test, but may we come out victorious so that it will be classified as a testimony and never to be visited again. Lord, we are committing the remaining of the weak unto their hand. Lord, may your blood continue to protect us. May you give us travel mercy. May you protect this property and everything that is within. May you take the ongoing work unto the hand and may you strengthen your servant that you use tonight. We commit it all and humbly ask it father in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Search me, oh God. Search me, oh God, and open my heart to try Oh savior my thought my praise where some grace in Oh from sin and s my ping. Lord, I praise you Lord for me Oh my word.
