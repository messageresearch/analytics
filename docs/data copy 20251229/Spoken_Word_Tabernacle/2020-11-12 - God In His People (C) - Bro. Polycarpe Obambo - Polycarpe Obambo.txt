========================================

a sickness i don't know everything i do in life it doesn't work who told you you are the failure is that a god's language when you death and life are in the power of the tongue and they beloved shall eat the fruit thereof so it's clear you heard it god send you to school no matter where you prayed and god answer your prayer and send you there and then if you go to that place and you find an opposition and you find difficulty maybe in your wedding maybe at your work or wherever god pleases you why not go back to the god that gave you the marriage god is in you his word is in your and if you confess bad things death will happen amen amen god put everything upon your own wrapper so why don't you delight in only confessing that which is good amen amen god spoke in his word that we are gods and brother read when someone is sick the elders have the ability to pray and anoint the person we follow but no matter your condition god doesn't have a favoritism amen amen everybody that confessed his name he gave them the power to become sons of god first john yeah i think first john chapter one angel first john chapter one no jean silva but as many as received him i set him quiet to them he gave power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not the son not of blood nor of the will of flesh know of the will of man of god amen amen you see you snot is here god gave you the ability to become his son or his daughter not by the will of your father or your mother that's the reason why that's why he spoke to jeremiah he said before you were conceived in your mother's womb i already know you see as we are here tonight god already knew us prior to the foundation of the world but why do you always pay attention to what the world is saying the world did not create you you have a creator you have a garden when the world is seeking after god they must find that god in you [Applause] let that people see jesus through your behavior to see jesus christ through your immune humility we want to see jesus christ in you triumphing in a victorious christ [Music] we found that when peter was down below they never knew what happened between jesus and moses so to be partaker of what happened over there you must come higher [Applause] because in you you are carrying the name of jesus because you are carrying the name of god you can remember david [Music] there was a philistine bear and the lion remember so the man the same god that gave me that victory he's also able to give me the victory tonight and tonight god is able to give you victory to your problem that situation that i have been longing for so staying for so long [Applause] let me see if elijah was a big uh someone coming from a different world than where we james 5 17. as we are oh my god by the space of three years and six months amen amen the bible says the bible is comparing us to elijah so the same way you were born elijah was born the same way but when he faced the issue he was taking his personal problem seriously and he was praying earnestly so that the solution can happen the problem with the church tonight your problem tonight um you are not like everybody else deity lives in you they still live in you jesus the fullness of the godhead badly amen amen because god created all things god created everything allah you are [Music] amen let me read it let me read it to see what did god do to man after he created him amen amen amen when god created all things he brought everything to men amen amen okay genesis 2 19 20. amen amen amen and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast but for adam there was not found and helped me for him i just told you that man was a partner of god not a servant as we [Applause] [Applause] god never came back and created something else he brought everything that he created and presented that to adam to see what will adam do with it because he created men to his own image you are created to the image of god so how can you explain that adam could sit and start with for you to give a name to a creature you must know your science pretty good you must know the characteristic of the beast or the to creature this fish from that fish based on their characteristics do you understand the level adam was listening so how did adam have those mysteries amen that's the deity i'm speaking about that deity dwells in you every creature and god only posed his approval god never contradicted adam because man is god's partner [Applause] [Applause] what did peter say generally [Applause] [Music] the problem with the church tonight that existed not as though they are existing jesus says listen if you have faith just like a little grain of mustard just a tiny tiny favor you can move a big mountain [Music] you can tell that mountain mountain move from here and the mountain will obey you how many mountains do you have in your life so you are always looking at colorado mountain kings mountain all those mountains [Music] that you have have uh beating signs completely there is all kinds of female cancers and things that science cannot solve but he cannot stand in front of the name of jesus christ can do nothing to the name of jesus christ sickness can nothing be in front of jesus christ your condition is nothing in front of jesus christ hallelujah you have the power my brother to come to existence those things that are not nothing something hallelujah he could not understand the scriptures he said what are you doing i'm reading the bible do you really understand what you are reading he said how can i understand if nobody teaches me and he begin to unfold the he mysteries about jesus christ and then when they come up to a pool of water the man said wait a minute what is forbidding me to be baptized one is forbidding me to be baptized when you're listening to the word of god so what is blocking you to reach out to your blessing what is blocking you to reach out to your deliverance you must find [Music] in the name of jesus christ those things will happen in your life and philip was explaining to him and he said wait a minute you are preaching about bodies baptism there is water there they took him to order the deity was in philippi when philip finished his service god never took an airplane god never took a bike [Music] no god never used a car [Music] [Applause] disappear without the airport until it began rejoicing rejoicing blessing the lord so it's telling you that enough when dealing dwelling is the same god that is you must speak good things about [Music] he was with jesus jesus but jesus heard despite that and jesus asked him what do you want he was baptized who gave his own confession and tonight you know your problem [Applause] you can stand and pray god i believe it's already time let's stand here we brought you the deity of god the deity of god is in your other people's life it's funny it's uh it's uh it's putting foundation in other people's life that are coming up here it's about to change your situation [Music] somebody was scoffing the children of god and david say no i must move forward and he said i'm coming in the name of the lord engaging god to the battle [Music] in luke 10 verse 19. i don't know what you're doing with the power of god in your life because god will require of what you did to his power because what you are listening tonight you're going to be responsible for that god gives you the power upon all [Music] [Music] what are you doing with the power of god you must remember somebody in the bible [Music] jesus uh maybe someone else was giving ten dollars somebody has five dollars somebody has one dollar they want to have their leader he said no i must bear mine amen but at the end [Music] maybe in [Music] in this world there is a resurrection when people are dying you have the power to pray for them when people are sick you have the commission to pray for them when you have a problem you have the commission to pray for your own problems [Music] a package that i don't know he returned the package back so why do you accept all kinds of packages delivered to you why do you accept sickness in your life why do you accept bad condition in your life [Music] god doesn't want you to accept them you are may be cornered somewhere [Music] but you are still staying in that condition instead of moving to a different place like abraham left his own country he separate from his brother to see the hand of god in his life to accept different conditions that's your problem certain situation no matter the love you have for that person sometimes god has to separate [Music] because you need to see the hand of god in your life let's pray [Music] let's pray [Music] we are beneficiary of this revival there is a revival in this church there is the presence of god in this church let's pray heavenly father [Music] father we need your presence be established in our heart hallelujah we want you
