my favorites but [Music] [Music] oh [Music] within me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] within [Music] from [Music] thy holy [Music] oh the joy of thy [Music] salvation [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] presence [Music] so [Music] salvation [Music] and [Applause] [Music] in the world of chaos we have heard the message for there is a place a perfect rest behind the inner [Music] let's sing that again as our pastor comes this evening for all this [Music] [Applause] [Music] a perfect rest [Music] for [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen oh [Music] [Music] amen [Music] there is a place of perfect rest behind the inaudible praise the name of the lord there is a place a perfect place right behind the inner veil very very important to be behind the innervale because that's where your rest is remember there was an ordinance against you and christ took that ordinance and nailed it at the cross and when he did it the veil of the temple split in two when he split now there is an interest you don't have to stay outside you need to go inside because when you get inside then you get the hidden manner praise the name of the lord amen i'm not the one preaching tonight i have our local minister brother kelly will be preaching for us tonight you all know brother kelly so he has his liberty to go ahead and preach the house down like we usually say yeah i'm still standing on something i was trying to get on part four uh the roof serving but brother greg told me something [Laughter] about esther so i have to go back and look about esther have to have the power to write her own declaration despite what was given in other words it seems like the power was handed to the bride but the bride was not aware and she went into the at the feet of the king and begin to whip to cry until the king unveiled like you know the man called mordechai there is something that mordecai have that if you know the under if you have the revelation of that you can go ahead and reverse amen it was a seal a ring a signal and judah also have a signet so we got to deal with the sickness of judah deal with the scepter of judah and deal with all those things to make you understand the power and the position that you have in christ amen you don't have to be accepting things you need to be refusing certain things are you there you have the power to say this no you have the wrong address it is written on my name i see the name but that box of snake i am not the one who order it you send it back where it belongs to amen praise the name of the lord we thank god for spending sparing the life of brother germain yeah praise the name of the lord as brother maurice communicated with me his mom had a surgery today and everything went well so continue to pray amen praise the name of the lord so continue to pray for a quick recovery not only for her but for german in the hospital so next time lord's willing they will be sitting in a service amen so we have brother kelly he's going to take his liberty come and preach only believe praise the name of the lord well believe oh believe [Music] all paints are possible [Music] only [Music] hallelujah [Music] all things [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] lord god [Music] become lord god as we look unto the throne for where our help coming from so we come in the name of the lord jesus christ lord god we're bringing you to the people lord god have your way lord jesus we give you praise we give you honor tonight amen and amen amen you know we just thank the lord for this opportunity you know you may be seated for a minute before we from the scriptures i just wanted some of you know me and know of me and like so i'm looking in and i'll do my best to stay still tonight okay i know it's tough when you're there but some see this is a great opportunity for me to come thank you musicians to come and sit up under a ministry like this what god have saved for last and you know all of us have our testimonies and in this hour here and then and we're still praying and looking for others to come in is that right because we now as the lord have showed us he put us on heart a little bit greg but he has some more force in that lesson doughnuts but one thing we do know what we're in the royal land uh right and we're royal blood right and we are in the melchizedek gallery is that right so we know god is bringing us in there because you are what you know we're still two looking at them is that right brother brahma always told us two forces it was the son of god it was the sons of the prophets is that right so we thank god for being with the sons of god is that right because we know that we thrive and we feed off with a revelation of the word of god so we come in this out here now so i was just looking at a little lesson here and giving our pastor a break i'm glad i thank the lord for putting me on his heart you know uh it's like you know john the baptist he they said he was a man a rugged man he was a man of the wilderness so you may see a lot of my terminology because i was a man of the prisons of the jails and other streets so i came from a different background of different so you're so don't get upset if i use some certain terminology so you can understand why god had me sitting under certain ministers in there because that's a special ministry it's a special ministry i know we've good and i heard the brother uh brother hayden the minister about you know is the heaviness on people's hearts and in them but you know i thank god where he put me at because he couldn't have put me anywhere else because it was a heaviness on my heart you know when you go into a place where i was i was familiar when you go into a place and souls are hungry they're thirsty i miss that you miss it and you know so but god has a place for us right now and it's feeding us so that we can prepare for something down the road is that right he's preparing us for down the road so you know when you see the god using your pastor we're going to show you you know you gotta get humble you know don't rush them you see what i'm saying we thank ones like greg and and the other brother and going home and they're digging into the word after the word that came here is that right god show us it it's all in the word and it's all in this message of this hour this is coming i i thank the lord but i was just as happy sitting there sitting in the amen corner and being fed is that right is that right this is fresh man and that's coming in from heaven but right now the lot has fell on me tonight is that right so we have to understand you know we've seen we'll share some testimonies in between by the grace of god that my son was here you know he just kind of hit the surface but it was a lot it's a lot going on you know i know brother john and different other ones has family members in them that are on the police force you know we constantly pray for them but they're the ones to get them to meet is that right huh so that's why we have to understand god has been hidden in all places so that he can well send the word for his elect bride we don't know where they're at you know what they're troubling with we don't know what they're struggling with is that right but we know that they're in all walks of life so god has send us to earnestly contend for this faith in this hour here now we want to always remember and that we are after the lost souls is that right once we get that last scene and we're up out of here but we wanted to by the grace of god and you know everything that that we're doing we're not just doing it when you hear the pastor say this is the church of christ and these are things these are the way of the lord even little children i don't have time to go to all the quotes i got my uh my uh timer set and this time brother i'm gonna keep that phone in my pocket this time brother bailey thank you i got the timer we had the timer set but you know when brother john and the ones coming in he called individuals to pray that's why we're going to be working with tonight our topic is still we're still going to be working with prayer confidence in prayer do you have confidence in your prayer because the reason why john is doing what he's doing or who's ever conducting brother abel and different ones when they call you up to pray is because your prayer is just as powerful as anybody else's prayer in here the children prayer so we have to understand that's why we're training them up train a child up in the way that he should go i remember brother branham said he had a quote in there where he had a child to come up there and pray and he said about a week or so later he said he saw that prayer answered he saw that person healed so we're transforming so so we are the church of jesus christ he is restoring his word this is not just the spoken word of god this is the manifestation of the spoken word of god this is the hour for it all is that right god extended his grace you're going to see some had to be did not did not the lord have our pastor say something gotta be whooped a little harder is that right so i'm gonna have to right but he promised what i'm not gonna lose not a one is that right sometimes you know i get to preaching fast i don't want my yankee a voice to come out you don't understand me but that's why when we were in here ministering last time we said you know when the coin the prophet of god said when the coin was in that fish's mouth he typed that with what a trustee is that right and he got around in there and he said sometimes you got to be rebuked and coming in he typed that with what a pastor's office is that right and he said sometime you got to come in and turn tables over is that right well he's caught he'd count that as a beak he typed that with a deacon's office but that was perfect love coming down there is that right is that right so we have to understand that we're all being trained that was perfect they couldn't see that that was perfect love when jesus first came in there well i don't want to get ahead of myself i want you to see some things is that right so we want you to understand because see when understanding comes confidence comes confidence faith come faith is only a revelation revelation can only come to you by god is that right so somewhere down to each and every one of us that's why the lord tell us to what pray praying what watch is that right pray and watch you stay prayed up at all time pray without ceasing because we're looking for the coming of the lord the coming of the lord we know things has happened in israel over in jerusalem i let the pastor take care of that i won't touch that but but the signs and showing is right among us we should be a glorious time we get ready to get out of here is that right huh so your sister's uh the trail you're looking good from the last time we minutes the god did something for you is that right you hold on to it is that right we're gonna look at it and we don't have much tonight we're not gonna turn many scriptures but we want you to see what the confidence is that god has put in you and me is that right so now we can stand and i'll read the scripture i'll tell you what let's go over to uh mark 11. and then i'll read that scripture then i'll read the other scriptures and you may be seated okay we've got mark 11. let's look at the start at verse uh 20. once you have it say amen it says and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and peter calling to remember it saying unto him master behold the fig tree which thou curses is withered away you see what the pastor was just saying we move it in two wise what you say this is what you say he said now we get over there he says and jesus answers save unto them have what faith in god see that's what's going to be our topic on tonight we're still working with confidence but have faith in god he said now he says for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain thou and thou remove and be thou cast to the sea and shall not do what doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saved shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith is that right he said therefore i say unto you what things so ever ye what desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them you may be seen it may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word and i want to read the first um i want to go to first john and two amen y'all gonna be praying with me okay i don't spoke the word i'm gonna put the word out to you you're supposed to be praying is that right ah so he says look at the first john two and twenty eight do you have to say amen okay let me say uh there we go he says in doubt did i write that down right i think it was when i say first john i think i might have wrote that down oh okay i got it thank you thank you jesus he says and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have what confidence and not be ashamed before him at his what his coming is that right you're being prepared by the word you don't have to be then let's go to first john 3 and 21. and he says beloved if our heart what condemn us not then have we what confidence towards god see we have confidence towards the word we have confidence in it because because we know what we're getting is the truth is that right we know that god cannot tell us we know that he can't but we want to look at three point little points here with job a familiar passage is a scripture with job we know here the prophet of god and he was working with it is he says have ye heard but now i see this is the thought here that he was kind of working with and that god they helped me a lot with the thought that was pricked and um pricked my heart so just bear with me like i said just pray with me for this hour we gonna be here but we gonna just be here for an hour i know it's the it's the hawk week is that right we know where the hunt was the middle of the week we know you pressed your way out but god got a blessing for us all that's why i said pray with me he said now we know we know that job he was a man that was chosen there by god he was a mighty man and he was a prophet but we know god chose job to go through something is that right and when he chose job to go through this but it was for the glory of god and god told them and as he chose him to go through this through the glory of god many things that he had to suffer but then there was one thing he didn't have to suffer because brother branham said that he all the things that he suffered but he didn't have to but because what he didn't have that faith that he was totally really needing is that right brother branham said those things has some of those things happened was because of what he feared god the things that he feared he didn't have that total faith he wasn't totally trusting in god he didn't have it now this hour here now we shouldn't have that because we got the fullness of the word is that right so god is telling us to have faith in god it's not just the letter of the word it's the manifestation of the word he said and then now look let me read this he says in may now i i don't have like brother brother steve so y'all don't have to pay attention is that right he got that power point i love that power play so y'all just gonna have to listen to me he said he didn't have a one in the ear let him hear what the spirit has to say is that right so we're all doing it by what faith is that right hallelujah he says now he says may the lord bless his word joe let's just a little look at job job was the prophet he was a man that lived back before the bible was written he thought that job was one of the oldest books of the bible because it was written before genesis was written job this great warrior the prophet a mighty man in his day no doubt that he had had brought up and has served though he had served the lord of his life see your children your parents is training you up according to the word of god the word to come you ought to thank god for this some of us were brought out of different lives some of them was brought out of different walks and maybe you know they went through certain things and they got testimonies and they try to make your children feel bad because maybe you don't have the testimonies or you didn't go anything but you got a greater testimony you know why because you had a god that can keep you from going through what i went through is that right so you you you tell them those things we got the word for the devil is that right i'm telling cause we are the jehovah witnesses is that right i was telling the fellow there at work i said don't bring me that religion brother that's why some it got a little offended some thought when i was from the last time we was here i made that statement about that jehovah witness you know why because that was the devil trying to come up to me and trying to trick me what he was trying to say was he said who are you worshiping i see if i would have told him god and then he would have said then what's his name if i would have told him jesus christ i'm not going to throw my pearls to swine i already knew what he was going to try to do you see what i'm saying if jehovah is so great if it's jehovah and you got a revelation of your jehovah why haven't you seen no jehovah witnesses witnessing on the street why don't you see them out there huh because they don't have the faith that god has restored to us before the foundation of the world i'm trying to sit still i'm trying to sit still huh religious demons religious statements i saw a pastor i was praying i saw a pastor moving to that pastor office when he was saying feeling the infirmities of our brothers feeling the infirmities of their families we come and we reach out to them because why because we know all things are possible to them that believe brother branham said a true believer if a true believer had what he believes everything is impossible he said that's what he says keep reading look at job he says in his life it says and had lived such a gallant to the people gathering life to the people all have respects for him but he come to a place where he calls it here he being tempted of who he's being tempted of god god is just using the devil to do it but it's god doing it that's why the pastor said this is god that's causing this split every time it is you got to go listen to the uh what the the uh message of the end time end time messenger and see what god said in here the split is what he called it he said i pressed to the mark of the prize of the high calling forgetting those things that are behind me huh they're looking like sheep and wolf clothing huh but they're preaching really against the cross they're not god tell us they try to say about the mysteries brother greg but the bible don't say that over the first samuel 8 he told samuel why he says samuel he says he's saying you start testifying that what he did for the people and god had to come and tell samuel samuel they're really not against you samuel yeah but they're against me samuel they really don't want this message they really don't care for this end time let's say john but that's what he's saying is our air now they're really against god they want to do it their own way is that right but we get rid of this but god's about to show them the real child of god is about to stand up now i'm something that i heard brother steve said he said they wonder why he got this revelation is that right he got this revelation because why he was like joshua joshua was set up under who moses is that right he got good training he got solid training he yielded to the holy ghost he yielded to his authority now he said my servant is dead but joshua as i was with my servant i'm with you also it's a different ministry that god has given him total different ministry why don't they come you know why they're not here know why they fled they said they came brother kelly where brother kelly why brother kelly is still there what is he doing there because the scripture says the scripture says the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the lord ah i didn't move with the group when you usually see them move like that somebody is influencing them they're being influenced is that right huh they don't want the doctrine they don't want the words of the lord oh that's brother seven most teaching that's brother steve's teaching hey what they say huh let's turn back to mark 11. i'm gonna show you something hallelujah huh look over there and see are they one hallelujah once you have it say amen he says now look he says burke's uh i started verse 17. i'm sorry brother mark 11 and verse 17. it says in hint cause saying unto them chapter 11 verse 17. is it not written my house shall be called of all nations the house of what the house of prayer he says but ye have made it away ah prophet god said many times where did that mean there's no repair means he said that was one of the things that satan got a man it's not that right satan god i'm also in the worship service is that right you pray for brother abel you pray for brother john that's a ministry that's a ministry that god had put in here for his precious bride if she prayed and he put someone on your heart enter his gates with thanksgiving with a song on your heart train up a child in the way that he should go when he grow old he won't depart from it we're talking about prayer we're going to read some things about the prayer too one of them i forgot to read to you when he got over there let me just hear god help me i got to catch you while i come to i'm a man of inspiration if i don't i get to go in and i might miss it he said now look god help me he said now look i want you to see this here hallelujah i can quote it i think i just about god let's see then help me lord tell you what i'll i'll get it we'll get let me keep going and read this here i'll get it it'll come to you but i'll quote it he said after they were singing and when they came out singing i think they were saying i'll pray for you and brother branham said that's right he said that's prayer i expect your prayers he said that's the mystery to the word of god that's the mystery to the way of god as you pray he said you are the real missionaries we're getting ready for something you're not going to be able to be ready for if you're not praying and watching you see that that was a commission so so many don't have the confidence is because they're not meeting the obligations if you're not meeting the obligations there's no way you're going to have confidence let's see what happens and we're going to and see that's why let me wait on that i want to read this first i'll wait on it he says now look he says the lord he said no doubt that he been brought up and have served the lord we're talking about job and have lived such a gallant to the life to the people have respect for him but he come to a place to where he calls it being tempted he's being tempted of the lord but i like to use the word he said test it and every song come up to god must be what first tried and tested he said now he's coming he he said we'll be coming he'll become an illegitimate child if a person can't handle the test still with me he said now look he says you can no more deny it deny yourself by denying this word see the word cannot offend the word i'm again i'm gonna get to mark 11 but the word cannot offend the word you see because whatever comes across here i remember my brother said he was sitting in a meeting and said he got there and said man i'm not going back to that church that feather called me a buzzer he said i don't know about you i heard him call me an eagle i'm gonna show you faith come by hearing hearing the word of god you see it come by hearing how you hear it now let's jump back to mark 11. he said now look he said and the scribes and the chief priests did what i'm at verse 18 they heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him see because of all the people was just starting at his what where'd he go where'd you go for i know some of them screaming in god gave me grace to say i'm gonna say it that's why that's why we met many souls when we was in the prison when the prisons was open went to jail for something it's not not that i was such a better preacher than them guys and them guys can preach some of them theologians man they know the scriptures front moves in backwards but the difference between them and me is i had the message of the hour i had the truth with me god vindicated i didn't have to back down off a note devil this word would defeat the devil anywhere anytime anyplace you know why they say he said the priest in them was astonished that his what doctrine and his teaching you know what they got around there that's right brother that's right brother abel you know why they got around in there because see when a man was on the streets where he coming from and they found out they had trouble with heroin and if the man overdosed somebody on the street overdosed from heroin the true drug addict he did not run from the strongest dope that was on the street he was looking for that dope is that right because he know he can get maybe three shots out of it at least two but maybe three so why when you see this kind of peachy why when you see this kind of doctor why are you running from it ah because now you find out you got to go on the back side of that doctor huh now you call man one thing he said when i met him he said brother kelly he said it gotta come out of the scriptures his brother symbol don't bring the don't come with me with that devil you see that the men's backing it by the scriptures oh he's that hungering and thirst for righteousness shall be filled over the prophet of god said you can never overemphasize revelation revelation revelation where'd they go they left because of the doctrine they left because of the teachings now you got to change now you got to humble yourself i love it who wants to be wrong i don't want to be wrong if god sent a person there on the scene is that right huh paul set up under the best teacher in the land i don't know why i'm going this way that wasn't even in my notes but i'm going and believing to him he said why paul said one of the best teachers in the land didn't it brother or the camilla and is that right but gamilion but when he met who jesus when joshua came on the land when the holy ghost came on the land he said them he shall be what he will lead you he will guide you he will protect you he will teach you he's your comforter is that right i heard a brother say at the family meeting brother haven't said the family meeting what do you say brother abel need more the holy ghost don't they yes sir why was the holy ghost sin the holy ghost was sent to give to you so we continue this walk is that right god wanted fellowship he wanted to increase your power in prayer he wanted to do all these things he said but i will not leave you comfortless i will send you what the comforter see let not your heart be troubled is that right because a physical condition can cause a what a spiritual condition a spiritual condition can call a spirit can call a physical condition let me see if i have yeah i had it down here in my notes i got it right down here the lord brought that thing brought that uh uh months ago to us didn't he let's see what he said down here and see what he said about it hello thank you jesus he said fear weakens the what kidney is that right come on holy ghost huh he said anger weakens the what the liver is that right huh he says stress weakens the what the heart is that right he said worry we can do what the stomach is that right he said grief we can do what the lungs is that right but why did he say that that was going to keep keep coming but we don't have to accept that he said greater is he that is in thee than he that is in the world he said i'ma show you that you're a special group of people none of these diseases none of these sickness shall come upon you it's what you say is that right what you buying on earth it should be buying in heaven what you loose on earth you should be loose in heaven is that right daddy don't have to be there sister if your child gets sick you can do what you can lay hands on them is that right huh you don't know how god to get a person out of a situation you just trust in god have faith in god hallelujah we're moving somewhere just pray with me he said now look he said his bible wasn't he said the bible wasn't wrote then remember job didn't have that bible is that right he said he said he he didn't have the bible then he said that was before then but he had access by god by revelation and visions is that right that's what he had he said now when god blessed him and made him a great man why even everybody respected him through his wisdom had become so great his inspiration from god had vindicated him to be god's servant so plainly what we are getting has vindicated that this is god's servant that's coming here feeding his children in this hour here now is that right he said i'll never leave you or forsake you is that right so that's why you have all you sitting out there praying and watching over the word where god is now is that right it won't be long i'm telling you saints you look at the prophecies and things around us it won't be long he says the inspiration from god vindicated him to be god's servant so plainly until the people come from everywhere to hear he said now look he says and then satan begins to accuse that man why say his tactics he begins to accuse that man he begins to to bring a accusation to get him but what we gotta pray in force is that right we gotta pray and forth the last time we was here we said pray in the prayer of faith is that right do we always feel it do we always have it no brother branham didn't always feel that brother branham didn't always have it let me read this quote to you and you could see say what you talking about brother brother kelly look at this here he said now he says sometimes i feel a person when they come to me i feel that pressure of faith come against me he said maybe maybe they're blind death or dumb he said but when i feel that pressure come against me that i that i know that it's faith i usually stop like that because if if them people have faith for it to be done no matter what's wrong with them but if i don't feel that faith he said i ask i just ask a prayer of what faith still hear me i pray the prayer of faith now you see so sometimes he may not be feeling it up here we may not be feeling it up here but remember the lady that had the baby and she got around it and they were there she didn't have the prayer card and when he got there he told me said now look she wanted she was concerned about the baby being healed and it was the sister if my wife was sitting there and the sister had the baby he said it said do you mind the sister she was anointed with the faith at that time and he told him now would you would you mind if i pray for your baby he says no i don't she prayed for that baby and when he got up there he said he came in the prayer line and he'd been brought up to the prayer line and he looked at it he says the woman prayed for your baby while you was there in the audience he said the baby going your way the baby is already healed you see who you are i'm talking about do you have confidence in your prayer once you meet the obligations is that right let me keep reading we're going to show you job job what god had did and how god had chose job job could not fail god was allowing job to be tested god is allowing you to be tested the devil can't come to you until you get permission from god because god already know that not so much to having the confidence is we having the confidence in god but god got confidence in you you are fighting yourself god put the confidence already in you he's just trying to get you to move that's all he's trying to get you to do he's saying look now what's that confidence he put it there and he put that confidence in joke he's the only reason why the things came upon joke because he feared see you don't have the fear you know you don't have to god said i did not give you the spirit of what fear but love peace joy and a sound mind is that right he's bringing you a word oh all he knew all the prophet god was saying see that's why you can't look at me look at brother brandon we got a balance with brother branham is that right we got a balance you watch the spirit that's moving in there now you got some of them that come and won't even hardly say his name down because they let that spirit that they left from convince them put questions in their minds he put questions in their mind whether or not if he was malachi 4 is that right they tried to come with john the baptist but god so rich and mercy had brought us the word it showed us by the scripture that he was what malachi 4 is that right four and five so when he come around in there why so many other men in this age this is what i tell them i battle these things behind the prison walls of different for a while see i would say the prophet of god the prophet of god so somebody's going to catch it he said he had having here let him hear what the spirit has to say so the only way to say is that right he didn't have faith let him catch it faith is a revelation it's the spirit now you're moving in why because they meet the obligation the obligation you come in the truth he said word he that hunger in the thirst at the righteousness shall be what ah look at how simple that obligation all you got to do is hunger in the thirst is that right if you hung in the thirst and you want the truth you shall be filled god cannot take that away is that right what other man that came here on this earth is that right we can rightfully divide that office first we got to bring him to the office because most of your gentiles one of the sisters she's asked a question when she asked the question when he got around and then i thought oh listen i love that fellowship with the family i love that fellowship i heard you hear a lot of things where people are sister wanted witness she wanted witness she wanted to tell him about that but she don't want to say brother brandon brother brandon brother brandon brother branham she's not one she don't want to say that she was thirsting inside i want to win a soul to the kingdom of god but how do i win it wisdom comes from god you know when we was a salesman i was a salesman back then we had took the worst route that there was i had the slowest route that there was the time wasn't making any money in that but see when you're hustling drugs and you're on the streets when you start selling all that is is what is a professional way of hustling right now when you're selling the chips you're selling these different things now you've been moved from the street so a good salesman is not a good talker sister a good salesman is a good listener you can't sell them unless you know what they're after you see what i'm saying so now wisdom comes from god and when we come around in there so when you get over there that's why he comes in faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of god that's why we're saying some are still wondering some is wondering which way should i go some is still not sure is that right some are not even witnessing why are you not witnessing because you're not witnessing this because you're not sure huh you're not sure of what you have you don't truly believe it that's why i said have faith in god he withered the tree it was supposed to be what some things only at the time is that right but it wasn't any fruit it was just religion all they had was covering is that right so you got to get them you've got let me get let me get back to this hallelujah once you see another prayer of faith he says any group of people any gathering of holiness people that believe in christ has the excuse me has the right to have the nine spiritual gifts it circles through the body it circles through the body it's in the body it's not a praying individual that's why i said now you see what i said i see why able and now you see why i am first of all your reason why you get there i'm gonna hit you i'm gonna pinch you with something now it's because you ain't praying at home so you're sitting there saying i sure hope you don't pray for me i sure don't pray for me and maybe god deliver you oh i sure hope you don't call on me i sure hope we don't you know why maybe god deliver you from drinking ah you got somebody struggling with alcohol now you need brother abel they need somebody to move in the gap for them somebody that was an alcoholic somebody that was a drug addict somebody that was a prostitute somebody that used to steals that's why he's saying the prayer he can use god wants to use any of you if one of them brothers would call you is staying in the gap maybe that somebody is looking at a woman you've been waiting for years to get pregnant and wait for that child but you looking and worrying about something that the devil is trying to unbother you with you don't have to god said i will not have you unfruitful i'm buried you got to see that's why he said have you heard the patience of job say look he said it'll be this one night let me back up you said it's not a prayer it's not a praying individual it'll be on this one one here this night baby you know what you tell mama when you go home make sure you pray it up you know why because they may call you to pray say mama we gotta pray brother john or brother abel may call me to pray i got a little friend that's struggling in school she's not doing that good in math and he made calling she'll get up there and say you know you know what lord i have a little friend at work i'm at school and she's having a time with her math so god could you help her with her math my little son was six or seven years old lord let my my father-in-law really so rest in peace he went up today about seven years old just like they was telling that um that that uh testimony brother nate was telling that testimony about nate's going home service when renee asked that question when he was six or seven years old my little youngest son went up to that altar my wife and i didn't send him he said i want to know you can pray for my grandpa so he can stop drinking and smoking this word is real god's calling us to the manifestation of this word that's why the lord in your home it has to be a peaceful home a praying home a loving home okay you rule your house by love we're a prisoner of love paul was a prisoner of love see so we have to understand in this hour here now what god has called us to do we got the goods we don't condemn nobody [Music] know that brother abel because why because god said in the scriptures i have created man in my image and in my likeness he said that i do what he's he said so he created a man in his image and his likeness what is being really thirsting for he's thirsting for god that's why he said even we need to refill him because we're thirsting more of god he said now look he said the person can pray the prayer of faith tonight and maybe it's on this one or over the next night it's on that one it's a gift that's in the body working around all of you milling through the body the nine spiritual gifts let me keep going because i don't want to fall behind i want to get much this as we can by god's grace he said now look let's turn to job one like let's get scripture to back job job one oh brother steve you don't know ah you're like a millionaire i wish i could sit up under your feet huh they get around in there you got to recognize the gift that god sent to you huh i'm not lifting up no man i'm lifting up the the uh again hallelujah you have job say look i call that job nehemiah come on all this looking for is right after nehemiah i believe i mean esther i'm sorry look here he says now look job chapter one he said there was a man in the land of us who name was job and and that man was perfect in an upright and one that feared god and extreme evil you think god was wearing you think god was worrying about joke failing you think god was worrying about job that's right brother that's that's right brother no he was not because the word of god had just identified job it identified job's character it identified that this is my man and it's ours he said now you look he said job of the character he said then there was born unto him seven sons and three daughters we dropped down let me drop down to verse six he says now there was there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among among them see where it is good as evil satan's always present he's no good man he's no good put him in a pipe he can't move that right put a snake in the pipe that's great you ain't going away he ain't going away take him out of that pipe watch it oh nature is that right people getting nature in the culture mixed up is that right they got around in there i know and i'm saying it to family i know if i'm inviting them africans to my house don't cook no hot dogs in the hamburgers that's a culture a culture and nature is too difficult you're trying to make them welcome you're finding out those things is that right ah boy we going we gonna keep going i'm going to jump down i'll tell you what i'm i'm going to jump down to let's look at verse 7 verse 7. and the lord said unto satan whence cometh thou he says then answered the lord and said from going to throwing the earth and from walking up and down in it he says and the lord said unto satan has thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and a upright man see one that do what feared god and he's true evil now you want to drop down here to verse uh 16 he says uh no no i'm sorry verse 21 verse 21 he says and said naked came i out of my mother's womb and naked shall i do what returned the hitler the lord gave it and the lord what take it away blessed be the what so joe wasn't even looking at those things satan started accusing job but job was more concerned about his character job was more concerned about glorifying god job was more concerned that god get the praises and the honor and the glory is that right satan didn't have the revelation if you take that heads away from job well i just gave job to hate i gave job those things that's not what holding the heads up what's holding the heads up was the faith that job had in god's word they missed it that's what jesus said i pray that your faith not fail you he said peter the devil desired to do what shifts you but i prayed for you huh that's what i was saying we're still working with confidence in your prayers are you worrying about your child making it no no no no no no no no no no we are concerned as parents but we do not worry that's not a good we got a promise from god he said what you bind on earth you're divine in heaven what you loose on earth you should lose in heaven god has given us the holy ghost the holy ghost that he has given us when those are running and hiding and the wealthy people are looking for a place to hide from that atomic bomb you know what god has given us the holy ghost that's the only thing that's going to save them from the atomic bomb or any other chemical warfare is the baptism of the holy ghost because thou believe it if you believe it go tell go tell probably god said once you concern you become convinced then you'll go tell you'll be concerned about the condition of this lane we have many testimony testimony just dropped them from spirit think prayer don't work had a man coming in i felt his infirmity he was at the bible study in the jail and he and he looked and he wanted to go out he wasn't a jail person for whatever reason you've seen it when you go in there and up you can see the jail ones and you know that's what they call them convicts is that right cause they're convicts they will con you if you don't stay with the words so how do you try them you try them by the word when you try them by the word if they don't want the word then you leave them alone so you got to understand they came up to me when i entered the jail cell he said oh i was supposed to get out of here today and i didn't hear nothing from my lawyer and if i didn't hear nothing from him he said can you uh pray with me so he got there i felt his infirmities i moved in with his infirmities my god then i started praying with and we started praying and we sat down and when he sat down we got there and he about to have the bible to study and they called his name to go home and they called his name to go home now nothing i did is just us praying the fear of faith is that right we got to understand these things here now those people that's out there those protesters any y'all ever protest been out on the street protesting well i was a protester i was a protester i was out there on the street cause i believe a true protester believes what they're doing is right i'm not talking about the mixed multitude is that right like you got a mixed multitude you got twins and everything is that right you got a mixed multitude the the protesters are out there in the daytime they're standing there they're locking on all nationality sexist male and female they're walking and protesting and you know what and they're not ashamed of it we are protesting we are contending for the faith because i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ it's the power of god unto those that are saved but unto those that what that's why he says it's foolishness to one that one that don't believe in the cross is that right they're preaching they're crucifying the cross all over again because it's just an intellectual gospel that they're being preached on why because when we were there protesting i never was doing human humphrey time and they wanted to move the poor people over turned over to the caucasians neighborhood well we were protesting was why are you going to bust us over there just upgrade the schools you see so they didn't want to do that so now you have a right to protest why you talking about an unsaved man the devil is in all nationalities you better watch out for that spirit out there black lives saved that's god is not concerned about a specific race god is concerned about the human race god is the creator of all life [Applause] logic logic kennedy that's not what your country can do for you but ask what you can do for your country we are the government we're the people of god martin luther king i have a dream that's his dream he did some good humane things that was his dream huh my word was the golden rule is that right you want me they are only voting i'm not taking any god-given american right that's your god-given american right to vote but you as a believer we have been instructed by god to vote for a christian ah see so now he got to understand and it's out right now what god has called us to do is that right only when the only one probably got more sense and all of them is don king some of y'all know don king that prize fighter promoter you know don king he stand where they call electrify here he's the prize fighter promoted here in america now don king he's probably got more sense than all those they said don king what are you you're a democrat or you're a republican you know what donald king said lisa he said i'm a republic craft he said what is a republic crash he said who's ever making laws for my money that's who i'mma vote for he was honest hello yeah job had his sleep thing look look what he had joe was what patient i'ma have to jump a little bit for the sake of time he said now look he says he told me have not you heard of the patience of job see job not only who said job was also prophecy nothing was going to happen to job job was prophecy he had to fulfill over in james 5 11. have not you heard the patience of job look what the reason what he said so faith waits with patience for what for the promised word of god to be fulfilled that's the prayer of faith is that you don't believe you know it's going to happen in god's time he said look he says now we we we notice that all through all his affliction thou speakers he told me he said thou speak is like a foolish woman is that right thou gave and the lord take away blessed be the name of the lord he said now satan had had come up before god because he come before god and accuse what he always accuses us is that right but he said but look if you just let me look i'll make he said make him he says i'll make you curse him look what satan said now he said but you your face to your face he says i want you to notice that the confidence that god had in joke look at the confidence that god have in you it's not so much we got confidence in god it's the confidence that god has in you look what he says down now job 1 verse 21 22. he says and said nick it came my mother's room and shall i hither he said the lord gave it and the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord he says in all this job did what sin not nor did what charge god foolishly and then he said now job still let's look at this here oh boy god i'm looking for a place to pull over he said in other words god said said to satan like this you can't do it he's a what he's a justified man he's been called and chosen by me he has been charged called and chosen to glorify god you have been called and chosen you have been called by god by the word of god you were appointed by god god job was called to fulfill his god's prophecy in god's word musicians you can come on up please he said now look but job still held right on to there was no turning back see he says brother john came up and he said there's no turning back he had him to sing that song some maybe don't fully understand yet but god's going to show to you why brother steve saying and the lord have him shown when he had roof naoma and offer also went away and ruth went on to serve the god of naomi but you know in that song [Music] no turning back i have decided some of you know the

it's the will of god just leave it alone accept accepted and keep suffering but the reason why you go to the doctor because you're trying to get better and the reason why you're trying to get better
