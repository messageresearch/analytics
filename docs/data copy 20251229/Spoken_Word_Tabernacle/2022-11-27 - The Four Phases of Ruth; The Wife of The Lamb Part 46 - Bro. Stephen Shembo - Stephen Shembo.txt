God how many are up to date with the sermon let me see your hand okay praise be to the name of the Lord how many are they reading the Cod book one question a day okay glory to God remember our next house meeting will be on December the 17th and the same the there is three youth group the first one that started is the one picking up again so you know who you are just remember December 17th and also remember December 3rd Lord's willing we need to meet here probably an hour and 30 or two hours and just talk to whoever he's working in this church as an officer musician or whoever or if you want to come there and you're thinking about God you have a gift in your life for the Future Let's just come and talk a little bit and point out certain things amen everybody okay amen glory to God Amen let's go to our scripture this morning and we pick up where we stop Genesis chapter 1 verse 26. if you dare you can say Amen I trust that we have not lost to anyone amen with last Sunday's message so everybody is on board everybody's clear amen glory to God so we can build from there if you're there you can say a man amen amen we already talked about Adam In the Flesh now we went back up to the spirit amen because it's very easy to understand the difference in the flesh when they say it's a male and a woman no problem we know what it is but when we come up in the spirit then it's a different story go to see your big eagle amen God bless you Genesis 1 26. are you there and God saved who said God amen do you see that God plural wow do you see God with finesse but he's not alone amen God is singular amen glory to God God is singular it is not plural it's a different language amen amen and God said comma let water us how can a singular be us you might be seated so that God is Not singular as you think God Is Us and brother Branham say that he is plural amen even the very word the Elohim amen is plural but Elohim means the one who existed by himself how can be the one existing by himself be plural amen glory to God Amen he say let us make man in our water image so whoever is talking here want to make man that look like him everybody okay uh glory to God amen are you ready to chew grown up food now amen that's going to give you rupturing faith amen glory to God he said whoever is here the US decided to make man that look like us okay let's let's go this way This Is Us this is the god that is here this God Is Us okay now this God here decided to make something that looked like him everybody okay amen so in this way out of this God came up something that looked look like this one amen because this thing must be in the image of this and not only the image but even the likeness even the texture of it in other words when you touch this one and you touch this one you are confused tomorrow glory to God Amen Let us make man and this person here they call him man is man singular or plural no look at the way it's written singular singular was God plural no so this God here created man singular amen but we know when God was singular he was not really singular are we okay so if he created man singular this man cannot really be singular the Oneness of God is something different than our brain amen amen in our brain we learn in school one plus one equal two foreign let us make man in our image in our not in my image in hour so it's more than one person and in our likeness so there is no one God there there is one God but there is not one God I hope I can reach where I'm heading so you'll see who you are amen amen because that's the problem with the brother amen [Music] once you know who you are you don't have to copy somebody you will be satisfied the Way You Are if they tell you you the most handsome do you want to copy somebody else they say you're the most beautiful do you want to copy somebody else no which Beauty again are you gonna get if you the most oh Jesus [Music] glory to God Amen and let them so the man even though it's written singular he is them God even though he's singular He Is Us amen so the man is plural when you start touching things like this thank God I have the Bible because if I have if I didn't have the Bible I would have a hard time preaching this kind of stuff but you can't fight me because it's in the scripture because the message is perfectly in line with the scripture that's why you cannot fight the message when you're fighting the message you fighting the very scripture let them amen so whoever is this is in in here whoever is inside here is them everybody okay and the vamp that is here have some benefit everybody okay he said let them have water Dominion thank you my brother he's right on board dominion over the water fish of the sea so God give them Dominion Dominion offer the fishes of the sea what else my brother and over the south of the year the fowl of the air and what else my brother and over the cattle the cattle and what else over all the Earth and over all the Earth amen so whoever is here have a power over everything [Applause] everybody okay so make sure you adjusting them if you are in them so you are born with potential [Applause] amen your heart is not a problem whether you show it like this the problem is where did you come out amen if you come out from here even if you're alone to be the Run oh yeah and there is a big giant Lego Life you can fight him [Music] [Applause] how can a small boy like this fighting a giant what was in the boy what was that boy seeing [Applause] what did that boy know everybody okay so God singular created man singular in his singular are we okay on the image singular in the image singular of God singular created he singular him singular male and female plural [Applause] so whoever is inside we already went through this we're just picking it up so whoever is in this side here there is a male and a female they are together they are moving together if you take the female out this man is incomplete everybody okay if you don't understand this you will not understand what is coming up everybody okay if you take the mail out this man is incomplete everybody okay created he them so you can see it it's like a Oneness and then finally split up again and when you want to catch it it goes back to Oneness again because quickly you will begin Trinity then it goes back again and he hide again then you say yes it's one God then he comes up too you know beautiful the Lord your God is but the God Is Us that's why you need the prophet [Applause] verse 28 and God singular bless them and God said to them do what be fruitful do you have to worry about producing fruit no no no do you need a fertilizer on you no you see how we're wasting our time in prayer he said Lord please send some fertilizer for what [Applause] [Music] do you know that Jacob was already blessed by Isaac you know that right Isaac bless him thinking that it was Esau right when he met the angel of the Lord he was asking for what else again for blessing which blessing did you see the angel blessing him again and saying oh Jacob I'm blessing you the second time do you see the angel blessing him the angel just changed his name [Applause] amen [Laughter] Oh Glory to God he said be fruitful and do what multiply and do what so who's responsible to replenish the Earth man this man they're telling him to be fruitful be fruitful and what else my brother multiply and multiply and what else replenish the Earth and what else do it I'm reading just the Bible and subdue it and what else have dominion over you know I have water Dominion off the over the water fish in the Thousand Years everybody okay so we back up here so we got one two three four this include everything five six seven eight amen he said have dominion over the future of the sea and over the fall of the air and of every living thing that moves upon the Water that's man in Genesis 1. Genesis 1 26-28 this is man we okay we okay so this man moved from Genesis 1 to Genesis 2. amen he moved to Genesis 2 7. amen and when he moved to Genesis 2 7 he appeared to be alone he appeared to be singular everybody okay and God said he's singular let me pull his brother out but to pull his Brad God goes in here not outside in here and take the blood from there and pull it so this man was not really singular he was also double in the body the body of Eve was inside of Adam is that complicated so in the body he was also that's why he's x y that's easy amen let's go to Genesis 5. we need to know his name amen glory to God Genesis 5 verse 1. it's a nice day the rain stopped here it's cold it's Sunday we don't have two services so let's relax amen so this is the book of the generations of who Adam where did that name come from in the day that God created hook man singular in the likeness of who God singular made his singular him singular again God open up again he said verse 2 male and female created he them plural and bless them plural and call Dare plural name water Adam so now we're not just talking about men men we're talking about Adam So Adam is not the man Adam is man and woman this woman her name is Adam this man his name is Adam because when we say Adam and Eve then we got confused no no no no no no no the original name that God gave to Eve was not ease the name that came from God was Adam so you have two two ways to accept if you want the call if you want to be called Eve or you want to be called Adam depending on what you want but Eve has trouble it means you can birth anything is the mother of everything so do you want to be called Eve are we okay now they say and he called their name Adam in the day when they were water created let's go to Jeremiah these staff are stuff that we cannot Rush with them yeah brother Branham even says in one place in the adoption he said this kind of sermon are not Evangelistic where we run quickly disposition you open your eyes change your thinking and make you know who you are and you begin to behave differently that's right without any sensation when you really get it that's when the sensation comes the sensation come after you get it Jeremiah 1. verse 4. glory to God amen this man is a spirit we all know this and this man is in the body he's human he's natural amen amen glory to God so before if you meet Adam and you talk to him you really have not seen Adam you are looking at the house or the shell or the envelope or the car that Adam is using but Adam is really inside there amen that's why Paul said if this Tabernacle we have water so we just flip cars amen that's why brother Branham said death is a vehicle you're just switching car and they show you a different Highway everybody Okay we okay so this man is an envelope he said to him that's where this man is Jeremiah 1 verse 4 if you dare you can say amen amen the word of the who Lord so who's speaking the Lord the word of the Lord came to me Jeremiah saying God come to talk to Jeremiah what is God trying to tell Jeremiah amen God said before I form you in the belly added water why is this important to Jeremiah why is it important why [Applause] God is saying Jeremiah before Genesis 2 7 . we okay me and you were in Genesis 1 26. you are already in Genesis 2 7. it's a problem but to help your problem I need to take you from Genesis 2 7. because in Genesis 2 7 there is nothing pretty much new the blessing the Dominion were given in Genesis 1 26. so if you don't know what happened in Genesis 1 26 you will not understand how you need to behave in Genesis 2 7. so I watch you Jeremiah you kinda shy you have a complex yeah when the visitor come you run away I saw you since your childhood let's see who you are he said before I formed you before Genesis 2 7. in the belly I know you in other words where there was no Genesis 2 7. you already was there so let's take Genesis 2 7 a little bit out let me talk to you about what happened in Genesis 1 26. because Genesis 2 7 have a lot of headache foreign he's sleepy he don't want to go to church he found a reason to escape church or another headache amen so let's talk a little B he did that to job job complaint complain he said [Music] um let's go a little bit back there come on come on get on the airplane then he took job he said look who he where were you [Music] we okay are you getting the message your glory to God he said before I formed you in the belly I know you before you come out of the water before what you call your birthday before your birthday that you celebrate every year you keep that all the time my birthday my birthday my birthday they didn't give me a gift you get upset ah and you give so much attention to that but before that [Applause] in other words don't get caught up with that there is something more about you than when you started in this earth you coming from somewhere he said before you come out of the womb I did water Sanctified thee so when did God started to work with Jeremiah Foundation of yours Amen in the in your mother's womb what can you do can you pray [Music] I did water in other words are consecrated you I took you and I set you aside that happened not in your mother's womb before Genesis 7 before your birthday and before your conception because somebody will say no so I was born when my mother got pregnant okay God said before that pregnancy that's right somebody said no I was born the day he said no no before you were born so God is killing both of them the pregnancy and the day you came out because somebody said no no you can be there pregnant but you can be still born so you were not dead so God eliminate both of them that's right amen amen because the way the day our mother got pregnant nobody really knows that's why we don't touch that that's why we stay away we only remember when you came out from the hospital that's all we know but God is eliminating both amen he said I sanctify you I did water ordained I ordain you to be a water Prophet to the water so the uh the prophetic office is it in Genesis 2 7 or is it in Genesis 1 26. are you following me are you following me amen so be so so your prophetic office have nothing to do with when your mother got pregnant he has nothing to do when you were born in a hospital you're not the word even if you are not physically alive yeah amen you are still a prophet amen that's why when Samuel died you remember now when they brought him by the witch of Endor he cannot be nothing else but a prophet because that Prophet started before that's why he can come out from that Dimension and still prophesy in other words you can never take away what was put in Genesis 1 26. now amen this lecture is taking longer than I thought amen job 2 verse 6. then say the ah who spit who's saying Jeremiah glory Lord God how can they give you such a news and you saying ah instead of saying glory to God Jeremiah Say ah what is wrong with this boy am I reading a different Bible what is wrong with this boy he says Ah Lord God behold I cannot water number one for I am a water a child I'm in Genesis too wow everybody okay God is talking to him about Genesis 1 26. to make him know who he is but Jeremiah is so caught up in Genesis 2 7 that he sees his inability I am a child I don't even know how to speak I cannot stand in front of the pulpit like brother Stephen and talk I can't do it everybody okay job that's why I told you it doesn't depend on how big you are if heavy set or skinny or that doesn't have anything to do because that's where your trouble is I cannot speak for I Am a Child do you think when he get adult he get in a stage where he's an adult I saw a daughter that don't want to stand here verse 7 but the Lord said to me are we reading the same thing yes are we are we reading the same thing God is revealing to us to Jeremiah something and Jeremiah is dropping down into a different level God is telling Moses he said Moses you come you need to go to Egypt Moses come up with Genesis 2 7. he said wait a minute I don't know how to speak matter of fact I have a trouble speaking come on now yes sir awesome look at God what he's talking this man with complex because maybe his father didn't have a lot of money God is saying but the Lord said to me say not I am a water in other words you need to stop that kind of language [Applause] if me God I'm talking to you don't you think I know you're a child don't you think I know you already have a problem with your speech so you think I'm wasting my time or I didn't calculate my equation pretty good in other words you are telling God you are making a wrong choice I am not the one to do something so God made a mistake you know better than God did you on the same thing the same army men of value he said who's my number so God is also the Bible said let every man's word be what and God's word be water so who's saying the truth God Our Truth we want to even prove it but God is calling that a lie because it doesn't reflect what God is looking at that's why Abraham was calling everything that is contrary to what they show him like he doesn't exist if God say hey you say B Abraham say B doesn't exist [Applause] Ence God say say not I am a child I want you to change that confession say not I am a child for you shall go to all that I shall water you need to break that complex out of you I know what I put there amen and whosoever I commend you you shall Watters be whatsoever I tell you to speak speak I didn't tell you to say my name is brother Stephen no that's why a prophet were coming and saying da safety he doesn't worry about you we okay verse uh eight be not afraid of the water faces Genesis 2 7 when they begin to fraud at you like this keep preaching harder when they are rolling their eyes go ahead and hit it pretty hard [Applause] it's intimidation [Applause] when they start building attitude go ahead that's even the right opportunity for you to to remember who you are and you say God bless you good to see you but I need to tell you you need to change [Applause] [Music] right here we have a whole message be not afraid of their faces for I am with you to do water delivery say the Lord then the Lord put forth his hand and touch my water mouth why mouth and the Lord said to me behold I have put my water in your mouth see I have I have this day set you over the Nations and over the water kingdoms to do what you are rooting out by what by Genesis one two seven what are you using as a tool everybody okay you need to root out Karma and to do what and to do water and to the water and to do what are you there my brother to build and to do what so Jeremiah can just stand and by his word he can do all of this [Applause] just by his word what kind of power is this everybody okay moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying Jeremiah what do you see do you remember this do you remember this do you remember this do you remember this right so when a road have already batted with almond tree it means that the prophet need to do what everybody okay why do you see a road with an almond tree that's what happened to Aaron's Road amen when the spoken word is given to the prophet a road appeared with almond trees amen verse 12 and then say the Lord to me you have where for I will do whatever do you know what he means Houston I will watch over My Water World to do water [Music] so when Jeremiah speak who's speaking let's go to Ephesian father we seen Jeremiah in Genesis 1. and Jeremiah in Genesis 2 Genesis 1 have nothing to do with your conception have nothing to do with your birth that's Genesis 2. but God is telling Jeremiah before you existed before Genesis 2 that's why David says this in Psalm 139 he said for thou has possessed my reign that has covered me in my mother's water I will praise thee Why Do You Want To Praise Him David for I am fearfully and wonderfully water May marvelous are that what works and that my head before one need to know that my soul why your soul need to know that Jeremiah I want you to understand something I want your soul to grasp something that before you were even formed I was there and David is saying that that my soul not Mom head because they had one produce anything the soul is where the heart is he said that my son know that how that's why you see David attacking Goliath everybody okay he said Mass substance what you call that baby was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrote in the lowest part of the Earth than eyes did see my water substance yet being water I was just an egg fertilized and in that water book that book is the it's another name for the Book of Life if you need a question you tell me I can give you the scripture he said in that book all my members were what so in the Book of Life amen your height was written there the size of your leg was in it your finger was in The Book of Life that's why God is telling Jeremiah that I already knew you [Music] what happened in your mother's womb is just uh they start making copy I have the original everybody okay he said all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was water when I didn't even exist in my mother's womb my mother was not even married yet you were there he said ah precious oh that water and water so what kind of thought that God do God have towards you who taught you God have evil thought you adapt pressure how precious are that thought unto me oh God how great is the water so the conclusion of your life is good [Applause] he said if I should can't then they touch they are more in number than the water when I awake I'm still with water [Music] let's go to Ephesians 5 and then we pray my God almost 30 minutes God Ephesians 5 verse 23. Hallelujah if you dare you can say amen amen already Paul says for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church the second Adam and he is the savior of the body

married who is the Lamb John the Baptist was baptizing one day and he said beholder land and he was pointing to her so the Lamb of God who is Jesus must be buried so he is not married yet he's still single everybody okay the lamb must be married the Bible said for the marriage of the Lamb is come so before there was no marriage and his water so the lamb has a wife everybody okay that's a lamb but marry a lion but marry a chicken that's a lamb marry a goat if the if the lamb if the husband is a lamb what do you think the wife must be [Applause] the lamb has a wife do we know the name of the wife not yet keep it so the wife must be a lamb or a you a female Lambert everybody okay he said and his wife has made herself water ready we know you ready by the second oil you remember the Bible said those that were already went into the marriage what made them ready was the second one not the first one in Revelation 21 verse 9 the Bible said they came unto me one unto me one of the Seven Angels you know this Angel we talk about it in a hotel it's a whole sermon one of the Seven Angels which have the seventh vow the angel that work with brother brother full of seven last water plagues and talk with me saying come here I will show you did the bride who is the water so the Lambs have a wife let's clear that one up and the wife of the Lamb they call him they call her also the bride pure scripture there is nothing to argue there everybody okay the lamb has a wife and the wife of the Lamb is called the bride everybody okay so we can see right here that Redemption is always connected to marriage [Applause] everybody okay you cannot have Redemption without marriage everybody okay the story of redemption is always coupled with marriage What is marriage now you took me to a different Avenue that I was not prepared what is really marriage What is marriage marriage is what we found out that in the Garden of Eden God created Adam and Adam in his sad he was male and female amen then God moved from Genesis 1 into Genesis chapter 2 and took this Adam here and put him in the flesh amen and In the Flesh Adam was X Y again that was Genesis 2. amen God Adam here in the flesh was alone everybody okay there was no marriage here everybody okay so God said I'm gonna make Adam a help mate that looks just like him everybody okay so God went and get inside this Adam here everybody okay and God performed a surgery and open the door everybody okay God enter inside Adam you following me and took another Adam I don't want to say if that's where we get confused God kept in Adam and took Adam out of Adam everybody okay everybody okay and God pulled one Adam out amen and when God pulled that out about he closed the flesh now the situation is Adam and Adam there is Adam one and Adam too right everybody okay Adam one was a male and Adam too was a female everybody okay still at this point there is no marriage are we following me now what is marriage since Adam too you following me was taken out from her original position amen God needed to take what belongs to Adam and to take it back again to Adam I don't know if you're following me God went to Adam and took a reap out of Adam God went with the rib and sat down and begin to work with the weave and Hope somebody came out God said but this is Adam this doesn't belong to me God this belong to who so God take Eve and say let's go back where you belong everybody okay everybody okay they're bringing back of Eve to her original position that is what marriage is all about did you follow me [Applause] if I lost you raise your hand so marriage is taking Eve back where she belongs [Applause] everybody okay when they take Eve back to Adam and God joined them together that is what marriage is [Applause] so marriage is redemption [Applause] because brother Branham said Redemption means take something back to its original water assistant do you follow me so if you have a true revelation of marriage the woman that you get married to the woman that you make suffer [Applause] then you the woman that you are playing came with is nothing else but you yourself [Applause] the woman that you are beating down come on you're breathing yourself that's why Paul said how can you play with your own body you need to nourish your body and cherish it because it's your body so that woman that you see there it is your rib when you are beating hell you bid in your River [Applause] so what happened is when you and her was born God split you he took you and put you in this I didn't prepare this but somebody may be needed God took you and put you in this family and God took you and put you in that family but that is both of you have one name [Applause] do you follow me I wish I can preach this in a marriage day everybody okay both of you are one person so there were many men many boys that came to you and nothing in your heart click them because you didn't belong to them I'm talking about a true marriage you didn't belong to them they can do everything they can have all kind of potential but even though they're good let me help you up again they can even have the Holy Ghost [Music] they have the Holy Ghost but still something in you say nothing but one day let that guy pass when he talks to you it goes beyond your head [Applause] he looks like he looks like all decorator and when a boy came the first time you were like check check check check check check no didn't pass next no no no but the day that man will come when you are talking to him you won't realize that the pepper is already dropped on the floor and when they ask you they say did you check he has the Holy Ghost you don't even remember checking the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] are pulling one another why do you love him I don't know but this boy is more better than him that's true but there is something about this one [Applause] that one is a marriage that can never be broken it's a marriage the standard from eternity [Applause] talk to sister you're gonna hear a whole lot of story like the day he talked to me I said what does boom means what did he tell you that did boom what did he tell you that did boom God means what he didn't say I love you but the Boom is greater than any reasoning and that boom is whenever her death come in a marriage that boom is the one that come out and stabilize everything [Applause] it is the absolute it is the absolute the final reference point well no matter how hard the marriage get if you can point that boom where it is all right Hallelujah [Applause] everybody okay so marriage is always the story of redemption that's why throughout the entire Bible you will see it's about marriage marriage marriage marriage marriage that's why the first miracle of Jesus happened where why in the marriage he was telling us that Redemption has come and Redemption is always connected to marriage so when they brought Jesus in marriage Jesus could not contain because this is very Redemption no no no please What is marriage I gotta get married I want to get married do you understand marriage I even talked to somebody yesterday I said we got a problem in the message [Music] people married they don't even know why they marry we just marry by copy or we marry by Instinct like animals because you feel an urge because you are burning and you want somebody to soothe your burning I'm sorry I'm talking to my church okay okay that's not the reason why you married because when you get seven the things you get different what are you gonna do but that boom of the manga it takes the sweeter it becomes everybody okay whether there is no food or not you can't wait to see that person it's a different story altogether [Applause] you can never point the the the the the origin of your marriage to something the devil will destroy it if it was Beauty what are you gonna do once again wait what are you gonna do with your beauty you're gonna make your wife suffer to the gym to please you so that she can have the shape that you originally loving that is not marriage you want her to work out you can work out too and go back to your original shape that even the ship changed it doesn't matter it is not Genesis 2 it is Genesis one it is the one who is inside that person never get old that person leaves eternally as your Eternal mate we can leave this body but in eternity we will hold together that is marriage so young people rephrase we look again why you want to get married [Music] [Applause] Paul said it is better to marry than to burn yes but Paul say You must love your wife as Christ you're when you're burning do you already have crust all right do you all have you have questions no let's take it together yes you burning but you must have crushed if you show me questions oh I don't have any problem go ahead and move because I know the way you're going to love your wife what are you gonna do I can enter many domain right now but I cannot [Applause] what are you gonna do if she's sick you know what I'm talking about what are you gonna do if she gets sick for two months [Music] what you gonna do what you gonna do [Music] for the weather so they better for the word so okay the worst game let's see the words to what you're gonna do [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign I already disclosed to you the definition of marriage Merit is always connected with Redemption you cannot have Redemption with our marriage that's why the book of roof is a very special book [Applause] because the Book of Ruth is not talking about just Redemption but that Redemption is Kappa with a marriage good evening that's why brother Branham says this he said Redemption is a beautiful story beautiful story of redemption a beautiful little story coming to my man a book that is water sure in the Bible and give her the very water of Water that is the book of water many people just pass over that book but it's the most because it's marriage and Redemption put together [Applause] it is the very mind of God brother Branham says this he said this story was written and all other all the old manuscript when they were segregating the Bible the holy man when they were trying to put it together in the Old Testament this book of water was one of the most water outstanding books that they did what why if it's just a love story why would the rather and the ancient Sage accept this book as water because there is a water and in this hidden revelation when you catch the water he will do water Paul said it is a great mystery so if you catch the very mystery of the Book of Ruth is a mystery of redemption and marriage and marriage bring us back in Genesis chapter 1 and chapter 2. [Applause] the wife of the Lamb we okay now now we found out this god brother Branham say look at how God planned that God is the male part that brought who Jesus Jesus here now God is a spirit so there could not be any sex remember in Christ there couldn't be any such or desire because if he was then Jesus was not born a virgin birth everybody okay now we found out that when God brought up Jesus Christ brother Branham says this about Jesus Christ I'm repeating this quote about him said but remember he went there with you in uh with you in him see God had never separated the bread from the water [Applause] so now we are working backward s where have I put it we are working now backwards underneath thank you so over here we started with Genesis 1 26 then Genesis 1 26 moved to Genesis 2 7. now brother Branham is starting with Genesis 2 7 of not Adam but the second Adam who is the Lord Jesus Christ because he also have a name and he is the second honor everybody okay and brother Branham is talking to us about the Genesis 2 7 of Jesus according to brother Branham the Genesis 2 7 of Jesus all the physical body of Jesus is how we found out that the physical body of Adam had even son So Adam was man and water female great let's see the physical body of Jesus Christ as we're building back up the wife of the Lamb you need to know where who's your wife where was your wife then you know how to handle her the Bible says uh brother Branham saying so when God looked down upon the Water Body of Christ he saw above water male and female fight me on it so according to brother pranam the body of Jesus Christ I have to go slowly with this my friend Jesus also was water and water why because Jesus is the last Adam so he must be exactly like Adam we okay male and female over there everybody will accept the problem is right here this is where I get people to take off leave the car out to run on the highway and everything everybody okay he says so when God looked down the body of Christ he saw above mail and water female he was our redeeming that water it's a combo a package they are same water same word spoke of water speak of water what does he mean God bless them and he taught them do what have a death yes [Applause] watch to the bride to the groom is the same word that was applied to who so there is no distinction [Applause] I'm trying to get you somewhere buddy [Applause] this blessing was not given to the man the Bible said bless them so the blessing that goes to Adam was the same blessing that was going to ease that's why God called both of them item there is no distraction what speak of the Bride of the groom speak the same for the water because the two are what is he complicated my fellow glory to God everybody okay everybody okay now we found out that when Adam was created in this uh body here Adam spent some time alone alone in nature but not in the body everybody okay so after spending a Ministry a time of a Ministry and in that Ministry God was creating the animal bringing them to Adam and Adam was giving name so Adam has a Ministry before Eve came out [Applause] if I lost you raise your hand if I lost you raise your hand I cannot it's like a teacher I cannot continue with a class and somebody's struggling he will not get everything that come out somebody say he's lost open Genesis 1. Genesis 2. please that's why I want Sunday when you relax you want you coming out of sleep and your blood is flowing through the head that's what brother brought them say I have a quote if you got a problem of blood flowing in the head I have a coat everybody okay let's go to uh Genesis uh Genesis 2. are you there yes sir verse 15. are you there and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to the water was if there 16 and the Lord God commanded the men saying of every tree of the garden may you freely water he was if there but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat thereof you shall water surely die was if there for proof Verse 18 and the Lord God said it is not good for men to be what so there was a time Adam have even the word of God Alone [Music] let's drop down verse 19 and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field every file of the air and brought them to her Adam to see what he would do after and whatsoever Adam call every living creature that was the water and Adam gave them to all Carter to our foul of the air to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not water so there was a time that Adam having Ministry himself without ease and in that Ministry what Adam was giving the name God could not contradict him [Music] in other words he was a Ministry where Adam had the mind of God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] are you following me let's go to James chapter 3. brother Kelly it is ship is navigating with autopilot it's moving in a different direction autopilot so he knows better he already checked the weather he knows what to which direction to take amen let's go to General to James chapter three if you dare you can say Amen you there you there if you notice God gave adam the power of everything that was upon the Earth and God showed us through Jeremiah that that power is given by the Tongue by the time you can rule out you can destroy you can plant you can change everything So Adam was not there going to a mountain and go Mountain that was not what Adam was doing Adam was using a member let's see when Adam fell what did he really lose [Music] we okay we okay let's go to James three if you dare you can say Amen verse 5 watch this even saw the tongue is a little water remember and boast water great things why is a little member talking great things amen he was created he was what he have a software there is a software of a town to speak great things it depends on how you hook it it depends on the source you hook it in it's a software everybody okay and then he says that it's a tongue uh verse five behold how great a little who are great the mother a little water fire Kindles and the tongue you there is a water fire a world of water it's a whole world so the world exists in the tongue okay let's continue so is the tongue among our members that he defiled the whole water body and set on fire at the water horse of nature it doesn't means that you're taking your tongue and you pulling up like a mattress and you go burn nature Adam was controlling Nature by water Jeremiah have to root and Destroy and to do and to plan by what so the tongue can change your life he can change the whole course of your life are you okay that's why God told Jeremiah stop saying I'm a child ah you need to change that way what I tell you to say just say it the way I told you everybody okay Hallelujah let's go down now it sets and it is set on fire of water hell because of the Fall watch verse seven for every kind of water please remember Genesis comma and every kind of water lord remember Genesis comma and everyone and of water remember Genesis and everything that is in the water is water and has been watered of water mankind so even after the fall men managed to control everything that God gave him under but not with the tongue now everybody okay job to verse 8. but the water can no man water it is an unruly water for it's a full of deadly water so it shows here that at the beginning God gave men dominion over everything and that Dominion was based on the power of the tongue so when man fell he lost the power of the spoken word [Music] we okay now now man begin to rely on the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil in order to take animal shoot them kill them threaten them put them in the zoo shoot them with something that make them sleep and capture them and put them in the zoo he's operating in in a way after the fall but truly he didn't have to do that why because man realized that he can control animals he can still control the bird he can control nature he can come to Gastonia destroy a whole mountain and make it a plan he can do that and put a I mean uh I mean a dynamite and blow the entire mountain and change he can still control nature but he found out he lacked the control of the tongue because that is divine everybody okay everybody okay so when Jesus Christ came when after Adam spent that time of a personal Ministry are you following me he came a time where God have to put that Adam to sleep we okay now when he put that Adam to sleep God went inside that Adam and pull another Adam and made two Adams now we have Adam and Adam Adam and we found in the body of Jesus Christ also he was what male and female and after three and a half years of a personal Ministry of Jesus Christ where Jesus spoke to the wind he was alone Jesus multiplied bread Jesus did this did this did this did this after his personal Ministry or with the word of God because he was the word made flesh they have to come a time they have to put also Jesus to sleep just like Adam and when they put him to sleep out of his sight they have to pull the yeah everybody okay [Applause] brother Branham is the bride of Christ and the body of Christ the same the answer is what yes sir your wife is your own body we just went through that because you are the head brother Branham said now see I don't want to get started on it because I can preach a sermon on me but I won't do that but I want to show you when God gave adam his word from his side he said she is now and go and water and when God gave Christ his water right the spirit gave the flesh there right he did water indeed what in his sad and water and blood and Spirit came forth that become water and water we are the Flesh of his father the bread will be the Flesh and death of who Christ exactly [Applause] that is his bride if was the Flesh of Adam and the blood of Adam so we got a second Adam here who was male and female after his ministry they pierce him what do you think come out of it water everybody okay this problem is easy if Adam was male and female here this is not bad coincidence we okay now Adam is male and female because Adam one in Genesis 1 was already mere and female he was only a replica the wife of the Lamb if Jesus Christ in the body was male and female this must be a replica of this guy [Applause] oh my God that's right amen Jesus cannot be male and female in the body if he was not male and female in the spirit [Applause] Adam cannot be Adam male and female if he was not male and female so right here we can see that Jesus also when you take him to Genesis 1 26. you're following me this Jesus here must be also water that's why when he created man in his own image in his own likeness man was water because he himself is what any question any question where are you trying to get me now this is where we were brother Branham said God in the beginning when he knowed men and women was made water one not two they were made one they were separated one put in the flesh and one inner to your father so in order to prove that to you when God made the woman he never took some dust and made her like he did the man he took a what out of the side of Adam she became a byproduct of a man because she's part of a man this is where we got a trouble these are the angels and God and the spirit that is John with who is water are we okay read me that quote again my brother and God right here and God and the spirit that is John 2 God both of them are water once your amen went down God and the spirit that is joined join means what Revelations say the lamb have a wife she's called the brother so their wife must come from the lamb and that wife must be exactly like the lamb but the wife of Adam came from water the spirit of God that was in the water the church which is the bread is the spirit that comes from water Heaven that God knew before the water off the water of the world that rejected water the devil's life I'm gonna erase the top here let me erase the top here let me put it here follow me carefully because this will change you amen this is God and we know God Is Us we understand here that there was a God as here who created man in his own image and his own likeness and this man was man and water and this man was put in the flesh and this man also came in the flesh when he came in the flesh he became the Lord Jesus Christ amen which is the second Adam the first Adam the second Adam the first Adam was also male and female in the body and he was also male and female in the water why because he created man in his own and in his non-lagness everybody okay [Applause] this man when he created Adam he was in the beginning everybody okay let's go before the beginning we okay yeah before the beginning you follow me there was somebody here that was alone this man was called Elohim he is what they called the father and this man is God and this man is invisible we went through some of a lot of this everybody okay everybody okay what was with this man the wife of the name brother Branham said now watch carefully now and see before there was ever a speck of stars before God was what God in Genesis they call him water before God was God God is an object of adoration and no one was there to do what worship him so he was at that time only potentially what God okay hey everybody okay he was known only as Eternal water spirit everybody okay right here is just that spirit that existed on its own when we look at this we say there is one person I'm going with you now back up brother Branham say he know he was known only as eternal spirit Karma the bride was already in his water foreign so even before the beginning [Applause] I'm going slowly now everybody okay even before the beginning God was not alone that this man this Elohim this father here has already a brad in him and the Bible said the bread is the wife of the Lamb are we okay so this man even from eternity was male and female [Applause] I hope God help you catch it brother Branham said yes she was she was existing in his water thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are how Eternal I did not the Eternal water thoughts of God so this woman in the body of Jesus Christ never has a beginning [Applause] [Music] amen [Music] do you understand what I'm saying do you can you take a a a lamb and a fish and make them together no because they are under different water categories okay can you take a human an animal and mate them together they're under different water categories and can you take a God and human and marry them together because they are in in in what categories so if you want to marry God you must find a wife that is how the wife of God must be working [Applause] the wife of God must be God [Applause] oh God I hope you're really sucking all right brother Brian I'm saying don't start that what Eternal let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you will see water many things what are the many things if you can understand here that this woman here is also eternal you will understand many things [Applause] the problem you are here [Music] when I'm talking to you right now your body is giving you problem the body is making some sleepy some are trying to go out some are all of that is your body because your body doesn't like this this kind of preaching your body doesn't like it nervous he said if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both water and water [Music] brother Branham continue he said he has never had the new thought about anything because all he thought he has always had [Music] and always will water and knows the end from what the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are how Eternal and they are what real these thoughts that we're talking about are not like things floating in the air no sir no they are more real than this because these things were created from invisible brother Branham said they are not simply like man with a blueprint he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into a water so it's not a mental stuff that God have like mental thought going on no those thoughts are real each thought that can move I don't know if you get me those thoughts can work the Bible says in the Book of Genesis that the voice of God was walking did you ever see the voice walking everybody okay but they are already real and they are what Eternal as part of what God see how this works amen amen so if you pull those thoughts from God do you have god with you let's continue this who are of the royal seed are the elect of God are they predestinated for known of God and where in the mind of God and his water in very plain language to be blunt with you the True Blood of Christ was in the mind of God how [Music] what are you trying to say pastor let me make it now easier for you you okay God let me remove this this is the beginning let me raise this like this let me put it clear amen this God was invisible he created something that is visible we went through that he Murphy kenosis and everything are you following me this God here the brother Branham said he has a brother but we could not see this God here anybody here is that this God do you follow me this bread here has a mate I don't know if you following me let me go slowly this is no man you follow me it's sad man there is air and a water is sad this man his name is what Elohim he's sad Elohim there were two persons [Music] are you following me if one of them was the bride the other one must be a groom everybody okay this groom here is what they call the s-o-n right yeah the Sun are you following me are you following me so God give birth to himself are you following me do you follow me this groom here came out when he came out amen he came out and became this This Witch is called the logos and it is called the son because he comes from there the father that's why they call it the son of God but this son is not sung the way you understand open Isaiah 9. [Applause] uh God help me open I said let's go I'm trying to rush now Isaiah 9 if you dare you can say Amen verse 6. you there unto us a water a child is born and to us a water a water everybody okay do you see the board a s-o-n is born okay the way you look you the way you think you have brother Charles Hamilton and you hear Brother Charles Turner right right that's the way you think but let's see the way it works indeed this sun here is given six and the government shall be upon his water and his name the name of the son not the name of the one who gave him birth the son his name his name shall be called what my friend the Mighty God Karma and water and the mighty water stop God of who the son is not just son he's God not only God he's mad the god let me make it worst for you his mighty God Kama the Everlasting water in other words the father that doesn't have a beginning that's a heavy end they all Eternal Father that father he is the son another one this man when he created this person this man disappeared this man became this man [Applause] are you following me are you following me so if in here there was a Brad and the groom what do you think will come up here again we okay now so right here there is something like this everybody okay this part here is called the groom amen and this part here is called the bread amen so the father is right here amen open Roman 1. let's navigate this quickly I have to stop somewhere if you dare you can say Amen glory to God Romans 1 verse 6. brother Angelo we're gonna I'm gonna read it first then you read it back among whom are

I have said yeah what church and all of you are what so the children of God are who so the children of God are what is making the blood of Jesus Christ so the blood of Jesus Christ is who in very plain language let's copy the True Blood of Christ was in the mind of God how eternally do not express until each came forth in the designation decreases and as each member came forth it became Express and took in place in the water body thus this bread is the meter water spoken word seed water right and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the water the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was water in came from the water was eternal with him and he's now manifesting God in how many members everybody whereas once God was manifested in water one member even our Lord water Jesus Christ God in one person is Jesus Christ but God in the female version is the blood of Jesus Christ [Applause] everybody okay let's stop there brother Branham said let me skip this it's gone amen so plainly that they predestinated is the only one that is considering water yeah did you get it let me say that again they predestinated is the only one that is considered in water they are the only one that will consider in marriage because Redemption and marriage goes together so marriage is further predestinated Oh my he said people might be making like things they are but the real Redemption is those that are water because the very word redeem means water to redeem something is to bring it back to water Hallelujah so it is the only will be brought back because they are they didn't that's why we call him our father everybody okay everybody okay the bible say that when the Gentile heard this they were water and glorified the word of the Lord as many as were white to water they did water that's why you believe in this message everybody okay let's finish with this thought let's finish with this thought the Bible said no man has seen who God in at any time the only water began soon how many begotten are they one how many one the only begotten of uh son which is in the water of his father in the bosom of the father he has done water declared him so Jesus was in way in the bosom of the father if Jesus had a wife where was his wife can I continue you are the water of who wash in the blood of who Christ precious and water water some of God standing with a water an adulterated water die he was what by the water of his son that became water and water that he may take you which way in the water after before the water the same as him he wants the great attribute of God cow water love everybody okay Wonder could it be already passed could the bride already be called is that where we are going through today she has to be molded and made in the image of war and Christ is the water that is the only thing it is in there in the Water World there cannot be one thing added it can be a woman with one hand like a man and the other hand like a pal like a donkey like like with a power like a dog it's got to be exactly the water word of the Lord like he is the word the bride is part of water the woman is part of what the husband because she's taken out of her the husband if was part of water from his water and so is who not taken from water but taken from there for water [Music] so the bread is taken from the bosom of the message of this hour [Applause] if he is the word the bread must be water [Applause] what happened in the prefigure now he opened the saddle father and took part of his water flesh which was water to make water and the bread has to be the water for he is what the word she cannot stand water she cannot stand on water she cannot stand on water she has to stand alone on water because she is taken from who Christ we are the word of God Amen We are the world made flesh let's stand buddy [Applause] the wife of the Lamb the wife of the Lamb the wife of the Lamb they'll have the wife of the Lamb is the lamb in female version amen maybe down the road we will touch on the glory [Music] I can't get to that my time is gone and you will see what is the glory of the Bride amen the devil don't want you to understand this but God told Jeremiah before you were formed before you are born whatever you are today before you are what you are this morning in this church his message this morning is he know you not like this he knew you before and you and him work together that's why we are the Tree of Life that's why wisdom is a woman that's why there is a woman a wisdom that created the world that's why the tree of life is male and female everything yes sir so God is telling you forgot about what you are now what you are has been given to you to make contact to this world you live and love it so much what you don't understand is if your life is taken off today what you see here will be in the grave that's not true that person is not true God is telling you that before you are what you are now I'm pulling you now out of here and I'm showing you where we are Where We Are me and you we are the same thing [Applause] so when I am not there you go physically you are representing me [Applause] your signature in my check will pass exactly as I am the one who sang that's why he taught the church whatever you bound here what do I do over there did he say I will argue with you what you're burning if you judge it and you say bound I Know Who You Are not the quality you are if you Dim something to be bounded I don't have to question Adam when Adam is giving the name that is exactly me it is me giving the name [Music] let's leave this man let's begin to think in Genesis 1. because that's where the blessings of God are and the more you in tune you give preeminence to this man you will find out that that's why Jesus said men Shall Not Be Live by what by every to show somebody that this one if he's corrected I can bring you through the wilderness you are worrying about the irrigation in the wilderness no if you stay in tune with me here I will create bread I will create water from a plenty Rock I will do miracle but this one wants you to go the easy route where everything is flourishing this one doesn't care which is where it's going if it's a Wilderness he changed the wilderness how was this church when we bought it look at this church today somebody got the power of transformation when you saw this church when we came here did you have this in mind this was already in the plan of God now we're just catching up we even put too large speaker here but that was not in the mind of God the man of God has this [Applause] you don't suppress God [Music] you are more than what you think you are the wife of Jesus Christ I have many courts and plenty stuff I can get to it let's pray Heavenly Father Lord once again we are approaching you this afternoon father thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy Lord and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for opening this word to us that now we begin to understand why you could give us Direction Even in our prayer that when we pray we should say our father because your father is our father and you even told us that one day we will understand that are the father in you and me in you until we come to a wrong conclusion that all of us were just one you just came before us to pay the price [Music] and to make a preparation knowing that down the road the precious bride will be coming but now have come the time of the marriage that we must find the bread that is mature abroad that is at your level a brand that is nothing but the word of God and now you unfolded yourself through the seals to bring in plant view the Plan of Redemption that we started with you and we will go back to you and all that you're doing is just bringing us back to our original position because as Adam and Eve live in the Garden of Eden now you are ready to live with us in the millennium you want your wife so that you can introduce us also together to leave a thousand year on this Earth just like a second Adam with his wife Eve and to enjoy the blessing of God father may you continue to minister to your children throughout the week Lord May those that didn't catch something as they're going back to review this May the sin plan with you who they are because you say one of these things the bride won't know who she is and this is the time that we will know who we are and we thank you for opening this world father bless your children protect us Lord continue with us as we commit everything unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless your church we love you [Applause] before and time begins my life was [Music] amen [Music] he knows my name foreign [Music] I have foreign [Music]
