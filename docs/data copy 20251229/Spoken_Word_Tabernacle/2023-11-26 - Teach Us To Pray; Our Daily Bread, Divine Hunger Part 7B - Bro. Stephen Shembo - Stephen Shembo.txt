so I can add more everybody okay where is this idea of Daily Bread coming from where is this idea coming from because Solomon make a big statement Solomon says this go ahead my friend remove far from me vanities and lies come on and not give me neither poverty nor riches say amen amen Hot Potato right Hot Potato right Solomon is is talking about what poverty and what and riches Solomon said don't give me what poverty nor riches so if somebody's poor he's out of the will of God because brother brandham said the majority of Christian are poor Lazarus died poor and he went to heaven and he was with Abraham brother Bram say I don't say that in in the rich category God doesn't have children God have his children that are poor that are rich what is Solomon saying Shake somebody's hand say God bless you can we continue now can we continue can you continue it was just for five second then we go we get can I continue let's go my friend he says give me neither what poverty no what riches but feed me for what food convenient for me if you look and another the translation it means give me my daily bread Solomon say don't get me to Poverty don't get me to reaches but give me what is needful for the day what is my daily bread it Solomon say give me my daily bread amen why he says because lest I be how full and do what deny thee and say what who is the Lord so when you are full there is a tendency to be self-sufficient slowly my friend slowly my friend full goes with self-sufficiency I don't need God anymore amen come on and and all lest I be how full poor we already finished lest I be full and deny the and say who is the Lord or Les I be poor and do what Ste is every poor people did they still no you need to know how to apply scripture if you poor then you are what can you say the Bible please just repeat the Bible not you repeat the Bible steal and take the name of God in what soet trouble Solomon say give give me my daily bread where is this idea of Daily Bread starting from where is it let's go to Exodus 16 let's lay now that Foundation if you thereare you can say Amen just leave Solomon alone we will pick up on Solomon amen amen because I know people that are blessed that are true Christian amen and people that are poor they cast all the time and they're not Christian they cast all the time they lie all the time and I also Rich that lies and I also poor that are Christian you need to know how you how you calibrating your your shot the church must have high ambition amen amen amen amen amen amen let's go to uh Exodus chapter 16 if you thereare you can say Amen where is this idea of Daily Bread comes from where is he coming from Exodus 16 verse1 follow me carefully Lord help me if I can get to this Divine hunger you there verse one let's go friend and they took their Journey from elen and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the Wilderness of what sin it's strange that name is sin so Israel left Egypt and when they left Egypt everything was going well and suddenly God took Israel because the one who was leading Israel was not Moses he was the pillar of fire leading Moses and Moses was leading the the the the the the the the what children of Israel that's why Paul say follow me as I follow Christ amen are we together so the pillar of fire took them into the Wilderness amen this Wilderness is called the Wilderness the Wilderness of sin you know what sin means that's the name of the Wilderness everybody okay God took them to the wilderness what happened he took them to the Wilderness of sin which is between Elm and S on the what 15th day of the what second month of the second month after their departing out of what the land of Egypt so Israel Journey for some time before they hit the Wilderness so why did God take them into the Wilderness when Israel left to Egypt they never travel Into the Wilderness right away they were going into good places and they met the Red Sea and the Lord open up the Red Sea and they begin to move and God was looking his calendar God said this is the first day let them keep moving second day let them keep moving and God look at the congregation say let them keep moving as soon as this date reach God say Moses changed the GPS the GPS toward elim and toward s but p through the Wilderness are we together then suddenly Israel arriv at the Wilderness what happened in this Wilderness are we together verse uh two and the whole Congregation of what the children of Israel did what murmured against Moses and who Aaron in the what Wilderness they didn't murmur before the Wilderness that's right they murmur only in the wilderness so the will Wilderness trigger the murmuring amen and the complaint amen what happened my friend Lord help me load this verse three and the children of Israel say to them Moses and Aaron would to God that we do what had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of what Egypt in other words it was good for God to have kill us in Egypt because now it looks like God is about to kill us but it was better for us to die in Egypt why what is trying to kill them follow me carefully he says W to God we had di in the hand of the Lord in the land of what Egypt when we sat by the what flesh Parts come on and we did ate what bread and what to the fo stop so Israel say when we were in Egypt we had meat we had flesh we had steak amen and we also had bread and we headed to the food so when we were in in Egypt we ate with fo we ate with f it was better for us to die in the place that we are satisfied with our food then to take us in the place where there is no food kill me where I'm in plenty but don't kill me where I'm be that's what Israel is saying are we together in other word when Israel reached the Wilderness of sin all the supplier all the provision of Israel run out in other words God took a time because Israel leaving Egypt pack provision right and as Israel was moving forward God look and he saw that everybody is having a pizza in the bag this one carry rice this one carry this this one carry this he say Israel will not for they will not listen to anything God say Moses keep take them into 485 and let them keep moving this way all I'm waiting is for them to use up all their food are you following me when Israel is journeying a child is see is hungry mama mama mama need food mama just open the pack and give the child bread oh we going to the promised land Hallelujah he say no problem hey Daddy I'm hungry let's sit down they open plenty of food plenty of food and God keep waiting for them and he reach a time when they say mama mama where is food when Mama opened the pack she seemed like it's two bread left are we together and Mama give the bread but now Mom is a little bit careful like uh you don't play with food like the way we are playing because since we start this journey we have not seen no flight attendant coming around here and begin to dispatch food right here since we start this flight everything is just the way we is we are using our own resources are we together so when they reach the Wilderness of sin everybody open their provision empty dry it's dry do you have water there my water is finished but I saw you packing Pizza when we were leaving Egypt the children finish everything so which direction are we going my God the Wilderness when we are empty and we hit the Wilderness Moses but we thought this journey is three days now it's it's more than 3 days and now we are in the condition that all our provision run out Hallelujah there is nothing we can depend onen and God chose the setting to be the Wilderness what is in the wilderness everybody okay listen to brother Bram my friend brother brandham say wherever Christ is there is what prosperity and when Christ returned to the Earth all what the curse of the Earth the curse of the earth will be how taken away some of this day the old what desert so desert is a result of a curse amen are we together amen he says all the desert shall do what Blossom as a rose so the desert will not blossom until Jesus come amen and a rough places will be made how smooth she shall bring forth in abundance for he is the prince of what Prosperity wherever he is hallelujah the prince of what Prosperity second quote brother Bram say when he comes again in his glory the desert shall do what Blossom as a Roose and we shall have no more deserts everything will prosper in the great Millennium when the prince of prosperity arrive how what wonderful so the Wilderness is a cursed Place amen amen everybody okay he says here when he return Jesus it shall be a land of what Prosperity the old desert will be what Blossom and there shall be food where everywhere so food cannot be in the wilderness are we together and God LED his children to the Wilderness when their provision run out am amen amen amen God is leading Israel to a place where there is no food there is no water amen when they have no provision when provision was there they don't go to the Wilderness when they run out of provision God say now it is the time put them to the Wilderness God chose the saing in the wilderness because in the wilderness there is no agriculture right amen are we together you cannot K the soul you cannot s you cannot Harvest Amen in other words God lock Israel in a state that all possibility are impossible are you following me if you need for water no water if you say okay we got some seed Let's uh s some seed and wait for the Harvest there is no rain there is no seed there is no food you look here sand you look over there sand you look over here no water you look in our bag nothing God say that's what I know then Israel begin to complain and to murmur against Moses they say you know what this is a bad death Moses I would that we would have die in Egypt when I die I eat I'm fool then they kill me and I go to the Grave fool then here I'm going to die with Hunger you following me what is God doing let's go to verse four my friend if you thereare you can say amen amen uh uh uh verse three let's go to verse three again and the children of Israel said to them W to God that we die by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we sat by the flesh F and when we did eat bread to the fool for you have brought us forth into this Wilderness to do what what kill this whole assembly with Hunger so Israel was hungry and when they're hungry everybody's going wild now there is no more provision in the wilderness verse four Lord help me if I can move forward then say the Lord to Moses behold I will run what bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a c rate how every [Music] day Daily Bread everybody okay so the Wilderness push Israel to the miracle of creation are you are we together there was no tree no water no River no vegetation nothing but the Lo nothing in the wilderness but Israel and the pillar of fire but everything that existed in this world was created by the pillar of fire amen so God took Israel to begin to display to Israel who he is [Music] amen are we together amen are we together amen word the Lord God that was leading Israel created everything but that word took them to a place where there is nothing and in that place that's the place God begin to bring bread not from a manufacturer no sir not from the ground because Israel will say we the want that work yeah we were working we sweat it out that's when we bought this bre bread God took that option away are we following it God took the option of any manufactur away God left Israel to deal with him alone in a place where you cannot think anywhere that bread can come if you look to the South there is no warmart you look to the left there is no store you look to the north to the South to the east there is nothing all you see is a light standing and the light look at Israel and say I'm going to give you bread Hallelujah and some of them sit down they say where is he going to get this bread is a caravan coming up or something is an Egyptian Caravan passing by that we're going to buy food amen so the Wilderness Corner Israel to look up to one [Applause] person are you following me the hunger of Israel was caused by God [Music] Amen are we together it was a hunger that God triggered God initiated that hunger so that Israel can turn toward him a natural hunger need a natural food a Divine hunger need the Divine food not a bread that come from the water not a bread that came from wmart but a bread that your father did not know amen nobody from your family ever experienced that bread you want to be the first one to experience that bread in the place where there is no possibility amen are we together are we together amen thank let's go to verse four again father help me amen he says I will rain bread from heaven for you and the people shall go where out and do what gather what was the work of Israel to work for the bread no what do they have to do gather they just pick up the bread watch this pick up the bread gather a what certain rate how every day so the bread had a portion we talking about where is this Daily Bread is coming from the bread has a portion and he has a portion for every day amen I'm claming but my time is running up you need to work with me so we can run quickly everybody okay so every day Mana God was manufacturing Mana per day are we reading a different Bible every day a certain what rate every day that I may do What prove them whether they will do what walk in my law so Mana was given for a test amen come mana father help me was given for a test amen what test verse five if you dare you can say amen amen where is this idea of Daily Bread coming that God every day have to give you a bread every day why they why is not God giving me a bread for a month but God say no no no no I don't give you bread for a month you come I give you you eat today tomorrow I'm expecting you to come where is this idea coming from Israel God told isra now that you don't have anything to depend on now you're going to look at me every day are we together every day I give you Mana amen but God knew man that these people if I give them bread they will try to store come on come on oh Father oh Father am spoken word are you with me amen are you with me God knew that he knew that if I give them bread if they watch they say especially mother when a mother look at the situation if they give her bread the mama will say no I cannot eat everything because I don't know what is tomorrow let me eat a little portion I'm a mother I'm going to keep a little bit for the little one in case tomorrow in case there is no bread then I can give the little one so she doesn't die God knew you Mama God knew you Daddy God knew that you're going to open a bank account in the wilderness to try to store man for tomorrow so God ambushed you amen can I continue can I continue it's getting sweet but my if you go with me quickly then we move on can I continue my friend can I continue can I continue in the back brother Joe can I continue okay my brother listen to this Lord help me verse five and it shall come to pass that on the water sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in and it shall be how twice as much as they GA how daily everybody okay so we have six day we have Monday let's go our way Tuesday amen we have Wednesday we have Thursday we have Friday we have Saturday and we have what Sunday I'm going our way I know the Sabbath was Saturday let me go my way so you understand okay don't come back can say the Sabbath was on Sunday no I'm just trying to make a point okay so our seven day is Sunday this is our Sabbath this is I'm giving an example I'm repeating this because somebody will come up after church and handt me so you see what I'm saying so this is the seventh day everybody okay so in the seventh day God say this day you don't work everybody sit at home don't do nothing and God say because on the seventh day nobody's going out on the sixth day I'm going to give you twice this day one person this day one por this day one por this day one portion this day one portion this day dable portion because you're going to use one portion for today and another portion for tomorrow why is not God giving excess everybody okay so according to God there was a daily rate for Mana you cannot get more Mana or less Mana amen let's go to verse 15 my friend I'm trying to rush quickly so I can stop somewhere you there my friend amen and and when the children of Israel saw it they said one to another it is what man for they knew not what he was and Moses said to them this is the what bread who made this bread which The Who Lord has what given you to eat who fabricated this bread Lord who sow and reap and work to produce this bread no no it's a creative bread who created it God in which form the logos so God begin to teach Israel that all you need is make contact with me amen if you make contact with me it doesn't matter the position you are amen I took you to the worst position to show you who I am amen I push you to the corner where all possibility I lock so you can look up and remember who is leading you yes sir oh god father help me listen to this my friend verse 16 this is the things that which the Lord did what has commanded has commanded please listen to this gather of it how every man according to his what eating God doesn't want you to go off a board if your leader is two aners stop at two anwers everybody okay but God knew man he say everyone according to his what eating a what an H for every man an H for every man according to the number of what your persons take you every man for them which are in the what his in other word when you GA man make sure you don't go off if you have five people you get one 2 three four five stop don't take six because every armor if you eat you are full when you are full God say that say wait for tomorrow amen amen amen are we together give us this day our daily bread where is Daily Bread coming from everybody okay jum to verse uh 17 my friend he says and the children of Israel did so and did what gather somehow more somehow less and when they did what meet in other words when they measure because when they say some more some less some of you are thinking that some people has more than that no it was a coding to the houses the person who have 10 people versus the person who have five people the one with 10 is more the one with five is is less but all of them nobody's greater than another I'm going to prove it to you let's go to verse 17 uh Verse 18 and when they did measure or meet it with an armor he that got a what much has what nothing over nothing in excess and he that GA how little has what No Lack they GA every man according to what his eating and Moses say no man live of it until what the morning so God made sure you cannot brag to your brother amen in other word brother CH cannot come in the morning and say brother I have more food than you that's right no you have according to your house I have according to my house so nobody is over nobody's under we are all equal everybody okay and God say don't keep it till the morning but God knowing man he say I know these people if I say don't keep it in the morning some will take it and keep it in the morning God in his manufacturer when when he made Mana he took an expiration date and he loaded in the Mana the Mana was only for 24 hours so that you don't worry about tomorrow if I leave Mana without expiration date you will begin to prepare for tomorrow I don't want you to prepare for tomorrow I want to teach you something as long as you have me tomorrow belongs to me amen but I know you I know your corner nature I know this unbeliever here I'm going to load expiration day when it came 24 hours the manner begin to rot God God God this food again so what are we going to do tomorrow I told you every day can I continue give me a few minutes we we we we have to stop somewhere because I can't I can't continue time is gone verse uh 20 not withstanding they did what hearken not unto Moses you know the human nature but did what some of them left of it until the morning ah because they were worrying about tomorrow until the morning say ah Moses is saying what he's saying bud I don't know tomorrow you better keep did you keep it too yes me too me too I don't I don't trust it what about you yeah yeah yeah sister uh we have a our click here we keep we pack so much over there nobody sees yeah when Joshua is coming we pack everything so Joshua cannot see did you keep everything no we ate we ate thank you Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah Moses say I know these guys let's wait in the morning in the morning what is thinking like this didn't I tell you don't pack Mana where is that smell coming from lord lord lord so what are we going to get to God knows you that's right everybody okay everybody okay he says in the morning until the morning and he bred what worms and he did what sank and Moses was what WTH with them he was angry with them and look at what God did to the leftover that was left outside so Israel doesn't go Gathering and they gather it every morning every according to his what eating every man according to his eating and when the son was how hot H he did what melted so God made sure whenever you get your arm the left over in the ground God increase the temperature of the Sun and destroy all of them because he knows you going to go up is Joshua there get a little bit God destroy all of them and whoever pack he say I know I know Israel they're going to stink let them wait till in the morning in other word Israel now begin to get trained to depend on God Amen every day without their effort everybody okay so the curse that was in Eden that man has to sweat out to provide his own food God begin to train Israel to remove that curse back like you don't have to sweat amen you don't have to work amen you don't have to worry about working for a boss called Pharaoh you work for me and I'm going to take care of you I don't want you to look at your bank account I don't want you to look at your mortgage I don't want you to look at your job I don't want you to look at everything I want you to depend on me I am able to give you what you need in a place that you can everything in an unexpected time unexpected Place unexpected way everybody together amen listen to this I got to stop my friend he says this Paul says this in Roman I have to stop Roman 8 chapter 24 he said for we are saved by what hope but hope that is what sin is what not hope for what a man do what see what does he have yet what hope so God doesn't want you to even see anything because if you see you're going to go to sleep if in the morning they brought a big truck like they bringing in the Gaza and you see the truck you say ah food is there now let's go to sleep God say don't bring any any Tru because if you bring any Tru they won't have faith that's it because they will begin to Hope because they saw the track and they know that food is there destroy all evidence I want them to begin to hope for something they don't see they just have to depend on what I say my word is what they need men shall not live by bread alone but by every word the word is what they need to understand I'm trying to make them understand to depend on what I say Amen am listen to this Lord help me in Deuteronomy 2 verse 7 the bible say for the Lord th God has did what bless thee where in all the works of thy hand I got to stop he says the Lord th God has blessed thee in all the work of what thy hand we want to know where was Israel blessed because God blessed them with the work of their hand where what was th work what were they working he says he knoweth th walking through this water Great Wilderness this how many years 40 years the Lord th God has been with who thee th nothing so Israel was blessed in the wilderness so whatever Israel was doing in the wilderness may be taking care of the C God begin to bless them in a bad place that's right God was not blessing Israel in a fertile land sir because Israel will say this land is fertile God blessed them in the land where you cannot teal you cannot swow you cannot reap but whatever Israel does they found out that he works if Israel got cattle cattle begin to grow if Israel got C what goat goat begin to multiply if Israel got sheep sheep begin to multiply everything is multiplying in the wilderness and in the wilderness every day you must depend on God to provide food and God told Moses I'm going to stop for the sake of time that go gather an armor which is the measurement for one man and take that one and put it in the Tabernacle so that the high priest will have something to eat that's right every time they go there everybody okay everybody okay so the high priest in the man all is man in other words the Wilderness was a place where God God begin to break the self-sufficiency of a man God begin to break every ability of a man so that man can now go back to his original position amen and his original position is that man must depend on the word amen and not on his strength not on his potential but depend on what God says don't look at your future don't plan for your future if you plan and make the Mana stank if you want to to to accumulate more I destroy it I want you to start living day by day as a people that follow me as a people that feel me every day you must seek me every day you must come to me every day you must depend on me and when you depend on me then I give you what you want sir yes sir everybody okay everybody good let's stop here my friend my time is up because if I dig into this I'm digging into something else where we stop God is taking us to the Wilderness where is this idea of Daily Bread coming from the idea of daily bread is coming from Mana amen where God begin to train a nation to depend on him every day without relying on their personal resources or the personal potential or the potential of Any Nation or any country because in the wilderness there was no Nation there was no president there was no DSS there was nobody there but God and you alone right all provision gone that's right all possibility gone every day you depend on me amen sometime you went through the Wilderness and some of you are still going there that's why sometime you see you are living paycheck by paycheck as soon as all your bill are done it looks like there is not much left right that's right because you want to accumulate and the bill suck it up and he left everything there and you keep working and you keep working and you keep working and we keep working you gain under training because he want you to not not to rely on your job because you can get fire if you get fire you will cry like an unbeliever I don't want you to rely on your job go to work but know that I am the one who provid amen go to work but just know that I am the one who can provide I want you to believe more than work I want you to have higher ambition I want you to open up your spiritual mind so you can see pass your potential pass your work pass your country pass what the government is promising you because all of them can fail but I will not fail you I will be with you to the end until I take you to the Rapture that's what I'm training you for because if they seize this churches if the the pressure of The ecumenical council begin to pressure us we don't worry about it anymore because the third pool is there the third pool is loaded to prepare you to produce whatever you need hallu Lord it is just the beginning my friend let's stop here and will get there let's [Applause] stand you need to understand why is this third po coming in this time it's not coming so that we can play with the power of creation and begin to make a show I can make a squirrel I can make a donkey I can make that's not there God don't give power for foolishness amen God is training you so that when he put you in a situation there is no bread when Moses told Israel tomorrow you're going to have bread maybe Israel was thinking about the natural bread that they got but God was showing them that I can create I'm bringing you back to the origin that I am a God that creates and in order to bring you there I'm going to start by a hunger I'm going to crank in hunger of you and that hunger is a Divine hunger he have a Divine Purpose it's a hunger to bring you back to the word not the word that we speaking of by the word that can create because everything was created by that word all that existed was created that word that's why he say man shall not leave by bread and all that's why the miracle of Jesus Christ happened in the wilderness the temptation of Jesus Christ why did it happen in the wilderness why and what was the first tempting of Jesus Christ it was Hunger why only hunger why only hunger why did the devil start from Hunger why was the first weakness that happened to Jesus Christ in the wilderness was Hunger why was the first weakness that happened to Israel in the weakness in the in the wilderness was hunger and the devil Straight Ahead come and say if you a Son of God create create take this and change it change it to mind he said you don't understand Satan I remember what happened in Israel when they were tempted I told God told them I want you to understand that men will live by the word and Jesus took that answer from the Wilderness and gave it back to the devil and he want and he overcome the devil it's a Divine hunger it is the hunger that brought the prodal son back the prodal son went back home because of hunger it is when he begin to eat something that was
