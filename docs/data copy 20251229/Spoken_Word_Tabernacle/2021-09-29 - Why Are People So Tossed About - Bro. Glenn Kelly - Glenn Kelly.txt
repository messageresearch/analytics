to music and and uh our phone never works and church was getting ready to come on it was 7 30 and and i started the service and it wouldn't it wouldn't load it was buffering it wouldn't play and and i asked the lord i said lord i know there's no phone service out here but i really really want to tune into this evening service and i ask that you just make a way and allow this video to play so that me and destiny can be in service and and hear brother polycarp on on wednesday and from that moment on it just played smooth the whole rest of the way and i've never had that happen out there but for

mickey mickey's family in prayer this evening for their loss we know it's a it's a victory for her but here we we remain and we mourn but lord knows what he's doing and it's our goal to all rapture

evening sister hamilton congregation oh okay i'm sorry i missed that but we do have a we do have something written down here it says god bless you sisters we will be having sister samantha shower this saturday at october the 2nd at 4 o'clock she is having a baby boy so if you have any questions regarding that you can see sister sharon after church and it was requested this evening that we we sing

hallelujah [Music] all things are possible jesus is amen let's give him a clap offering tonight hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen god bless you brother benjamin good to see you true soldier amen blessed be the name of the lord i believe everybody got a message about sister gene by make his wife she departed to be with the lord she was such a precious precious precious sister and i have no doubt that she is right there in the sixth dimension amen hallelujah i know what a caliber of a woman she was if you spend time around here she was centered in the word right there into the word a very great support to the family and to her husband but he kept the decision came from the lord that it was time for her to go home amen and we have been working a little bit hard on it by god's grace talking to the family back home and also talking with the family here we appreciate all the sisters and everything that the church is doing as far as visiting them making phone calls and bringing the food there we really really appreciate because it makes things a whole lot easier for them amen so based on what i've discussed with the family it looks like the sister wanted to go to her family back home and to be buried there so we want to honor that because that was the desire of her heart and i'm working with butter mickey and lords willing tonight we'll be talking to the children as well to kind of put everything together and know uh how they're gonna go and everything so you stay tight on your text messages we will communicate you what is going on so the funeral will take place overseas over there our sister will be buried there the family will be going there not quite sure about all the detail at this time but lord's willing right after service i'm going to meet with them and talk and put everything together and do what we can to just kind of make things a little bit easier for them so if someone want to give something as a contribution to the family i spoke to uh the deacon what we were thinking was that on sunday lord's willing we can take a love offering so that kind of gives you an opportunity as everybody that is part of the church they want to give something they can give it we can put it together but probably by that time the brother will be already gone with uh i don't know if everybody in the family or part of the family we figured out everything tonight so when he comes back eventually we will do a little something just to make sure as a little memorial uh meeting together gathering together for the family and just uh to welcome them back again in the spirit of love comfort and support by god's grace amen so they need a lot of prayer it has been hard on the children hard on their family and hard on the church so we need a lot of prayer a lot of support from one another but by god's grace the main thing remember god will never take you out of this world if he have not finished with you and if a christian dies the bible say precious in the sight of the lord is the death of the sand i don't know why we were going through those chains of first death second death but i believe a nafta word has been given and given to the church that you can draw strength from it knowing that we have a true sister she's not lost actually we are the one that need to make sure we are prepared so we can meet our sister she already made it she already finished her course she's in a better place she's not struggling with a heart situation anymore now she's in her theophany so if you see here all i know i can tell you before even you see her you're going to see her young amen so you better maybe search for a certain picture when she was younger because that's the way we're going to meet here a beautiful young lady and we're going to be together forever amen so continue to pray for the family once i get everything finalized tonight then we will send you a text you do what you can on sunday and then as a pastor we will do what we can for the family to make things better for them because we are family this church is a family and we stay really really really tight especially when things comes like that to make sure we really really can express that love because they need that love from us and that support and our prayer amen so stay strong spoken word tabernacle one soldier lays to fight the battle but on the other side one more amen so praise be the name of the lord we got brother kelly tonight we thank the lord for having brothers that can step in like this when i got a really really really busy tight schedule and he was there handy to help so we want to hear from the lord and we're going to call brother kelly and from there on stay tight i know does uh mention about the baby shower somehow by the grace of god they might be living right on saturday if everything works fine but if they didn't leave on saturday just stay tight we might have to send you a text about the baby shower and make a little change because we need to give more time to the family and make sure they got enough comfort then the baby shower can be moved up but if everything works fine and we get all we need for the family and the children and the ready to move on then the baby shower is still maintained so you might have couple texts and things telling you about it just stay alert so we make sure now that nobody's uh missed and make sure you read your text to make sure you're getting everything that we have in amen praise be the name of the lord let's continue with only believe as radical is coming up only believe [Music] believes [Music] baby [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] amen we won't prolong the time let us pray lord god we thank you for your grace your mercy lord god we thank you lord jesus for an opportunity father just to come before your precious children on tonight lord god but father we know we're two or three we're gathered in thy name that you are here you're in the midst of the lord god so we thank you lord jesus for receiving the songs of zion on tonight and lord god those that are labeled wasn't able to be here tonight father strengthen them and keep them wherever they may be grant them a word of grace lord god and those that are streaming lord god comforting them also lord jesus so father we look unto the hills that we are strengthening our health coming from our help cometh from the lord so we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory lord god we bring every spirit under subjection tonight lord god over in the midst of your precious children and we promise to give you the praises the honor and the glory and my faith we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen amen amen um thank you musicians that'll be all i tell you just to carry on i was hearing the the songs by the grace of god we were having a good time over there said brother mickey's in the house yesterday we were just praising the lord you know when we got there we thank the lord for his grace and his mercy and we just rejoice and i tell you the lord came down in there so don't feel sad for them they're moving forward by the grace of god the youth came in and it's good when you see the the youth that was just there rejoicing and praising the lord giving god the glory in times like this coming together as a family comforting one another i mean the holy spirit was pleased he came down he accepted the songs of zion there yesterday he comforted the family's heart there yesterday so i tell you we thank the lord for his grace and his mercy and you know we don't we won't prolong the time let's turn to first corinthians and verse 12 in on chapter 12 and verse 13 i was looking i didn't have much time to look at this but uh i wanted to look at another thought there um but this kept pressing on my heart so i better follow the leadership un under the lord and uh so once you have your bibles and you're at the scriptures say amen first corinthians 12 and verse 13 for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit he says for the body is not one member but many may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated you know it was a thought it was uh yes it came to me i was just there meditating on the thought and what i was looking at it was why are people so tossed about amen and i looked at that message it was really pressing on me because you look at this day and time god bless you brother you're right at this day and time we looking around and we know that the rapture is about to take place soon and you can see by the times and the prophecies and things are being fulfilled but you know it was three points that brother branham brought out in this message and he was three points he would work with i may not get to all of them i'll do my best by the grace of god we know that it's a wednesday night and children are in school and we won't plan to keep you too long by by the grace of god but it's why the christians are so tossed about and when you look around and when you look at when you look around and you see the conditions and of the world and and the times we're supposed to be moving forward and growing is that right i know it's only our hearts are heavy but we're going to do our best and and and move with the lord so i want to read some things before we get into the scriptures and y'all be praying with us he says the the the christians rest in in that hope upon the stormy sea anything that happens there will be sure storms rise up he said all kinds of troubles is going to come we know i like one of the brothers says that that's essential is that right we can't get around that is that right but we have a comforter is that right greater is he that is in need and he that is in the world he says in all trouble but we but we're anchored see that's all it'll never sink it can't sink is that right he says now he says he said i've noticed many christians in my life to be up and down are we going to head home tonight now we're going to look around in there because we're bringing you closer to to god is that right because i noticed that christians are up and down i'm not going to cut it i'm not going to sugarcoat it so those that stubborn and study this message here and in this specific topic you know where the prophet was going right he says now and then look i want to read this said a true born again christian can rest his faith or her faith upon the unmovable word of god we know we got an un infallible word of god is that right it cannot error we can put everything on it that we have we're living on it because we're putting our life on it is that right what god has said is that right and let no man put us under this word he said now nothing else a christian faith is based solely upon what rest is that right this is a rest this is a finished work is that right we're supposed to be enjoying this life our next step is what heaven is that right so we are knowing this hour here now all your messengers pointed to what it pointed to the messiah coming they pointed to the messiah coming and they also talked about the atonement is that right everyone talked about the blood that was shed for you each and every one of us god's precious blood came down for you and i he couldn't see anyone else not an angel and come god came himself because we are kin-focused that right it was all about the blood he said now look he said i've noticed many christians in my life to be up and down he said i wondered about that so you know it must have been heavy on his heart so the lord had to give him an answer he says and and and without preaching such a text as as this he says i thought the best to deliver to my to to my people here first and see before i go out anywhere i wanted to bring it here i mean that's why the god put it on my heart because we are not at this time supposed to be up and down is that right no no the holy ghost is positive the holy ghost come was sent in is our way here so that we can finish the redemptive work is that right so we can become one with god in his hour here now and god wanted us to be one with him as it was in the beginning so he's giving us the power and prayer he's giving us back the authority that we once had is that right so what so we're gonna look at this spoken word now before now in this time in this age here we thank god for the prayer line we thank god for those things is that right but god is moving us into move upon the absolute is that right so we don't want to get ahead of ourselves but we wanted to see because there's three major points he worked in it and he was trying to bring out to the saints where the enemy was tricking the people at is that right so look you heard the pastor work in that area and constantly working and he was showing us about the justification last time i was here and the last time we were talking about the true origin the origin of a true witness is that right you come from god you go back to god we're moving it to the spoken word now but he's building a character in each and every one of us so we'll be able to handle this spoken word let's see what he said he says now you find them people who seem to be very religious seem to have such a deep desire and daily they search and hunt and seek for god and never come to any settlement of any kind to where they could be settled or anchored in christ he says and this i have learned to be in inexperience he says and this i have learned to inexperience that it is the people of intellect okay so he's talking about he's digging deep is that right he's now we're coming talking about that's what this message is bringing us into right he's not everything that he's exposing now is to bring you closer to the character of christ anything that's in you he says every one of us know the wickedness and the bitterness of our own heart is that right we know what we struggle with so the first point here dressing is intellect is that right that's a terrible thing reasoning because you're not moving no dental no devil out the way he said believe from the heart the prophet of god i'll do my best brother to keep still okay and and who's ever uh interpreting i'll try help me lord he said now look he said now he says he says you're never going to get any supernatural movement on if you're trying to mix intellect with the supernatural you see i wanted to preach that message tonight was why christ speak brother great that thing was pressing on me let me the lord give me grace another time but we want to dig deep we want you to understand this intellectual demon is with these religious demons is what we have now so people get cold and starchy and they sit there and they believe they have some but there's only an intellectual conception of the word you should be performing a supernatural in your own home teaching your children how to cast out them teaching your children about prayer warren teaching your children about offensive prayer this is we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places an intellectual devil see if you get up in here the last time we was here we were telling you about in ii chronicles 20. i wasn't picking on anyone or saying about coming up here i'm just saying i know you have to be prayed up and you have to be anointed because satan is going to try you he's going to try me he's going to try everyone but you have to understand under the anointing is the right anointing the anointing only comes from god god demonstrates that he backs up what you're doing is that right so when you sing a song you're singing a song to jesus you singing a song to glorify god you singing a song to prepare a way for the preacher you singing a song so we can drive the demons out through the worship service we're singing the song all the blood all the blood the blood has signed my name so yeah that's why i said we rejoiced there yesterday we were singing those songs we had a good time singing it to the glory of god we seen our precious brother benjamin just light up there is that right the lord touched his spirit is that right comfort the word of god he says intellect he said now speaking this there's two different two different of christians seems strange seems strange but i will not say to to two types he said i say two different phases would be a better word to use he said two phases the same christianity but two phases of it he says and one of them is an intellectual or a mental conception of this message see you have to understand if you lack it on your prayer life satan is going to get you he's going to catch you and you're going to respond the wrong way because you have not been anointed god prayed up and got with the father and prepared yourself for the battle is that right so you have to get into the spirit the prophet of god said get you got to get in the spirit well you won't receive anything is that right so we're talking about an intellectual christian and a mental christian versus a spiritual christian we're talking about some let me let me keep on reading i want you to catch and i want to take my time we're going to lay it solid because these things that you're not doing when you go in in a war in the battle okay you're not going to be prepared for it that's why he said put on what the whole armor of god so you may be able to withstand the wilds and the tricky of the devil in the end time is that right so we always praying for those that are on the essential jobs now it's not like kovic is not out there but if you ready for it and you fake out the faith it cannot harm you is that right we're going to get there about you are speaking the word is that right we're not going to go we're not going to accept anything because we got a promise no diseases no the sickness nothing can come upon god's children is that right we speak the word by faith is that right he comes down and he anoints the word that comes out of our mouth hallelujah he said in the middle of what god has said in his word he said now he says and he said in his word of jesus christ by the way of knowledge he said now look he says and others is experiencing experimental experience that god has given the man word in his heart that's right brother see now this man has had an experience in his heart his heart has been turned to god he has been born again of the spirit and of the water that's why he sent malachi 4 to turn to what the hearts of the children write back to the fathers is that right the original apostolic teaching that was in that time now it is supposed to be another book of acts written again is that right now in this time that we're living in so now we're talking about not just the intellectual conception hallelujah that's right brother he said now look he says and other is an experience that god has given them in their heart the one intellectual is hungering see he is feasting on god he said but his feet his feast doesn't hold huh we're gonna get into something okay but it doesn't hold them let's go okay for some reason you're coming here you're enjoying the mysteries you're enjoying the deep teachings you're enjoying the hidden things that's in the scriptures but when you go out that door how many can you talk to someone about it how can you can you talk to someone what god has given you can you tell somebody by revelation that you come from god that you was in the mind of god that you were the eternal god that you were the seed of god that you're looking for the rapture to get back to god any day is that right he said pray and watch for the coming of the lord it won't be far it's a joyous hour now we tell them about jesus get yourself lined up because what he has done for you on calvary we taking back what's ours hubble's lord he said now now look see they're hungry they're out there looking for something but they're looking for god okay and we got the goods god gave us the goods we know that every human being is hungry and thirsting moaning and groaning for the manifestation of the sons and the daughters of god is that right we're not out there reasoning we're standing with earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints he has preserved we have been preserved by the preserver you have been anointed by god you have been called by god you have been appointed by god this is a real war but you know what we got the victory is that right we got the perfect paper is that right brother branham said a man that got perfect faith he has every situation under control [Applause] look what he says he says now he says one intellectual hungry he said he's feasting on god but his feasts don't hold the other one seems to have victory all the time there's nothing but there's nothing bothering them huh there's nothing bothering them because we got a promise is that right god jesus said you've never seen the righteous forsaken for his she's begging for bread i never wanting for nothing is that right i'm enjoying jehovah gyra i provide all of your needs the other ones seem to have the victory all the time nothing bothers them they're just as solid and anchored as they can be he said no trials no storms bother them at all he says but they seem to have something about them he says that that people who are christians and are trying to live for god admire that type of christian huh now what about the young rich ruler he admired jesus huh he recognized jesus had something that he didn't have is that right he looked upon him and he knew that everything jesus did he prospers is that right but it was one thing the wrong young rich ruler was lacking when he looked at jesus he saw a character brother brown said he had a character that he didn't have he wanted eternal life is that right he saw what this brother jesus was doing and he ran and he fell on his knees and said what what must i do to inherit eternal life is that right so we know the story but look at also peter in him is that right being not yet converted they was looking at the young rich ruler's life also is that right when they saw he said oh jesus told him the ultimate do what take all your riches and give it to the poor he couldn't do it isn't that right all he had was that's right brother intellect intellect religion that's all he had is that right we're moving into something is that right when them demons when the holy ghost told us the other day when they saw jesus coming they recognized jesus the intellect person called him beelzebub the intellect person called him the devil the intellect person did but the demons that was in the pigs say what ah lord you come to torment us before our time the holy ghost showed us that even the demons don't want to go to hell even the demons don't want to be there they are always tormenting somebody but look how he uses his benefits before his time always crying for grace and mercy the devil ain't they ah no god he get around in there he get over there that's the same thing he got around there brother polycarp that was good about whether what was the name hey hagar knew the scripture hey god knew at the time that she can get grace and mercy when sarah told her to move on didn't see god did what god it was a promise there is that right so hagar knew that so that child that she had she wanted to get grace and mercy for that child was that right because she was carrying who ishmael was that right so she still had a promise so she knew how to get her going get her promised saints you have to understand god has delivered us every promise in the book now is what ours is that right hallelujah he delivered us from what look at that just come to me turn to psalms 103 real quick hallelujah we're not willing to be lacking nothing nothing not in this hour saints god's opening up the word he's bringing the word and this hour here now look what he's saying in psalms 103. he said bless the lord o my soul and all that is what within me bless his what bless his holy name amen hallelujah it's salvation in that name huh he said now bless the lord o my soul and forget not what all his benefits the devil will not forfeit his benefits what about us saints hallelujah whatever you ask you can receive is that right according to the word of god if his word abide in you you abide in me whatever you ask you what you can receive it was according to the will of god saints let's move into it this is the hour of all the benefits he said look he said who who forgiveth thine what all forgiven all thy iniquities who do it now everything we knew what to do and didn't do it look at this the blood of jesus christ forgave all of your iniquities when he went to calvary is that right hallelujah glory be to god and he said what and here of some of thy diseases ah you think we're afraid to challenge kovic we're not afraid to challenge kovic is that right huh god has given us a word right there we're gonna we got the infallible word of god that comes from the throne of god he says no diseases no sickness would come upon god's children speak the word and stand on the word and watch god move he can't move until you speak it is that right brother they can't move until you speak had an essential job devil coming in want to attack your mind look what he says is i healed of all thy diseases he says who redeemeth what thy life from what ah the almighty god who's rich in mercy when we within our sins after knowing that we shouldn't have made it and the almighty god watched over us kept us when we should have been dead maybe in an accident maybe in the gunshots or something but maybe somewhere drinking drugging overdosing but god kept us god watched over us hallelujah he redeemed our soul that's why i'm sure brother branham it kept troubling me why are they toast why why did it toss to him from what the almighty god has done for him he has called us overcomers is that right huh he's going to give us a what a white stone now his righteousness and a name that no other else would know is that right hell they god in you probably was striking the prophet touching his heart why are they toast hallelujah he says who redeemeth thy life from what destruction who crown of thee with what loving kindness and tender mercy hallelujah hallelujah you're getting around there i was listening the other day he said brother they said he was going to cast the devil out brother lamont he was going to cast him out he was tired that out of his wife you know he got sick of it brother branham said oh no no no no no no no that's not the way huh he said you just love her just love her just send us some send us some edibles huh send us some flowers huh send all these things there too when you go out just hold their hand come on honey open the door for on this side is that right i see some of you admit i'm getting ready to hit home now huh huh your wife and your family then here you go i need to talk to that one huh that's already showing your character where's your loving kindness and gentleness and meekness and sweetness oh honey yeah i still look the same since the first time i met you ah it gets sweeter it's sweeter than sweeter when you walk with christ it gets sweeter it gets sweeter it gets sweeter you get humble yourself you humble yourself why are we tossed he couldn't understand why well we got all the benefits huh we are the father of a king is that right the king remember the slave that came from africa and he got around in there and it was something about that slave is that right when you go on your job there's something about a christian when they see you on that job huh they got around in there what's the difference huh with that slave over there do you eat different no that's different no he's sleeping no he he stayed right there in the gallery with the other slave he said but what's the difference about him he says you see over in africa see his father was a king so he was raised up no other way is that right you are being raised up no other way but by the king it's a character that's inside of you that's gonna be produced uh we may not appear like we're nothing now but we're gonna be just like him when he comes job said i come in this world with nothing i leave this world with nothing but job was talking about natural things huh can we leaving here with his character is that right i know i'm going in the rapture is that right i'm looking for the rapture i'm looking for that day to come hallelujah glory be to god why are they tossed he says the other one seems to be so victory they just as solid and anchored as they can be no trials no storms bothers them at all but they seem to have something about them is that right he says and i often wonder lord what is it that these people have that others crave so much for and yet seem to fail to get it see what you got huh see what you got well you got every opportunity now when god gives you to tell someone about jesus to tell them about the goodness of this life telling them what the lord have done for us and doing for us thanking the lord for what he's done looking for things to come but don't miss what he's doing for us right now the time that we got in here and the way that we got in here it was a supernatural way if you humble yourself and put your mind and take on the mind of christ and don't don't think like you men but you think like god it was a pressure put on but god knew that he was go that we had to move forward and god made a way is that right god made a way for his precious children never leave you or forsake you he said now look he said they crave him for it i know that's a great a great question in all of our hearts who have served christ he said i've never seen a person yet that ever once come to him life never seemed right to them anymore if they ever left christ if you come to christ and you turn around and you leave it you will find yourself being worse off you will become worse off when you come into the presence of the lord here i don't want to get it i don't want to get ahead of myself because i want you to look and i want you to see this and when they come in here why things happen why they are tossed first of all some is just have an intellectual conception of this message which is not an intellectual conception that's why so many walked away so many through fiery darts is that right when you sign someone that truly truly got the baptism of the holy ghost they're praying for their brother they're loving their brother is that right they're moving forward in a positive way hallelujah he said now look he said the person help me lord he said but now he says see people are hungry but they haven't been taught right that's exactly right that's exactly right we got to understand because you cannot have the the former rain and the latter rain you got to be both of them before the mechanic for the dynamics can come forth is that right so now so many of them you'll be surprised that is the famine of hearing the word of god in the land right now you are blessed to be able to sit here for an hour and 30 minutes that's right brother you are blessed to be able to sit here for an hour and 30 minutes and get the word of god is that right it's a change taking place inside of you see you'll find out later on when the pressure come you're going to find out the goods that you have inside of me is that right thank you lord he says now he says now to see this hunger for people and yet not able to reach it he says many many of our teachers in schools have brought in much theology of telling the people he said now this is not prophet now he says well it's because you did he's saying because you didn't shout because you didn't speak in tongues because it is but together we find these people when they do shout or speak in tongues some other emotions they still don't seem to be the person that they should be you're getting somewhere isn't that what the pentecostals did is that right god did it had it method to say you shout you got it pentecost who said you speak in tongues you got it now she see we got the full goods things is that right there's something down inside of you if you want to show when when where's that angelo we said you you command your hands to praise the lord sometimes this body be down and his body just be down and i'll be tired and when i hit that door brother steve i said lord i want these feet to dance for you tonight it's not a show lord only you can move his feet only you can move his hands only you can but it's for your honor it's for your glory it's for your praises lord i need you to strengthen his body tonight and he'll do it for you lord i feel your people as heavy tonight i need a song lord on my heart to glorify you father when i sing this song lord let it be anointed to drive the demons away let it comfort someone when they came in the door because they entering your gates with thanksgiving and praise his father we're talking about serving our god he said now look hallelujah he says so find it so simple in the word of god we try to explain it and in order now to do this after seeing the intellectual part of the mind and the soul which is in the heart he says now you truly have two different mental faculties you have one them that's in your head by your brain and the other one operates in your heart that's why god come to work on your heart is that right that's why when you come in and i was saying you sing and you sing those songs to the glory of god you're anointed and you pray now you can drive those demon forces away is that what it is because god is pleased he anoints that song it shakes the foundation of the devil someone rejoices someone cries someone praised the lord because they got delivered in the worship service god came down let me keep going help me lord he's saying now luck he says now so finding help me lord and emotions and finding state of the might he said there are two different which is in your heart which is called your soul the spirit in your soul now they are very much in disagreement many times when the head seems to to say something in the soul wonders that it it's not right but when it comes into the soul the head seems to step back is that right he says so is a man think up in his heart so is he is that right he can hear when the devil came at you who tried to tempt jesus is that right or the lust of the eye and the lust of the flesh and the proud of life what did jesus do sooner or later he says what get back behind me satan you see so he now he got they cut he caught that it was just an intellectual it was using the word out of contents is that right so it wasn't going to work that's why we had to have a prophet to come and turn the hearts of the children to the father he had to tie up all the loose sins and he had to speak judgment on the world is that right but we're looking for the rapture he's letting us know that we're in christ is that right there's no condemnation who those that are in christ jesus we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit is that right keep in your mind set fail on steadfast on christ and he will grant you a perfect peace is that right hallelujah help me lord he said now look he says now they he says but when it comes into the soul the head seems to do what step back that's right brother he get back the soul said uh-uh can't say amen can't say so be it is that right because down in the soul it lives off the word of god the anointed word of god you either got a faith seed in there or you got a doubt seed down in there is that right and it's going to produce it sooner or later it's going to produce it's going to be what showdown time is that right that's why we said we thank the lord you thank the lord for the prayer lines you thank the lord for those that come but we have to understand when that anointing comes on the gospel is that right brother branham said they get that anointing mixed up they don't understand the real anointing when the real anointing jesus said the spirit of the lord is upon me and he has anointed me to preach the gospel cast out devils heal the sick raise the dead open the eyes of the blind is that right don't worry about no copic is that right anyone that can come to god they can leave here whole you come as a sinner you can leave here as a saint under that anointing under the gospel that right the preaching of the cross is foolishness to a person that perished but its power into one that is what saved is that right help me lord he said now look when the lord come in he said now the faith he said the soul said there's been things that happens to you that you knew was going to be yet you could not explain it why is that right how can you explain the supernatural how can you explain to someone with us in this building huh how can you explain to someone that this building was supposed to be sold three times huh how you gonna explain to someone because god had it for who is for us is that right it was for his children it was for his bride i don't need a place where i can come and do what and feed them is that right he said this is a double portion we're getting a double portion is that right like elijah say eliza he told him is that right you got two spirits moving in this message is that right sons of gods and the sons of the prophet he said he wanted a double portion he wanted that spirit to come down in there he wanted to see the god of elijah is that right how do we get the double portion we got a double portion out of a pasta and a teacher then wait huh you gotta hit it is that right he didn't hide it from us he hid it for us this is the hour is that right he saved the best for last hallelujah sometimes saints you ought to be on the offensive prayer is that right what you buying on earth shall be bound in heaven what you loose on earth shall be loose on heaven use the word speak the word take back your family members drive back them demons for us the condition has nothing to do with the conclusion of the madam we have a promise is that right hallelujah [Applause] look what he said like the son he said loving kindness psalms 103 verse 5. he said who satisfied thy mouth with what good things the goodness of jesus is that right the good tidings of the gospel is that right hallelujah he says now look he says so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles the lord execute righteousness and judgment for all that are what i don't press the gospel would come and release the ones that oppressed is that right oh biting that devil up hallelujah he said he made he made known his ways unto moses in his action to the children of israel didn't he know he brought and let moses see moses i'm with you i called you moses i'm gonna charge you before the foundation of the world moses let me show you the supernatural moses put your hand in your heart right moses take your hand out moses his leprosy put your hand back in moses hallelujah moses i'm the healer moses i'm the lord thy god i can heal thy disease is that right moses he told him around then he said moses you got to have a clean and pure hand to handle this word moses anybody can't handle this word in this day and time is that right he said moses but i showed you i'ma told you i'mma bring you out on the mighty hand he said bride i'm gonna take you out of here in the rapture when the squeeze comes don't worry about it don't give faint just look up you're reducing drawing there i'm gonna get you out of here just in the time is that right hallelujah he told moses he did what brought him out of egypt is that right he's sitting like flies is that right moses had to speak it is that right he had to turn the water to the blood moses had the speaker come on saints we're speaking the word in this hour why cry speaker is that what he told them he showed him salvation he showed him salvation leave the chariots out of there he showed them salvation was going to bring him out of egypt he showed him salvation taking him to the red sea he's showing him salvation taking him through the wilderness he showed him salvation stand still and see the salvation of the lord see the mighty hand of the lord you got the helmet of salvation keeping your mind steadfast on christ and that's why he said the joy of the lord is our strength restore the joy of my salvation thinking about the helmet of salvation thinking about what the lord has done for you on calvary thinking about the lord saving your soul thinking about the lord healing your body thinking about the lord bringing you your wife thinking about the lord saving your children thinking about the lord saving your mother thinking about the lord saving your sister thinking about the lord the goodness of the lord [Applause] [Music] stand still and see the salvation of the lord he said moses he said the lord is merciful and gracious to anger plenties and mercy he will not he will not always child and neither will he keep his anger wherever he have dealt with us after ours he's he has not dealt with us after our sins nor reward us according to our iniquity look how merciful this god is that we serve hallelujah hallelujah let me get back to the message thank you jesus he said now look he says there's been happening who'll help me lord he said he says there have been things happening to you that you knew was going to be yet you could not explain it there's no reason you couldn't explain explain it out but yet you just accept it and it happened just that way he said that's when something happens down here we're at that's when something happens in the heart something down in there is letting you know that lord if this is you could say amen or if it's not isn't that right because you knows you pray read your bible and study the message a blind man know a righteous man is that right faith come by what hearing hearing or what word of god that faith cometh that means you're pressing forth towards what understanding the word of god is that right but it's driven by faith is that right so faith coming by hearing the word of god understanding the word of god when it comes to you it increases that what that faith so you pray and you read your bible it will increase that faith praying building up your most holy faith praying we're at in the holy ghost is that right people come to the prayer line now why do you come there to the prayer line we know you can come be there god has that there you're welcome to come up if you need if you need prayer but we're moving into what the prophet of god was moving us into as peter spoke these words the holy ghost fell on them is that right every time you hear the word of god and is anointed by god it's the holy ghost that's speaking is that right here we're bringing you into that's what your origin is bringing you into your origin is bringing you into back to think like god thought and now when you think like god before you speak it when the holy ghost come now is him working through you it's him speaking through you he's become your mouthpiece he's become your arms he's become your legs it's him controlling everything is that right we're moving into that position saying [Music] help me lord he said now look he says now that's he says in the great meetings the vast field the campaigns he said notice many people coming to me saying oh i i have all faith he said yeah an intellectual he says that's right right here but in their heart it isn't there you see you got two kind of believers you said you got a fleshly christian you got a spiritually christian he said now he says but he said help me lord they couldn't explain he's okay many notice that's an intellectual they are right here but in their heart it isn't there if it was they wouldn't be on the platform to be prayed for for help of faith if they have faith come on bride i'm totally hitting to you now we're laying it out you got to get to a point okay when you're moving into the word the manifestation of the word for your day okay speak the words you believe the word god said it i believe it that's it that's the infallible word of god who can change the infallible word of god it cannot error that's right without nobody if god said it that's it let me keep moving trying to get to a point help me lord he said now we have to go back to a type and as he said looking in this picture here he says i believe especially it's easier for it it's easier for them to understand to illustrate let me jump a little bit he said now look help me lord he says now when they cross the red sea and come over into the promised land god by sovereign grace each night he rained down we rained down manna out of heaven when god come in here you coming here on sunday morning by the grace of god god is bringing you fresh man is that right hidden manna that was there but in there you know it's always a mixed multitude is that right there's always a mixed multitude so we don't wrestle against flesh and blood not against persons is that right but satan will or no but we've been warned we hit that door god anointed his blessings over there in the hotel god has brought us here he wanted you now remember satan's not going to leave it like that is that right so we have to understand but we know no weapons formed against us is going to prosper is that right every time the devil sticks his head up he's going to get hit is that right we're not wrestling against flesh and blood is satan trying to use his tactics is that right obsession oppression possession is that right obsession is trying to inject someone with a wrong thought he's trying to inject you with a thought that doesn't line up with what the word and what the holy spirit is teaching us in here is that right hallelujah let me keep it going here let's stop there he said look he says now he said the sovereign grace man from heaven he said the people who would go they take the manna and then sustain their life in the journey now god was bringing this form to sustain them along the way god has given us these words to sustain us along the way okay because let every man words be alive let god's word be true is that right so we can't we can't live off of man's words it got to be god's word is that right okay the message of the hour he said now look he said now we see that we see that same thing as happening in christianity many people before nine o'clock they get hungry you had a lot of campgrounds see that right campground stars and that's what he called the glory many people go to the service and rejoice and shout and praise the lord while the spirit of god is what falling and condemnation did what left their heart he said as soon as it got and as soon as a day or two after the revival huh he said after that after that revival they find themselves back in that old grind again yet they come eating manna is that right uh-huh let me keep going he says many he says he says now many people come to christ which was never which never been able to in the pentecostal world to make the pentecostal people see this fundamental truth see it's so hard see that's why so many leave they say it's too strict they say it's too hard no it's not i'm gonna take you to some churches if you don't land you're getting a solid foundation laid here okay you're getting a solid foundation in the word by god's grace in god's mercy and not deviating to the left and not deviating to the right is that right so he's trying to bring you into the character of that christian that god saw us before the foundation of the world he said now look he says he says he says now because the church has his doctrine and and they hear that pastor daley the evangelist is speaking and they on i'm gonna jump a little bit now but but they fail this truth he says now i often spoke yet to believe this faith or fundamental truth that jesus said he that heareth my word and do what believeth on him that sent me had what everlasting life and should not come into the condemnation but it has from death pass from death unto life you see it now turn to john 5 24 i want you to see it didn't have any scriptures but help me lord we want you to see it because the holy ghost gave it to the pastor the other week they want to but you got to continue in it some of you say oh we know that i know we know this but god don't want me to preach it again he said now look look at the the gospel of john five and let's look at the two verses it's uh saint john 5 24. he said now he says billy billy i say unto you he that what that there's eph on the end of it right that means then the holy ghost tell the pastor you got to continue in it is that right you can't just hear you got to continue in it is that right my word see organizations take that scripture and they just applied and that's all they do and they hold on to it and they go on and keep living the way they want to live is that right it doesn't work like that he said i continued in my word and believe it see you've got to also believe it continue believing he says on him that sent me have everlasting life and shall not come unto what condemnation but is passed from death or to life he said verily really i say unto you the hour is what coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall what live see now they do what they we being quickened we're being quickened by the word is that right now once you continue in this word you build now you see why the holy ghost had the past to keep saying are you caught up are you caught up with the message are you caught up you see because you don't want you to get left behind and what god is bringing he's building your faith he's unfolding this word getting you ready for this rapture bringing us into our true origin what he initially send us here for is that right what the holy ghost is and what the holy ghost was sent here for it's right for us to become partnerships with god can you imagine that you're in partnership with the almighty god he says he hears my word believe the judgment he said what do what do we have believe here faith cometh by hearing he hearing the word of the word you got to continue let me jump on he said now the second thing we talked about the first thing was intellect the second thing brother branham he was working with here he was saying that now he says from he says from death unto life from darkness unto day for mortal to immortal from corruption into incorruption from weary unto what joy is that right it's always when you hit the door it gives god thanks thanking the lord for allowing you to enter his gates once again he said now he says now for for um corruption to incorruption from weary unto joy from death unto life from resting upon fully on what thus say to the lord that's what we're resting on is that right he said but upon the word of god to whom the human soul rests god said that that settles it makes it real now let that sink in it's real because god said it that's right god said it who can change it is real you just walk by faith is that right the judge shall live by faith he said now look he said let's go quickly to the second step what makes these people go out on the ground and eat the manna and then before a night come many of many of them go hungry and people go to the meeting he said there is just many people who goes and turns the radio on hears a good sermon and rejoices many of them goes to church they hear a good sermon and they go home and rejoice but what is that thing then that comes in and takes it all all away from you listen now you got to see what is it that comes to you know as an individual what comes and take it away from you your mind now should be steadfast on what god just unfolded to you we used to ask our children oh what did y'all hear in church today i know what you hear in church today you know they made sure they heard something because they wanted to stop by the waffle house they had to know they heard something is that right so they want to get there so you get around in there so they made sure they heard something it takes a wise man to win a soul is that right so we're now we're bringing you in there you're applying the word you're meditating on the word david said i keep the lord before me at all times is that right so look what he said let me continue brother branham's working with he's saying now what is it what's stealing it from you is that little something now satan's going to maybe to touch the children satan's going to trouble the wife satan's going to try to trouble the husband he's going to try to do something to steal it from you is that right i'll tell you what look at uh before i begin look at luke 6. god help me i'm sorry uh luke chapter 8. we're going to come back today hallelujah i won't read this oh the gospel luke 8 and for let's look at the verse 11. he says he says prayer with his soul he says let's start at five verse five he said sower went out to sow his seed and as he sold some fell by the wayside and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon the rock and some as soon as it sprung up it it withered away because it lacked moisture he said some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and did what choked it see and others fell on good ground and sprang up and bare her fruit and hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried and he had he didn't have an ear let him hear let him let him hear let him hear he say his ears hear and let him hear he says now look look at verse 11. he says now this parable is this the seed is the what the word of god he said those by the wayside are they that what hear that and cometh into who the devil taketh away the word out of their word that's right brother mike out of their hearts he said lest they should believe and be what now why is the devil trying to steal that word out of your heart stand still and hear the salvation of the lord which is the word of god he know if you removed his word he know if you believed his word he know if you speak this word he know of you tell someone about this word you can win a soul to the kingdom of god is that right when understanding comes your confidence comes your confidence comes your faith to come faith is a revelation only can come from god god's the only one could give you the holy ghost god's the only one know if you really believe this message he said now look he said the devil take away the word of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved he said they on the rock are they he said they on the rock are they which when they hear he says receive the word with what and these have no root which while which for a while believe and in time of what see something in your life whoever it is that temptation to pull you away when god is telling you to pray you want to build something up and then all of a sudden you want to go get something to eat god telling you to fast you see he's trying to move you into something some kind of temptation is troubling when it's time to go to church maybe perhaps the devil is pulling you to walmart is that right instead of you sacrificing and say lord god uh give me the strength father to press my ways into the house of the lord father i need a word from your throne father watch over me along the dangerous highways lord touch me lord it's been a long day with the children lord god strengthen my heart strengthen my body strengthen my spirit lord um and lord let me still be able to greet my husband and give him a hug and a kiss on his cheek when he come in the door and says honey come on i'll prepare this for you we can eat something along the way but let's press our way on to the church tonight is that right we had to get up a little earlier maybe on sunday if you heard the pastor say one time don't everybody run to the bathroom and try to take a shower and clean up at the same time is that right we have to understand easy these little things block you satan is real is right he's wise as a serpent and a humble but we got to be harmless as a dove we got to stay ahead of him we got to pray bind up any demon force and that would try to tempt you is that right block it off until the lord manifested before you he's no you know he's going to do it you just keep binding it up until he does it is that right speak the word by faith help me lord he said now look he says and then on the rock he's verse 13. when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which in a while believe in the in a time of what temptations fall away he said and that which fell among thorns are thy are they he says which when they have heard so forth and are choked with what and what and the pleasures of what and bring no what see you're not maturing is because it's something in the world that's pulling on you you're supposed to be moving to maturity you see you know we was there in the world if you was a single fella and all of a sudden you got around in there and you married now and is that right i i i kind of wonder why a fella that's mary hanging around the single buddies this is the real love is that right now you and your wife is becoming what ah don't think you're gonna handle this word if you can fulfill or have a desire for all of the word to be fulfilled in your life a little eleven eleven and a whole lump is that right that's just the way it is huh i don't know where that one comes from but i had to say it he said now look he said look help me lord he's he said now because they can't move to maturity unto perfection because one you have to understand your thinking haven't changed yet that's right brother so as a man think of in his heart is he okay so we have to understand those things is that right that god is bringing us into maturity he's bringing us into that statute of that perfect man is that right god has extended his grace and mercy to his precious children so now you young ladies if you're looking for if if you're looking for a husband you know god going to send you a husband you know what's lacking in your life huh you know how to cook some rice and you and your husband's going to love some rice now huh everybody love rice you know how to cook rice you just got to learn to cook rice huh is that right yeah we had to learn to do those things it was 10 of us we were poor it was 10 of us we had to do those things so clean you know cook everybody had that you didn't have no choice yeah you have to learn to do that things now you're a young lady then you're becoming a younger adult then you're going to become a what a wife then you're going to become a mother is that right you have to move into it it's a dispensational it's a transition right those children is a dispensational change elementary school middle school high school is that right and then you're going on into your profession or college whatever it's going to be it's a dispensational change you thank god for all those benefits that god has put there before you take advantage of those benefits hallelujah you don't know how we got that please forgive me if i'm stepping on the path i'm i'm moving out of line help me now i don't want to pass oh i want the holy ghost to come up here and say beacon stay in your place i love gray you know why because who wants to be wrong nobody right love is corrective is that right love is corrected open rebuke is better than the secret love is that right and i'm not saying don't get me wrong no the pastor's not saying that i'm just saying under the anointing the holy ghost know when to get me he know how to get me you need to get back right hello yeah let's see where we at he said he said but but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and a good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with what patience patience is a virtue see once you see that good and you see that's there see that's why you say in that message is real good believing from the heart and the saints told me to go there and listen see you have to understand no one's against you against you but how can you trust the person that can't keep their words in our time it was just hey a handshake bro you're looking for it you don't understand what we're saying a person keeping and going keeping their word we know things happen we're not saying that we're not saying legalistic i'm saying but if you if a person can't keep the word then the prophet of god go listen to him see what he said he said you can't be how can you trust a person the word is his bond hallelujah help me lord he said now look he says and then you notice the strange things now remember let me join i know i'm jumping we're still with the second step look what he's talking about he's talking about here i think like he's talking about now these religious demons he says but what is that thing he says then that comes in and takes it all away from you he says see he he says see now this is important he said but what is that thing that comes in and takes it away from you the first little difficult that rises truly if you're hearing the word and your soul is rejoicing of the word in the word it's the holy spirit that you're eating on ain't that right brother polycarp that's what he said that's what you're eating on so you're getting the holy ghost when they answered us in the family gathering you're getting the holy ghost is that right the father the word and the spirit are one huh [Music] he said now look you see i believe that you believe on everlasting life he says i believe that you accept the lord jesus gives you everlasting eternal life when you believe it is i believe one spirit let me drop down he said now look here what paul said through the upper coast of ephesus but look what paul was trying to get him to see he said but have you received what the holy ghost since you believed so the people believe that's baptist teaching is that right they try to make them think since you believe you still got the holy ghost but now you got to move in have you received the holy ghost since you believe since you believe he says now look he said not that manna he was an anchor in christ you are anchored in christ that's intellect you believe it you accept it you say that's right you recognize it to be the truth and you're a christian and you've got everlasting life by believing it you've entered into god you're on the campgrounds manna is falling and you're eating it he says now did you notice the strange thing there was a mixed multitude eating the manna bear with me he said now look people are sinners what do they accept they accept the lord jesus christ seeing the movement of the miracles the god of healing and whatever doing right open they they can open their hearts and rejoice in the sermon preached under the anointing and that's the same type of manner that the christian is eating say amen he says you see it then you always remember my doctrine he told them you have to follow god in threes he's he's perfect and now look i'm gonna jump a little bit he says now here i met he says help me lord i met people who would stand in the church and just rejoice and see some good outside go outside the church and maybe monday or tuesday and just living unbehaving becoming a christian and the man or the woman he said whoever it might be will turn again and shake your hand and i don't want to to do those things see they really don't want to be that way still with me they don't want to be that way but what he has shown him that the people need is the baptism of the holy ghost is that right and by them getting the baptism of the holy ghost now that will cause you to have a love and a burning desire for the word of god is that right you would have a thirst to come into the house of the lord it won't be a struggle so we're telling you that's why paul was saying it was two struggles the things i desired to do i did not the things i desired not to do i did is that right but he found out it was a war let me read that to you that's in romans uh seven hallelujah he says and he said but i find a law that when i who do good evil is always presence with me he said for i delight in the law of god after the what the inward man is that right desiring to feed that soul he says but i see another law in my memories warring against the law of my mind my spirit and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in the memories but he said oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death he says i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then when the mind i myself served the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin hallelujah we're about to walk it down y'all come on up the musicians come on come on up he says help me lord where is that he said but now romans 8 because i'm not going to get to the third one there's no way it's just too much tonight for wednesday night what were you walking with later on when you see when you're moving those two three steps what the prophet was showing you was one they had to come and get out of the intellectual way of walking the second you need the baptism of the holy ghost to move into that in the third you have to move into the holiness of holy and when you get into that holiness of holy he was showing you now when you get there and behind the veil which christ was that high priest that came once for all ripped that veil on calvary for each and every one of us is that right so now so you'll be able to go behind the veil all right and then you can live in that veil that's what he was saying you live that life as a true christian you're not up you're not down you're not back you're not poor once a person move into the things that god has moved them into maybe the lord's will we'll get a chance to go and look into that but we look unto the hill to where our strength and our help cometh from something soft there brother we're looking through the hill and where our strength and our help cometh from he was typing it with that manner that manna that he got around there typed it with the pot of gold that pot that they had inside of the holiness of holiness the manna was always fresh the man always dropped down fresh for you and god came in and this is the way that he promised to bring them out this is the way that he promised to live that life not being tossed not being tossed to and fro but you have been justified you have been sanctified you have been filled with the holy ghost and now when you're feeling the holy ghost now you're resting you're resting in there we're at behind the veil the veil has been ripped when christ went to calvary and shed his blood for each and every one of us we don't have to worry about anything now there's no worry christ is taking care of all of our needs is that right but now we are speaking the word with faith we speak in a word with boldness you constantly stay in that light and then through in the church ages it gave us some light is that right in each of this age but when god came down and broke those seals and when he broke those seals and now we were able to move it to the holiness of holiness because all the loose sins was tied in all the light that light that stayed lit back there all the time that's why you see that person that's always joyous i'm closing my bible that's always joyous that's always staying in the presence of god and nothing seems to bother them where they've been they've moved behind the veil they're praying they're reading their bible every day they're studying the word is that right they're listening to the message they're rejoicing in what they're hearing they know they're letting it fall on good ground it's bringing forth much fruit they're maturing in the word they're waiting on patience when the promises of god what he said he's going to do he's going to do is that right hallelujah let us bow our heads thank you jesus hallelujah lord god we know father it was like a shotgun lord god message here lord jesus but father we we know lord god your servant wanted to know why the people were tossed oh lord god all that you have given us in this hour here now lord jesus we come in this time lord god we're a glorious hour for your precious bride father everything lord god is optimistic we look on the bright side of all things because we know all things are working for the good for them that love the lord lord god father we ask you to forgive me for anything that are said or done lord god that that wasn't good or edifying your people here your children tonight have mercy on my soul lord jesus father we want you to bless the pastor his family the deacons the trustees lord god and all those father that are pressing their way out the musicians lord god the song leaders jesus we ask you to continue to strengthen them lord god and wherever they're weak lord god send the word of grace father so that they won't be tossed to and fro lord god but let them lord god live behind that veil let them live in that light lord god day and night let the mind stay steadfast on your word lord jesus and father we promise to give you the praise and the honor and the glory so we thank you lord jesus and by faith we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen amen i'm gonna try to sing a little bit this song y'all help me you're gonna i'm gonna get started and you come behind me i said it's nothing like the presence of the lord i said it's nothing like the presence of the lord [Music] and as we seek his face he is here in this place and there's nothing like the presence of the law somebody notice they say it again say there's nothing like the present [Music] there is nothing like the presence of the then lord seek his face he is here in this place and it's nothing like the presence [Music] someone [Music] his pace he is there in this place and it's nothing like the presence of his joy saints his joy you can stand this joy [Music] there is nothing like the praises of the lord [Music] there's nothing like the presence of the lord amen how many enjoy the word tonight hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen [Music] you know like the brighter stare that [Music] the first pull is healing right second pull is discernment and the third pull is the opening of the word amen but if you go to the same bible the scripture says that the word of god is the discerner of the thought and intent of the what so the word discern in other words the second pull is in the word [Music] and i send my word and my word did water my dear my word did what so the first pull is in the word [Music] so when you reach the third pole automatically that first and second pull are automatically locked in and that is why brother branham says the highest form of god to unfold himself because all god is bundled up into the word amen it is not an intellectual religion it is everything is coming from the heart and as the brother has been uh preaching i keep thinking over and i say oh my god maybe one day we gotta talk about marriage amen because it's truly from here amen the bible says the marriage of who why did he have to be married like a lamb [Music] why he was not married like god [Music] for him to get married he have to be in morphy into the lamb amen because brother branham said at the beginning he was that eternal spirit that filled everything amen there was nothing no space no time nothing it was just eternity and he was the one that was feeling eternity and brother branham said that being had what we call supreme intelligence he knows everything he is omnipresent he is omnipotent he is omniscient he knows all everything that is god amen but at that stage he could not get married you know how he got married brother branham said within him there was an attribute that was called the lugos amen hallelujah can i get one minute or two or three [Music] brother branham say within him this being here this eternal being inside him there was attribute amen and brother branham say one of the attributes was called the logos amen and that logos really was crushed everybody clear so god have to take the logos and pull it out of him amen in other words god birth the logos amen when he birthed the logos the logos is a special attribute that means the fullness of god amen so when the logos came out of god god could not stay outside of the logos because the logos means our god amen when he was inside god he was just a thought when he came out of god and god spoken logos amen god could not stay and the logos going out when he said logos the logos was pulling god with him did you get it did you get it in other words the logos was the envelope that came out of god and when he was coming out of god that envelope remained open and as he's coming out of god god is getting into it take psalm chapter 104. you started not me amen you started not me take psalm 104 blessed the lord oh oh lord my god that are very great they are clothed with water and with water number two verse two who covers that self with water as a water as an envelope amen so that pillar of fire that we call the logos when he was coming out of god that's why he was called the son of god amen that's why when they saw the four uh the the three rebel children in the fire furnace nebuchadnezzar said he looks like the son of god he was a pillar of fire you cannot burn the pillar of fire amen so when that attribute was coming out of god it was coming like an envelope that opened up so when it comes out of god it means oh god so god cannot stay there god have to get inside that amen that's what makes the pillar of fire god amen amen amorphy and kenosis together everybody and brother branham said this christ here was the very heart of god amen so god pull his heart first before he pulls his wife amen so before he get married he have to pull his heart he could not get married as a supreme intelligence amen he have to pull christ first then he made christ flesh and the beginning was and the word was with god and the word was and the word was made water christ came then he took him to calvary and pierced him now the wife of the lamb can come it is the wife of the heart of god so marriage is a hard situation never here anybody care everybody here marriage is a hard situation it is never here and men usually miss that and that's why we get trouble in the marriage amen i was talking to somebody i say this is one person there is another one here this one is getting here with their personal agenda and this one is coming up with their personal agenda you think it's not your personal agenda but it is because you are getting into married so that i can get a husband that is this that is tall that is this he's gonna buy me this he's gonna do this he's gonna do this he's gonna do this he's gonna do this that's your list that's how you jump into marriage and he also is coming up i need somebody who can cook for me who can do this who can do this who can do this who can do this and you jump into it and when you get that everybody want to get their benefit let me stop there [Laughter] and you're going to continue thinking amen amen and we don't understand one another amen i'm supposed to be doing this she's supposed to be understanding no can i read one more let's go to face corinthian then i'll stop here something to ponder sorry first collection chapter seven you heard him talking about marriage here right say hold your wife what is he just holding here we've been married five years you just want me to hold it hold on hold on hold on you don't understand what gold means first corinthians 7 are you there verse 28. let me skip that no let's go by first turning but if that do what mary that is not sin so how many are married here you didn't see now and if emerge if a virgin mary she has not seen nevertheless such shall have water trouble where show you jumping into trouble did you know that when you say i want to get married you want to jump into trouble you want me to tell you you're jumping into sweetness that's why you got disappointed okay let's continue young people they're looking at me like brother stephen not my time but i spare you but this i said brethren the time is short and he remained that both dead i have wife be as though they have none and they that weep as though they would not and did i rejoice as though they rejoiced no we just not ended up by us though they possess not in satisfaction and did i use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world pacific way now watch carefully but i would have you with that carefulness why paul he that is who caring for the things that belong to who right easy stay single take care of your own problem sit home and you don't want nobody to bother you you can come back from work and you sit and relax you don't want to talk to nobody because you think oh that's fine not when you're married amen i wish the whole church was here did you get it so you want to stay free stay single stay free no trouble love the lord with all your heart let wisdom be your sister no problem no brother stephen i want to get married fine amen here that is a merit care for the things that belong to the lord how he may please who praise god i want to please you lord amen verse 33 bird he that is water careful the things of the lord caring for water the word how he may please who so when you're entering marriage what should be your normal agenda to please who and wife to please who how did you jump into marriage to please who selfish 34 there is a difference also between a wife and who the unmarried woman cared for the things of the that she may be holy both in the body and in spirit but she that is married careful the things of the how she may please who so when you jump into the marriage you're going to do what that's what i'm going to ask you if you want to get married in this church who are you trying to please or you wanna be pleased are you getting to do something because when the heart of god came down the heart of god was royal the heart of god was filled with all riches but that heart made himself poor so that we the bread might become water not he he kept himself rich so that the bread can do things for him no he himself become a servant as he's entering into the world the bible say christ enter as a servant it's written in your bible he's entering for service amen everything he has he have to give away he gave his time he gave his money he gave his glory he stripped himself of everything so that he make sure that's why you hear paul say husband love you as who let's pray let me stop there that's enough for you to chew amen and ponder if you really you want to get right that's why you hear brother brandon before you get married get the holy ghost to set your heart correctly and many things are done wrong because of not being taught right amen and he doesn't understand me you don't understand him because you always want to be understood you never took time to understand him and he always want to be understood and this one is wired differently and this one is wired differently and this one interpret things differently when the other one interpret things differently this one love means pay the bills the other love means sit with me on belk you can pay all the bills as long as you don't stand in that belk it doesn't mean anything let me stop you're going to understand me later let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for everything you are doing for us father i know why and you know exactly why i have to say what i said because i heard you speaking through your servant to the married people lord the devil has been troubling the family a lot and the lack of understanding of certain things has been the trouble where we keep casting out devils and don't understand that sometimes it's not even a devil it's just we were not thinking like the brothers say the correct mind has not been opened up yet lord may you help the family move away from those personal agenda and may they join together truly into one center of agenda which is to live and to express eternal life because eternal life is living for others if lord father we can all understand that not only to the married people but to one another in this church as a church family as musician as trustees as deacon as pastor as laity and every single person lord father is gonna make our life much much more better and to appreciate one another better lord we are committing this church unto the hand as we go into our respective place father may your blood continue to protect us may you strengthen lord father brother make his family i'm glad when i saw him yesterday he was so strong and he began to even smile and father i can see that you're working in a mysterious way but i know lord father that they have to leave and go back home lord and father when he sees his wife normally it's going to be a different situation but we are trusting on your grace that can give him strength because you say you should not you cannot put up on upon us that which is greater than our strength father unleash that strength that you have put in this family lord to go through this trial because the water should not overwhelm us father nor the fire burn us lord we commit them unto the hand guide us through everything consecrate our heart lord and prepare us lord father in that diary so that when we meet again on sunday you can speak to us from on high as lord father we're gonna call your servant to come here lord and to lead us with one of course before we teach me father continue to anoint him lord in the name of jesus christ amen brady able if you can lead us with one song then we can go home amen did you get it did you really really get it [Music] amen blessed be the name of the lord it's a great key he's gonna avoid a lot of headache and he's gonna avoid a lot of trouble and he's gonna put you on a neutral ground and later on you're gonna understand that it is just nothing but living for others amen he didn't have to do that he didn't sin there was no sin on him nobody could convince him of unbelief but he had to drop down and did that's exactly what adam did no wonder he was the second adam amen so just remember that take your personal agenda off look at the benefit of the family look at the whole church as a family amen look at the whole bride as a family because eventually we're going to live on eternity together never to be separated again yes my brother [Music] for you are part of me and i'll not rest until you are at my side and i will do all [Music] you are my bride let's sing that again he said fear [Music] my [Applause] [Music] and so i'm casting all my cares on you [Music] oh yes you love me it's redemption redemption by your blood that's the greatest [Music] [Music] for redemption that's what seven angels in the clouds testify me sing it one more time with me say so i'm casting all my kiss [Music] you love me oh yes you love me it's redemption by blood redemption by your that's the greatest [Music] [Music] no longer y'all are dismissed tonight children of zion rejoice children of rejoice jesus is alive
