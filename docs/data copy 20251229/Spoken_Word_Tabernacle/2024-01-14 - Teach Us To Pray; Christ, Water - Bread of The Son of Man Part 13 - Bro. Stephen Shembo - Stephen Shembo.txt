on what we're doing okay you ready for it we want to make sure it's coming from the prophet amen blessed be the name of the Lord then I will get to my routine brother brandham says this in question and answer in 1964 which is after the seals uh that was preached in August the 30th in the morning paragraph 1 182 it's a long paragraph so I have to take what was necessary to kind of fill it into the into my slide brother brandham say that he was a man and a what a woman standing before what the alter holding one another's hand say I take you dear to be my loveful weed wife see she said I take you dear to be my lawful weighted husband why he said this is strange so there were a couple there renewing their vow but the preacher was not there they say this Pentecost he said this man and woman are getting married without a preacher and so he just uh so he just sat down and waited and after they made their what to live true to one another only death will separate them they put what their arms around one another and they did what kissed each other that's brother BR I'm saying that can you say Amen they were renewing The Vow when the Finish renewing The Vow they did what who say that the prophet can you say Amen they kiss each other somebody's ambushed to brother Kelly they kiss each other they turn around and walk out doing what smiling so you're going to experience that for the first time in spoken word right amen he says just a moment he said I'm kind of curious I'm a stranger say you are getting married say yes without a preacher he says what no say we've been married how many years 40 years and the one who's going to get their vow renewed today has been married for 40 years am blessed be the name of the Lord so the coat fit perfectly they say that we've been married 40 years he said we got married right here at this altar how many years 40 years ago and every year we come back and do what renew our vow brother brandham say that is what kind of idea a good idea so renewing a vow is it a bad idea or good idea good idea blessed be the name of the Lord so as we begin with the song let's go ahead and sing this song and the congregation will be standing as we

behalf of the FES family and the church spoken word Tabernacle we welcome you to this renewal of vow ceremony between Robert and Laurel Faby amen as I was uh looking for a scripture to read just briefly about this renewal of vow before we go into it this is the scripture that the lord gave me that came to my mind and this is what I'm going to pray to you it's in the book of deuteron Deuteronomy 8:2 we read this over and over but today it's going to be special for you because this is 40 years and you're going to find your 40 years in the scripture yes sir the Bible says in Deuteronomy chapter 8: 2 that if you want to open up that would be great you can join me I give you some few seconds so everybody can read it and see what the Lord is going to do to their lives from this day on am amen verse two and thou shall remember all the way which the Lord th God LED you these 40 Years of marriages Amen in the wilderness doesn't mean God was not there God provided with food God provided with water and everything I'm just going to read it to Humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou w keep his commandment or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger now you know what it means and fed thee with Mana which thou knowest not neither did thy father knows that he may make thee know that men do not leave by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of the Lord do men leave so all these 40 years God want you to get to one conclusion that the word is is above everything amen he says thy Remnant works not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these 40 years I don't see any of your feet fell so God has been gracious to us he said thou shall also consider in th heart that as a man chesten his son so the Lord thy God chesten thee therefore thou shall keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to fear Him this is your message for the Lord thy God bring thee into a good land sir after this 40 Years of wilderness now you're going to transition to a different marriage different than what you have ever seen amen he said for the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land a land of Brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and Hills a land of Wheat and barley and Vine and and fig trees and palm grenades a land of olive oil and honey a land wherein th shall eat bread without scarceness thou shall not lack anything in it remind God this a land whose stones are iron and out of whose Hill thou mayest dig brass when thou has eaten and are full then thou shall bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he has given thee so the time of Mana is over now it's the time for you to eat the old corner and new marriage experience that you

verse uh 27 very familiar scripture to you in this church so we should be good I believe the sermon on Wednesday is self-explanatory so clean up where you need to clean up and let's move on so God can bless you if you don't clean up you are blocking yourself God won't drop that blessing on you if you don't want to clean up because he's going to mess you up amen amen glory be to the name of the Lord verse uh 27 the B says does the eagle Mount up at your command and make her nest on high so we talking about an ego you might be seated amen we still about the Daily Bread amen amen we talked into we went down now we cling back up he says verse 27 does the ego Mount up at your command and make her nest on high she dwells and abides on what the Rock do you see where the ego says the eego are by the way upon the rock you know what it means right so the ego stays where with water Revelation so if you an eagle you need to stay where on the Rock uhhuh praise be to the name of the Lord verse 28 she dwell and abides on the Rock upon the crack of The Rock and the Strong place from there from The Rock there from the Revelation she does what seek the pray so where do you see where does the ego Seeker pray the rock so if the ego is on the rock as soon as he sits on the Rock then from that position of the rock he can begin to search the prey the prey is his food so the ego search the prey from a position of a revelation when he is standing on the Revelation this is when his eyes begin to screen everything because his eyes are anointed now amen this is the position that he sees Praise by pray we're talking about food we clear from there from The Rock she seeks the pray she spies out the food and her eyes behold what a far off so the eag sees far off from the rock so your vision gets more clear are we together when you are on the Revelation amen because without a revelation you don't see anything see nothing without a revelation you can be walking and trampling your blessing but you don't see the blessing but once the Revelation come on you you might look at the ground you say where a minute I'm sitting on a gold mine right here because of the Revelation so the Revelation give the ego the position to spy to see or to spy her praise or her food and also it give a uh an ego a clear per uh perspection perception perception the ego can see clearly when he sits on the Rock Amen her Young young one also do what suck up blood so the eego drink blood yes the eagle not only do they eat meat not only do they eat meat amen amen not only that's e go eat meat steak food but the eagle also drink blood SS gross but that's where the son of man is hidden amen her young one also suck up blood and where they slain are the carcass uh-huh there what she so if you want to find the ego somewhere if he's not on the nest on the Rock spying food you will see him laying on a carcass where there is a fresh kill amen where there is a slain where there is food there is a slain there is a carcass this carcass is not aena carcass because aena carcass are sometime rotten this is a fresh one am am amen amen if the eag already ate the meat or have the food or the the Meat part whatever you call it steak or whatever why what is the purpose of drinking blood what is in the blood what is in the blood you already got the meat yes sir you got the protein and everything what is in the blood that the eagle is sucking the young one are sacking the blood so they don't just eat meat but eego when they eat meat they also suck the blood in other word a food a eagle food must be a bleeding food am everybody okay whatever it is the meat of an eagle must be bleeding because the eagle eat or partake of the meat and then also drink blood what is in the blood what is the blood of an animal the blood of a prey the blood of of of a rabbit or whatever what is in the blood this is what the Bible says in Genesis chapter 9 verse4 the Bible say but the flesh which is over there let me put this this way I usually go slowly so we stay together okay if I Rush quickly like an evangelist at least some of you remain in a amen so but flesh with the life thereof which is the what the blood thereof shall ye not what eat so the blood has life am I'm reading the Bible yes sir the blood has life so when we talk about blood we talking about life amen amen amen so the food the meat ofo provide the life and provide also flesh keep that in mind Leviticus 17:14 for it is the life of All Flesh the blood of it is for the life thereof we clear therefore I say unto the children of Israel ye you shall not you shall eat the blood of no man or flesh for the life of All Flesh is what the blood thereof that's why our steak are well done amen God don't want as don't want his children didn't want anybody on Israel to eat blood but the ego out out can eat the Flesh and suck the blood the the eag are we together he said for the flesh for the life of All Flesh is the blood thereof whosoever eat it shall be how cut off so what I'm trying to draw from here is the blood is the life so when the ego is eating his food he's drawing nutrient right right to grow and he's also sacking life yes sir amen from the Fresh kill that he get the food of an igle provide nutrient and he also provide life amen are we together blessed be the name of the Lord let's go to Matthew 24 verse 27 glory be to God we give you many several example in the natural about our food and our thirst and everything now we climbing back up in the spiritual realm if you dare you can say Amen Matthew 24: 27 amen the Bible say for as the lightning come out of the East and shine even to the what West so shall also the coming of who the son of man be so we talking about the son of man it's very important to understand understand his name the son of man you know what it means right son of man means what prophet amen verse 288 for where soever the what carcass is you remember that right from job wheresoever the carcass is there will the ego do what be gathered together so if there is no you won't get a eagle if you want to get Eagles in the [Applause] church Hallelujah you can preach whatever you want to preach in the church you will get a church full of people Pentecost are filled with people in the church but they don't have the caucus amen Baptist are filled with people we got mega churches in America where preacher are already in mess amen come on Amen the problem is an eagle don't care about the size of the church but the eagle is looking for the [Applause] carcass where the carcass is that's where you going to find the eagle if there is no cus the eego won't stay there but if you tell the eagle there is a carcass over there no matter what is here no matter how good this environment is no matter how many friends the ego got here the ego will Rel all his friend and go where the carcass is because where the carcass is it's where his life is that's where he can live that's where he can continue to grow if you stay in a place where there is no ccus no carcus then you die am in other word the location of an eagle depend upon the the availability of his food let me St it again so he goes all over America I don't know why I have to say this the location of an ego when an ego choose a location let me drop down again plan when a negro choose a church when an eagle choose a state am when an eagle choose a city where he's going to stay when an eagle is looking for a job before he can accept the job the eego must make sure there is a caucus where the job is because you can get your job but you will die spiritually and this is what is happening in America this is what is happening all over United States some of the eag say we can stay where we are but we can stream for a long distance the streaming is good if you were in church can you say Amen streaming started more after Co but if ego as they see Israel and everything that is going on they don't forsake the assembly they will try to be in church they don't take streaming for an excuse streaming is an it's it's it's a it's a supplement but it's not the man food they using streaming to supplement them but they must have a normal Church yes sir everybody together everybody body together so before you move somewhere else check for the caucus what I'm trying to say make sure there is a solid Church don't move you say no because they pay people more over there you going to die with your [Applause] money I'm going to Michigan because over there car are cheaper so you basing your life upon the upon the price of a car or the price of a house because houses are cheaper in California that's the reason why I'm going to go to California do you have a church in California brother Bram say California is a cemetery for [Applause] Preacher Brother Bram say California is a graveyard for the preacher so a message believer should not be there can you say Amen if you want leave there one of this day you going to be at the bottom of the ocean are we together are we together are we together the location of an eagle the place of an eagle the position of an eagle where an eagle is where he stays where he is is a place where the carcass is am if you want to Joy an eag put a carcass there amen so in the morning he can sit on the Rock and when he's on the Revelation he's looking left and right because his survival is based upon the life of the car the ego need the Flesh and the ego need also the [Music] blood not can food no yes not food that has been dried up where the life is no longer there it was good for certain days but it's not good for today he was good for Luther it was good for Wesley but it's no longer good today am everybody together are we okay before you make any move before you do something check if there is a carcass there check if there is a fresh kill there check if the pure and adulterated message of the hour is preach there I'm not saying there is a message church because we got message church that look like Baptist we got m a church that look like Presbyterian we got m a church that are like Pentecostal you need to get your gauge and put your DNA in the church and make sure that church is delivering the message correctly am without adding anything or removing anything we want to suck the blood of the message we want to eat everything whatever we your Mar Bram say we want to eat it whe it's sweet or be it doesn't matter matter of fact the lamb in Egypt they were eating that with be herbs so they so they say the blue cheese is good are we together are we together look at what you're using to base your location where the ego is that's where where the carcass is that's where the ego go ego don't go just like that ego don't come and say you know they are paying more people there ah okay I'm taking my family there ego don't move like that before the ego move he say wait a minute do we have a church who's preaching over there what kind of caliber is it is he a man that can meet My Level because my level is not a Luther my level is not Wesley TD J won't meet My Level there is only one meal that can meet My Level I don't want to be undernourished I want a good meal and only the message of the seven angels message believer wherever you are wake up the time is Jo night Israel is in trouble you need to wake [Applause] up because everything you will accomplish will stay everything you will accomplish here will stay but there is one thing I don't want to leave my family here as for me and my houses we need to find a ccass we need to hear your preacher how is he preaching I don't want to hear your spion I don't want you to be cing people that we don't know in this church the Bible say the b say that's the ccus that's we want don't play with your life because of friend don't play with your life because of your body somewhere there and you put your whole family in Jey because you want to please somebody while the children are dying I didn't plan all of this I didn't plan all of this I don't know where it's coming from so somebody need it somewhere Hallelujah amen amen so the son of man works with the carcass amen there is a message Church there it doesn't matter it won't even impress me because I want to see who who's preaching there if I go there I listen to it I say Ah that's a brother that's a good brother that one is good if you go go Fellowship over there because I know that that's ego food we're not the only one we got people all around but I want to make sure who's there before they poke you with all kind of vaccine and before you know it well the message not everything that is in the message is right now you start you you you are eating some uh Wild G or something come on glory to God where am I at my friend let's go to John chapter 4 when you start like this then I don't know if I'm going to finish my Oh Glory to [Laughter] God you know what let's just pray can we pray Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly again father this morning thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father I'm committing myself and this congregation unto th hand Lord may you move us completely out of the way may you be the one speaking and the one hearing Lord father take everything unto thy hand and lead us by your spirit in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen John chapter 4 very familiar scripture there is a meat there is a flesh and there is a drink you see it right here amen there is a drink right here let me put it right here again ego have food which is the Flesh and ego have also drink which is the blood right and in the blood it's life that's right amen amen am eager for his food for his hunger now we clear and for his thirst amen glory to God uh John chapter 4 let's go to verse 7 if you there you can say Amen there come a woman of Samaria you know the story to do what draw water Jesus said to her give me to drink for his disciple were gone away to the city to buy meat then says the woman of Samaria to him how is that you being a Jew ask drink of me which I am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the water Sam verse 10 and Jesus uh Jesus answered and said to her if you knew the gift of God Amen and who it is that say to you give me to drink so you got to know two things you have to know number one the gift of God the gift of God what is the gift of God call repent and be baptized in the name of the and you shall be filled with the gift of the what if you know the gift of God Amen and who and the person of Christ the one who's asking you to give me water if you know those two if you have a revelation of these two things if you know what was the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the very life of God Amen if you knew the life of God and if you knew who was talking to you asking you for food for drink yes amen give me to drink you would have asked him in other word you will be the one asking that's right amen and he would have given you water Living Water so there is two waters there that's amen what I want you to remember is the Jesus that is talking here his name is the son of man Jesus the son of man amen and Jesus say if you know the gift of God and who it is that is talking to you the person that is talking to you you will be the one asking me and I will give you not your water there is two waters there is a natural water and there is also another another water which is a spiritual water which is the living water and Jesus say that person the one who is talking to you he would have give you living water so who got Living Water who has Living Water so the one who have living water is the son of man it's Jesus Christ himself so Jesus had water and the woman also had water there is a water natural amen and there is also a water that is spiritual the spiritual one is with Jesus and the natural one is in the well amen and Jesus is saying give me your word and the woman say ah you as American me and you there's no dealing with it he say if you knew who would ask you you will be the one as soon as you see me you say hey wait a minute give me water and the water that I can give you is not this one it's a living word this word is a Living Word a water that have life amen amen verse uh before I move there the one who has the word is the son of man in other word Jesus Christ even though he look like a man amen he was a notion amen he's a notion working like a man sir in other word in Jesus there was water am but you need to know who he is so he can give you the water the Bible says this in John chapter 1 verse 16 of his what fullness have we what all received so we all receive from his fullness because remember in Jesus Christ dwelleth the fullness of the godhead how Bly so Jesus have the fullness of God the whole ocean was with him and John is saying that from his fullness this is where we take one so every one of us can draw water from him are we together yes sir the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 12:3 for by how many Spirit one Spirit are we have all baptized into what one body whether we be who Jews or what Gentiles whether we be What bond or what and have been all made to do what drink into how many Spirit one spirit so all our drink our spiritual drink is in one man that's why he said if you knew who was talking with you you have the whole ocean here you have the fullness of God here you have the fullness of the Living Water right here amen if you knew that what you're talking to is really a fullness of water you could you should be the one asking the word first am am are we together verse 11 the B says that the woman says to him sir you have what nothing to draw so when Jesus is saying I'm going to give you living water the woman look he say where is Your Bucket you don't even have a bucket so where are you going to where are you going to get the water he said the woman said to him sir you have nothing to Jo and the well is how from where then have you that living water in other word where is that water coming from this woman need to ask Israel are we together because when Israel was journeying Into the Wilderness there was a rock following them everybody okay when Israel needed that water The Rock begin to produce natural water so Jesus not only produce spiritual water but he can also give you natural water am am amen this rock here this rock here when he was Israel in the wilderness amen he produced natural water so if this woman W water Jesus could have produced natural water and say Get it that's right amen but Jesus doesn't want to give it to her because he gave to Israel and all of them died are you following me I'm going to get to that but Jesus is talking about another water which is a spiritual water so it's a rock that can provide naturally and he can also provide spiritually but if you deal with that rock on the natural base only you can get the benefit and die and go to hell are you following me but if you deal with the rock on the spiritual L then that rock will produce both the natural and the spiritual are you following me so that Rock when he look at the woman he say if I give him the natural water it's not going to solve her situation I'm going to give her a different water and then I can rescue her in a different level are we together yes sir amen verse 12 are you greater than our father Jacob which gave us what the and drank theirself thereof himself and his children and his water Jesus answered and said to her whosoever drink of water this water shall do what thirst again this is natural if I give it to you now you're going to be satisfied tomorrow you will need it again tomorrow you will need it again and I'm able to do that have any problem but I want to qu something first am remember thirst it's in the natural and it's in the spiritual you got the thirst of the body you remember and there is a thirst of the Soul we clear now he says but whosoever drink of the water that I shall give him shall what never thirst but the water that I will give him shall be what in him a what a well of what water doing what up into ever springing up into what everlasting life so the water Jesus is talking about is not like I'm going to give you this bottle of water no no sir he said listen if I ask you water all you can do you can only give me a bucket I can drink and that's it but me I have a different world and that word if I give it to you number one you won't taste anymore everybody okay and if the word ever get into you that word become a well I'm reading to you the scripture in other word the word I'm giving you I'm not really giving you word I'm actually making you swallow a well and once that well is establishing you that well begin to produce use water that's why you won't tast anymore because you have your own personal resource of water that is quenching your thirst all the time in other word what I'm giving you is a well of water and that well of water will begin to produce water that's why you won't taste anymore hallu and that well of water can also produce your natural water a because the water that is coming up there is giving you eternal life so if you drink from that water you are drinking life if you sucking from the blood you sucking life are we together are we together verse 15 the woman says to him do what sir do what give me this water give me this water that I do what I thirst not neither come here to do what yes listen to this in Revelation 21: 6 the Bible says this and he says unto me it is done I am what and whoa the beginning and the what end I will give unto him that do what is a thirst a fountain of what Water of Life how free Revelation 22:1 17 and the spirit and the bread says what come let him that Hearth say what come and let him that a thirst do what whosoever will let him take what The Water of Life how freely so Christ is our source of water in other words Jesus Christ is our Water of Life are we together are we together let's go to John chapter 7 we already prayed John chapter 7 and we start climbing verse 37 if you dare you can say amen God will give you water it's a spiritual water but once you drink that water that water become a well and a well springing up everlasting life that's why you don't trust anymore because in toward you inside of you you got water when your soul need it the soul continue to drink because there is a Fant there is a well that is bubbling inside and you don't have to ask anything anymore our water our thirst can be quenched yes sir by Christ we clear John 7:37 if you there you can say Amen in the last day that great day of the feast the Feast of Tabernacle Jesus stood and cried saying what if any man thirst If any man thirst remember thirst and hunger amen let him come unto me and do what he that believes on me as the scriptures has said out of his what belly shall flow what rivers of Living Water do you see that so you become a river in you out of that belly that belly is not your stomach that belly is your soul am in your soul there is a river Living Water and brother Bram said the well and the river means the same thing it is not two separate things he says out of his belly shall Flow River of water water do you see the same water in John 4 but he spoke he of what the spirit so that living water is what the Holy Ghost clear which day that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet what glorified we clear so far we clear so far my subject this morning is teach us to pray Christ the water and the bread of the son of man am amen the water and the bread of the son of man we just seen clearly that the son of man is our water he's the one that gives us water amen the son of man give us water amen that's clear because he when he give you water he put a well in you he put a river in you and you yourself become a Fant of Living Water amen so if you need a water if you are thirsting you need to go where the son of man is amen are we together not the Son of God uhuh I'm talking about the son of man the one who was talking to the woman was the son of man the one who spoke in John 7 was the son of man the son of man means god is made flesh and God is made flesh in the office of a prophet when you see God is in human flesh in the office of a prophet then there is a f right there am amen amen everybody together we have been dealing with givers this day our daily bread or give us day by day our daily bread we understand what it means and we found out that this bread is establish a relationship between the one providing and the one who is in need that's why Joseph used the bread the corn of Egypt in order to bring the whole country of Egypt back to Pharaoh so that they country can be completely Pharaoh in other word all Egypt belong to Pharaoh the people belong to Pharaoh the land belong to Pharaoh the C belong to Pharaoh there is nothing in Egypt that doesn't belong to Pharaoh so pharaoh and his people become one and Joseph achieved that by the bread are we together are we together so this bread is not really to just give you food but it's a mean that the provider is you using to bring you back to himself am are we together are we together let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 10 glory to godallah we good on time my friend 1 Corinthians chapter 10 as we claming 1 Corinthian chapter 10 verse 1 very familiar scripture if you thereare you can say Amen moreover Brethren you there my friend yes I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our father were how under the and they passed through the what the SE we clear and they were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea and the word baptism you know that it's not something inside it is a not word expression it has nothing to do with the inside they were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea and they did eat of the water the same spiritual meat and did all drink of the water same spiritual drink so there is a drink and a meat amen are we together am there is a drink and a meat all of them are spiritual for they drunk of that spiritual water that did what follow and that rock was who Christ so Christ is the one that was producing water am and Christ doesn't only produce natural water but he also have living water with his spiritual water which is the holy spirit am because in Christ we all are baptized into one body and we drink into one Spirit are we together verse five but with what many of them God was not what we for they were how overthrown in the what the Wilderness so even though these people were under the cloud even though they were baptized unto Moses the prophet even though they were drinking and then eating both spiritual food God was not happy with them and God killed all of them why that's why are say that being in the message doesn't mean anything saying a message Church doesn't mean anything we need to know what is going on over there because you can be in the message but you are not in the message Hallelujah let me say that again you can be in the message camp but you are not in the message that's why brother Bram say we didn't come to talk about the message to argue about the message to discuss about the message but we come to get in the message and the message is Christ are we together are we together amen why did they die on the Wilderness why did God kill them why let's go to Hebrew chapter 3 glory to God Amen Hallelujah Hebrew chapter 3 verse 17 if you dare you can say Amen amen Hebrew 3:17 the Bible say but with whom was he griev how many years 40 years in the wilderness was he not with them that had sin amen out of all of them only two enters that's right whose caucus fell way in the wilderness and to whom saw he that they should not enter into what his rest so they could not enter in the rest amen but to them that did what believe not how can you see what Moses did and you don't believe how can you drink from a rock and you don't believe how can you eat Mana every day coming from heaven and you don't believe what kind of unbelief is this in word God was taking care of them as a father and he was doing that to catch their faith but they could not clamp to the faith and God got tired and say this is not the Generation Kill Them All but they were baptized under the crow they went all the way to the Red Sea they eat the spiritual food spiritual manner drank water but with all of them God was please because to please God you must have what fath it is impossible without faith to please God because him that come to God must believe that God is what and he's the rewarder of those that do what so these people follow God but did not believe God are we together I'm getting there my friend verse 19 the Bible say so we see that they could not enter in because of what unbelief so everything that was done all the miracle it looks like they believe but they didn't believe so God was trying to pull them to a different level but they would not go up God sent Mana he say I sent Mana to teach you something they don't understand he sent what that they don't understand he sent what they don't he said no no no let me wipe them all let's go to verse four verse one let us therefore do what fear L A Promise being left of us of entering in into the rest any of you should seem what in other word be careful because there were people like you that experience God doing many thing in their life but still they were not believing what they were following maybe you don't understand what I'm saying this is why after 30 years people are leaving the message they follow the message they were blessed by the message they got money from the message they got housing from the message and after 20 years the message was not good because all and long they never believe the message they even preach the message but they never believe the message Judah preached the gospel but Judah never believe on Jesus Christ amen how can you be in the message 25 years and then you leave we were calling you brothers and sisters and you are more holy than all of us you wear so long dresses we thought you the spiritual sister yes sir many of them God God was not pleased with them in other way they were following the message they were in the camp of the message but they never believ the message amen are we together are we together God say you need to feel you need to examine where you are are you here to get the Tiding of the message and then after 25 years you live with the Tiding of the message if you leave the message return everything that the message gave you if you are baren and we pray for you and you start having children if you leave the message leave your children back the [Applause] message because we take the benefit of the message but we don't want the message this is what God is telling Israel I am giving you benefit but that's not what I'm looking for I want you to clim higher are we together Shake somebody else hand my friend you know what it means Glory to God we there we there God destroyed them because of what unbelief so do not be surprise young people when they tell you so and so left the message don't be it happened in the firstday it is even a good proof that we are following the right [Applause] thing because the first Exodus had the pillar of fire the second Exodus has the pillar of Fire our Exodus had the pillar of fire so what happened there must happen today because Jesus Christ is the same if it doesn't happen we got a wrong message but because it happened now we know we are in the [Applause] truth in other word they living of people in the message it's actually stabilizing the elect the devil thought he's making a big show he didn't know that the elect now begin to be convinced that really this message is right all things work together for [Music] good it Lord when you see Judas betraying Jesus Christ is he it is very good but I'm not Judas but it's very good because the F because the script CH fulfilled and I'm I'm very sure of Jesus [Music] Christ it depend on the angle you looking at my friend so don't be discouraged and don't be talk about oh so and so he's leaving the message so they left the message because they were not in the message [Music] for me the message is in me so if I live I'm living with the message that's why David say though I walk in the water of the shadow of what the message is still with me hall hallelujah do you know Jesus went to hell do you know how he went to hell with which body did he take he took the theop the theop is the word so he Enter Hell with the word so if you take me to hell I will enter with the [Applause] message in other words nothing can separate me from the message I if you C here you see the message you cut again you see the [Applause] message I smell like the message I'm sweating the message this ceron is going a different direction bu let's go to verse four chapter 4 he said uh uh verse two he said for to as was what the gospel preached continue my friend as well as unto them but the what word preach did what not profit them why not being mixed with faith in them that hurt so they heard the message but the message doesn't change them because when the message enter in them there is no decoder come on because when the message come he must find the message and the message and the message mix together and then they blend together amen for we which have what believe we do enter where into rest as he said as I have what sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although they what work were what were finished where from the foundation of the world so this whole thing is connected with predestination when we all hear the message we are hearing the message according to our seed hallah Hallelujah if we come from God we are hearing God when God is talking we listening to the same message but we got different interpretation in somebody else there is no faith amen no faith means there is no nothing in them to decode the message but in somebody else when they look they say wow I see it and somebody's looking he say I don't see it amen amen let's go to John chapter 6 glory to God Amen God was trying to bring Israel up but he found out there is a generation that no matter what he did nothing is working why because of unbelief because of lack of faith there is nothing the message doesn't work and after a while guess what they walk out amen did you eat the spiritual food yes did you eat Mana yes but they never believe the message even though they were eating the things of the message we clear watch the same scenario now in John 6 my friend then I'm going to start claming with the the quot of brother brandham you there amen John chapter 6 let's go to verse one if you there you can say Amen a little bit of reading here amen the Bible says after these things Jesus Went Over the Sea of Galilee which is the Sea of tarus and a great multitude did what follow him how many people follow great mude we clear a great this is the Bible this is not me a great multitude so it's not few people a great multitude followed him read with me why because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased so they were following Jesus Christ because of what so the first pool attracted them everybody want him in the church the miracle was not because Israel saw the miracle but God killed all of them they saw the miracle but they never believe we will see these people they are following Jesus Christ because of what it looks like they believer it looks like they are what Believers great multitude because of what Miracle J them into the message amen and verse uh the miracle because of uh which he did on them that were whatas so we talking about the healing which is the first pole you understand this thing now we clear am verse three and Jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciple and the Passover a feast of the Jews was nine when Jesus then lift up up his eyes he saw what a great company this is now Jesus seeing in other words when Jesus lift up his eyes he scream and he look he said I got a big company I got a big church here amen they saw a great company coming to the disciple coming to who they were coming to Jesus what a beautiful thing a great company coming to him he says to who pH for your information if you go to the Book of Mark this place was a Wilderness if you need a scripture see me after church this place was a desert amen that's what the Bible says amen when he saw the big company he says to who in The Book of Mark the Bible say he says to them but John is an eagle so he have a focus very good am amen when he focused he say no it was not just them it was really Phillip we clear and then he says to Phillip where shall we buy [Applause] what are we together where shall we buy what bread for what that these may eat why did he only ask to Phil Phillip he looked at the mountain and he turned to Phillip he said hey Phillip where can we find bread for these people watch Phillip amen and he says verse 6 and this he says to do what prove him for he himself what knew what he would do so before he asked the question Jesus already knew what he was doing so if if you knew what you're doing why do you ask Phillip the question can I continue verse S Phillip answered him stop let's go to verse uh five so we we get this together Jesus asked him where shall we buy bread that these people may do What Jesus was asking for location did have I read anything Jesus says where in other word tell me where I need an answer the answer is a zby a McDon a Walmart and a Target that's all I want you to do Jesus said where show me the place did they ask him how much money he had watch what Philip is answering when you read the Bible go slowly Jesus is asking the location right because he knew amen now let's go to verse seven philli answer him 200 what pen wor of bread is not what sufficient for did Jesus ask him how much money he has no Finance so Jesus knew who to poke everybody okay he says all I ask you show me where Philip begin to say oh no uh with 200 penny that have here I don't think did I did I ask you how much money you have did I ask you how much money do oh did I ask you do we have sufficient money to be able to buy bread for this I didn't ask you that I just ask you where exactly right Philip is coming up with a number he said 200 penny a penny was the salary of one day wow you remember the 11 workers hour they were giving them a penny do you remember so if you take 200 Penny it's like a salary of 7 months so Phillip is saying even if you take a man's salary for seven month it won't work with what we have is that the answer to the question Jesus knows how to squeeze you so that your brain can go Po and you can't think no more he said that's what I was looking for now that you stuck in your brain that's what I was looking for are we together Philip answered him 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take what little one of his disciple Angel Simon Peter's brother says to him there is a lad here which have what five barley Loaves and what two small fishes but what what are are they among so many brother you bringing a solution and you discrediting the solution I ask you where is the location oh no uh in our bank account here we only have 200 I don't see how it's going to work here that's not the question somebody come and say oh I have bread okay but even though we have bread but this bread won't work so why did you bring them to begin with if you know it's not going to work are we together so Jesus is offering two possibilities are you following me so this bread can be purchased with money amen oh Jesus can use the direct substance that he has which is bread and fish yes but this is the least potential because this one can provide more bread than the lad lunch are we together so Jesus could have used both source and provide bread because money brother Bram say is a purchase power and brother Bram show us many time that faith is like money he says if you're looking for a laot of bread and they give you money for it you man just get us happy because you got the bread in you so Jesus could use money and multiply money right follow me and give money and then they go buy the bread and bring it oh Jesus can multiply the bread and give it but if Jesus multipli the money they still have to rent to you H are we together yes because the number of the company was so big so if you need even if you get money you need to go get a big truck so you can go get money uh I mean bread for so many people and bring it back so that the people can eat but if we got bread here if we can transform that to a manufacturer are we together on the spot then we are saving ourself from renting a car renting a ass renting horses and we got the money but this solution is there less promising and that's what Jesus picks up the less promising one the man is even promising but they won the two the the kid lunch for one not an adult lunch because an adult lunch you can CED in kids the kid so it's only for the kid the very last resources Jesus said that's where I'm going to get what is Jesus teaching this great multitude Amen in the wilderness he says give me the lunch they give him the lunch he said make them sit together let's go let's go let's go and he feed everybody and everybody is full and he even give more until they say father that's enough he stop he used the least substance we clear let me save some time jop to verse 11 if you dare you can say amen amen and Jesus Took the Loaves and when he had given thanks he did what distributed to the disciples continue my friend and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise also the what the fishes as much as they would uh-huh when they were filled he said to the disciple gather up the fragment we don't want to wastage that remain for that be lost therefore they gathered them together and did what fill 12 baskets with the fragments of the five barley Lo which remain over and above to them that had water listen clearly they follow Jesus for the miracle watch verse 14 then those men when they had seen the what Miracle not the miracle of the healing are we together on verse two they were follow in Jesus for the miracle of the healing now Jesus showed them a miracle of Creation in other words they third po [Applause] Miracle everybody okay a miracle of creation because Jesus created amen when he created verse 14 then those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did says this is of a what the truth that what prophet that should come into the world so the people say hey we've creation like this brother this is the prophet that should come into the world that Prophet that should come into the world means that this is the Messiah am are we together follow me carefully when they seen the miracle of creation they says that this is the messiah amen so me and you concluded that these are believers so we clear now these are believers they believe in the Messiah are we together are we together are we together watch even verse 15 some of them were zealous when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and do what take him by force to make him what in other words some guys say no no no no no no you taking too long the Messiah was supposed to be a king these Roman are there and they're giving us trouble let's just take him and make him our King right now and we start a revolution back to Jerusalem get the Roman Empire out it looks like they are even supporting the son of man they are confessing the son of man they are even talking about making him King they are standing for the message yes can I continue can I continue then he depart he departed again into a mountain himself where alone are we together are we together jump to verse uh 24 I'm skipping we got the picture clearly right we got the picture clearly right Jesus ran away from them and these people went outside the next day the people are coming again where is our King they start looking for Jesus follow me carefully my friend we clear verse 24 if you dare you can say Amen once I clam here finished then we saw he says when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there we clear nether his disciple they also took sheep and came to what seeking for who Jesus now they're seeking him they saw the miracle they saw the creation they say this is the Messiah we need to be with this man so all of us say oh my God we got a beautiful message believer we got message followers they even are paying their ticket they're going to the convention overseas they're going to the convention in Minnesota they are paying the ticket let's get in the ticket let's go there support the meeting there follow me carefully my friend follow me am I reading a different Bible okay verse uh 25 and when they found him on the other side of the sea they said to him what when came you here why how did you come here what time did you get here you already Ohio I took oh because my friend is there so no problem how did you make it here look at Jesus Christ they follow him for miracle they says that he was the Messiah because he created let's see the level of these people you there you ready brother Robert verse 26 Jesus answered them and say Yes uh what verily verily I say what unto you you seek me not because you saw Miracle the only one that can discern this is Jesus Christ according to me and you these are message believer they are following the message they are supporting the message we heard them confessing that this message is right this man is the Messiah these people even were able were ready to take him and make him King they were ready to die for the message now Jesus turned around and he put his binoculars he look he say you don't seek me for miracle I'm reading the Bible please I'm not fabricating everything it's coming from the man how can a man follow Jesus for the miracle how can a man confess that he's the Messiah paying even ticket but what is he after in the message why is he following the son of man we we clear my friend watch this my friend very very and say to you you seek me not because of what the saw the Miracles but because you did it what of the L and were what so the main purpose with Jesus was what in other word when Jesus created to them they say h this is a good place here so from now on no more hungry in the morning I pick up my entire family we going to church because after church finished they're going to give us [Applause] food after church is finished we're going to have a dinner don't do me like this my friend I'm just reading the Bible I'm just going to give the Bible let's go quickly to that converstion when the converstion is finished we got fellowship and after Fellowship I will see my body we have free food amen I'm telling you the food over there was so delicious are we together so we are following the message because we got the benefit out of it Lord the reason I'm staying in this message if I declare to my church that I don't believe brother Bram the Turing will disappear I will lose my source of income that's why I have to dute the message a little bit no in this church don't read the prophet but we still believe the message but do not read the prophet on the puet but we believe the message this picture we believe it but don't put the over there because we want the source of income we want theing we want the [Music] offering say Amen am I'm not telling you when I say say amen I want to get some feedback my friend okay say Amen my friend this is the problem we thought they were looking Jesus Christ for their life come on Jesus say you see you're not looking I know I know exactly what you I know why you hanging around me this is the message my friend verse 27 Jesus says what labor not for what the meat which perishes we clear labor not for the meat that perishes everybody okay labor not for the meat with perish but from the meat which does what endureth unto everlasting life so there is a food that give eternal life and there is a word that give eternal life now we found out that in Christ we got the food and the drink both of them give eternal life and Jesus said do not labor for this thing because you if I give if you drink the water you going to be thirsty again this food I gave it to you tomorrow you following me if I give you this food tomorrow you're going to follow me but that's not the main concern the reason why I demonstrated this thing is not for you to really look at food I want you to look at who is there if you knew the gift of God and the one who asking you food because money was here right right right right you f me money was unable to feed the great multitude the lunch was there but the lunch was unable to feed 5,000 but what fed the people is not really bread and fish it is not really the money it is the person of Jesus Christ so if Jesus is there that's what matters whether there is bread or not whether there is money or not if Christ is there he can produce the food do you follow me yes if Christ is there he can make Mana rain from Heaven if Christ is there he can bring water from the rock do you follow me do you follow me verse 27 labor not for the meat which perishes but for the meat which inth to what everlasting life water that spring up unto everlasting life now it's not water it is now meat that spring up to everlasting life which The Who son of man which The Who son of man this food come from who the son of so it's a food that come from the son of man not the Son of God the son of man shall give you for what him ha God the Father seal do you know what it means this food only come from the son of man because the son of man is where the father put his approval so if you want to find the approval of God you need to find the son of man because the son of man have a food if you get the food that [Applause] say who is the son of man everybody okay everybody okay who is the Son of God the son of man but the problem say in the rising of the son the sun he says now who is what the son of man in the beginning was what the word and the Word was what with God and the Word was what and the Word was made what and dwell where among so the son of man is who the word the son of man has a food and brother say who is the son of man he say in the beginning was what word the son of man is the word hallah H let's CL my friend let's go my friend go ahead and read it and the son of man is revealing himself in the same power that he was not down through the church age through what justification through what all these things here about who the son of man who is the what son of man the what the word are we together the word the word is what quicker than and Powerful what the twoed sword and dis of the what do that's in the heart what did he has to do he has to prove that word what would he do notice of it when we see it happening look at it in the same what form that he was where here in the beginning how my proving that he is what Hebrew 138 continue my [Applause] friend what was it Jesus Christ the same yesterday that was Christ that was where in the wilderness with Moses how many knows the bible say that that was when yesterday that was Christ when Paul was speaking where here today you believe that in the New Testament then the what the same what [Applause] when are we together are we together are we together we talking about we are laboring what for the food that the son of man give you that's the food that you work for brother Bram says this go ahead my friend I was not the one that appeared down on the river I was only what standing there when he I'm not the one that perform these things and forell these things that happen as perfect they are I'm only one that is well near when he doesn't I was only a what a voice that he used to say it I was it was not what I knew it was it was it's what I Just Surrender myself to that he did what spoke through it is what isn't me it was the it was not the what seven angels oh no it was what the manifestation of the son of man it was not the angel his message it was the mystery that God did what unfold it's not what amen it is who God we clear the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the what son of the son of man is who Christ he is the one that you're doing what feing on you are not feeding on a man a man his word will do what fail but you are feeding upon what unfailing body word of the son of this is the this is the food you need to labor on it this food is everything for you glory glory hallelujah amen jop to verse uh 41 if we can go quickly if you dare you can say amen amen hallelujah we were in verse uh oh God no stop let's go back to 28 give me some time all right let's hurry he said then said they what shall we do remember these people believed right they were following Jesus Christ because of Miracle they followed him Jesus turned around he say you following me not because of Miracle not because of what I did yesterday when I was creating bread you are following me for food let's see if these people believe him verse 28 then say they to him what shall we do that we might work the work of God Amen show us these things so we can start doing that ourself too so we can begin to get our bread and multiply it everybody okay Jesus answered and say to them this is the work of God that you do what believe on him whom he has sent in other words leave the miracle but go first to the main thing I want you to believe because Israel got what you got but they were not believing and I kill all of them in the wilderness you following me jump to verse 30 they say therefore to him what sign show you then that we may see and what believe what do you what do you work can you imagine the people that were following Jesus Christ for the miracle they s the bread they say this is the Messiah now they're turning to Jesus Christ they say what son do you show me were they believing no that's what happened in this message that's correct I'm reading to you the Bible jum to verse uh uh 31 look what they're telling Jesus our father did eat what man in the desert as it written he gave them what bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus said to them verily verily I said to you Moses gave you not that bread for heaven in other word that manner that you're talking about you didn't from Moses I was the one that was giving you the man your father I'm the one that provided the father Moses was only a prophet but the one that created the squel is me do you follow me yes sir do you follow me yes sir he says but but my father giv you here the what the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is what is which he come is is he which cometh down from heaven and give life to the who the world everybody clear then say they to him Lord everm more give us this bread and Jesus said to them I am do you see are we clear now I am what the bread of life in other words the son of man is the bread of life you following me he's not just the Living Water he's also the bread I am the bread of Life do you follow me yes sir he that comes to me shall what never hunger in John 4 he that come to me shall never thirst over here shall never hunger so he's both the water and he's also the bread are you following me he that come to me shall never hunger and he that believe on me shall never what thirst but I say to you that you also have seen me and do what believe not so they didn't believe that's it amen they seen the miracle of healing they seen Jesus creating still they can't believe Jesus Christ Israel drunk water did this still not Bel what's going on look at Jesus Christ he's going back to to to predestination verse 37 all that the father did what giveth me shall do what come to me and him that come to me I will know what in no wise cast out are we clear jum to verse 41 the Jews then murmur at him because he says I am what the bread which come down from what heaven and they say to him and they say is not this Jesus the son of Joseph now they begin to find fault when he was doing miracle they didn't worry about the son of Joseph when he was creating bread they were eating they didn't worry about the son of Joseph now they begin to argue with him being the son of Joseph when brother Bram was here nobody argue with him now today we begin to argue whether this was true or not when he was here nobody attacked the flag the cloud over [Applause] there you didn't know he was a son of Charles andam he says is not this Jesus the son of Joseph I thought they say he was the Messiah now they begin to say the son of Joseph in other we know his father he's no God who father and what mother we know they are denying the very deity that they saw in their own eyes he says he says how is it then that he say I come down from what heaven the Messiah should come from Heaven you testify I was the Messiah now I'm telling you I came from the heaven you say no your father was here we remember we have your birth certificate in Carolina Medical Center over there Jesus therefore answer and say to them murmur not you among what yourselves we clear we clear no man can come to me except what the Father which has sent me did what and I will raise him up where the last day jum to verse 38 my 48 I am what that bread of life your father did eat man in the wilderness and are what you are reproducing exactly what your father did after the miracle I did your father did eat man in the wilderness and now what this is the bread which come down from what heaven that a man eateth thereof and what not die I am the living bread which come down from heaven If any man eat of what this bread he shall live how forever and the bread that I will give is is what my flesh uh-huh which I give for the life of the what so the bread is a flesh only God can drink this kind of be yes sir yes sir the bread that I'm talking about is my flesh can I continue he says the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying can this man give us what his to eat the people that follow the miracle the people that testify about the message now the third pool is unfolding the word decreasing the number of the multitude removing those that were in the message for so long because God is about to do something new yes yes if they stick around they will learn the secret of life so I need to give them some word to kick them out yes in my language they say it's a b I'm going to give them some bones so when they crack the Bon everybody clear they give them some Bon so we can't eat this are we clear eat my flesh the Flesh of a human being can I continue where are we at my friend verse 53 then Jesus said to them they asking Jesus they say wait a minute did you hear that he's saying we need to eat what Look what Jesus added you ready I'm about to close I can't reach where I'm going my friend okay listen he says verse 53 then Jesus said to them verily verily I say to you what except you eat what the Flesh of the son of the Flesh of who son of not the Flesh of the Son of God the son of man when the word is made flesh that's the flesh that you eat if you don't eat their message if you don't eat the message of the son of man you have no eternal life so you mean those people that are praying over there brother Stephen you mean that they won't go to heaven watch on YouTube what happened to most of them go see what happened to most of them because of lack of the son of man let's go my friend he said then verily verily I say unto you except you eat the what flesh of the son of man and drink what his blood can you say amen amen God say when you eat something don't eat something with its blood Jesus say this BL this man here when you eat him you must also drink the blood this is not a blood of a cow this is not your steak of Long Horn this is the stake of the son of [Applause] man can I continue can I continue he said except because he said My Flesh they start struggling he said let me give you a full meal let me give you the full meal the combo everybody okay he say except you eat the Flesh of who the son of man and drink what his blood you have what no life in you so you cannot eat the flesh without drinking the blood everybody okay because there is a creature called an eagle the eagle when he C on the flesh he also suck the [Applause] blood can I continue the son of man is an ego himself he knows what ego eat so when the son of man is giving the food he says listen to me if you are a true eager I will know you by the way you eating amen I will know you by your restaurant I will know you by the restaurant you go in into the church you going into that's how I will know who you are because an Eiger will need flesh and blood when they eat the flesh they suck in life because it's a bleeding word it's a word that is bleeding it's a lamb that is bleeding a lamp that is coming from the CH bleeding so we can eat the lamb and suck the blood because the blood have the [Applause] life if you don't drink the blood no Eternal lifeall as as as difficult as it's going to S let me make sure you understand me because the the because the life have left the Shar the life is now in the seed there is no Holy Ghost wither this message now if you

Exodus son of man Third Exodus son of man do you know that it's Jesus Christ that Rose all the Old Testament do you know that but after after Jesus Christ everybody that die are still in the grave ping the grave AR you in the grave so we need another son of man so we can raise all of them so Paul is waiting for me without me no Paul if there is no son of man Paul stay in the grave but the Capstone is the only one that can bring the [Applause] resurrection let me finish here my friend my time is up my friend let me go here verse 54 let me finish here when it get juicy like this this is when the time is finished oh my God let let me go verse 54 who so does what eateth my flesh and do what drinketh my blood has what eternal life so to have eternal life you need what and do what can you say it loud drink what what is in the blood so when we sucking on the tap come when we put in the T when it's playing we are doing H that's why sometime when the devil beat you so hard you put a tape and you feel like you're going back because you [Applause] because in the tap there is something there it is the Flesh and the blood of the son of man that's why I I remind you every day read the message listen to the message man shall not live by bread alone but by [Applause] every let's close here my friend where are we at my friend verse 54 are we 54 whosoever eat my water and drink my what BL has what eternal life and I will do what raise him up last days verse four for my flesh indeed is what and my blood is what drink indeed he that eat what my flesh and what drinketh my blood do what dwelleth in me and where I am you dwell where and him he's where so who's dwelling in Who The Duality him in me me and me that's why that's why the devil cannot decode you on the radar because when the devil look at you he sees you he sees Jesus he said this is Sister jerus no that was not sister Jus that's Jesus no no no it's a jerus no it's Jesus because Jus in Jesus Jesus in jerus zero right there where am I at my friend where am I at6 56 let's go he that e what FL and what drth my blood dwell where in me and my and I where in him verse 57 as the father living father has sent me uh-huh go
