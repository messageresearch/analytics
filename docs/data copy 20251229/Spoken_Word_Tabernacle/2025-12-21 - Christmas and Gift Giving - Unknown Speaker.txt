I thought we finished with this subject but I thought but I believe we had to I have to administer a few dosage of chemotherapy. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ah, shake somebody's hand. Say, just get ready. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I had a question about the gift during Christmas season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because some of the churches, they say we don't celebrate Christmas. [laughter] I'm sorry, my friend. Are you the one asking me the question? &gt;&gt; Okay. Can you turn your timer off? &gt;&gt; It's a lollipop. Somebody's still [laughter] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, they asked me a question about the gift because some of the churches they say they don't celebrate Christmas, but they get some gathering and exchange gift. But not for Christmas. But in Christmas time, &gt;&gt; brother, you ain't fooling no one. &gt;&gt; If you want to remember the birth of Jesus Christ, Jesus was born in April. &gt;&gt; Wait in April. &gt;&gt; And in April, begin to tell us, oh, you know, THE LORD JESUS was born in April. That will be fun. &gt;&gt; We will talk about it, but don't wait for December. So let me uh administer a few uh dosage of uh chemotherapy to make sure some of the lingering uh cancerous cells &gt;&gt; are taken care of. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Ready or not, here it comes. [laughter] &gt;&gt; H in the message. Sir, we would see Jesus Brother Brandham say the word Christmas mass come from Catholics &gt;&gt; Catholicism. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WHAT CATHOL what what Catholic priests are doing &gt;&gt; they call that a mass &gt;&gt; and brother BRANDHAM SAID THE HIGHEST FORM [screaming] &gt;&gt; OF spiritism &gt;&gt; is the Catholic churches. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Benjamin. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, brother Brandham say the highest form. &gt;&gt; The highest form. IN OTHER WORDS, THE TOP &gt;&gt; TOP. &gt;&gt; THE lights here are not on. Brother Robert. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The top &gt;&gt; the top level, the number one level of spiritism. Brother Brandham say to the Catholic Church &gt;&gt; and the word Christmas &gt;&gt; that you love to say MERRY CHRISTMAS THAT vocabulary &gt;&gt; came from the Catholic church &gt;&gt; don't say amen. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Christ which is what &gt;&gt; Christmas &gt;&gt; Christmas it is a Catholic tradition. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do we want to hang God on something that came from the Catholic Church, &gt;&gt; which is Jezebel today, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Don't worry, my friend. Now, Christmas, &gt;&gt; I wish that really the people would could understand in this world what really Christmas is. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I know your quote. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. But I'm saying Merry Christmas. I'm giving you a different layer, a different quote where this they don't touch them. &gt;&gt; They don't read this quote to the church. &gt;&gt; They only they only use those quote that brother Brandham say I wish everybody merry Christmas. That's the quote you will hear for 40 years. This you won't hear them. &gt;&gt; But in this church, we eat everything. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO QUOTE THAT SHOULD EMBARRASS YOU. &gt;&gt; Even where brother Brandham lied, we read it. &gt;&gt; AND WE ALSO READ WHERE HE REPENTED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I CANNOT HIDE THAT BECAUSE THE BIBLE NEVER HE HIDE THE MISTAKE OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; NO SIR. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SPOKE WHERE DAVID MESSED UP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IN THIS CHURCH, WE READ EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "NOW THE FIRST word Christmas is A KIND OF A CATHOLIC EXPRESSION, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; It means Christmas. &gt;&gt; Christmas. Christmas. &gt;&gt; It was ordained or was BEGIN WITH THE ROMAN CHURCH." AMEN. &gt;&gt; I thought somebody I say Muslim deal with this easily. &gt;&gt; And they don't celebrate Christmas. &gt;&gt; Jehovah witness deal with this easily &gt;&gt; and they DON'T CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. ONLY MESSAGE BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT KNOW MORE THAN MUSLIM AND JEHOVAH WITNESS, THEY THE ONE struggling with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lollipop. [laughter] &gt;&gt; AND CHRIST WAS NO MORE born on this on on the 25th day of December than I was born. &gt;&gt; Because he was born in April. &gt;&gt; He said, "Uh-huh. IT'S JUST A complete conglomeration of what? &gt;&gt; DOGMA." &gt;&gt; SO CHRISTMAS IS A DOGMA. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DOGMA. You don't understand what he means. I'm going to come back TO THAT. HE SAY THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO IT. The whole world as the prophet say has become a petrified sore. That's right. Just it's just no clean thing.

THAT CHURCH HAS BOUND THE WATER &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit can be bound. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [laughter] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Please don't say amen to me. Say amen to the court. &gt;&gt; THEY HAS BANNED THE HOLY GHOST FOR nearly how many years? &gt;&gt; 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; Under m back there and under the water &gt;&gt; church ages. &gt;&gt; IT HAS BEEN BANNED NOT at the river Euphrates &gt;&gt; BUT AT THE DOOR OF WATER &gt;&gt; AND WATER &gt;&gt; DOGMA &gt;&gt; THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT CAN'T WORK IN THE CHURCH BECAUSE of a man-made WATER &gt;&gt; SYSTEM. SO DOGMA [screaming] B THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU ARE CLINGING TO A DOGMA, THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS BLOCKED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN.
