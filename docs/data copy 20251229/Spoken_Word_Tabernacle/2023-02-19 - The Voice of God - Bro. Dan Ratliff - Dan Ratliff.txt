y'all might be seen yes God blessings honor all the glory all the Praises for everything he has done for us and everything he has done for my family and myself on Thursday Lord's running go on sorry I had to drop off an order for someone so I was hustling to get it done as I got it done I thought I turned the stove off to me I love and entrepreneur there was no fire so I packed up everything and I rushed out and I came all the way up to Charlotte we had some other rungs to make and I did everything and on the way back home we were out for six hours when we got in normally I would go in first and when I go in I would always put the light on in the house Hadassah came in before me and that's something that don't happen and as she went in she turned around and she came running back out she said mom move move get back get back I said what is it she said get back so I just ran back together with her she said apparently I left the stove on and it's a gas stove she said and the entire house is smelling of gas so we came back out and I sort of opened the door to let the air out and standing there the whole yard is smelling of gas so we had a light on in the hallway there was a light on on the steps to come up from the the downstairs and the pilot light for the fireplace was on I called brother Robert I said Robert this is what happened the first question he asked was did the house blow up I said no he said did you and Hadassah get hurt I said no so I called Freeman gas which is a gas company that deals with the house he says Miss Valley stay outside but while I was speaking to Robert I said Lord you protect the house I believe you protect me I'm going to go in and open the doors to get the scent out and the Lord said to me hold your skirt so no static forms touching anything go in don't put any light out or any light on and you just opened the doors and come out the back door and move away from the house so we did that we reversed the car and put the car up by the grass closer to the road so I called Fremont gas he walked me through he said I'm going to take you to the main Outlet the big tank he said I'm I'll guide you to turn it off and you'll stay as far away from the house as possible so I said to him okay and we did that he said yes somebody somebody in your area and we're gonna send him over right away so in like in 20 minutes time he came he checked to make sure the tank was off he went in he says how long were you all going for us in six hours he said and these lights was on I said yes you said Andrew pilot lights on I said yes so I don't know what to say I just don't know what to say you know he checked everything he said it wasn't any leaps or nothing and Saints you know we heard of the couple and you know it was very sad the guy sneak and what happened to them and the Lord protected our own we they just filled a tank and the tank was at a hundred percent and 10 of the the tank escaped at that time the Lord kept the house the pilot light was on the light was on I just want to say I'm crying but it still tears of joy because when we realized how much God loves us and how much he protects us you know because it was six hours gas is on pilot light is on lights are on and the Lord kept the house and I want to say thank you Lord Jesus [Applause] praise the Lord everybody woke up this morning got out of bed and um as I got out of bed I just kept heading to the right and again when I put my shoes on and then lower I could feel my head spinning and lose religion I was talking to a brother to brother Greg there and he prayed for me and I I can feel just this pressure in my head this morning as I came up here all of that left me this morning so I just want to use a testimony that we were talking about in the message how the lives of um uh what's his name again the with the whistle Brother Bird how God used the whistle and and the deer line shooting just as an example it was that's right and I just want to use John Ryan from mine thank you Lord for healing me thank you Lord for healing Hallelujah I have a quick one too brother Stephen if that's okay we I don't know what possessed me to um you know we moved out to Kings Mountain we got a little bit of land we already bought a couple of goats and I I don't know what was asking but last uh last Saturday week ago we purchased a couple little bottle fat calves and you know I'm looking at YouTube and I'm like I can do this even with two of them well it's a little harder than you might think because they pull these little calves off their mamas after their colostrum like day one or day two day two and uh ours are three weeks old now but we've had a pretty rough week we've had one that's been dehydrating you know pretty bad since about I don't know Wednesday or Thursday a lot of Tears a lot of praying over just a little baby cow she's a sweet got a sweet nature so um I mean I even brought it up to brother Stephen and he he says he went to prayer for her as well So Yesterday we've been trying to give her a little bit of electrolytes because she is dehydrated and she wouldn't take a milk they drink about her uh two quarts of milk twice a day and she wouldn't take that and she wouldn't take the electrolytes it was like she didn't drink anything at all yesterday and I just thought well this is it can't get any liquids in her you know so I woke up this morning um thinking you know I'm gonna have a little dead calf on my hands or you know when she's laying there um you know she's in pain she had little tears running out of her eyes yesterday and when she breathes she just kind of goes You Can Tell She's agonizing I'm thinking well if she's not any better you know I'm gonna have to just go ahead and put her out of her misery and I'm thinking oh my goodness well I got up this morning I have to feed them before five o'clock in the morning so I got up and I only took one bottle down for the other calf I wasn't anticipating being in you know doing anything with this little sickling and I got up and uh they got a clock inside of them too because this little sick calf was standing at the edge of the pen waiting for me to come with her bottle and I fed I went ahead and fed the other one because I was there with the bottle warm and that little sicken was nudging me because she was wanting her bottle so I rushed up to the house fixed her a bottle she drank the whole bottle this morning the whole thing so we haven't decided if we're going to call her Miracle or Victory or Overcomer yet or something but she's got a name coming amen so I do not have any prayer requests yes sir I I don't mind if we got we don't want to make too much into the preacher's time but amen go ahead go ahead well this this kind of goes along with the story you just said but it involves my wife let me tell you not trying to save my wife as a cow okay I'm not trying to do that laughs no we're not doing that we're not doing it because I know she's listening in but anyway uh you know she had that surgery uh what four weeks ago and she was doing good up till about two weeks ago and she shredded some chicken and she ate that and then it's just like it relapsed to before she had the surgery and now the last two weeks she's been back on a liquid diet and just in pain and we don't know what's going on so anyway um uh this morning on the way here I was listening to a greater than Solomon it's here from 1963. and um um he got to the end of the message and he called he he was praying for people and one of the people he called for was stomach issues and I'm thinking Lord if he calls three people that'll be a witness to me that this thing is over with he called three people so and on the way on the way down here I'm thinking well we didn't read the scripture and we didn't pray before I left because I was trying to beat brother Lamont here but anyway so when I got here I called her I said you know we didn't pray and we didn't read the scriptures so I read the scripture and we prayed on the phone and while I was praying you know I told her about the the three Witnesses on the tape that I heard before I told her about that first and then while we were praying it hit me here is the same situation brother Branham when he was in Louisiana and his wife in Arizona with the tumor and I said here is the same situation or miles apart you got this situation going on we're on the telephone and here it is repeating again so I just wanted to get and it's over with it's done come up and play this morning okay Let's uh let's stand I don't have any prayer requests we're going to ask brother Charles to pray this morning that is creepy Heavenly Father we thank you Lord God so much to thank you for in this hour Lord God and Lord we

to move on and I was stuck in the uh life uh how do you come timeline amen and they keep generating questions after question after question and he was really like a family talk amen so try not to miss question and answer amen amen you know one thing okay I gotta say it you might be seated amen train your family Train Your Husband train your children that this life that we have is not our life the life the breath of life that you breathing doesn't belong to you it's just a lot of snap we take you and bury you amen so train your family remind them that the life that they're breathing is not their life amen and without God there is nothing that you can do everybody okay so a Christian Life is a life that is wrapped up or mingled together with your relationship with Jesus Christ I don't know if you understand what I'm saying so there is no way you can move one day without having something to do with God a Christian life is not Wednesday and Sundays do you follow me a Christian life is not coming on church on Wednesday and Sunday that is religion [Applause] everybody okay Mama Train Your Husband to the things of God in other words when you wake up on on Monday morning your mind is thinking about God everybody okay not that okay today is Monday this is my day God I will think about him on Wednesday that's not the way he works when you wake up in the morning you start thinking about God even though you go into work when you take in a shower you are meditating about God when you get in your car you are putting a sermon or maybe you're playing music that will bring you into the atmosphere of God when you get to work if there is a possibility you have a Bluetooth that you are listening to the sermon you're working when you're on break time you open your Bible and you read in your Bible you eat in your lunch in other words you are living your life but your life is seasoned with God amen so by the time you get on Wednesday you already fully charged of the anointing of God so when you come on Church everything is working amen so when you get your life moving like that you already looking at Wednesday you say what is Wednesday Wednesday is the day that we have service what should I do on Wednesday if I need to cook I need to cook on Monday so that Wednesday will be free if I need to do shopping I need to shop on Monday and Tuesday so that my Wednesday will be free I need to do everything on Monday and Tuesday so that on Wednesday I am fully relaxed I am fully charged I am strong and I'm ready to go to the house of the Lord don't put up things on Sunday you don't know who you value it amen put everything aside on Wednesday put everything aside on Sunday amen if it's Saturday we don't have question and answer praise the Lord go to the mall go shop get the kids to the park and everything but never get the kid to the park when there is something going on in the church do you get what I'm saying do you get what I'm saying give God the preeminence you don't see how you training your children you don't see how you training your husband you don't see how you training your wife and someday few years down the road you will be crying to get your husband to church you will be crying to get your wife to church you will be crying to get your children to church because your children have nothing to do with the things of God because you yourself don't even value the things of God Mama remind Daddy tell him that hey there is a meeting today is Wednesday okay make sure everything you do by six o'clock you must be ready so we can go to church remind him on Saturday night that we need to go to bed on time the children need to go to bed on time because in the morning we got service we need to be refreshed we need to be on time we need to be there and we need to be there worshiping the name of the Lord amen our life is mingled together is wrapped up with our relationship with God Amen and that relationship is now Wednesday it's not Sunday that is religion that is all over the message we're leeching amen amen train your children the correct way train them to be on church on time train them to be there on question and answer train them to be there when there is any special meeting train them when there is something going on train them in Sunday school whatever you do push your children to God push your husband to God how can you sit with a husband that doesn't show interest to God you think you're having fun way to when the Devil comes I will be receiving phone calls and I will receive your phone call and I will pray with you I will help you but I'm going to remind you I say sister you're responsible for this brother you're responsible for this amen because when the church was open you give away to certain things how many stay home and don't go to work because they have a headache how many stay home on Wednesday and on Sunday and they don't come to church because they have a headache your talent now don't work on Wednesday the Motrin don't work on Sunday because we will be streaming as you see the day approaching stay on the streaming trimming in this church is an exclusivity that is given to you so do the best that you can to be in the house of God if you can and the Lord sees your heart then you stream do you understand me and then when you go home you can use the stream again to look over in the sermon if you miss something but don't use streaming as your priority like Wednesday no more church Wednesday I'm streaming you put up your own schedule who told you that what about if YouTube have a problem what about if the Beast begin to put pressure and they close the streaming and they shut down YouTube what are you gonna do there is one thing I like about myself I learned to say things plainly so when I meet your master I'm now responsible for you amen train your children when there is something going on in the church take them to church if there is nothing going on in the church if the Sunday service is closed if there is no Wednesday service then you can put up your shopping you can put up your washing of dishes your watching of uh what you call it clothing all everything your car washing and everything you can put that but if there is church separate those things give God preeminence love God with all your heart give him the preeminence before you do anything make sure his staff at first amen make sure whatever you do for God is first then he will bless everything that you're doing after that amen before you go chase for that money make sure you chase for the maker if your Prosperity is taking you away from God you under a curse you don't have to say amen Amen brother Stephen if whatever you do is taking you away from God if you see yourself going away from the things of God and you are prospering you in a dangerous ground because you're gonna win the whole world and you're going to lose your own soul that's what the scripture say make sure as you prosper the Bible says that what you want to prosper as the one as your soul do what so make sure the way you growing up in the Lord you growing up everywhere you're prospering then you safe if the Lord comes today you can take off and leave everything in this world but if you go through the things of the world and you neglect the things of God one of this day you say well the children are just babies that baby need to sit in church over here as much as you think they don't understand they need the presence of the Lord I heard the mother saying we won't come to Sunday school until our children are grown up so they only come to Sunday school to drop the kids and brother Brian I'm saying plainly these are people born in a message grew up in the message that are coming up with statement like this so nowadays it doesn't impress me whether you were born in a message or not my point is are you in Christ how did you get into the Tabernacle That's What mattered to me everybody okay everybody okay glory to God at least your blood is not under behind only believe brother then had to live from Gregory Michigan he's here this morning with us he's a pastor we met in Ohio a wonderful brother we met a brother Charles Lamb meeting and he stopped by to Fellowship but I felt led as a minister and a pastor that I need to give him the pulpit to preach so I told him that he's home he's going to preach like home he's going to behave like home he's going to use a PowerPoint so he's really really home so you pull like home and we enjoy like home everybody okay if I rob you the wrong way you say thank you Jesus for your pastor like that everybody okay [Applause] because on the other side you will be giving me so many hugs you look at me you say brother Stephen hug I say that's enough you say no no I need to give you

Saints said amen amen God bless you can have your seats for a few moments I uh maybe would like to introduce myself because I'm sure that most of you don't know who I am but I uh as brother Stephen said on many men brother Chad Lamb's Church in Lima Ohio there and I knew right away something was very unique about that man just the way he spoke out the the confidence that he had I knew I said Lord there's something special about this man and you certainly are a blessed people here in Gastonia North Carolina we we certainly are envious I just want to come down here and go to this church [Laughter] [Applause] well I would be the best amenor brother Stephen I I you probably wouldn't get me to sit down my wife she unfortunately couldn't make the trip this time but uh she said you know honey why don't you just be a good uh Pew message believer and just sit there I said don't you think I want to I it's so much easier right brother Stephen then to just sit there I I the greatest thing I have in my life is to listen to this message to read this word to spend time praying unto the father amen better it's like icing on the cake to be able to sit where you're sitting and feast on this kind of manna oh my we are certainly blessed that's for sure my name is Dan Ratliff and I Pastor a small Church in Gregory Michigan and I've only I'm a young I might be old but I'm a young pastor but

God I'm thankful for uh my wife her name is Sister Lynn and she God predestinated her to be my wife before the foundation of the world and I know you husbands here will argue with me and that's okay I

of God you are blessed with a servant of God a pastor that I believe was ordained by God to take you to a body change amen you know brother Branham said I I want to give him his roses now uh-huh I'm

glory now we're thankful for the gifts and we appreciate oh I might get myself in trouble here brother Stephen but we appreciate the gift from God we appreciate the gift from God Amen amen just like your wife appreciates her husband amen amen now she doesn't worship or bow down to him is this okay preach my brother preach she don't bow down to him okay yes but but husbands you know there there was an old German man that said honey I told you I loved you at the altar oh he just brothers just looked right here he said if that changes I'll let you know now let me tell you how that worked out for him your wives need to hear you love her just like our lord Jesus likes to hear you love him he knows he he knows your heart he knows your thoughts they speak louder but he wants you to tell him I love you Lord I love you Lord oh wow my goodness yes sir isn't God good to us you know [Applause] now the unfortunate thing is is that this is being streamed and and my wife's gonna say no honey do you tell me you love me [Laughter] you know we got to be transparent that's right I just say Lord help me [Laughter] praise God wow yes sir we are blessed God wants us to enjoy our salvation he said I would that you would prosper in health yes he doesn't want you to be sick oh somebody's pulling brother Stephen I I I'm trying to go back to my my sermon here yes my brother look I I I did a little study on the choices we make yes my brother yes sir yes sir the choices we make unfortunately we put them bad choices on our father [Applause] oh God's putting me through this trial God's doing this to me and and then here's the bad thing brother Stephen is the link my father and the devil in the same category because they say the devil made me do it Now isn't that silly God didn't make you do anything the devil didn't make you do anything you made the choice I made the choice the new birth yes uh-huh the new birth is not on the body not even in the spirit but it's in the soul you don't have a choice there you you just either believe are you don't believe [Applause] [Music] it is either word or not word there's no black white in God's economy there's no gray area we call that a pale area that's a dead area isn't it glory to God the choices we make [Music] and it will have ramification it's like when you throw a pebble in the pond you get the ripple effect so maybe if I could just uh this is from a pastor's heart can I just share a pastor's heart yes sir don't misunderstand me Satan will bring thoughts to your mind not your soul he can't touch that but if he can get you to destroy yourself my goodness why do you think he hates you so much because he can't touch it he can't get that soul that came from God um yes sir you every one of you could spend hours giving me a testimony sharing your your testimony of your life this morning amen and even in through the times uh that the enemy has attacked you as a body try to destroy you as a body we got news for the enemy this morning you can't destroy God now you're too late for that you can try to tell me there was no Bridge Vision you can try to tell me that this didn't happen and that didn't happen that doesn't move me glory to God I didn't mean him on a bridge [Applause] I didn't even meet him at an altar oh I met him before the foundation of the world before there was ever anything I you the bride was in his thoughts yes and the devil knows that [Laughter] and the devil knows things you're going to make mistakes because of your choices because of your emotions that's it but it doesn't unsave you that's it so when the Devils I don't know who's pulling but when the Devil comes to your door [Applause] when the Devil comes knocking at your door and said there's no hope for what you did yesterday [Applause] there's no hope for you because you have anxiety or depression that means that you must be demon-possessed come on somebody preach with me it just means you have an enemy that's trying to work in that Spirit Realm that's the emotional Realm that's not where we serve God no sir we serve God just like I said before I love you amen I we are one Jesus prayed father I pray that day and I are one yes sir like you and I are one all right Oh Glory to God praise God wow that just makes you want to sit down in a corner and cry remove your name amen from the book you didn't put it in there to begin with that's it brother Brandon said get the Holy Ghost before Satan does what takes your mind not your soul mine nothing you were sealed before the foundation of the world this is a subject I've been studying deeply yes yes I haven't had the time to and I don't think I could ever exhaust that study but I believe one of the most misunderstood and let me just make a disclaimer before I start if I say anything contrary to what your pastor says you stay with what your pastor says is that the word way is that what we're taught we just had to get that out of the way so the Devil Couldn't try to throw something up we just family that's we just want to serve God but the most one of the most misunderstood Revelations that was revealed in the seals right right was election and predestination the prophet called it I know it's a big word and that's what the prophet said he said predestination I know that's a big word for you Pentecostals are for you Baptists yes so I know when I've learned through the School of Hard Knocks brother Greg that when the enemy is attacking me on a certain point God must really have something important to say [Applause] so when God is coming into your private life or when Satan's coming into your private lives attacking you behind closed doors on a certain subject you just know this God knows that's it and you can be assured that his bride is going it God's going to expose the enemy one of the greatest misunderstood teachings yes sir is election yes predestination I'm not going to bring Doctrine to another man's Pulpit he's well gifted you have a very good teacher uh we give we give praise to God for the gift in the church amen my goodness can I get started yes my brother I didn't start my time clock [Laughter] maybe we could just stand together and to rest our bodies for a moment and turn to First Corinthians chapter 12. First Corinthians chapter 12. we're just going to read a verse here verse 3. I wish to speak to you this morning by the grace of God the voice of God the voice of God praise God First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 3. I hear a few pages turning so we'll just be patient I like how brother Stephen says I want you to see it in the Bible I want you to see it for yourself so you know I'm just not telling you something First Corinthians 12 and verse 3. wherefore I give you to understand as Paul speaking now that no man speaking by the spirit listen carefully now by the spirit not of man of God calleth Jesus a curse now that's really important there's no way I can finish this this teaching this morning but maybe if I can just share a little bit of my heart with you and then you can go back and study and search this out would that be okay I appreciate your kindness and welcoming Spirit here this morning Paul saying that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a curse now here's the other side of them that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost amen by the Holy Ghost may the Lord bless the reading of his words you may have your seats now I want to just uh give you a little bit of an example before I get started and that is I want to take you to the scene where Jesus is asking his disciples who he is but the first question is who do men say yes my brother yes sir yes Paul caught that vision are you with me preach that this this word is it works we we just we just got to let the word do what the word does amen God didn't ask my opinion about it he certainly didn't ask me should he or should he not write this or that he had that all figured out if somebody tells you that there's contradiction in the scripture that just tells me they ain't got the new birth I mean I'm not I'm not down in that person I'm just saying they they must be born again we must be born again that's it each one has to have that new birth yes yes sir without the new birth you can never recognize who your father is are you with me don't don't get confused on that no because there's uh oh here we go there's a seed down inside of you brother Branham said it was the Deep call us to the Deep so that that's the voice of God calling to the voice of God if I get to the end of this it'll be a miracle preach my brother listen to Paul's letter again wherefore I give you to understand in other words listen carefully I got something important to say to it that no man he'd left no question that no man speaking by the spirit of God now there's man that's it that's it that's it that handle the word of God is this okay yes that handle the word of God that are not called to handle the word of God neither do they have the what the spirit of God I yep yes [Applause] yes [Applause] yes perfect so I guess I'll make myself at home ah [Laughter] praise God and we could die just turn over to II Timothy second Timothy three I will again want to lay a scriptural Foundation to what I'm telling you so now you uh now you will see it for yourselves and you'll say no man told me this but God himself that's exactly exactly yes sir second Timothy chapter three now keep this in mind what Paul has said that no man no man except by the spirit of God Amen amen yes sir second Timothy chapter three if you're there say amen amen I like how this starts out verse one this no also yes it's it's fun to read the word of God to me it's a joy to me this no also so now on to the word like okay tell me tell me right I'm not saying I'll have to read so when brother Stephen asked me if I read um I read it I read it because it constrains me to read that's my brother it brings me joy yes sir praise God trust me I learned that through Hard Knocks this no also that in the last days we are there that this was prophecy and this day this scripture is fulfilled amen amen he says that in the last days perilous times shall come so we wonder why say father why why is this happening why is it I told you why I told him I warned you this was going to come Hallelujah can I go on my brother that in the last days perilous times shall come but let's go to verse 2. can we read verse two yes for men also now we're finding we're finding the deception of the enemy that's it he likes to hide but he needs a body to hide in that's that boy oh boy I don't know about you but he ain't got no room in the end here [Music] because this room's full this this room's full of the Holy Ghost [Applause] full of the spirit of God so now I can recognize brother Kelly who Christ is and I can identify not only who Christ is but who I am because we are one there's no room for the enemy brother Brandon said you can't help when the thoughts come over you but don't let them take a nest don't sit there and ponder about that thought the prophet taught us take it to the word be good bereans and and study and show yourself approved oh boy glory to God for men shall be lovers so if the first verse is true yes the second verse is true also amen for men shall be lovers of their own selves that's the problem that's the problem so you know the Bible tells us that there are three things that stand in our way now let's be careful it's not three other people it's not your neighbor lust of the flesh yes lust of the eyes and the pride of life yes it seems so simple but what happens is we start listening to another voice other than the voice of God amen amen we listen to our own voices nobody nobody knows this like I do a sectarian is it's when they say this little group right here this little group right here we have the voice of God and if you aren't in this little group right here that's it that's it what you effectively have done is silence the voice of God because you have your own voice now you can read the scriptures you can quote the quotes but that doesn't mean that you can call him Lord Jesus pray to my brother that just means you're educated that's [Music] it that means you just have the ability to read words that's it and remember them and make notations uh-huh but when the spirit of God moves upon you when the anointing comes upon brother Bynum said a man shouldn't handle this word unless he's met the pillar of Fire yes sir I have to leave that there preach about that can I go on one step further Paul said First Corinthians 12 3 that you can't even sit there and receive the word without meeting him the Holy Ghost without the spirit of God do you do you understand what I'm saying otherwise star benchwarmer but when it's life to you when it's life to you it'll metamorph you it'll change you you become a new creature in Christ Jesus your old things are passed away now the devil doesn't forget about your old things though that's right but God according to the message doesn't see them no more oh win win confessed when a true repentance not that we got caught not not that somebody called us on the carpet about it but that the pillar of fire personally came to you because it's hard and as I would preaching as much as I would teach her as much as brother Stephen uh would would a tremendous teacher of this word and gift it would hand it over to you we can't give you revelation neither can the prophet give you Revelation but the Holy Ghost he will lead you to all truth that's that's the simple as it gets yes that's as simple how do I know because I'm more witness of that I'm a very uneducated man I didn't like school apparently graduated at a young age God called me at 13 years old God put a poll in my life but the last thing I wanted to do was preach this message first for for a couple of reasons if I just might be honest with you preach my brother one is um no I huh I can barely read and write how are you how are you going to have me stand in front of people and read that's kind of embarrassing I can't even say my words right A lot of times by two that's the problem I've seen a lot of hypocrisy so how can I'm young even now I'm young remember I said don't let the white hair fool you yes but at the age of 13. I could hear what's being said then I go home or I go over to such and such home we don't need to say names or anything like that that's not important the point is right when I don't see a Living Word that's it my brother that's it my brother yes my brother yes sir so let me even just start right here at the pulpit if we may uh-huh if I preach this message yes sir and leave here and go live a different life there's no confidence not in me but in the word that's do you see why Satan took chapter or verse 2 of chapter three here in second Timothy except for men shall be lovers of their own selves that's right self-motivation motives that drive the choices we make that's the choices we make but let me just tell you if you ever meet that Pillar of Fire if you ever come in contact with the spirit of God it'll change your life you won't have to seek God brother Brenda preached a message called discernment yes oh here we go [Music] I'm just gonna come get right down here and just talk with you share a pastor's heart maybe yes my brother you know when when a man stands behind a Pulpit right let's even go a little bit further when a husband comes to church and he says Amen to the word and on the outside he's looking really good uh-huh you might even see him hugging his wife right holding her hand maybe as they go through the mall or whether sitting at the restaurant huh but let that can't get rubbed backwards one time yes my brother and you'll see what that man's made of that takes when perilous every home you find out whether that man is familiar with the voice of God or the voice of the enemy you'll find out which one he's been listening to really yes my brother maybe even saying amen too yes you understand yes sir pretty soon it's manifesting time there was a former Reign the teaching rain now the latter rain which is the Harvest rain which is now the manifesting or the Gathering of the fruits yes yes it's a gathering of the crops if I can say it that way the spirit of God is brooding over the Earth is brooding down through the Earth collecting the Bride of Jesus Christ pulling it out of this one here pulling it out of this one here pulling this little group out of this one right here and he said she will be without spot or ring [Applause] she'll be there'll be no blemish but to the onlooker to the outside oh you can't come in here because you don't think like us you don't see it like us have you ever been there and then you begin to doubt your own walk you begin to doubt your own revelation but Jesus said to the question he said who do men say that I am right something oh no now here's where the rubber meets the road but who do you say I am I'm in I'm in glory to God the fullness of the godhead bodily said to Peter blessed are thou yes sir because flesh and blood in other words men with motives men with false doctrines men with false preaching amen didn't show you that [Laughter] you see where Paul caught that Paul said oh under the inspiration of God right yes so it was the revelation of God the spin the spirit of God that moved upon Paul to write the word of God the letters of God to write the New Testament Brothers right amen to catch that and to hand it because now this letter ate the Corinthian Church was a believing church that poor brother Pastor Paul uh having to deal with that Corinthian Church I I say praise God I can't wait to shake his hand can you say Amen I know we have some Corinthian churches around here but just know this God has sent a message in this day to call a brine out of denominationalism to call a bride out of confusion to call a bride out of verse two second Timothy chapter three men lovers of themselves right but he said blessed are thou yes Flesh and Blood didn't reveal anything amen but my father which is in heaven yes he has to reveal and now here's the key part that Upon This Rock the revelation of Jesus Christ and let me go one step further it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you in this hour yes yes it's the same spirit of God but it's in a different time so there's a message that doesn't work for that time but there's a message that works for this time are you with so the prophet will teach us in that message to German if you haven't heard that I encourage you go listen to it it will really change uh some some of our perception of different things it's very correcting let me say that yes sir if I might just share it I didn't put any of the quotes up here for it but you can go back and take a look at it uh and I encourage you to like I said I don't want you to take my word for it but the prophet said not to look at the person right right yes sir but to discern the spirit you are called you each and every one of you the members of the body of Jesus Christ is called to discern the spirit of men even if they are of another belief that come on now I'm just preaching message to you these these aren't my ideas I ain't that educated but to discern the spear that's in them they may be a Baptist right I'm just trying to let you have some peace about some things so we knock down this cult thinking that's exactly right you hear me when you're able to discern the spirit in a man yes then you can find out they have the same motive as you do let me go another step further and quote the prophet it's still the spirit of God in them [Applause] that's why the prophet would call them brother but he would go one step further and say now let's bring you home how about Discerning the spirit that's in me oh it's easy to look and see somebody else it's easy to hear the voice of God for somebody else exactly right but let's start calling on the name of Jesus for ourselves because the scripture said if your heart condemns you what then ask so if there's no condemnation in me I can hear there's a Clear Channel between me and the father it's pretty simple to me it's so simple I just believe it I'm very thankful God didn't make me an intelligent man you asked some of my family they'll say he's dumb as rock but you know I forgive them for that but there's no big eyes little use in this economy we are brothers and sisters I can love you just like I can love my own immediate family my own biological DNA because I see and can discern the spirit of God in Me and the discernment of the spirit of God in you and know that in this place the Master's welcome [Applause] there's no hindrances here I I think maybe maybe the devil tried to show up to church but when the spirit of God where there's unity in the spirit of God there's power amen Discerning the spirit of God [Music] wow what a message that is there you go brother Stephen it just makes me want to go back and listen to it again amen amen praise God what time of day is it anyhow can I read to you uh out of the church age book s now if I stumble you can laugh it'll be all right it's the very last page the very last page of the church age so now if you've gotten through the church age book you get to the icing on the cake can I read it to you now not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may what follow me so now we have a servant of God a Vindicated prophet of God all right that is not fulfilling verse 2. [Music] speak to God if God wouldn't even allow him to smoke a cigarette come on if God wouldn't even allow him to take a drink because of his emotions you know the life story I'm sure you've heard it I don't have to labor there if God won't allow wouldn't allow that office to be polluted in that way certainly he would keep him from self-motivation this messenger for this day had no motive but to point the Bride of Jesus Christ to the author and finisher of our faith it's the alpha omega principle yes my brother do you understand the alpha omega principle it doesn't include about me I'm just included in that principle [Music] all praise God not for one moment do I bring this just kills all the critics you had a motive brother brainer you were point he sat in the seals he said in the seven seal he said now when this gets out it's going to cost me ten thousand of my friends he called them friends oh that's another subject let's stay away from that one praise God I'll leave it for one of these evangelists how about that he says do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join you folks are well taught that's amazing brother Stephen you've got a wonderful Church so when you have a minister saying or a pastor let's just put it in my lap when you have a pastor saying come to my church we teach this come come to my church we have the full truth yeah red flags are going every direction but when you have somebody say to you have you ever heard the voice of God what what do you mean is there a voice of God it's kind of like when the question was asked have you been baptized we know not whether there be any baptism how are you baptized have you heard the voice of God in this day yes my brother you might get some funny looks you might get some strange responses at first but as long as you're not pointing to yourself Jesus said take no thought of what you shall say for in the hour I will speak through so when there's no motive when there's no objective but Christ when we just want to point others to Christ then he can freely use you but if you find yourself struggling to witness to somebody we still believe in that right we I got a few we still believe in witnessing wasn't that the commission going to all the world now you don't have to stand back open and preach brother your life brother Bynum said yes sir the greater preacher greater Ministry than I could have standing behind us yes because you only get to hear me for an hour and Lord bless you for that but it's your life that people will see let me just bring it at home with you it's your life that your wife will see it's your life that your children will see yes my brother oh my God listen to these words to follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization um [Music] I I think God's cleaning the house not not here but around the world it didn't just start yesterday you know God's words are eternal ah he said I have never done that and will not do that now well I can have confidence in a man like that that you discern the spirit it's not a human being yes yes I don't worship the human being I discern the spirit that's in the man praise God I mean you you can read this book we know it was inspired by God but you know it came through a voice of a prophet can can you imagine brother Stephen being in the prophet shoot I I don't even want to try to imagine that I've literally heard people say I wish I had what he had or I wish you'd be careful what you're wishing for when God calls a man he ordains that man he equips that man I'm I'm preaching now to the family here when when God calls a family he equips that family now there will be perilous times there'll be trials let me tell you this God never tempts you [Applause] that that Temptation comes from the Devil exactly like are you with me brother Burnham said that God will allow trials to come for testing and and it's not now this is where we got to catch this by the way this all has to do with the voice of God if you haven't caught that already but what God will do is he'll allow this to take place but it's not so remember job right remember Joe God knew God knew who Joe was before God knew exactly what job was going to do some will say God sent job up for failure Maybe [Music] what God was doing was manifesting himself in job because there will come false accusers with men of their self-motives they will strongly accuse you they will strongly tear you down they tried to destroy the testimony in your lives but sometimes God allows that do you hear me Church's spoken word you are can I maybe say that the Church of job God has allowed testing maybe if I could give you a message this morning God has allowed the testing to manifest himself in the pure unadulterated work in Gastonia North Carolina [Applause] not because he had confidence in you but he had confidence in the spirit of God that was in you the prophet would call it the fullness the Fulfillment of God in you in this hour praise God praise God praise God [Applause] I don't care what the devil throws at you [Applause] God knows yes yes sir yes so don't be discouraged if one's battling depression or anxiety God will never leave you nor forsake you God will never let you go yes my brother he's here to tell you this morning it's okay maybe he's here to tell you it is well it Is Well with My Soul amen Glory to glory to God can you say that this morning yes from the bottom of your heart [Applause] blessed be the day I'm trying not to cut up right now there's language coming from all different directions but let me tell you what he deserves my praise and my glory because it is well inside my soul he transformed me from Darkness into life the things that I used to desire I desire them no more you may remember my past but my heavenly father the Alpha and the Omega he never remembers it I'm free I'm free let me just say this the prophet of God you know the story about the man the soldier that was bound by homosexuality spirit it just took the word friends it just took the voice of God not the voice of a man but the voice of the god and that demon had to walk out and I had no choice he didn't stand can somebody hear me he didn't say you have to come to the altar he didn't say it's not going to work unless you come up here and put a show on he just took a walk with the prophet [Music] [Laughter] he took a walk with the messenger of this hour and the spirit of God that was upon that messenger let me even say this that was in that messenger protruded out of him it was the spirit of God the voice of God do you hear me that came out of the messenger and that demon had to leave and what did he say I'm free if you're bound this morning the voice of God is here in this room it's not me it's the voice of God in this room telling you you can be free you don't have to come to an altar I'm not against altar calls but you can get it right in your seat it works it works yes my brother praise God praise [Music] to my brother preacher he that the spirit is set free is free indeed [Applause] oh my goodness praise God what a wonderful presence of God preach my brother can I give you a little testimony I was bound by cigarettes do I have any former smokers so you know what I'm talking about do I have any former drinkers well I'm right at home nine nine among amongst alcoholics not amongst Sinners but the redeemed [Applause] you see we have a unique Fellowship we understand one another [Applause] it's like the little boy went to buy that dog right and he said I'm gonna take that one and that one had a bum leg and the owner said why why son why would you buy that dog it's all broken leg and he pulled up his leg and he had a prosthesis hunt he said we understand one another [Music] we understand what you have a heavenly father that came down embodied in a Corporal body [Music] that whether you're 12 years old and you're fighting a pornography addiction whether you're 13 years old fighting suicide for uh oppression whether you're a 15 year old trying to find your identity he knows can you say he knows he knows the redeemed of the Lord say so amen my favorite song it is well I wish I was a good singer oh praise God um I was bound by nicotine demon [Music] look you know I I I like giving God the glory But Not only was I bound when I told you that God called me and I ran into the world let me tell you I put it like my mother-in-law told me she she told my wife she said look as hard as he served the devil that's as hard as he's going to serve God because it's in his nature pray to my brother so when I was bound by the enemy let me just say I was bound by a lot but to give God the glory it was one day and I was driving truck I think there's another truck driver in the church here yeah I knew I'm in good company I told you I wasn't a rocket scientist you know when I brother Stephen when when I went to uh when when God spoke to my heart and said this is your last chance it got my attention he knows just what to do that was his love I said okay I give up I stopped running but I had a lot of baggage I have a lot of scars I can't take those scars away but my father he has a new body right it's never had a taste of cigarette a drink of alcohol doesn't have a tattoo that you hear me it's perfect like his own body so when I felt that pull this is why I'm telling you I know at work I'm not speaking from the outside looking in I'm not telling you something that I'm guessing at I'm living in shoe leather walking in shoe leather to testify to the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour it works it works you can write that down on a magnet put it on your refrigerator and every time the enemy comes by just say it works praise God you see I had to be honest with God and he likes you to talk to him and be honest that's the key I said you know father my body really enjoys these cigarettes read to my brother my body really enjoys that alcohol that's the way to praise I'm not hiding anything at that point I need a friend there's no friend like Jesus I need help I need a Deliverance I couldn't I obviously proved I couldn't deliver myself if he let me go guess where I'm going preaching my brother that's why the new birth works when I told my pastor then that I was going to go into the truck driving world and I can't say that I blame him he said that's ridiculous you going into the truck driving and if you don't know the truck driving world you ain't missing anything but there ain't nothing good out there let me tell you [Laughter] you want to meet Devils aha God will have a witness everywhere though amen when I said to follow I said father my body really likes these it really enjoys those but I don't want to smoke I I don't have a desire to drink no more my body does and I sounded ridiculous to myself because you know I didn't even know how to really pray right I wasn't all fancy with my prayers like the publicans right I like the prophet he wrote a letter put it on a tree yes praise God listen I just said I need your help because I can't quit these things that's it that's it that's the key my brother you didn't uh oh here we go you didn't make me start I did that myself I can take you to the day I started and why did I do it because it was the cool thing to do it was popular with the ladies and we were big and cool thank you brother God likes a contrite heart he knows that's he knows so when you confess now repentance can I start my message now [Applause] my my repentance was true I never tried to hide anything from anybody that's not that it never works right let me tell you I was in Pulaski Tennessee anybody know where Pulaski Tennessee is there we go uh maybe Cornersville Tennessee area and I was getting unloaded and let me tell you what I understood my pastor's heart that he said that's not good for you but it's exactly where God wanted me why because I need to hear the message in a pure form amen and I had lots of hours to listen to the message can I just be honest with you now [Music] I would stop the message to smoke a cigarette look I know it works I didn't want to disrespect the message while I was smoking I had enough sense about that [Laughter] I would never speak against the prophet because I knew that was truth even though I didn't surrender myself to it I knew it was true I couldn't explain anything to you somebody asked me what the godhead was I'd be like I have no idea somebody I remember I was raised in a Pentecostal Message Church oh dear Lord Jesus you're

covet your prayers Satan's trying to take my voice now listen I went through a very very serious stage of anxiety and depression huh pray to my brother I'm not speaking from an office I was one in my mid-30s a married man I was on my mother's couch curled up like a little baby feeling I had lost my mind I would go to work and have to turn around and come back home because I would feel like I was going to die I would feel like I just overwhelming if you unless you've been there you don't understand but my father's been there he understands he knows it was horrible I can't tell you how many trips I made to the hospital friends look demonic bondage is horrible run for your life don't see how close you can get to it the prophet said see how far you can get just just get shot in with Jesus it'll be okay [Applause] I would go to the hospital on a regular basis my whole life would be brother Steve informed around that I was close enough to a hospital that if I had a heart attack I could get there get in there within four minutes hold on I spent a lot of time of course we didn't have Google there they still had medical dictionaries an uneducated person trying to read but I was trying to to know and understand think for God I knew better than the doctors they would say you have perfectly good health no no you're missing some I have a heart attack or something it's a real bondage friends preach my brother it works they had me on Xanax and then of course that's such I don't know if any of you know what that is but it's such a powerful drug yes sir super addictive addiction and you know the enemy knows what he's doing uh-huh but one day yes the voice of God come speaking amongst all that confusion it's kind of like Jonah was whenever you're in trouble look East let me just say it this way whenever you're in trouble look up not only your Redemption but your freedom draws nine can you say praise God when you're in trouble look up [Music] they don't call it depression for nothing because you're always looking down oh when there's freedom when there's freedom and there's joy in the joy of the Lord what happens to your hands [Music] [Applause] [Music] what happens to your head [Applause] what happens to your heart [Applause] the joy of the Lord is your what [Applause] [Laughter] praise God I know him as my redeemer I know him as my deliverer I know him as my savior My Healer and my restore because that's what he said in Malachi 4. I come to restore the hearts of the children back to the father let me just say it this way I come to restore the seed back to its original position Christ is a mystery of God revealed his threefold purpose [Applause] great I don't even know why I put this up here praise God praise God let's read this together I'm going to close here okay can we open the airport brother [Laughter] foreign I thought I was a quiet pastor look what you did to me you know brother Tim cross warned me of you [Applause] I like to see the joy of the Lord all right let's let's read this before although we aren't worried about any chicken burning are we or any roast beef Lord Jesus not for a show or not to do that but that your word might be listen carefully to this this is beautiful you never heal the people just because to show your God but it was the fulfilling it was fulfilling the word and that's the way why I do this father is my faith to believe listen to this careful let's let's just let the prophet say what he said don't think right I tell the church back home don't think Carnival we're in Heavenly places now father is my faith to believe that this good woman can be healed of what so a good woman uh-huh I'm just letting you see yes my brother I'm just letting you see don't never let the devil tell you you're not a good person okay yes yes it's not about your looks we don't go by looks it's in you're well taught you're well taught spoken word you understand there's a body realm there's a spear around and there's a soul realm we understand what the prophet said about the spirit Realm can can I can I continue with this right the prophet said that you don't think with your brain go look at it I'm not a physician I'm just telling you what the problem says he said it's just a bunch of muscle and cells listen to me carefully now I don't know why God's going this direction but we're just going to go he just did a 180 degree turn with the plane listen your brain sends signals to your body that's that's its function yes sir right yes God designed this body I think he did a good job the prophet of God said now listen carefully the prophet of God said that a doctor can set a bone but he can't heal you that's exactly right that's exactly we thank God for doctors they have their place right that's what the prophet said right now if God uh chose to use a physician to remove a tumor and they get all that tumor out of there then good the life has to leave right right it doesn't have something to dwell in right but your brain now look the devil is very smart he's good at his job he studies you right right he listens to your conversations right now he can't hear what you think but he hears what you confess [Applause] yes my brother so if you think one thing you know I'm quoting a prophet now and you do another what you better stop that [Music] yes my brothers he said you don't think with your brain but the devil studies you because he's got to know how to attack you that's right so he's looking for your weakness he's looking to find the weak spot the prophet said you got to cover that weak spot how do you cover that with the word with the voice of God it works my brother so when you have a psychology oh trying to tell you that you have a part of your brain that wasn't developed and this is why you're depressed or this is why that's a lie that goes back to the devil now I'm not saying that that physician is trying to be wrong but I got to just stay with what the prophet says that's it it's not a brain issue your emotion your memory your reason your imagination your conscience is in the spirit Realm amen that's where you think with that's where you have a memory of amen that's where you reason amen amen amen and brother Stephen it's also where you can sear your conscience listen to me carefully the devil can't seal your conscience but if he can get you to do it what does that mean preaching my brother take your time can I just break that down just a little bit break it down look I thought about it a bunch of times of putting a circle up there but we're just gonna roll with it at home I wouldn't listen thank you brother listen God doesn't deal with you in your spirit Realm but you have to be able to take it in exactly right exactly right it has to come through the inlets the five senses has to drop in through the spirit through the spirit that listen we're looking at seer in your conscience but if you stop it right there [Applause] if you stop it right there it's an intellectual understanding that's it and I'm afraid there's been a lot of intellectual preaching that's exactly but when it drops past the spear around brother and it strikes that soul ah you want to know what the sign of the new birth the evidence of the new birth is is that you say Amen to every word not that you reasoned it out in your mind and it was correct you're too late to tell me that nonsense amen that was the whole issue in the beginning but when it strikes the soul and there's a seed of God there it can't help but say Amen I don't understand it all but amen [Applause] that's it my brother I can put it on the shelf of my heart do you hear me if somebody wants to make fun because I say I have to put on the Shelf of my heart that's not going to sway me anywheres because I'm looking and pressing towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus [Music] I'm Not Looking Back but I'm looking forward if we stay that's right the frogs that Look Backwards right yes sir but she they follow the shepherd hey don't worry he he's got me amen but when the voice of God it gets through all the physical and it gets through all the spiritual it has this wonderful tendency by the correct to clear up all this fogginess and some that has been sitting right next to you for all their life will say why is it so clear to you and so foggy to me do you understand now how it works you it's not complicated we just have to get past verse two of second Timothy 3. amen amen wow when it strikes the soul that's it it doesn't have any senses it's got one sense the prophet of God would call it the what faith now can I preach amen Hallelujah it was fulfilling the word and that's the way why I do this tonight father is my friend so it wasn't emotion do I have a little Freedom I'm in that's the problem with many youth camps [Applause] I'm sorry brother Stephen you will probably get some backlash for that one I get to go home but but he's got big shoulders so God's equipped him well okay wow yeah I did I went there sorry not sorry look unless music but that's where it starts [Applause] why don't you know you start to find pastors song leaders youth leaders joining in with denominational oh so if you have denominational seats you're going to have denominational babies [Applause] let me go one step further it's because they're afraid of the word but let me tell you what it works you don't have to make somebody come to Jesus you [Applause] you don't have to work them up to come to Jesus you don't have to try to discern them [Music] [Applause] the word says he's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart you don't have to put on a show just let the word work then it has a solid foundation [Applause] and I'm afraid there's been too many denominational babies been hatched they'll have to give an account for that friends that's between them and God my purpose today is to bring you a pure message from almighty God [Applause] to tell you it works brother it works yes my brother this message works [Applause] [Music] I'm the recipient of it [Applause] I believe it was the prophet that said [Music] to sing a few songs is this okay to create a right atmosphere [Applause] to create a right atmosphere not a spiritual atmosphere but a soul-changing atmosphere [Music] where he will be welcomed where he will be walking and it starts at home [Applause] [Music] when you know Wednesday night service is coming up tonight stop right start seeking God you'll get what you expect but it transforms right from the home right from the vehicle outside into the sanctuary [Music] this this is the house of God right here but it's not for a show is that what your Prophet said it's not for a show but for the glory of God because there's really truly people that are bound by addictions that are too scared to come out and say I need help because of what somebody might say about them we've got our own families kicking children out of their families because they don't dress right because they don't act right but instead of Discerning the spirit of God that's down inside that individual and letting the word do its work foreign call me to be a savior he did that do you hear me he called me to be a dad he called me to be a husband he called me to be a brother he called me to be a friend and a preacher that'll get up here and try to save you is in the wrong motive friends glory to God but when you have a man that's yielded to this move of God that doesn't care what God says just let the word and it lines up from Genesis to revelation [Music] and it lines up from the entire message it works it works I promise you it works we get our youth together what is the purpose of that is it for a show is it to make money oh it's to introduce Jesus Christ look we don't get him the Holy Ghost one day and they get it another no no no no no no no no no that's not how it works [Music] once you've been born again you can't be unmarred now that's from an uneducated man that's coming fresh from the Throne of God the new birth works it works preach my brother if we can just get ourselves out of the way let me say this you notice how God's moving lately he's bringing people that you've never heard of before what the prophet say there'll be those there that you do don't ever give up on your children don't ever give up on your husband or your wife don't ever give up on yourself [Applause] it works it works I want every one of you to be able to say I am en I'm free to worship Him I'm free When I Call On the name of the Lord he's going to hear my prayer [Applause] amen amen praise God praise God the prophet never displayed a show no sir no sir he never your Liberty to show me pointed to himself matter of fact there come a point in time he wanted to go hide in the mountains now does that sound like oh does that sound like somebody that wants to do a public show he said this will not be a public show yes my brother this isn't a public show the voice of God is personally Christ's submission God revealed to you you just bring your little lick of fire amen thank you and when you bring your liquefier and your liquefier we got a bonfire [Applause] [Music] hell I have no fire like the Holy Ghost Fire praise God Amen preach my brother [Music] I gotta stop with these handles you guys are pulling weight God knows what he's doing if we can just set our motives aside let him have his perfect work in our life you'll be okay let's let's finish this up Lord help me father is my faith to believe that this good woman can be healed of this demon are you ready yes Satan I charge you in the name of William Brown so now we're looking in the name of Jesus Christ who triumphed Over All sicknesses come from the Devil clinical depression is a demon it comes from the Devil and it's under his feet and his servant I take I take the initiative in Jesus name Leave The Woman come out of her now let me ask you do you think that demon was just gonna maybe say wow he knew when he had to go now listen carefully listen very carefully to this this is I wanted to come to this and the message what is the attraction on the mountain he said what's the attraction that's what the attraction is the predestinated seed of God who can't do nothing else but follow it means more than life to us [Applause] does that sound like somebody reasoning to you take our lives but you don't take that what is the attraction God as usual [Laughter] you know it was common to the prophet brother Stephen to see the usual things of God because he dwelt in the atmosphere of God and let me just say you tell you this this morning I hope it's still morning but then you can have that same indwelling you can dwell in that atmosphere just like the prophet did let me take you to the message that is the rising of the sun he said it's the first fruits it's the first wave Chief offers what is he waving above the Bride of Jesus Christ not William Branham but the message he's waving the Harvest the first fruits the son of man Ministry fulfilled this day he never waved himself he waved it was the message the Fulfillment the Fulfillment amen write this down put it put it in your soul you won't for David said hide it in my heart I hide you I hide the word in my heart I won't forget listen carefully Hallelujah true repentance yes opens the door for the Fulfillment are you with me true repentance opens the door yes not emotional repentance so why would I want to lead you to an emotional repentance why would I want to lead you to an emotional response but if I can point you to the word it works and when a true repentance because the prophet of God said don't come up here with what sin in your life he didn't say attributes he said don't come up here with sin and what it said so don't come up here because it's going to get exposed [Applause] it it'll get exposed I gotta stay away from those Trails let's just focus here and close this so look we're not dwelling on healing that is a gift that's a promise from God first it worked it's there for for you for the believer because he knew you were going to need it right but it all starts with the principal Foundation of God's word is you have to be free from condemnation when you're free from condemnation you can receive the fullness of the spirit of God because then you can say to this mountain be removed uh are you with me yes so you without the fullness of the Holy Ghost you open yourself up to unbelief because you'll start working in that Spirit Room the prophet wasn't kidding when he said well there's a reason why that demon won't leave right because he has a right to stay there but when he's exposed it's really pretty simple right but if you want to follow but if you want to be bound by that there comes a point in time you worship that sickness why do people worship sickness oh [Music] because they receive attention oh yes [Applause] yes my brother now on yes my brother yes sir yes well I can tell you that devil didn't like that but we're going to expose him anyhow that's it my brother oh my God look the reason why people seek attention is because they're lacking it somewhere [Music] continue to move on that's why the prophet said it's not child delinquency that's exactly like it keep pressing you're getting ready get it it's apparent delinquency now look here let me tell you something you can't go back and undo what we did as parents my daughter and my son bear scars from my poor choices notice what I said there my poor choices I was selfish I didn't care about anybody else but myself and would do anything to get what I wanted I know none of you have ever felt that right but I'm I'm just here to stand as a testimony that he took a selfish nature he took a one that just wanted to please self so I'm not speaking as a novice to Second Timothy 3 2. but from experience I know what that demon is look what it is is you never see really what the devil is setting the trap for you about that's exactly right that's exactly right he's not just going to put up a neon sign he's not just going to put it up on a PowerPoint slide and preach to you with it he's going to find the weakness right right and where does he find that now this is a pastor's heart where does he find that weakness family stream I'm just telling you what the prophet says but you don't have to keep using that as an excuse [Applause] because there's a word in this hour that come to exposed [Applause] not only a family strength but a national string amen amen we are not other we're we're here in this world but we're not of this world exactly right we're of a Heavenly Kingdom amen amen and in the Heavenly Kingdom it's not about you and I no sir it's about him so the devil will come and ever so slightly use a strain use a weakness here yes use a weakness there and the next thing you know he's setting that young daughter of yours up to find a man that'll come along and fill Daddy's spine preach my brother oh that's exactly right and are you hearing me yes sir and the next thing you know she got pregnant by that guy and then because she's ashamed because when that devil gets what he wants he pulls back that's it and you realize what you just did [Music] now you're in a peculiar predicament the intelligent people say about curious or however they say preach my brother so then they're going to get abortion or they go and do this and now on social media you have you have the devil anointing people to say if you have abortion you're not in this preach a sectarian it's a cop mentality preacher and some reason people find the necessity to try to defend against that right really what's happening they're battling the same thing themselves that's exactly right so instead of somebody getting on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or whatever and saying here's what the prophet said first seek ye first the kingdom of God it I don't have to argue whether the prophet was right or wrong seek ye first the kingdom of God and all his righteousness the prophet of God in the seventh seal said the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ cast us all it's as if it never happened [Applause] I don't ever see anybody on social media saying that because it's not popular it doesn't win many congregations to build a big church but it works it works that individual that's going through those trials you have no idea unless you've been there what kind of Torment each one is going through [Applause] brother Brandon said discern the spirits not to rebuke them not to kick them out of your church not to make them feel like there's no hope but there is hope that Daddy does love you even though you've done this daddy does love you it doesn't matter whether you did I don't agree with that but Daddy loves you because there has to be like The Prodigal Son he went and killed the fighter cat got the best dress on now does that sin sound like a father that had disrespect that didn't care have perfect love on Target's brother wow the devil's good at his job but God is better it works it works oh praise God [Music] glory to God I want to come to a point and then we'll close now without getting too involved in the subject of the sovereignty of God for that would take a book in itself let me he was honest let me point out and I like when he says this so so not paying attention he's got my attention out here that according to these verses these verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own brother just the same as men choose their Brides don't pull just hold on let the pastor take care of that you've got to stop because I keep wanting to go there but it's ah Lord you take care of this now okay you don't pull it out of me I I let me just say this the prophet said to us men that we have a place in our chest now we can move on there's only one that can fulfill that imprint now he said just as a man would choose his bride listen carefully the thoughts of God are eternal so the election [Applause] the election was in his mind [Applause] so before Oh Brother Stephen you have to clean this up so before the fall [Applause] [Music] [Applause] en the Bible invites us to go back to the beginning there's your quote marriage and divorce go back to the beginning because before the beginning it wasn't so [Applause] God had an imprint of your help me [Applause] nobody else could fulfill that empress nobody else so don't try [Applause] now how do we know what that imprint is go back to the beginning when I was one of everything uh-huh see it the polygamy Spirit crept right in yes [Applause] see if I could write as fast as you I could have wrote that are you proud of yourselves you just pulled me right off of that [Music] oh well that's what he said it works he didn't say it was going to be a bed of roses without forms anyhow oh we got to stop the bride today does not simply decide she's going to take oh he said it I didn't but I just believe it amen I can say Amen with a pure heart I just believe it it's it's really it's really simple you just can't operate after the beginning because he said he invites us to go back look marriage and divorce was 90 some percent spiritual can I say something that's why men with motives will tear down marriage and divorce because they don't they can't go back to the beginning [Applause] their motives they're motive their motives prevent them so what do they do then attack it let's go no sir it's the groom who decides that's it the natural types and chooses a certain woman for his scripture John 15 16. ye have not chosen me but I personal pronoun Prophet would say have chosen you [Music] amen not after the beginning but before the beginning praise God now according to the word of God we believe that the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world go ahead my brother this choosing of the bride was purposed do you see yes so the new birth according to Paul First Corinthians 12 3. can call no man can call the Lord Jesus Christ without the spirit of God so in other words unless that spirit of God chooses you calls you puts a desire in you that's it you can't respond to a pure word that's not me saying that because it's a choosing of a bride praise God now why why that the purpose of God according to election so there must have been something that fell related with husband and wife [Music] amen amen I like how brother Stephen says it and I'm gonna have to uh to borrow it from him this message is yummy it sure is you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself we're gonna have to have a part two to this and being Eternal listen carefully being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world watch carefully watch carefully before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him let me stop you just for one second so you see what the devil tries to do take the worship and adoration from God and put it in yourself so there's where I said people don't want to be healed because it brings attention it's a form of worship so you may not be bowing down to to an idol of Lucifer but yourself full of yourself if he can get you to not worship God who are you worshiping all right here we go so he was at the time he was at that time only potentially though and he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already now you know it wasn't me saying it the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts now in the Physical Realm excuse me in the spiritual realm that won't make no sense to you but if you can just digest this and let it drop down into your soul it'll come to life amen so and what about these thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God eternal this is powerful watch this that's it what a powerful quote what a powerful statement friends if you can see this not with your spirit if you can see this you will see many things see what the eternal Spirit thoughts of mind election of God are you ready so what did he do he sent you almost 1200 messages I call them love letters [Music] to me personally he said Dan I got something I want to share with you amen it's my voice that's it that's it I want you to hear my voice not politic voices not Church voices my voice personally to you I'm writing you a letter it's gonna be recorded from 1947 to 1965. I'm gonna make it to where you can even put it on a PowerPoint slide and share the good news with others amen amen amen you see this letter isn't to anybody else so when I make it personal then it's I'm not making it about me I'm making it to me so if I'm making his word to me then I'm not trying to make anything to you you understand the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life it's really that simple the choices we make friends let's finish this quote if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his ability so therefore he as God must be Omni mission if he's on the mission then he is not now learning do you understand what he just said it's not like Lucifer is just learning you uh your father knows you there's a song that says he knows my name amen amen amen Oh my he is then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge no sir if he can add to his knowledge then he is not Omni mission the best we could say is that sometime he will be amen amen amen amen sure Let It Drop just Just Let It Drop amen the best First Corinthians 12 3 now the best that somebody could say yes because they don't have the Eternal revelation if you can see this you will see many because they're looking from a dead position that's how do you hear it yes sir let's close but that is not spiritual or scripture I'm sorry he is Omni Mission he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has oh he's talking to me is he talking to you this morning he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal that's it they are real that's it they are not simply like a man with the blueprint II Timothy now he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already Eternal and part of God so when Dan was doing the things that Daniels were doing that's it when you were doing the things that you were doing those were not the Eternal thoughts of God Amen amen amen amen the Eternal thoughts of you of God were election in you so now it's the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God that's exactly right why why is it that this time why couldn't it be in Luther's time why couldn't it be in Wesley's time because that was in part yes my brother that was a Reformation that's it but it took a restoration what does that mean yes sir you go back yes for the beginning yes sir yes my brother and it took the voice of God yes my brother it took the voice of God that's my title yes it took the voice of God yes said take you back to the beginning yes sir to Eternity yes sir Christ is a mystery God reveals Yes Man together if you get a chance listen to that message it's amazing it's amazing the voice of God can you say Amen praise God praise God praise God do you love the Lord thank you brother father we thank you for your presence I just want to say thank you for your goodness this morning father I want to thank you for your presence because

soul knowing that it is well father may you protect us as we go into our respective place and may you be with us throughout the week Lord father may you bring your children to a conscience from the heart of the importance of mingling their life with their relationship with Jesus Christ father strengthened brother then remember him for the sacrifice Lord because we know that the footsteps of the
