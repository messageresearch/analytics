stand stand if you want to say a man say amen if you want to shout shout praise the lord let's go to the book of ezekiel chapter one last week was longer and i apologize i had to meet a certain point to make sure you get the first stuff there are two staves so we want to make sure you understand one then we can move to the second one so apologize not in uh intent to drag it but to make sure we reach a certain point and we get it amen how many have listened or were there when we preached the mystery of the tree heaven only few people can you raise your hand high the mystery of the tree heaven do you remember that do you remember that pretty good yeah because we stopped short somewhere and never finish it so i want to make sure if the majority of the church didn't get it so we probably need to start back zero and make sure nobody is left behind right yeah for some it might be a little bit of review then we kick in instead of me dropping on part three and you like gps lost [Laughter] gps signal loss ezekiel chapter 1 verse 26 if you're there you can say amen remember last week we read verse chapter one we started from the beginning you saw the caribbeans they were driving a chariot and you understand the wheels in the middle of the wheel so now everybody should be familiar with a wheel in the middle of the wheel it's not a mystery anymore remember the sounding of the seven angel all the mysteries must be revealed ezekiel chapter 1 verse 26 and above the firmament that was over the head this is the caribbean you remember that was the likeness of a throne so above the caribbeans they were thrown carrying something they were carrying the throne of god if you remember last week as the appearance of sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne in other words when you look at that throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it you might be seated so here just a quick recap from last week we understand that the caribbeans were carrying god which in the old testament was represented as the ark of the covenant because above the ark of the covenant was the mercy seat and on that mercy seat we have two caribbeans and right in the middle of the caribbean that's where god uses that place that specific spot as the throne of god so now we found out that the actual real throne of god when he was moving he was moving by four wheels four caribbeans they were carrying god and above that firmament there was like a firmament like heaven that's why we might need to touch on the mystery of the three heaven so when we say firmament heaven you know what it means in the scripture so above those caribbeans were like a heaven and above the heaven there where there was a throne and on that throne somebody sat there so we have the caribbeans this is a chariot with wheels right we got kerry beams right there and above the caribbean they were like in heaven and above that heaven there was like a throne a chair and on that throne somebody sat there right praise the lord verse 27 and as so as the color of amber so the person that sat here have a color of amber remember when ezekiel saw this vision at first he saw that there were a fire in the middle there was like whirlwind then there were fire splashing up but right in the middle of the fire there were a little fire like an ember which we know it's the pillar of fire now when the description becomes a little bit more clear we found out that four caribbeans came out of it and out of those feral four caribbeans there was a heaven above the heaven a throne on that throne that fire was in the middle in other words the fire that first appeared like in the middle of the whirlwind was not really in the middle it was above the caribbeans everybody clear the caribbeans or cherubims whichever one works and i saw as the color of amber as the appear of fire around the bad inside from the appearance of his loans if you want if you notice he says he is this is a man but when you look at this man the appearance look like a man but they measure this man from the launch everybody clear they didn't measure him from the head remember when we spoke about one of the seven engine with the seven valve that either the belt was where on the loins or the belt was put on the peps right but here the measurement is coming from the lungs so when ezekiel look at that man from the loins up right so if that man appeared today we must know where his loins are to measure him right but he looked like fire how are you going to see the lungs in the fire praise the lord he said from the appearance of his loins even upward and from the appearance of his lungs even downward as so as he were the appear of fire the appearance of fire and he had brightness round about it so when they look at this man this creature that looked like amber fire the color of amber if you take it from the launch going up this word and down this way all the way he looked like fire in other words when you look at this man even though he looks he have like the appearance of a man but he looked like fire but that fire is not like your fire he have a specific color which is the color of ember right praise the lord verse 28 as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud so not only does it look like the ember but we have a rainbow coming up from there like a covenant what is the name of the lord is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness around the bottom around the back this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord so if the glory of the lord appeared today that glory when he appears is going to appear like fire make sure it makes sense and that fire must have the color of ember right and that fire must look like a man and when you look at that fire up and down it look like a man and when you see that fire you must be sure the kerry beams are around there and they are carrying the throne of god right if that fire appeared today we must see this description on that fire let's see if that fire appeared today and when i saw it i fell upon my face and i heard a voice of one that spoke why did ezekiel fell down because he recognized that's the glory of god that's the presence of god ezekiel fell down and understand that this is the time of worship this is the place where to worship god because the throne of god is dead you worship god where his throne is his throne was in the tabernacle in the wilderness and he was hiding behind the badger skin and his throne was upon the ark of the covenant so when you want to talk to god you go there when you want to worship god you go there then he move all the way to the temple of solomon then from the temple of solomon he moved into the man jesus christ and today we must know where is the fire that will be the place of worship that's where you must meet god ezekiel chapter 16 it's time to swallow hard food somebody say it's deep what about i'm saying those deep chop off they make belief ezekiel 16 if you dare you can say amen verse 1 again the word of the lord came to me saying son of man thank you brother david cause jerusalem to know her abominations and say that saith the lord god to jerusalem so god is talking to jerusalem we know jerusalem is a city remember that angel da head the van todd john he said come let me show you the the city the new jerusalem which is the bride are you there so when they say city you need to know whether it's a natural city or they are talking about a spiritual city which is a church everybody clear now look at this jerusalem that said the lord god to jerusalem your birth the birth of this jerusalem your birth and your nativity nativity in other words your origin is of the land of canaan remember canaan was the land of heathen israel came destroyed the occupant and took over but originally it was their land of eden okay he's of the land of canaan your father was an amorite he's an amorite a jew so this jerusalem is born from gentile okay your father was an amorite wrong nature and your mother a high that high tattoo jews so this jerusalem is a jerusalem that is birthed from gender we clear now praise the lord and as for your nativity your origin in the day you were born your never was not cut so at the birth of this jerusalem this jerusalem never was taken care of normally normally when a child is born somebody must be there to cut the navel or the belly button if you want to call it are you there but when this jerusalem is born he is neglected you were born your never was not cut neither were you wash in water so jerusalem in a are you there nobody watched this jerusalem to separate you you were not salted at all no character right born in sin shaped in coming into the word speaking a mess no swaddle at all verse 5 no i pity you to do any of these to you to have compassion upon you that you were cast out in the open field are you there in matthew chapter 13 when jesus interpret the parable of the field jesus said the field is what how many knows the world do you want to see it are you okay you want to see it we okay okay if you want to see it i can show it to you for those who want to see it it's going to be in matthew chapter 13 verse 36 and 38 you can check that at home are you there so when jesus jerusalem was born this jerusalem was completely abandoned left in a mess a mess and they left it just to grow with the trend of the world cosmos to the nothing of your person in the day that you were born and when i passed by you so at the birth of this jerusalem there was a visitation of god are you there god visit this jerusalem at birth that's the first visit at birth everybody clear when god comes to you first he found you in a mess we clear now okay and when i passed by you and i saw you polluted in a mess drinking smoking all kind of stuff polluted in your own blood we know that blood carry life in other words you will mess in your own life a crook a prostituted right i said to you when you were in your blood live if god spoke life that means this baby was dying everybody clear so death was already said here dead in sin are you there then at the first visitation god brought life the first time god pass he's bringing life praise the lord yea i say to you when you are in your own blood in your own ways of thinking life live life i have caused you to multiply after they gave you life you begin to grow right i have caused you to multiply as the bad of the field and you are increased and watson great and you are come to excellent ornament your breasts are fashioned so god had first came and saw this jerusalem and when they are talking about breasts we understand that this jerusalem is a woman are you there but at first the woman was a child so god brought life and let that woman develop and god was just watching at the progress of the woman when the development of puberty began to come up praise the lord your breasts are fashioned your hair is grown you don't have baby hairs anymore are you there whereas you were naked still not clothed everybody clear and bare no shoe not clothes no shoes because shoes will not speak of the gospel all right the gospel of peace right naked the other leo audition right praise the lord verse 8 now when i pass by you this is the second now everybody clear on the first visit naked no shoes death i only came gave you life and left and left you growing but now i'm coming back on the second time not your birth anymore it's a second visit the reason why i'm coming because you are developed you are not a child anymore you are a grown woman now i'm coming at this time verse 8 now when i pass by you and look upon you behold your time was the time of what so there is a time of love young people there is a time to be born there's a time to grow and there is a time to get married i'm not going to preach on that right clear so god first came a birth but the second time he came at the time of love which is the time of marriage right because the bride that jerusalem is now developed she's ready to enter into a union the first time you were dying i brought you grace to give you life but the second time when i'm coming my intent is not for grace anymore my intent is for you gather the two stave off the ark of the covenant we clear somebody have not caught it yet and i spread my skirt over you remember roof you remember when she asked boaz spread your skirt now you understand what the roof was talking right you thought she was only saying put a skirt it's a lot right amen and i spread my skirt over you i claim you for marriage everybody clear and cover your nakedness so the nakedness is taken care on the second visit the first visit god look it's a child just grow up i understand mama i don't like him tolerance still no now let's tolerance you were grown up are we there i spread my skirt over you and cover your nakedness yeah i saw to you relation 10. i saw to you i didn't swear in the first time not when the church was a birth from jerusalem not there i only inspire you there right but now it's not my time to inspire you it's my time to marry you are we clear praise the lord and cover your nakedness yeah i swore to you and enter into uh now the second time we are getting into a covenant are we clear if you say who the lord god and you became not the first time not at the beginning of the churches but at the end that's when i'm coming to claim you i'm coming to unite with you i am coming to enter into a covenant with you the first time grace praise the lord verse 10 then washed are you with not at the first time with water yeah thoroughly thoroughly wash away you all so now i'm cleaning up your life completely out no more you out because you were polluted into that everybody there from you and i anointed you with what so not only did i clean you up with the washing by the water off the door and now i'm also anointing the token verse 10 i'll close you see the clothing when it comes because you need to get into a ceremony we clear now i close you also with embroidered work and charge you so i brought you also shoes which is the gospel watch that gospel i showed you with what if not i would release brother kalima i showed you with what badger skin if you remember in the old tabernacle the pillar of fire was behind are you there so this gospel is a gospel that is hiding the pillar of fire [Music] clear and i guarded you we about with what fun what which means what do you remember that seven ninja do you see how this sermon goes you miss one it's like algebra are you there and cover you with verse 11 attack you also with ornament and i put what what brandon say works upon your hand and a chain on your neck and i put a jewel on your resolution and air he wins faith grandma say that in your ear and a and a beautiful what run upon your head verse 13 thus where you deck with gold and silver and your remnant was a fine running and silk and brothered work you did eat fan floor and revelation 10 and and you are exceedingly that beauty is spoken of after the whole process beautiful and you did prosper into earth you become a kingdom now right verse 14 and your renown your reputation your fame went forth among them not the jews among the hidden for you all but remember that beauty who work on that beauty okay for your beauty not the beauty of ezekiel 36 or something that's the beauty of lucifer okay okay for your beauty for he was perfect perfection comes from that man through my to my in other words the beauty that you have now is according to my test remember esther she only have to be mad beautiful according to the instruction of the king so god is talking to this lady like the beauty you have now it is not your own beauty it is the beauty that i made myself according to my desire right not the beauty of your first life of your open field of the world by the beauty by me perfect through my commonness which i have put upon you who put it the lord says the lord god everybody clear now let's go to the last scripture and then we pray in ezekiel 1 a throne somebody sitting on the throne looked like amber from the launch up from the launch down carried by the caribbeans is ikea 16 there is a woman a city a lady jerusalem of the gentile had two visitation by god the first visitation she was in a mass god brought life brought grace and god left it and she begins to grow through the edges then at the end when she's a fully grown mature lady god comes now not for life but for union ephesians chapter 2 the message has already been preached and you have you has he what if somebody is quick and do you know what quick it means to make a laugh somebody was [Music] okay you has he quickened who are dead in what and what in a mess we clear now the bible does not contradict itself verse two wearing in time past your past you walk according to the course of this open field everybody clear according to the praise of the power of the earth the spirit does not work in the children of the children of the devil among whom also we all had our in other words you also were like them you were also acting like them in the past you have a testimony a portion of your life just like them okay among whom also we all had our conversation in time past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind and whereby amorite hi-tat okay by nature the children of what even us so by your first birth you were born by high-tech you were born from an amorite by far by your first nature you are not different than the people that are going in the nightclub verse four but god who is reaching mercy that's why he passed by are you there god who is reaching mercy for his great what but you are too young he can't get married to a baby right okay for his great love where if he loved us even when we were watching so when he was passing by on that field he looked at that baby when you are still dead god loves you are you there he loves you when you were dead in what polluted has quickened us together with by uh the first step his name is what by grace you are and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the edges to come paul is not talking he's in ephesian church age he said that in the ages to come he's now pushing towards something over there right in the ages to come he must show the exceeding witches of his grace and his kindness he could have left you just like everybody left you are you there his kindness to others through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through what and done not of yourself you were just a baby you could not help yourself not of yourself it is the word so when he passed by he could have left you but by love he just stopped and loved you and spoke life to you because it's just a gift of god everybody there verse nine not of what nothing you have done that's why brother branham said you have nothing to do less any man should work if you didn't you would say i did i did i did i did so he came when you could not help yourself when you got into the river you could swim he left you he said if i come and pick him up there he would say i knew how to swim he left you drink water drink water drink water drink water until you don't know what to do you begin to float in the river then he come and begin to pull you up are you there then when they say who brought you out of the water you know i'm gonna say i swim myself no he was somebody who rescued me so you don't post yourself praise the lord verse 10 for we are his what right he's somebody we are he's his masterpiece he have to come wash us out and an anointed and do so when you see me today i am just a product of jesus christ [Applause] you are honest it's not my honesty it is the honesty of jesus christ [Applause] why do you dress with a suit anytime it is because of jesus christ if not my parents could have been right here [Applause] are you there if not my parents will be right here and you see me walking like this but i don't walk like that because of jesus christ

that you being in time past what born from an ammo right and heightened in there that's your flesh here american asian african mess are you there who are called on circumcision by that which is called the circumcision in flesh in other words when the jews look at you they say hidden by hand that at that time you were without who being alien from the commonwealth of what and stranger from the covenant of promise having what having what in the first visit having what you were cast in the open field no hope [Music] right having what no hope if not you will be drunken this morning having what no hope and without in the in the open field over there without without god open film no hope 13 but now in christ jesus you who sometimes in the past were far off are made near by what for he is our who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you're doing for us father we did what a man any man can do is just take the word of this book and read them but to come down and give the revelation and interpret the word it takes the holy spirit because you spoke in your word that this word is not for a private interpretation lord we are moving our self aside may you help us move completely out of the way may you come and speak your word to your children father be the beginning and the ending of this service lord we commit everything unto the hand rebuking all kind of demonic spirit away from this place father may heaven be open up may forgive all our sins and trespasses but may you come down and visit us in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you last week we spoke about the mystery of the two staves we found out that when moses made the ark of the testimony god told moses to make two staves so one staff was on the other end and another stuff was on the other side now we wonder who should carry this ark and make the ark move so when we study last time we understand that the ark was moved by men and men was the wills that god borrowed in order to move his gospel or reason why when they came in front of jordan weaver what they found out was that the ark never touched the water the ark only engaged in the shoulder of the priest but now the power of the ark of the covenant was communicated into the priest until god recognized that when the hand when the feet of the priest touches the water the water will completely depart so now man and the world became one because the word was on the shoulder of the man which brother branham interpreted to us that the shoulder was their heart everybody clear now when we look at the first stuff of the ark of the covenant we describe to you that the ark that stuff was jesus christ now today we're trying to find out what about the second stuff everybody clear part two take zechariah chapter 11 what we wear if you dare you can say amen verse 7 praise the lord and i will feed everybody there and i will feed the flock of disorder even you are poor of the flock and i took to me two staves the one i call beauty we found out last time he was what grace because according to isaiah because jesus fulfilled the scripture and according to isaiah isaiah said there was no beauty to him and the correct translation was grace remember because the law came by moses that came by who jesus christ and jesus took that grace and gave paul a dispersion of what we clear now now it's clear if you miss the old one it's keep building up are you there and the one called beauty or grace and the other are called bands or what union and i fed the flock so the first staff was grace but the second staff was union there is two of them one is grace one is what at the first time it is grace but on the second time it is can i repeat it again on the first visit it is what but on the second visit it's working we okay praise the lord job to verse 10. and i took my stuff that's god even beauty or grace and carried a standard in other words god broke it and we found last week that in isaiah jesus was struck by god right there broken that amma break my what my covenant which are made with all god so god had a covenant with israel but by striking the messiah which is jesus christ he broke the covenant everybody there there is a mystery here job to verse 11 and he was broken in that day so the poor of the flock that worded upon remember in malachi 3 behold i will send you uh elijah for the people that were doing what wedding the lord will come suddenly in the temple where that upon me knew that he was the word of god so we found out here that when we approach grace grace was broken and we understand that grace was the man jesus christ because according to this prophecy when they evaluated him he was sold for 30 pieces of silver are you there and then he was sold by judah so when jesus christ came jesus was the first staff which was grace but by breaking christ they broke the covenant with the people that people was not the gentile the people was the jews of israel so judah went to the high priest took 30 pieces of caesar we saw it last week according to jeremiah and according to zechariah and then when they did that they crucified the messiah there is a key there where is the key take daniel chapter nine matter of fact before you go there are you still in zechariah jump to verse 14. so everybody get there verse 14 everybody there few people everybody there if you come to this church you always need to bring your bible then i'll cut asunder my other event so band also will be okay then we'll be broken that amount break the brotherhood between judah and so when the second staff is broken he broke the brotherhood between judah and i hope we will get there now we can go to daniel two stuff two staves actually first off broken second stuff will be also broken daniel chapter nine if you dare you can say amen okay brother john caught that verse 24 70 weeks are determined you familiar i will come to preach on those stuff we will get them over again 70 weeks are determined upon your people and upon your holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sin and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy six fold purpose verse 25 know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem zero babel to the messiah the prince shall be what we know that here the scripture is talking about 70 weeks but when god began to divide those weeks the first was seven weeks come up seven weeks and three score and two weeks which is 62 62 weeks three score means 60. are you there a score is 20 20 20. three score is 60. three score and two weeks 62 the street shall be built again and the wall even in troubles time so when you take 62 plus 7 it's gonna give you 60 now there is still one week that is left i'm not gonna if i dig here we're not even going to touch here what we are trying to talk are you there and after three score and two weeks shall the messiah be what everybody clear so the messiah will be cut off after the 62 in other words the messiah will be cut off in the one week that is left when they say this don't be quick you need a prophet the messiah will be cut off the staff will be okay but not for himself and the people of the priests that shall come tardis shall destroy the city and the sanctuary tardis and the end thereof shall be with a flood and to the end of war desolation and determine are determined verse 27 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for what now we found out there is one week there so one plus 62 63 63 plus seven gives you 70. so it's not a word it's telling you the messiah when he comes he's going to come here this is where the messiah comes are you there praise the lord he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the what you see now in there everybody clear and brother branham told us that one week in the bible means how many years seven years are you there and then if it's seven years we have three and a half years and three and a half years the total gives you seven years everybody there so in the midst of the week are you there the messiah i won't be everybody clear the messiah won't be cut off the messiah won't be broken and we know that jesus preached for how long three and a half years which is the ministry of jesus christ going clearly and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to what because the temple is gonna be destroyed they rejected the messiah they crucified jesus christ the temple is going to be destroyed the sacrifice will work so when we are talking right here when they say that the first stuff will be broken and the breaking of the stuff it is talking about the 70th week of daniel the last one it was locked right in the scripture are you there so by breaking the messiah israel rejected god and the gospel leave the jews and begin to go to there we okay brother branham at the end time when the tribulation period come now here is a little things we are going to reverse back a minute where the three and what half here oh daniel 70 last word of daniel 70 weeks which is three and a half years now how many remember that from the church ages there is 70 which determined did he give you a scripture you got to read your bible on your own look how perfect he was say messiah will come and he will be for the sacrifice for his sacrifice in the midst of the and the obligation well then there is still what waited don't drink to what so when we get to this right here from here all the way to here everybody following me god is dealing with israel right there when he come in the midst of the last week after three and a half year god cut off the jews everybody follow me everybody following me so the dealing with the jews sees right here but still the jews have three and a half years that are left which is half of a week everybody there but in between the first three and a half when the messiah is crucified on the cross and god returning back to the jews god opened another door where he's dealing right here in these two midst of the weak he is not dealing with jews anymore but god is dealing with a jerusalem that is born out of gentile are we okay brother branham now the 70 weeks was determined perfectly as daniel said that messiah will come and will be cut off in what the midst of the week and jesus prophesied for what two and a half years now in the middle of this three and a half years of daniel in the middle of feed he was cut off but now the last part of three and a half is the what so in right here god will be back to the jews but for the gentile it will be a tribulation period you don't want to be there are you there you don't want to be there where the gentile church is oh there this is great now don't miss this the bride goes in with them not with a baby not the baby goes with the groom are you there the bride goes with them if the blood is going with the groom what happened there marriage are you there so brother brother is telling us that before god goes back to the jewish right here there is the rapture of the church everybody following me because god is taking his bread that started in ephesus but in laodicea god take his bread home everybody following me praise the lord take luke chapter 21 when you look at the scripture superficially you're going to come up with a superficial understanding luke chapter 21 verse 20. if you dare you can say amen i still hear some pages turning and when you shall see who jerusalem compass with army that priests that come to destroy the city then know that the desolation thereof is near then let them which are in judea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it they poured out in other words jesus already fought foretold them when you see the army coming depart it's a destruction coming which are in the midst of it depart out and let none not them that are in the country enter the ring because they are destroying the city they have to destroy the temple to make the sacrifice cease verse 22 for this be the day of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled let me drop to verse 24 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword they're gonna kill the jews and shall be led the way captive unto all nations the jews will be taken out and jerusalem shall be what or trampled down chop them down of the agenda until the time of the gentile be what so when they break the first stuff the covenant between god and israel is broken are you there and jesus is saying that that covenant will be broken until the time of the gentiles in other words god is going to leave israel and go to the gentiles and jerusalem will be in trouble until god finished with the gentiles god from your bible everybody clear so far check roman chapter 11. hallelujah verse 11 verse 7. if you dare you can say amen everybody there if i pass the time you ship your hand we stop verse 11 uh verse chapter 11 verse 7 what then israel has not obtained that which he seeks for but the election has obtained it and the rest were what only a small group recognized jesus christ the remaining of the jews were blinded job to let's continue according as it is written god has given them the sleep the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see ears that they should not hear to this day and david said let their table be made this name and a trap and a stamping block and a word complains to them let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back always watch verse 11. i say then have this stumble that they should fall paul is saying that if israel stumbled is israel done completely he said no no god forbid because there is still what three and a half years everybody clear god forbid but rather through there through the fall by them rejecting the messiah breaking the first half are you there salvation has come to work by rejecting jesus christ salvation leaves the jews and goes by because jesus started the summer uh the the samaritan woman he said salvation is of the earth but the jews rejected salvation then salvation goes to there from your bible salvation is come to the gentile for to provoke them to to see if israel will get upset like they took my stuff are you there jump to verse 20 well because of what jesus said you would die in your because of ambulance they were what everybody clear and you stand by what they just live by by faith be not high-minded by what because god don't play let's go down to verse 25 i'm skipping this you can read it at home you'll be clear for this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceit that's what blindness in in part not totally in part in part is happened to until the fullness of the be what and brother branham said the fullness of the gentile is their seven church edges if you need a coat you see me i have probably three of them are you there we understand clear now right so by breaking the first staff which is grace he took the gospel and turned that gospel out from the jewish people and send it to the jerusalem jerusalem born of phenomena and of a high title it is jerusalem but jerusalem of the gentile toward the bride take second corinthians 11. i have two stops if i reach the first one and we good we stop there we good praise the lord second corinthians 11 verse two paul who start with the church are you there a messenger to the gentile we already seen that verse 2 for i am what paul is jealous i am jealous of you with godly for i have not marry you paul was not entirely the privilege of marriage the gospel of paul only is powers you to christ because power receives a dispersion of grace his dispensation is to bring life to the woman she's still a baby even though paul prophesied that jesus is coming jesus is coming but he was not to come in the time of power are you there paul work only with the first staff are you there that's why brother branham said the anointing of the lion of judah was the anointing that was job in ephesian churches so paul only could bring life inspire you claim you be jealous but paul cannot marry you everybody clear praise the lord not this jerusalem the word jerusalem the what time to finish okay let me run this and i'm going to hit my stop notice jerusalem there jerusalem is from above the bible say which is the mother of a soul and christ is our do you see your jerusalem are you there we realize that god is our for we are born of jerusalem of the gentile i'm gonna hit the first stop on the first step on the first step god called that stuff grace and grace was broken and because grace was broken the church started as an infant are you there to be a spouse but not to be married you following me are you there but on the second visit when the lord come back god sees a woman that have breastfed that is grown up and that woman is ready for you jonah are you there she's ready for the union of her with her brad let's take the union we see the nations uniting we see the world uniting we see the churches united we see the uniting uniting with them why the word is and as the black gum being there and the blood being the hero of girl they come together in hell they unite like uh they are getting ready for the wedding they become the world become you and you become dull what day are you there this day we find out the great hidden mysteries of god being right why are the mysteries revealed because it's the time of the second stuff hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah in genesis 18 when god went to abraham are you there the interest of god was not abraham god asked about sarah he was more interested about that woman he told sarah he said i will come and visit you in the time of water [Applause] are you there are you there now remember that man in genesis 18 just become i'm heading toward the airport okay i'm heading toward the airport just relax i got my stuff i know are you there now remember that was who that was not the man that was in genesis 18 was not the man jesus he was christ but not jesus demanded dark discern the thoughts of what not the thought of abraham but sarah must be connected with abraham abraham with seven letters and the last letter must be h.a.m [Music] the thought in service man behind him that was not jesus he had not yet been born he was born in the new testament but he was still crushed christ was in jesus are you there but it was uh in that abraham called the great almighty jesus said as he was in the days of sodom now watch close in the days of sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as hell see not no more there the woman is growing up is called in that day the son of man will be revealed what to what it takes the second step the second stuff are you there the second stuff is union it's a staff that join to what to join the church today do it there us though the bridegroom call will come right through this this what when the son of man will come down and come in human to unite that too the second staff brought life but the first staff brought life but the second staff brings the church has to be the world he is the that too you're not together and to do that it shall take the manifestation of the revealing of what you need a second staff to unite you with your bridegroom it's the son of man who will come down in among us and will make his word so real that he shall do what the church and him us dog and she shall go home to them so the marriage happened here but paul cannot marry you you need a ministry that will join you with the head esther purge your heart before god walk up with a meek and humble spirit the church that is going to be the bride of christ now remember esther refused the adornment she took the spirit in her heart to go before there you must be equipped remember the second time when he comes he comes with the equipment of the bread to dress the bride and the bride must be ready for herself [Music] i'm heading to the airport are you there the bible says that the bride have made her how can a woman make herself ready for the bed wedding right when a woman gets to get married she's sitting right and somebody's dressing her up turn around she turn they do this they do this they do this but the bible said the bride made herself in other words she it looks like she doesn't have anybody to dress her they serve an angel with the seventh vowel was a saint remember him he was part of the brother so that angel is a bride also [Music] are you following me are you are you following me are you following me are you following me the bride needs to make herself ready doesn't mean the blood is alone inside the blood there is one person of the blood that dresses the blood since the blood is dressed by the messenger who is the bride that's why the bride is making herself ready do you want me to repeat it again do you want me to repeat it again do you want me to repeat it again brother brother means a part of the blood but brother branham has the commission to trust the brother when brother branham is trusting the brother it is the bride making herself ready are you there so when god look he see brother branham dressing the blood god cannot say someone is dressing the bread because brother branham is part of the bread that's why god said the bread is making herself ready hallelujah the woman today the church that thinks she's going to get in because she got more members she's the best dress crowd she she got the biggest organization the biggest church in the city and things like that you shall miss it a million miles if you are depending on that it is a sweet kind reverent spiritual washed by the water of the world the word in you it is what the second visit are you there the second visit the church needs the earth the second visit are you there a full gospel the second visit that's right not just a part watching paul the second vision cleaning up made new creature in jesus blood is not hell he will not have his dirty bread that's why when he comes on a second time he takes the woman and begin to wash him are you there if a woman come up to get married and she looked like she come out of the pig pen out a man that's got any dignity about him would not marry her he make her clean up herself clean herself when the church of christ come up to get married think she's going to be in the blood with all the world tagging onto her christ brad won't be like that neither is the church of christ of the lord jesus christ that church is not a ragged church either we've worn out ragged of denomination she don't have to be a member of some great denomination she has to be uh second visit not saying we belong to the biggest church the biggest organization this or that she's got to be sanctified holy with that spot all by the blood of earth who the second staff have to be if the first stuff was broken and the breaking of the first staff was the crucifixion of jesus christ i'm heading to the airport i'm gonna stop here i'm not gonna touch the brotherhood between you then israel we're gonna see that later are you there if the breaking of the first staff means the crucifixion of who is union which is the ministry of christ in the end time are you there that unites the blood with the head is broken so there is a second crucifixion of jesus christ the first one we found in exodus 17 that moses struck the rock job moses only did it one time are you there but take a number i take it to the old testament bring it to the new testament and let you go we good okay thank you that was it she said man so don't bring me trouble it comes from the mouth of a babe so no trouble there if you ask me you took 15 minutes more let's go to number chapter 20 verse eight if you dare you can say amen this is the second time the first time moses struck one time water came israel drunk everything good is will continue a second time take the road verse 7 and the lord spoke to moses saying take the road and gather you the assembly together you and aaron your brother and do what did god say struck the rock the reason why god didn't say struck the wrong because the rock was already stricken remember that rock was who god already struck christ are you there and he gave a tap that jesus christ will be crucified that was good so when the problem comes again god moses come to god god said now since the rock is already stricken don't struck it again what you need to do is now what speak to the rock you see that speak to the rock before the eyes and it shall give forth each water and you shall bring forth them out of um them water out of the rock so you should give the congregation and their beast to drink everybody there so far and moses took the road from before the lord as he commanded him and moses remember the road was to gather the people only you see not to struck only gather the people because it's cheap you gather them with the road are you there gather them with the road but don't strike it you speak everybody there and he took the road from before the lord as he commanded that's good and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together that's good before the rock and he said to them here now you rebels angry must we bring you order out of this rock and moses lift up his and with his lord watch now he did what did god tell him to strike the rock smart the rock how many times crucify the world again and water came out abundantly and the congregation drunk and the beast also remember even though moses did something wrong follow me very carefully he never stop the blessing are you there when the rich young ruler rejected christ he went on and kept prospering are you there so don't think if you reject the message and you are prospering god is with you [Music] how many believe moses was a prophet he was god love him and when he went down there to the rock god said you go down there and speak to the rock and it shall bring you to order but moses in his anger he was a high temper he went down there instead of speaking to the rock he smote the rock and smoothie twice they broke the whole picture of god the rock was you believe that don't you minister he was only smitten and we speak to him is that right and moses spoke the right of spoke the christ the second time but that broke the whole picture of god's great program bastard into pieces right there christ brings meeting twice when he was only smitten what take your scripture and we finish hebrews 6 that was your old testament that was your old testament let's go to the new testament i'm going to stop at this hebrew chapter six if you dare you can be you can say a man everybody there verse 4 for it is what for those who are words have not feel nothing has been filled god branham said it was not filled not filled just taste you get to a buffet is that good let me test it you just tested it and have tested of the heavenly so they have a taste of the holy spirit but they were not filled with the holy spirit tested of the heavenly gift and were made protected after by testing the holy ghost are you there the spoken tongue the anointing came they did this this they did this this they tested it because once you seal it is to the day of redemption are you there you can't fall back but this is impossible if you have tested verse 5 and have tested the what they eat the message are you there and the power of the world to come which comes by the message if there shall if somebody like that come off to renew them to repentance seeing they did what to themself there in other words they crucified christ the second time this is in the new testament and put him to what in other words they are putting christ the message publicly in the shame you following me you're following me and this people keep the congregation away from god and if there is anything happen it spoke of it in the congregation they condemn it from there from there and say it is stay away from it in doing so moses did it paul warner's in doing so day [Music] jesus christ in why in 1963 because the opening of the seven the forward was born by telling the people get away from that they are doing what and are just as guilty as those guys upon this ground upon the ground of what so when you take the word away from the people you are crucifying what [Applause] you are breaking union is exactly what they were doing the very word that god was reflecting through his own son to prove he was and the one that they claimed that they loved the jehovah that had manifested himself by scripture done exactly what he said would do exactly what god said he would do and reflected before them because the love of their church group and the things like that they condemn the prince of life where is he crucified from you hypocrite you're not better than that i'm not angry but something inside of me is stirring god has been totally identified among you where did he get his pieces in his hand when did he get his pieces on why does he get today in there where did he come from among the brother where did that come from the one who claimed to love him that is who did it that's who does it he is second not the first one because union needs to be his second calvary where he receives his piece against the word that is what pierces him who is he he is the word where is he peace the hardest from just like he wants them are you there crucifying the world crucifying the message you say this was christ we are not to come together to talk about the message we have come together to get in the message and the message is are you there the message is right he is though that's right let me jump here how shall he appear in the last day is to bring the people back to the earth so that the bride the grown woman will know her no hell there so by crucifying the message it is the second crucifixion of cross your second road is union it takes the message to unite you with your groom are you there are you there that's why on this pulpit are you there are you there on this same time are you there they share chariot of the caribbean must come down to identify to us where is the correct place of worship are you there are you there are you there the throne the likeness of the appearance above it that was who who was there and the message is who the color of what around who have you seen amber before are you there are you there that you might know that the color of the light that is with the lord and the lord is light that follows the lord it is as the lord is amber yellow greenish that's what of light that is with as the scientists took its what yellow is green witches how many seen ember before have you seen ever before that's how the ember looks like are you there but now we have a creature right here are you there do you know his lunch do you know the launch of this creature right here you cannot see that are you there you need to go by the angel who hold the golden wheels because the measurement was the measurement of the engine so that creature comes closer to the earthly angel are you there and the earthly engine gives you the measurement of the loans are you there are you there let me give you differently are you there are you there are you there if he appear you don't know where his launch is but when he appears he must appear close to the seven engine so you take the measurement of the noise from the seven engine are you there from the seven engine up and from the seven engine down are you there then when you look at this creature right here it look exactly like amber are you there telling you that the caribbeans came down vindicating that this is the message this is the place of worship this is the stuff you need for your union are you there are you there you need the measurement of the angel to measure him he look like fire brother random help me god still exists in the same colors from the launch approach fire amber color shut with her oh with her and many colors like that ezekiel one in the sky after jesus christ the same [Applause] the holy spirit still in still in his church in the last not me i was just standing there but one came and stood beside him so you get the measurement right i want you to look at that just exactly what [Music] are you there and it happened when brother problem is doing what under what the bible and standing here with this bible on the sacred desk there the word [Music] it happened when brother branham is preaching the message he preaches the message and he was so inclined with god until god took the chariot took the thought caribbean and dropped down and shut the picture to show you that this is the place of worship are you there i am thankful to god to be living the invisible what the second stuff is called what the invisible what of what i'm thankful to god to be living in this time as the closing of the scene of the world history if i would have say he would have said so before the foundation of the world if he would have laid out the whole program to me and say i want you to preach it now what age do you desire to go to the earth to preach i would have chosen for i think it is though i certainly would have loved to be during the first time of his visit when he came as a man but still i think this right now is what greater than what than the first coming because it is the time that he is coming to take them that he is nearing the resurrection when all the redeemer will come what a glorious opportunity we have to speak to her great what first part two steve that's your stop the first was crushed this second part we found that it's crust now are you there the alpha and the omega is there the first ministry and the last ministry is there the first message and the last message is there i am alpha i am union and grace are you there the same holy ghost spirit is the same move in the same move that he moved in there in the first visit when you were a baby under eastern people with paul has come header under western you adult now bringing the same that is to say though and the fullness of the power of the resurrection of jesus christ we are living at the setting of the sun and the gospel light as he was criticized and made fun as the broke broke broke broke grace they wanna make fun of the message beginning of his first shining forth under his people he will receive the same type of work as he was under but at the same jesus god blesses the people in there by his that's why he have to come down personally he's blessing them in the form of the holy ghost under other sheep that i have not on this fold the gentile are you there your second step is the message lion virgo lion the two pyramid of david we will go but when he broke down here when this stave is broken he divided israel what does it mean we get on the next time next time [Applause] church there is nothing new there is nothing new whatever is happening let it never shake you because it's prophecy being so fair instead of being shaken let it be a stabilizing forces for you that i am following something that is right remember if somebody worshiped brother branham a word to him but to me it's a confirmation if somebody crucified the message want to him to me it is uh because the message in the old testament was crucified in the new testament paul spoke about the crucifixion it must happen are you there but thank god among the gentiles in this last day god came to clean us up because the ministry of zoroba there brings both stone he brings the cornerstone restore back what paul head and bring us up the union of revelation 10. so in this end time by the message of malachi 4 we are cleansed from our tradition we are cleansed from our country we are claimed for our life we are clean for our former life but not only are we clean we are also judged for the marriage we are also united with the brethren because the place of god worship where the caribbeans took a picture to tell you i am here i vindicate this message that it is true [Applause] let's pray heavenly father lord once again we thank you for your grace for your love and your mercy father it took grace for you to pass by pull us out from all kind of life further from prostitution from
