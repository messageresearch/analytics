about probably about four and it was just my head so i thought let's sing this y'all i'm sure i'm sure some of you know it we'll just pick it up we're not going to sing the whole song and i don't even know which voice or which maybe a couple verses i know the first one go sing so let's [Music] in jesus he speaks the drooping heart to cheer o hear the voice of jesus [Music] sweet is noted in sarah song sweet name on mortal tom the sweetest carol ever song oh jesus blessed jesus listen to this verse now his name dispels my guilt and fear no other name but jesus oh how my soul delights to hear the charming name of g i'm gonna sing one more verse and when to that bright world above we rise to see our jesus we'll sing around the throne of love his name the name of jesus sweet and snowed in sereps [Music] oh jesus blessed jesus let's give him a clap offering this morning hallelujah i think that song was written it's probably close to 200 years old and i think isn't that the one that the piano kept playing during one of his meetings somebody fell out or something on the piano and it kept playing the great physician so that's a that's a pretty anointed song actually isn't it amen um so i don't have any praise reports i've got a testimony from brother charles is yours a is it a praise report or a prayer request or just a testimony what you got all of the above okay well come on up we'll start with you my brother god bless you i love you good morning everyone god bless you um on friday i had to go get my oil changed and i'm in the process let me get my oil changed i was already tired because i worked crazy hours so i was exhausted apart falling asleep driving and um got my oil changed on my way home i stopped to get some gas when i stopped and get some gas i checked my account on my mobile app and it said 1210 for the uh oil change so i said well that ain't right you know that oil change costs 120 dollars in 10 cents that's i'm not right so i said well i take it as a blessing and i just kept driving and i said nah i can't do that one that's how people steal you know that's how people steal you know if you ever worked in um like handling money that's a form of how people steal they throw things off and you know and then another thing he said well what if he made a mistake you know his supervisor they gonna get on that man you know he didn't mean no harm he had a good spirit on him so i said lord you know i need that money i said lord but uh i said lord i can't do that so i called him back and i said uh i looked at my uh ticket i said well what's the individual's name it was justin i said um i speak to justin please and now he said uh well give me a second give me a second he picked up the phone and i said um yeah i just left at the maximum i said it just changed my oil said it came up to 120 dollars i said um but did you make a mistake and uh at first you know i can tell in his spirit he thought that you know he charged me too much but i said uh he said well it could happen you know we make mistakes i said oh okay i said because it came up 12 10. he said huh i said um it came up 12 10. you know he said well give me a second came back he said um do you have any receipt verifying you know like it was your card the payment came off of your card and i said yes sir i said it says 12 cents 12 10 in the top left corner said it has my uh credit card number and everything on there he said well give me a second came back to the phone it's funny how when you're waiting for a blessing or something to happen god be making you wait like that but uh but um he turned around and uh got back on the phone and he said um he said well i said well if i got to come back and pay it he said i won't be able to make it today i'll just come back tomorrow you know and pay the balance he said well i guess she just got a cheap oil change so i said so i said well thank the lord i said thank the lord for it you know and i went home and told my family but you know it just taught me how when you do things right and be honest you know god is just trying you to see where you stand you know those tests and trials they turn out to be blessings so i just had to tell you all that god amen [Applause] where's this place at [Laughter] we'll just line up the children of god outside right amen does anybody else have a praise report they want to bring up amen praise the lord or a prayer request this morning anybody with a prayer request yes ma'am what's her last name paula watts paula watts they're pentecostal right they've been very good to my daughter they you know when she was taking the piano lessons and all and she she uh went through the whole hair loss thing with the cancer and you know lily stuck by her side and would go visit her and and everything and um so she tested positive if anybody couldn't hear and her immune system you know because the cancer is still out of whack she's in i guess total remission as far as that goes but you know she's just wanting us to remember her so the cova doesn't affect her adversely you know um it's kind of a it's kind of an odd thing that's covered in you can get your vaccine and still still get it and die so i don't know so um amen brother enoch will you come up and pray over these prayer requests please hallelujah anybody else yes sir okay yes sir okay okay you can get a second opinion back there in the back to you know if you [Laughter] if you go see him he may he may have something else to say yeah yes ma'am okay amen all right so the young hamilton not the youngest where

balloon we want to see hands for anybody that may have already possessed the cod books the two cod books okay all right are you counting are you just interested okay so i guess everybody else doesn't can we see the hands that do not have okay we're just wanting to try to figure out um okay if you're in need of them there is a list back here by the purple box it's labeled you know cod books and i think they're just wanting you to put one check mark for your family just put a check mark and they'll count the check marks and then they'll buy that many books yes sir brother robert okay okay all right so there are when i came up there were about four check marks already so we need the names who've already put the check marks and then we need the names of those who who will be needing the books they're very good we've we've had them for you know a little time and um so um especially with our purple box it goes hand in hand with that you know it'll give you the idea an idea that things that were already asked the prophet and his answer on them amen i mean you might have a question because he covered you know some of the um like the dying of the hair yesterday and it's in there it's

always has a song doesn't he amen god bless you amen praise the lord everybody in the meeting yesterday there's many questions that we have that means there's many struggles in the mind that we are not sure of so i thank god for the opportunity for those struggle to be washed away with the answers that we've given so this song's been on my heart a lot of songs been on my heart for this one just suits for yesterday i got a little something on my chest so i won't sing loud i don't normally sing i don't have much lungs but um this is just how it goes may your struggles keep you near the cross

wonderful thing it would be for you just to fill this room today with your glory where we couldn't speak all we could do is just try to absorb it amen and it's not so much on our flesh as it is in our

amen do you believe he's here this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] amen we thank god for what happened yesterday everybody ready everybody remember that picture blessed be the name of the lord how many enjoy it let me hear you thank you very much i i didn't even know when they took the picture but brother abel got it amen do you have anything else or beside that one that was our fellowship yesterday for those who miss it that was it that was the setting probably it's not showing everybody but we were quite a bit of people over there amen blessed be the name of the lord we can switch and go back to what we need to say this morning amen we apologize for those online we had some technical difficulties and the password was locked for two hours so those that are in church are gonna see it straight right here and those online we gotta go with the old fashioned way where we use the camera amen okay so you hear this morning you got a little privilege so you're gonna see it straight to the camera but when you go home just make sure you can the one on the camera you make sure you really get it because i really want it when you go home you can study go over the sermon and make sure if you need the code it's there the reference is there so you can take it and use it and be prepared and build up for that amen don't forget the meeting for brother sean martin if you want to go there see brother abel amen as far as the cod book those who need it you make sure you write your name back there yesterday we ran out of time and there were a lot of people that raised their hand they had additional questions but tom was our enemies so the box is back there again and if you have questions go ahead and write them down put them there with your name and then from there on we can schedule the second one i believe it's going to be a brother kelly's house amen then you're going to know where your deacon live you already know where your song leader is amen now you're going to know where one of your deacon is living amen blessed be the name of the lord you might be seated i'm going to go through two things yesterday we touch on the hair amen we touch on hair here on wednesday and i'm sorry i was a little lengthy on wednesday but the anointing really hit toward the end and i didn't have a choice you just bear with me the time is bad and we're trying the best that we can to deliver as much word and scripture to make sure you have what is necessary for you to fight the battle amen so sometime just remember we will still be mindful but just remember we're doing this for the name of the lord we only have two servants a week on wednesday and on sunday i know the kids have to go to school but with everything that is going on in the world in the message what we came out of it you need a strong solid foundation amen sometimes we cannot go rush through it i have to take my time slowly to make sure it's received properly because when it's clearly received by revelation then it's anchor and you can fight on your own i'm not going to be with you when you're looking at the internet when you are in school when you're at your work but you must be uh build up enough to defend what you believe and we want to have a strong foundation that's why i go through scripture through the code to make sure you are built upon a strong foundation which is the word of god so when somebody asks you a question you're now looking for brother stephen you dare you can take the bible and then defend yourself amen so yesterday we went through a question on the hair we talked about the coloring in the air uh in the hair so those that were there already caught it i'm not gonna go over it again because the question was already handled on wednesday we handled one of them and i spoke about the week of the sisters that whenever you have a wig just make sure your wig look natural not a wig that have the hair that have been trimmed which give the wrong appearance so i felt like i need to give you the quote where brother branham say so you don't say my pastor is saying i don't want that even though i'm your pastor i want you to say the bible says and brother branham says because brother branham is perfectly in line with the scripture amen brother branham say if you got a hairpiece but are wearing one of these buildings how many know the beatles you know them are they good or bad people very very bad amen evil we don't have the beetle today but their spirit is still here using other worldly musicians amen and brother branham say if i could look right in one i'll probably wear one myself not a bitter wig in other words the revelation or the remain the same if you want to wear a wig make sure you don't copy the wig of the worldly musician make sure you don't go after the fashion of the world we don't want that because that's where you get a wrong spirit or a wrong anointing brother caleb just a little biafra but a hairpiece brother brother i'm saying but that's all right if you ain't got no hair and you want one if you can do it that is perfectly all right yes sir if a woman her hair is not long enough and she wants a switch of hair in it put it on sister the only thing we don't want you to look like the world amen make sure it's respectable it is decent and it's not giving a wrong impression and it doesn't look like the hair of beyonce or whoever is up there amen if a man takes a bad call than things and want even to his appearance to his wife if he wanted to wear a hair piece do it yes indeed nothing wrong with that no sir no more than you would be your teeth or artificial arm or anything else so if nature has taken something from you and it's so handy you go ahead that is perfectly all right if you don't have teeth it's okay to have false teeth if you don't have now it's okay to have faults now but not you already have now and they look good and now you want to add something to your now that's a different story amen if nature taking something off of you or your hair is uh shedding in a certain way that is not correct which i would first go by prayer and make sure we cast that demon because the bible says that hair was given to a woman for her covering so you don't want the devil to attack your hair amen it happened here in this church we pray for her sister and her hair begin to grow amen i'm not going to call her name to embarrass her amen the second one there was a question about the serpent seed whether he was natural or spiritual we answered that and brother robert mentioned something and when i was going home he kept coming back to my mind to my mind to my mind i went to sleep wake up he kept coming back so i felt like i don't want to miss what the holy spirit was trying to share through brother robert amen the question was the seed of the serpent is his spiritual seed or natural we answered yesterday that it's both and the other question was if nacho how does he come over from the flood when noah and his sons were the sons of god how did he come over through noah's son's wife so we already explained it yesterday but i just want to punch something right there in genesis chapter 7 verse 13 the bible says that in the cell in the self same day enter who one you count with me and who two and him three and four the sons of who so we already have four there everybody clear and noah's wife how many five and three wife of his son with them how many five plus three equal eight into the water first peter chapter three verse 20 which sometime were disobedient when once the long suffering of god waited in the days of who noah while the ark was a preparing wearing few that is how many so peter was perfectly in line with the old testament everybody clear there was eight people here ate there amen now the problem is eight people entered there and all of these eight right here we found that noah and all his children were the children of god so how did the serpent seed enter remember the question is is the serpent seed natural or is it spiritual when it comes to natural i will prove to you yesterday that it came through the line of canaan everybody clear the bible says thou these are the generation of the sons of who shem ham and japheth and unto them were sons born when not before the flood ever clear they were born after the flood in other words everybody except eight people were completely eradicated or dead so those were those that were born after the flood but we found out that one by the name of canaan amen was cursed and canaan was not even the son of noah he was a grandson to noah so whoever told you that black people were cursed that's wrong get that out of your mind amen the son of who now these are the grandsons of noah the first one is kosh and mizraim and fat and cannon now we are trying to explain the natural seed through canaan which we did it yesterday and we proved to you that the canaanites were from the lineage of cain everybody clear now brother branham says that i want to give you coats now so the giant never come from pressing themself in these giant were the sons of who remember in genesis 6 yesterday whose father was the the serpent who looked in every respect exactly like a man but was a great and huge fellow bigger than l that is where your giant started everybody clear and that is where those sons came from because they were the sons of who because they were there now it's canaanite it's the grandson of noah everybody clear in the land of water where they come from and that is where cain went to you understand now so the land of noah that cane went was actually the promised land that's why when god was bringing israel back god told israel when you go to the promised land make sure you wipe everybody because the serpent seed naturally was there remember the spies when they went there they saw giant the sons of anak which were the anakims they were giant it was that serpent seed that have escaped that was right there in the promised land anybody clear now blessed be the name of the lord he said that also proved the serpentine it was a different race of people all together that was the serpent seed in paragraph 108. brother branham said that they were canaanite these water giant and they were the sons of who they just went through adultery of the wife of him committed adultery just like eve because brother branham said the seed went over the ark just like he did by eve which was an adultery we explained that yesterday amen and they were the sons of cain which were the son which was the son of who the serpent and the serpent was a giant man great monstrous sort of her fellow so you understand how the natural seed went by there everybody cleared so far in the message the ark and when we come over through the lineage of ken and he did the same thing they went off in the land of nod candid and they're married took his wife and went in there and leatherman and later man has become water it's coming from that lineage when the children of israel come up through there they found men even some of them had fingers of 14 inches long and i think of that great who david slohu in other words your prophet is telling you that the giant in the promised land were the natural seed of the serpent that escaped and were carrying over the ark by the wife of him who was pregnanted by a k knight by a descendant of kena she entered the ark with her pregnancy and that pregnancy was opened up after the flood because those suns were born after the water everybody cleared so far now when it comes to the spiritual side the spiritual side work with nimrod anybody clear the bible says and the sons of cush we right here siva and havela and sapta and rhema and saptica and the sons of rhema sheba and didon and the bible goes back again to cush and kush begat who nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord and the beginning of his kingdom was water what i want you to understand here is noah had three sons noah was the correct lineage that came from god ever clear so noah had three sons the first one was uh shem and then we got ham and the third one was who japheth everybody cleared so far so from here him the scripture jumped down and the ham had cush anybody clear so far so the problem is this is still a pure line makes sense a pure line brought him and that pure blood brought kush and kush brought who nimrod anybody clear now brother stephen we understand that canaan was not the pure seed because kenan was a wrong child that's the reason why when ham committed sin noah did not curse him he cursed cayman which was a grandson ever clear and brother branham explained to us that that's where came the canaanite which were there giant that is the natural seed everybody clear so now if you are talking about the spiritual seed how can a spiritual seed of the serpent seed come through a pure line because noah was pure he brought him ham brought kush kush brought nimrod kenan came from the wrong seed line but how can the spiritual side come through a pure line anybody clear so far because when we look at the songs of know of him the other one we're still from the pure line how come that's why you need our blessed be the name of the lord genesis chapter 9 verse 1 and god bless noah and his water so god did not only bless noah he blessed shem he blessed him and he also blessed who jeffered he was blessing the pure line yet the pure line brought a wrong child how can a pure line bring a wrong child cannon came from the wrong seat we all understand it's gonna be wrong what about the pure line the mystery of that is hidden in roman chapter nine romans chapter 9 verse 10 and 13. and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by how many husband everybody cleared so far brother robert calls all of this amen rebecca conceived by how many men why does the bible have to clarify one why why we already know the husband of rebecca is isaac why does the scripture have to qualify one because of the serpent seed amen so he said rebecca conceived by one by isaac amen but when the children came one of them is jacob and one is iso how can a pure land produce a bad child everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father who isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that's the purpose of god according to water when you are dealing with a spiritual aspect of the serpent seed do you need a key of the election of god it is no more the body it is no more the physical it is no more the natural the natural seed that goes through the sperm but now it's a spiritual seed amen blessed be the name of the lord through according to election must stand not of works but of him that calleth he was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written jacob had a love but he saw his water the child was not born yet why do you hate that child amen yet he's coming from the good parent the key is the spiritual gene the spiritual a seed of esau was wrong so there is a natural seed and a spiritual seed the natural came through canaan but the spiritual came through nimrod even nebraska came from noah but his seed spiritually was wrong just like esau makes sense now make sense hearing recognizing acting on the word of god when i say make sense i'm not talking about your brain i'm talking about your heart we see in these two songs that one day before they were even born they were at war with one another even though the virgin mother she was virgin she was a virgin the beautiful rebecca that married the righteous seeds of god's promise isaac that they were too consecrated spirit-filled believer on god foreign to the very marriage that they united together by because it took eliezer the angel of the lord working back and forth god foreknew it and how could such a thing come true that one mother by one father how everything is pure that's the spiritual aspect one a very evil person and another a very good person and how that the good person looked to be evil and the evil look to be good when you go down brother branham continuing paragraph 13 he said we would know it today as the law of water it is not only election but the second key is called the law of contrast in other words when you have white you have black when you have dark you have light amen we will know it today as the law of contrast that where there is good there is water where there is right there is water and we will never no matter what our environment may be ever be able to shake ourselves from the presence of either one because it's the law of contrast so by natural canaan by spiritual it's nemirod it came through the pure line but this is no more natural it's a spiritual seed everybody clears so far brother branham in israel and the church part four for instance many of them like how that former religion began in what in kane how he come on out and come on down the sons of who and who now brother branham is not chasing the natural seed because cain was of the serpent now brother branham is saying that the spirit the religion of cain amen that spirit came through him not naturally but spiritually and from him he went through cush and from kush it went through nimrod because their spiritual gene is wrong even though naturally they are born differently that's why when jesus looked at the jew the pharisee he said you are of your father the who they say their father was abraham amen but jesus said your true father is the devil so naturally they came from abraham but spiritually they were the seed of the devil that's why brother branham said caiaphas was of the devil anybody clear how we come on down out and come down through the sons of noah who him out of him he had nimrod nimrod built the tower of water which is babylon babel comes on down through the king nebuchadnezzar time and now and on out into revelation who else babylon how that little seed started way back there at the east side of the gates of eden with kane come on down winding out all kind of coats and everything started back there winding themselves out to the end this natural side started through ken that's where the giant came in the land of canaan and then the spiritual side started through nimrod that was the answer we want to clarify everybody clear so far praise the name of the lord let's go to our scripture a message

way and entering into the website of the prostitute she didn't call you you the one that used your phone and your computer going after her amen and it's done usually at night why a night passing through the street near her corner and he went away to her house in the water only at night a twilight in the evening in the black and dark night when you turn your light off you think mama doesn't know and you are there with your cell phone and behold there made him a woman with the attire of a water the outside appearance of that woman is prostituted harlowed prostituted that's her outer appearance that's why the scriptures say flee the very appearance of what and the second thing she was a harlot in water a saddle heart we already explained the word saddle right the first time it was placed in the scripture it was by the serpent so you see who that woman is now a serpent seed in a female version let's go to proverbs chapter 9. amen you want to get to a serpent seed in a female version they have phd in sexual stuff that's what brother branham say a sex queen proverb 9 verse 1 if you dare you can say amen wisdom whose wisdom again christ has built her house how can christ be a woman building a house this woman built a house oh my god amen has she has eun out her water the house of this woman have seven pillars what is a pillar what is a pillar a woman with a house seven pillars amen she has killed her beast i have to go slowly this way i'm gonna stop where i'm gonna stop and don't go over if that's okay amen but i won't rush she has killed her beast the food or the meat of this woman is a fresh meat fresh meat it is not a meat that was killed before he gathered and a carry-on meat but the house of this woman when you get in her house her food is fresh it is a food that have been killed on the same day it is the food of the day she doesn't give you yesterday food she give you to dance food that has been freshly killed if you're sleeping you really you sit up there amen you can't be sleeping i don't know what you're doing at night amen she has killed her beast she has mingled her water not only does she have a fresh meat that meat is accompanied by one which is the stimulation of water it's a fresh meat fresh food that the woman killed with wine they both combined is it clear now the bible becoming you everybody clear she has also furnished her water she has a course meal on her table course meal on her table how many meals does she have if she has seven pills verse three she has sent forth her water so the woman has a house but she also has maiden you follow me so the food comes first through that woman and out of the woman he goes through other women that has been faithfully taught i hope you get it i help you in it the original kill it comes from that woman amen if you want an original kill you gotta be identified with that woman you must be in that woman you must be in that crust in the female version you must be part of christ in the female version then from there you pick up the food and he goes to other sisters which are faithfully taught she has sent forth her maiden she cried upon the highest place of the city who saw his who naive simple let him turn in here as for him that wants understanding she says to him in other words you are naive you don't know how to protect yourself from the prostitute come into this house where is the house let's go to revelation chapter 3. amen oh god help me just reading the scripture revelation 3 verse 12. how many pillars that she has stay awake amen by the robert already screaming you know what it means revelation 3 12. everybody there him that overcomes will i make a water so a pillar is a person make sense a pillar is a person he's a human being now these are this woman this woman has a house and in her house there are seven persons that are the foundation of a house so when you get in that woman you're gonna pass seven people number one number two number three number four up to the seventh one they are human beings how many angels came on sunset mountain is the cloud a mystic is it a lie and when they took the seven engine they turned the picture who came out there [Music] who came out there the wisdom and brother branham said da seven seven seven seven ninja form the wig that is on the charge showing that the supreme authority the supreme wisdom has come and it takes seven pillars it brings the fresh manner with the stimulation of the revelation which is the opening of the seventh hill and he gives you a devil of seven course meal in the book of proverbs in the book of prayer without even a quote hallelujah him that overcome will not make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him my water so those pillars have the name of god the angel that carry my name don't play with him he won't forgive your sin amen i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is the new world and the new jerusalem we saw it is the bride and the bride is a woman and the bride start from ephesus to laodicea and she have seven messengers which are the seven pillars and if you need fresh kill you got to go in the messenger of your day because there they killed the freshmen carcass they just kill it hallelujah which is the new jerusalem which come down out of heaven from our god and i will write upon him my water not only do they have the name of god but they also have the new name of god what is the new name of god let me pull that back let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you're doing for us father we thank you for your presence being this morning and we are committing this service unto the hand may you be the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end may everything that is contrary to your word be completely sealed out of this place may nothing but the holy spirit be sealed in may you come down and speak and bless your children deliver those that are afflicted in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you anybody ready blessed be the name of the lord part 29 still dealing with the black dog on wednesday we saw that paul and peter described two women describe a normal woman which is a christian and they also describe a prostitute everybody clear then we went in the book of john in the book of revelation and in the book of revelation john also described another prostitute amen and she was called jezebel ever clear which is talking about the makeup right there everybody clear because she was the one that was doing that in the old testament jezebel she was also called babylon and she was a and a mother of what a mother of her lord meaning that her prostitution doesn't stop there just like wisdom have a house and have maidens amen that received the anointing from the manhouses the prostitute of revelation 17 also have made themselves but all those maidens are also hollowed and the prostitution here it is not only spiritual it is both spiritual and natural because the state of the church is known by the condition of the natural woman brother branham in a message proving his word if you want to know what condition the church is watch the way women act she is the word so if there is a natural prostitution here there must be a spiritual prostitution if there is a spiritual prostitution there must be a natural prostitution everybody clear amen she is the church see her immoral indecent watch look what the church is in just watch it see just watch women you see where how your women degrade and become so polluted that is the way your church is the tap if you go outside in this summer you're going to see almost naked women everywhere that son is the son of the churches as well in other words the women naturally are telling you that spiritually the church become a bunch of our lords everybody clear so far and in this whole lot of revelation 17 when we pulled the harlot everybody cleared so far the bible says that she was set upon a beast let's bring it up in revelation 17 verse 3. the bible said that so he carried me away in the water we showed you on wednesday that that was a spiritual side into the wilderness and i saw a water a woman which is a church sit upon a scalloped colored beast a beast means a power in the scripture full of name of water she's an evil woman remember in the book of proverbs 7 chapter verse 9 the woman have the attire of what and her lord she was also and she had what a sudden heart which was the heart of the beast in the garden of eden anybody clear and we found out that there is another woman here that have an anointing or a power and the power that she get is the power of satan everybody clear full of name of blasphemy having what seven heads and water she also have seven heads just like the wisdom also have seven people everybody clear she also have 7 and 10. just like revelation 10 7 but she flip it around ever here those are the mathematics of god revelation 13 verse 1 and i stood upon the sand of the sea and i saw a water a beast rise out of the sea having water seven heads and what so the beast that the woman in revelation 17 was seated is exactly the beast that came out of the sea in revelation 13. everybody clear because the beasts of revelation 17 have seven heads and ten horns and the beast of revelation 13 has also seven heads and what ten horns and upon his horns were ten crowns and upon his heads the name of water the same thing that was over there verse two and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were unto the bear and his mouth was unto a lion like the mouth of a lion and the dragon who is the dragon satan gave him his water and his water and water so the authority of this beast the power of this beast and the seat of this beast is completely saturday amen if you go in the book of daniel you will see that daniel saw three beasts he saw the lion then he saw the bear then he saw the leper the fourth one daniel was not able to identify him but when you go to the book of revelation john is giving you the leopard the bear and the lion all of them mixed together into one beast just like the white horse rather the red horse rather and then the black horse rather when you take the three you mix it together you get the fourth one which is the pale color ever clear which is the work of satan now here is the water why do you need wisdom because you are dealing with another prostitute solomon say my son to protect you from a prostitute you need to have water and that wisdom must be a woman it must be in a church because in the end time there is an anointing of prostitution again upon the churches and upon the people and if you want to be protected from the end time prostitution you need to find the church that has wisdom everybody clear everybody clear so far to whom they have wisdom and water both of them together count the number of water which is 666 everybody clear so you need a church that has wisdom that's why christ came in the head of the prophet as the wisdom of god i am the wisdom of god this is not william marion branham this is your lord this is the supreme wisdom you need a church that has wisdom to protect you from the prostitute of babylon and that church is the end time message church by william marion branham [Applause] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord the bible says in proverbs 7 that thou that wisdom which is christ is a woman we know christ is the wisdom of god the bible says in first corinthians 1 24 christ the power of god and the word which is a man now watch first corinthians 1 30 but of him ye of him are ye in water now we are in christ jesus come on who of god is made unto us what not only is christ the wisdom but christ also immorphy or condescend himself to us and become wisdom to us in other words just like wisdom was made flesh in christ it is gonna be also made flesh in the blood everybody clear so far not only wisdom but water and sanctification and water you are the redemption of god that's why you can preach somebody and bring them redemption because you become redemption yourself hallelujah what do you get in the place when you get to a place and people were cussing and when they see you everybody stop casting because you are the sanctification when you get in the room if people were cussing they stop casting because sanctification came you become sanctification by jesus christ [Applause] hallelujah first corinthians chapter 4 verse 10 we are fools for christ's sake but year was in what so to have that wisdom you must be in water hallelujah that's why solomon when god came to him he said ask anything you wanted solomon checked god he entered here he checked wealth no that's right a new navigator no this no and you just know and you have to know a big investment no and then he look he said oh i see something there all i need is what wisdom everybody clear as long as solomon cherished and was connected to that wisdom everything went fine when solomon begin to forsake wisdom then he begin to fail by strange water because it's wisdom that protects you from the strange woman anybody clear so far everybody cares so far when brother branham spoke to a hearty right righty hearty right didn't have daughters you got it hearty right has sons not daughter and according to prophet a son to be protected from women he must be connected to who christ they say happy right ask everything that you want you want a healing i'm going to give it to you you want a million dollars i'm going to give it to you say what you want hearty right turned around and saw two boys amen and the spirit quickened that in the book of real of proverbs chapter 7 a boy needs christ he said allah masking is the salvation of my two boys because if my two boys get christ then they're gonna be immune or protected against any women everybody clear so far she asked for the wisdom for her sons everybody clear first corinthians chapter 11 how can thou wisdom become a woman you there okay be followers of who who's talking there paul had the right to tell people to follow him be ye followers of me even as i also am of who paul was the messenger of the first church paul was the first pillar of the house and paul said

indeed ought not to cover his head why for as much as he is the word and the glory of what remember paul god told us that we were created wonderfully masterfully made and we were created for his glory ever here now the man is the image and the glory of who but the woman is the glory of what so the glory of this christ here ever clear the glory of this christ here is a woman everybody here adam and eve were one when god created he created only the man but never the woman amen the woman was pulled from the men she was the reflection of adam that's why jesus was the second adam he have to be

chapter 1 verse 14. and the word was made what and dwelt among us and we behead his water so christ when he was mad flesh he had the glory but the glory of a man is who a woman hallelujah we behead his glory their glory as of the only begotten of what so christ had the glory of the father of the glory of god the glory of the father or the glory of who god in other words he was the visible image

with his own blood god by the water perhaps not a man a water with a golden girdle the gospel that had the power and the glory of god over the body of what in the same sermon in 229 brother branham comes again he said when jesus was standing with his hand out this brother branham says he's a woman then brother brother turn again he say it's a man here is a little thing i don't want to leave out to you here watch it he's standing in the midst that is the middle of the seven golden candle stick so that person is crushed that person is the bride brother branham help me he went there with you in him god had never separated the blood from the word groom yet when adam was walking it was there are you there that's why eve and adam was both called adam eve got the name eve after she sinned at the beginning if you look at eve you're going to call her adam you look at adam you say adam you look at eve you say adam because both of them god called them adam so when god looked down upon the body of who he saw what and what he was all redeeming what they are same same word the same word that spoke of the groom speaks of what clear everybody here there is many fine women in this building tonight fine loyal women but there is only mrs william branham she is the one that goes home with me she is the one that is my wife there is fine people in the world found water but there is only one there is
