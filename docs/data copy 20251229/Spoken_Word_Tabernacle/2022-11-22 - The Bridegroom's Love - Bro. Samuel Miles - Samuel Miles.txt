anybody had a praise report this week amen good brother what you got um here okay and um before I gave it to him um uh the Amazon told me to um pick up a trail like spot number so and so I did but it wasn't the usual trailer but I didn't think nothing of it that's what they told me that's what I took right it turned out that trailer tore up my um my lines and my electrical lines and it had done something to the truck I couldn't find out what it was no fuse and fix the wire and still wouldn't give me no lights and everything so I had to put him because I can't turn down the load so I put the drive in the truck and he took off doing his thing without no lights in the trailer naughty naughty but you know well anyways he got pulled over by the state trooper and it turns out the state trooper was his cousin first cousin so I just want to give praise for them because that was definitely a protection [Applause] I've had a CDL and I know about that great amen we'll praise the Lord I just want

hands and our feet and our mouth and praise the Lord okay ain't no bird step in my place [Music] [Applause] [Music] ignore [Music] [Applause] [Music] free [Music] free [Music] [Applause] [Music] I know [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm alive [Music] [Applause] I'm gonna tell you something I'm gonna take there's something about a Wednesday night or Tuesday Tuesday this week it brings out the best songs I mean you have to repeat them on Sunday because ain't everybody here you know keep that in mind come on up brother Stephen man that was wonderful right there wasn't it amen amen off the old Pentecostal sky blue skin killing all folks when they were praying praying praying until the Holy Ghost come down that's what he reminded me praise the Lord amen keep up the good work glory to God no matter what's going on we will praise the Lord where the traffic on 85 77 on 485 no matter what it is we're going to praise the Lord nobody will take my place so I'm here tonight no one will take my place amen glory to God everybody on board with the male and female on deity everybody on board everybody clear glory to God nobody lost nobody lost a wing somewhere praise God he had did great oh my it took a lot to build to build to build to that point but praise be to the name of the Lord he keeps unfolding and unfolding and unfolding and now you will see the whole bubble wrapped up in one story that's why I gave you the the the terminology the Brethren the Bride of Jesus Christ the Church of God the saints of God they call that I even seen some of them that we are called The Beloved and Jesus Christ himself is their beloved and in another place we are called The Cult so all of that we're talking about one thing so once you recognize that all those terminologies speaking about you then before you know it you can feel you you can navigate the scripture all around it's one beautiful story of redemption from the beginning all the way to the end he started with a marriage he end up with a marriage over there amen so Eve is nobody else but Adam in a female version Eve is Adam in a female version that's all now you need to see yourself as the second Adam that's what the devil doesn't want you to see amen but Lord's willing we would dig more more until you look you say I cannot leave this world without having the Holy Ghost it belongs to you amen oh my God I was talking to my wife I believe last night I told her I say you know Elijah went through three stages and then the last one there was 50 people that followed him which 50 means Pentecost which means the Pentecostal move will try to follow Elijah and Elijah up to a certain point that would stop and when they stop they cannot go further because this the the further you go you need the second oil to open the Jordan yes and to unveil the evidence that was sealed a long time ago and after they found the stone that were hidden then across Jordan the Rapture open up did you get it if I lost you raise your hand I lost somebody okay so what I'm trying to say is there were steps there were three steps that Elijah and Elisha went brother Branham who are tapped them as Luther Wesley and Pentecost and the last one if you look at the scripture the Bible says there were 50 men that left I believe it should be Jericho and to follow them and 50 means Pentecost showing that the last move that will follow the bride is Pentecost amen amen so somebody will get that first oil okay and move on straight a little bit but they won't reach where Jordan is right they will stay afile the bible say that they stood afar off to watch they have the first sword they can go all the way there but they would not temper with that second home and those that got the second all will advance and get to Jordan when they hit Jordan were open was the seal evidence of the 12th Stone now are open when they open you see them once you see the two of sun and you come up from the the revelation of the Rapture open up Man Three three again the Matthew 25 without the second oil there is no rupture you gotta cross the second hole it will open the seals when he opened the seals you see the seals then the revelation of the Rapture comes up one of these State prayed for me so you can see what really happened from a due birth when you are born again what happened what really happened in you when you are born again amen when that happened you might have other things following up you might fall down on the ground you might be start speaking in tongues you can be shouting and running around all kinds of stuff can happen to you but make sure that one thing happened to you in other words when the anointing come you have to do something in you but the holy ghost that you get is not different than what was represented somewhere if your name is represented in the one Holy Ghost that is both male and female you're going to get the Holy Ghost in other words whether you like it or not God will give you the Holy Spirit you can even run away the Holy Ghost will chase you where you are and say I need to enter you until you're going to surrender you're going to get the Holy Ghost amen amen you know the sons of the Prophet knew that Elisha was going yeah Elijah was going they knew it but they did they were not partake care of that mystery but they knew it so don't be impressive Pentecostal touches certain things about the coming of the Lord they will know but they don't really know what's going on remember Russia Rosa that was one curtain amen the ion curtain and China arose up trying to fight with Thailand that was your bamboo curtain and when we finish the Beast who's rising up now is that complicated why did it happen only after we stopped preaching about the Pope here then what follow he opened up with the pole after we finish the whole trace of this Earth why did it happen like that it's not because of me the boss is giving enough instruction so that we cannot be deceived there is nothing new whatever the pope is doing we already have the blueprint in other words stay tight with this message it's homegoing time amen so pray for me we see the direction of the Holy Spirit how things will uh come up on the weekend amen glory be to God we have brought the same Mouse tonight he will be preaching our Thanksgiving message I learned how to pass the ball amen I learned how to pass the ball quickly amen I might be the one moving left and right or just pass it maybe he's going to shoot it so we can dunk it on Sunday if you know what I'm trying to say Amen so Brother Sam is the one having the ball tonight did it make sense I want to make it like that so you can really get what I'm trying to say Amen so we do not have visitors here tonight remember that we have family members so brother Aaron it's good to see you tonight Amen brother Aaron uh Fellowship we've brought uh Barry coffee and he is also a minister of the Gospel so one of this day we'll try to get you somewhere and open the door so you will be a blessing for the church amen thank you for stopping by and being a blessing to the big Christian family welcome you are not a stranger you are part of the family we're not visitor amen and I reached everybody tonight I don't want to call name but whoever I'm reading knows what I'm saying God richly bless you it has been a while amen let's sing only believe home we believe [Music] oh we believe all things are possible [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] and all things [Music] always [Music] foreign God bless you appreciate you let's just turn our scriptures to Saint John 3 16. very familiar text very familiar text we want to talk tonight about the bridegroom's love I'll talk to you tonight about the bridegroom's love amen and Happy Thanksgiving I remember hearing brother Branham just recently says we ought to be thankful that he said I don't feel like we're thankful enough I don't feel like we're thankful enough just this one act in Acts 3 16. uh John 3 16 John 3 16. let's just read the word now for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son yes that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life now this is the key right here God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world that wasn't his purpose but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God so then why then condemnation verse 19. and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and Men loved Darkness they love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth light do you ever notice a cockroach bugs bugs of a feather go into it every time we go into hotel room go in and turn the light on if I see anything scary and we're out of there laughs it's true we haven't walked out of more than one hotel room for everyone that doeth evil hate at the light neither cometh till a light lest his deed should be reproved but he that doeth truth comes to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God Lord Jesus we now are asking you humbly father that you would bless the reading of your word that you would anoint our lips to speak Lord God Lord God that you'd anoint the the hearers to hear Lord those that have a hunger in their heart Lord may they draw on the gift that you place Lord before the foundation of the world and Lord Jesus may you guide us in the direction that you would have us to go and Lord May at the end of the day May you get the glory the honor and the praise for Lord Jesus we can be nothing but like this microphone Lord if you don't do the speaking Lord nothing will be said that's worthwhile but Lord if you will come and do the speaking Lord then we'll all go home satisfied we'll all go home full and we'll all go home praising the worthy one the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world thank you in Jesus Christ's name God bless you and you can be seated you know what the the last message that brother Branham preached on Thanksgiving day was it's the invisible Union he preached it in Louisiana amen amen and I'll never forget he was saying on there he said uh here I've preached almost I think it was a he was into the service almost uh towards the end of the last half hour of it and he said I haven't said anything about Thanksgiving he said but how thankful we should be how thankful the new Pilgrim fathers were when they came here and had the freedom to worship God that they wanted to the way that they wanted to so the invisible Union was expressed I believe it was in 1965 in November down in the Shreveport meetings amen amen well praise the Lord Jesus praise the Lord Jesus this little story just caught my mind and caught my well it was just something that it's a superhuman story but it was done by a human being and it happened in the 1968 Olympic Olympics has anybody ever heard of a man named awari from Tanzania from Tanzania and he was he was an Olympic runner and he was at the he was at the Mexico Olympics in 1968 and he was representing his country and he had a deep love for his country and he was he was quite an athlete apparently uh in in Tanzania he was one of the uh top Runners that they had and but when he came over to Mexico in Tanzania I guess that they don't have mountains and so he couldn't train in the high altitudes in Mexico cities in a very high altitude and so the air was thin and so it wasn't too long into the run that his legs started to cramp but he wouldn't give up he just kept pressing through pressing through pressing through and then on top of all that brother Stephen there was a little melee between the runners and all the runners kind of jostled together and and this man was thrown to the ground and he dislocated his knee he bruised his shoulder and he could barely uh keep going but that man ran it was a 26 mile race the accident happened at mile marker 11. of course they do it in kilometers but mile marker 11 he ran 15 miles on a dislocated knee and he would not quit I don't care what you're going through you don't have to quit we want to press the battle God's love is drawing us God's like us God's love got us this far and God's love is going to take us the rest of the way just relax I like the way brother Stephen puts it just put it in neutral his love is elective love I like what he said you can't mess it if you don't want it he's going to chase you down and give it to you anyways you say where is that in the Bible well let's look at uh Jonah he was running away did God chase him down brought him back he said boy you gotta go you've got to go he couldn't send anybody else brother Stephen it had to be Jonah it's right amen before the foundation of the world I remember reading in the greatest battle ever fought it's a quote that has stuck with me for years and years and years he said to he said you have to come to a place to where you keep your mind in the word and you doubt your doubts common yes yes if anything comes along and says you can't you just doubt that one if something comes along and says you can then you believe that one it's good to see you so bad we missed you amen imagine that devil trying to give our sister a fever shame on him I'll tell you Satan is cruel when you see what he does the little babies I don't want nothing to do with them and this message called Satan's eaten brother Brandon brings out this thought here he said I wanted to speak to you this morning to bring something to you to Enlighten you to the promise of God for this age now keep in mind this is priests in 1965. and I want to say it in a way that you understand what I'm saying and I'm not trying to make anything mysterious about it but the but the age that we're living in is beyond that what the what is being brought across this pulpit but by the entire fivefold Ministry brother Glenn Kelly bringing that beautiful message the other night about the the the Stone Cutters and the Masons and and how we need to have a stone cutter you can be the right Stone but there's still got to be somebody there to come in and Chip the stuff that's not Christ off you remember Michelangelo brother Stephen gave you that beautiful example that big block of marble that he was using and he he had to take his his chisel and his hammer and he had to knock off everything that was not Moses anything that was not Moses had to come off and I'm here to tell you tonight that as a child of God anything that is not Christ has got to come off and God's got a provided way to knock it off and that's the fivefold ministry I'm not the one that said that the fivefold ministry was given for the Perfection of the Saints I didn't say that but the scripture says that and brother Angela there's people that want to do away with the Firefall Ministry what are they gonna do and we can't and Eve got in trouble for just believing just one word they want to throw out a whole paragraph God help them something not something uh that somebody else was in another day but something when and them things is all right he says and we'll refer to all those things but I thought I would try to bring to your mind with these scriptures now keep in mind he's preaching Satan's Eden with these scriptures uh I got written here that would Enlighten you and make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now now you wouldn't you wouldn't believe how many times that word now is just tucked right in there now are you the sons of God it doesn't yet appear where you shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be what for we shall what brother Angela's my microphone I'm only kidding we're gonna we're gonna be like him we'll see him like he is and I've always said it like this uh brother Polly carp when when when I see him I will see him in my mirror I will see him in my mirror damn it it's your character it's your man of walk it's your manner of life [Music] brother Brown said that the beauty of a church is the character of the people and I want to tell you something character is not a gift [Music] characters of victory and every trial that you go through has been foreigned by God before the foundation of the world her brother Branham and Lee Vale talking one time you remember this brother Stephen he's talking to leave apparently somebody had sent something to brother Branham and it was offensive not only to him but to his family and brother Lee looked at him said brother Brown how do you take it like that yes and brother Branham looked at Lee and he said oh lee he said that was a trial that was prepared for me before the foundation of the world you're in his hands we're talking about the bridegroom's love you're in his hands brother Stephen was talking uh before this before I came up and he said that uh one of the words that that he run into was beloved beloved and that was also used in that same text beloved now are you the sons of God now do you know that that word beloved comes from the root word of Agape of agape and the actual word for beloved is agape agape you're his dear little one are you ready for this are you ready for this sister that's why he hasn't given you the spirit of fear that's why we can look at him and call him Abba father a dear little child can look at her father and say Daddy and when you look at your daddy in the eyes and you ask him something just in just the right way you know especially you girls you know you're gonna get it girls got away with daddies Sunshine plug your ears so he wants to make us a better soldier in the field that we're fighting on now to learn the tactics of an enemy now this is very key here folks because we don't want to wrestle with the Enemy we want to block the punches keep them off us we don't want to keep falling and getting back up falling getting back up now I want to say this if you fall get back up but it's far better not to fall and not to have to get back up I would rather have a testimony that I never fell you sisters have got a testimony that you can hold true to it and you'll have a testimony that there's nobody else in this late to see an age will have we're talking about the bridegroom's love it's a no-nonsense love it's a pure love so you want to learn to keep the punches off you as much as you can he said no he said let's look a few minutes this great sinful day that we're now in he said I don't believe that there was a day that I ever read in history that there's been greater days of persecution when the children of God were put to death on every hand but the deceitfulness of the enemy we've never had a day like we're living in now it's the most cunning and deceitful day and when I see that it brings this it brings this and when I see that it brings this that the Christian has to be more on his toe than he ever was than he was and today than he was in any other age now he says back in the days of the persecution of Rome the Christian would make a mistake they would go down the arena they fed him to the Lions and he gave his testimony and he went to be with the Lord but now he says the cunningness of the devil listen closely the cunningness of the devil makes people believe that they're Christian when they are not November 19th no no I'm sorry November 29th 1973. can anybody count back that far a long time sister Teresa and another man walked into a creek was it Deer Creek Deer Creek in Pennsylvania it was two o'clock in the morning and I would just received the revelation of water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ amen and see back in 1973 they were looking at 1977 they were subtracting three and a half years off for the tribulation so 1973 and a half they were out of here oh it's true so this guy is telling me you're going over to Germany November the 29th uh November 29 1973 I went overseas that same day the reason I got baptized at two o'clock in the morning is it was the last chance I had to be baptized and I didn't think there'd be somebody in Germany to baptize me so we went down into a cold Icy Cold Creek at two o'clock in the morning was baptized and I'll celebrate that what on the 29th of uh of November but it's never been the same since but I just want to say this it's been a battle it's a battle and you have to stay on your toes you can't give the devil one inch not even a whim and the the more that you can get tuned in I I just want to say this to you young folks you young folks when you when you come to this church don't come haphazard you come like it's between life and death like it's every word that's come because we're living listen to what the prophet said he said that this is the most deceitful age and Satan the devil has set every cunning trap that he can he's a Deceiver and Jesus told us in Matthew 24 how that this day that we're living in the most deceitful day that we've ever lived in so close he said it would deceive the very left if now we're talking about the bridegroom's love and the bridegroom's love is a known nonsense love now we've all been following the teaching on the Tabernacle and we know there's how many courts the outer Court spirit is the inner court and then there's the holiest of holy and that's your soul right how many senses control the outside Court okay when you're in this fight you gotta take those five and stick them in your hip pocket don't come to church with your feelings out on your sleep [Applause] we gotta move on [Music] and you have to forget your emotions your conscience your reasoning your memories remember what Paul said about reasonings does anybody remember what Paul said about reasonings cast out every reasoning and the thought that exalts itself above God cast it down we don't have time for pity parties we don't need to drag the man of God down trying to take care of us and nurse us and burp us and feed us a little pacifier I want to tell you I have been cut I have been ripped I have been torn to shreds since I've been in this church I'm talking about me but I'm not the only one but there's not one time that that razor came by that sword I'd pick it up and show you again but I did it last time that sword came by and cut something off of me that I didn't come back and tell the man of God thank you thank you thank you I want to tell you something when I pass from this world the way I go down the way the tree falls that's the way it's coming up and brother Branham taught us death don't change a thing [Music] if we're going to get rid of anything we got to get rid of it now and it's late the hour is late do you realize that time is blending into eternity not going to blend you know the Ephesian s Smyrna age and the Smyrna age blended into the pergameon age and the pergamine into the thigh Tyrant well I want to tell you something that time is blending into eternity the Bible said of the sounding of that seventh angel when he begins to sound the The Mystery of the time would be no more time will be no more it said the mysteries of God should be finished [Music] I remember back home there was a man of God hammering me on that he come to me he thought he was the eighth messenger he did still does I guess maybe he's the ninth by now this guy I I'm gonna I won't put his name out there but he was so vain brother Robert that he told his congregation that he helped God write the Bible do you see how how far off you can get and anyways he would hand me with that it says the mysteries of God should be finished and I said boy that doesn't sound right well you know I always felt like the King James version was wrong because it's it's not should be it would be and so you know when they wrote the new King James version you know what they put in there would be anybody got a King James new King James you got a new King James look it up uh uh uh Revelations 10 7 and see if it doesn't say would be I see we're gonna put it to the test that should be would be but they're actually not finished until they're revealed to you personally that's when the mystery is finished God can reveal it but until you receive it exactly it's not a finished product and when the mystery of God is revealed to you personally it will produce nothing less than the literal life of Jesus Christ if you've got a if you've got the Mysteries all figured out and you do not have perfect love go back again and try again what's it say does it say shouldn't be no no new King James the new King James okay anyways it does promise you and if not I got the Greek word on it I can prove it to you that way all right so amen thank you I wish I had that Clicker turned too many pages that's why I was lost all right so here we go so if we're living in the holiest of holies we're living by faith faith alone and faith has no reasoning to it and Proverbs 27 5 it says this it says an open rebuke is better than Secret Love say that brother I would rather a man just come right up and tell me straight up you know if people would tell me to my face the things they say behind my back and the things they say behind my back tell them behind me because I always come up and say nice things to you but then they tell the people behind your back the bad things well just come tell me the bad things and then say the good things about me behind my back do you see how the devil's got it so backwards if you've got something uh good to say to somebody then tell that to their friends and if you get something that's negative either go tell him or get on your knees and tell God then we'll start moving this boat down the road then we're going to be one big happy family because we're all going to have the love of God that's when we're all in I was I've talked so many times about this that if every person was perfectly lined up with Jesus Christ then we would be perfectly lined up with each other we don't need to try to imitate each other we need to keep Jesus Christ as our Focus from the littlest one to the to the oldest one from the from the sisters to the brothers we should all have one thing in mind the pattern is Jesus Christ the righteous [Applause] now I don't know why a public rebuke just a straight out rebuke has gotten such a bad name they used it in the Bible Galatians 4 11 to 12. it says but when Peter was come to Antioch Paul says I would stood him to the face because he was to be blamed that's right for before certain uh uh came from James he did eat with the Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew himself and separated himself fearing them that were of the circumcision right for everybody his Pals his rookies Peter you're wrong but this man was filled with the Holy Ghost Peter is filled with the Holy Ghost was there any resentment did you ever hear Peter complain to Paul Paul you shouldn't you shouldn't done me like that with my buddies let's look what Peter said in second Peter 3 15 to 16. Peter said an account that the long-suffering the Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul sound like he had any hard feelings he called him his beloved brother I want to tell you something anybody that will rebuke me to the face and set me on a course closer to my Lord Jesus Christ I will call him my beloved brother can I say it like this just one time for the advantage of the little ones I don't care if a donkey tells me I'm doing something wrong I love the Donkey you won't find me kicking no donkeys telling me I'm in the wrong way [Music] [Applause] that one came straight from him I like it when he does stuff like that amen our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given to him hath written unto you and also in all his Epistles speaking in them things in which are some things hard to be understood in other words it takes a little prayer life [Music] don't get mad at brother Stephen start praying look when the angel Gabriel came to Mary and she spoke something that was hard to be understood the angel spoke something hard to be understood what did Mary do you beat unto me and then she pondered it she mulled it over in her head she kept thinking about it kept praying about it friends let's pull together God is unveiling himself right here before our eyes his very nature his very character is being made and when we get to have it cook in a couple minutes we're going to find out that he made the vision playing upon the table oh my but now look we who are wise we will we will ponder them we will chew on them we'll go home and pray about him we will ask the Lord to help us to understand but they which are unlearned and unstable will wrestle with them as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction now keep in mind friends that we're not walking by sight our light is the light of Revelation and the light of Revelation is our faith expressed and faith comes by and hearing the I like this church and how can and how can he preach without a how can we hear without a preacher and how can he preach except that he'd be what thank God for God sent uh Pastor amen in Hebrews 11 27 Moses by faith forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of of the king for he endured as seeing him who was invisible and now look when God the the bridegroom's love is a corrective love and if you're on the road wrong course the bridegroom is going to put you on the right course and sometimes he'll use very unusual ways to do it for instance there was a man named Saul one time and he was on the road to Damascus and he was going to persecute the Christians he was on the wrong course and so he had an intervention of divine intervention of can I say it can I say it the pillar of fire amen you talk about people wrestling unstable under their own destruction I read an article one person said that was a floodlight you don't put a floodlight that close to a man's head foreign [Applause] [Music] just because they don't want to believe the truth they love Darkness why don't they just love the truth that's why they'll be condemned I was leaving here Sunday in October Michael I said now I know why this gay agenda is going on Satan is trying to manifest In the Flesh what God is doing in the spirit he's just a perverter he ain't got no imagination so he'll take the plan of God put his little imp to it and he messes everything now that Spirit shouldn't touch any young people in this church it shouldn't touch none of you oh my God amen well after he had that experience you know God is a very wise God he really is because he wanted to get Saul's attention but he knew that Saul didn't have the Holy Ghost so he probably had a pretty vile temper so you know what he did I did him that man could get mad all he wanted to he couldn't do nothing about it right and then he sends him a prophet and the prophet prayed for him he gets the Holy Ghost but then God only gives him enough eyesight to where that he could read the Bible and he could compare his experience do you know that he spent three years in Arabia right right studying the word of God you get some people they get a little hiccup and they got the Holy Ghost oh I got the Holy Ghost bless God well where's your three years to go down and compare that to the scriptures and to come and make sure it was the Holy Ghost you ever seen him in a Pentecostal Church they come up behind him oh you got it all right please nonsense if your Holy Ghost does not produced a literal life of Jesus Christ just don't have nothing to do with it throw it away and wait for the real one to come when you can love your enemy when you to do good for them in despiteful use you when you can be long-suffering when a brother when he's wrong and you can bear along with him then you hold on to that Holy Ghost [Applause] if you're still getting yourself offended and having pity parties don't hold on to that one get rid of it you're just miserable and you're making everybody around you miserable God knows how to slow us them Paul recognized that being the Lord because he looked at him he said Lord who are you and then the Lord right up here the Lord the same one that led the children of Israel through the wilderness ah can I say it like this the same one that kept them Lions off of Daniel [Music] [Applause] [Music] Daniel and Darth seeing him that wasn't visible and friends you're going to endure as seeing him that is invisible [Music] look to the Unseen but don't try to figure it out God must reveal he must unveil he must pull back the cover [Music] and do you know what you have to do to get God to pull back the cover just ask ing just ask him Lord I don't understand lean not to your own understanding oh have a good conversation with God every day you got a question you got a problem you got a problem somebody in school bothering you have you talked to Jesus about it have you prayed for him amen it's hard not it's hard to preach behind brother Stephen it really is because you could get so many thoughts coming up he's already said it she's already said it but he don't have a copyright on it that's another one of the most dumbest things I ever heard is brother Branham plagiarize somebody and those same people are saying that he plagiarized reads the same books where brother Brandon gives credit to Uriah Smith and Dr Larkin and I read all them books in some places I could make it fit but there's other places I just can't I couldn't line it up and so I got to preach the way God shows me and then they want to come along and said he plagued your eyes yeah is God so anyways Paul was commanded to rise and go down to a street called straight and there was a prophet there whose name was ananias and saw a vision and he baptized him remember all him now he was a little bit skeptical about this guy he had to do a little praying himself he had to get a revelation that God was really in this he didn't want to go lay hands on just anybody any time he's a dead old boy might bite me right but when he prayed and God said he was one of his and he had no problem amen he got the revelation Hallelujah so Paul compared his uh his uh experience to the scriptures and we find that Paul the rest of his life had that for a typos so don't when you hear something come across as pulpit don't just go home and feel warm and fuzzy take it back into the world what else you got to do with your time what you got to do with your time what you doing with your time can I tell on myself one time this morning I was going through going back and forth between the Bible and The Message Bible and there was that article caught my attention and I stopped to read it and I got all done brother polycarp and I said man that's five minutes I could read first uh first Peter two or three chapters and I wasted my time reading that article now what did that I can't even tell you what the article was and it has no Eternal value [Applause] I want to ask you a question of your children to God are you a child of God are you a child of God are you a child of God amen then spend your time with Daddy [Music] [Applause] say with me in the beginning was the and the word was and the word and the word was and dwelt Among Us if I tripped you up I'm sorry but spend time with Daddy [Applause] you're the agapato he's the Abba he's the daddy he loves you he wants to solve your problems he wants to give you Faith where you got fear do you know there's no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear [Applause] so he studied and brother Branham said he had that as a tide post for the rest of his life he said what an absolute that was the end of all arguments that was the end of everything for Paul all strife everything was gone I don't care what the Pharisees said what the sadness he said or anybody else said he met God he met God Vindicated by the word that settled it that settled it let's apply the scripture test tonight what if the minister come up to you and rebuke you openly right in front of this whole assembly come on now yes yes could I could I just suggest this this is just me this isn't brother Branham I didn't read it anywhere else but your ability to receive corruption reflects your maturity [Applause] exactly right do you know that we need to get lined up quickly there's there's no time to play no more exactly do you know that there was a couple in the Bible named ananas and safiro and they made a claim does anybody remember what the claim was oh yeah what was the claim they gave it all they gave it all let's get it out of real estate let's make it personal they said they gave their all I'm gonna let that one just just ruminate where are you at amen are you giving your own your confession is I'm giving my all oh I'm giving my all amen are we really giving everything we have all our heart all our minds and all our souls the woman that put the two mites into the treasury and she was followed up by a man that put a whole bag of gold in there and everybody was marveling at the back of gold a bag of gold but you know what Jesus she gave more because she gave her oh are we giving our own wives are you giving everything you got to your husband s are you giving everything you got to your wives amen are we given everything we have to to the Lord Jesus Christ are we still holding back a little something we got a little garment from the old man that's still hanging in the closet brother Branham says for the occasion closet [Applause] did you hear what I said take that Babylonian garment out of your closet and burn it you got stuff in your closet and you know Jesus wouldn't approve of it [Music] I'm trying to let that one settle because I want to land this one everybody relax now have you got that one are you ready to did you get your fire started you know some people in the Bible had books that wasn't right and they started a bonfire [Applause] [Applause] oh it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory Full Of Glory Full Of Glory it is joy unspeakable and full of glory and brother Stephen where I go he done preached it hey but you don't have a copyright isn't God good okay so now let's land this I don't want to land the plane yet let's just land this load you either burn those Babylonian garments or you will burn can I ask you a question you say Brother Sam that's awful hard you know what ain't I love you Jesus Loves You this is the bridegroom's love you remember the story of Jericho you remember somebody got a wedge of gold yeah yeah and a Babylonian garment what was his name thank you brother it didn't just affect him it affected his whole family look we're a family here let's quit the nonsense let's if we invested as much time in prayer as brother Stephen invest in in studying and preparing what would our Sunday Services be like [Music] all right every one of us were part of this don't you know that God hates the nicolaitan spirit and the Nicolas and spirit puts it all on the preacher and his children go home and watch I love Susie [Applause] that was in brother Brown I'm saying you know I heard a I heard a on the radio a radio minister that said if Paul was alive today because he wrote about marathons right I said I don't think so there ain't nothing on a football game would get can you imagine Paul getting all excited about somebody with a blown up pigskin Throwing It All Over in the air somewhere I don't think amen Hallelujah look at this uh Hebrews 12. verse 6. For Whom the lord loves he chastens he scorches every son that he receives amen if you endure chastening God will deal with you as a son I for what son is he whom the father chastens not we're talking about the bridegroom's love we're talking about a love that is corrective and a little um what's the word I want to use little measuring stick that I keep in the back of my mind when when I get thoughts run through my head you know these tormenting demons you don't does anybody else have those I'll tell you that you ain't gonna make it you're no good you made too many mistakes does that happen to anybody else or just me oh you can get your heart racing the bridegroom's love is corrective Satan is the false accuser of the brother [Music] Satan is the one who will come and tell you you'll never make it if something is telling you you're never gonna make it I'll tell you what you do just tell him what his future is going to [Applause] say I got it in the boat you're going to Lake a fire dude so leave me alone amen but if you're without chastisement we're of all everybody say all so you're not alone you're not alone when I said I got corrected everybody else said yeah right yeah but we all love brother Stephen how many how many how many of you willing to stand up and say brother Stephen make the vision Plain on the table would you stand up so he'll see what's in your heart just stand up let him see how many of you want him to make the vision plain upon the table can we just knock that devil in the head once and for all can we just take all the trepidation out of his heart we're standing and we're asking you as a family please make the vision plain don't hold nothing back [Applause] thank you thank you that wasn't fresh from the throne I thought about that this afternoon but it was from the throne John says this he says love not the world neither the things of the world If any man loved the world the love of the love If any man loved the world the love of the father is not in him can I make that any clearer could John make that any clearer for all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life it's not of the father but it's of the world and the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of the father of God abides forever now look at this curious little warning that John sticks in here little children little agapetos it's the last time he didn't say last times like the last two thousand years he said it's the last time amen do you see how brother Seth's message resonates all the way back they were expecting back then do you know how he knew it was the last time because they were Antichrist as you have heard that Antichrist shall come even now there are many antichrists whereby we know that we're in the last time now when that Antichrist went forth what horse rider was it the white horse rider and for all you people who think brother Brennan plagiarized Uriah Smith didn't get that right I'm just saying I'm just I'm just saying he didn't get that right that's why brother Branham couldn't use that because he couldn't make it fit thank you Jesus now the white horse rider came in flesh and the bride is going to the litter listen the literal Spirit of Jesus Christ it's going to be made flesh did I say is going to be I'm sorry is made is come in the flesh if that Spirit that's in you does not testify that Jesus is coming the flesh it makes you Antichrist it's not about what he's going to be it's what he is a question for you for use or do you love them if you love light you have eternal life if you love Darkness you condemned yourself now look at this here it says they went out from us because they were not of us for if they had been of us they no doubt would have continued with us but they went out but they went out that they may be made manifest that they were not all of us do you have that word for unctions it's an anointing the Greek word is charisma you've got a charisma you know you've got a Charisma yes that's where they get the word charismatic from but you've got the and it was uh it was a special Sab that was made by the high priest let me read it here I got it here uh it's usually prepared by the Hebrews from an old a a romantic herbs anointing was the inaugural ceremony for the priests the inaugural ceremony for the priests and you've got that unction now let's see what this unction does you've got an auction from the Holy One and you know all things am I reading a different Bible now that word for auction has only used two other times in the Bible and it's all in this same chapter let me read verse 21 real quick as we move along I have not given uh I have not written unto you because you know not the truth I have not written unto you because you know not the truth but because you know it and that no lie is of the truth now if you drop down to verse 27 it says but the anointing that's that unction that's that charisma which you have received of him abides in you and you need not that any man teach you but the same anointing teaches you what of all things and his truth and is no lie and even as it have taught you you shall abide in him and now little children abide in him oh I pray God makes that a revelation to Every Soul in this building it will Revel now illusionize this congregation if you abide in him from the moment you wake up till you lay your head to rest and then you commit your sleep to him and you do that for the rest of your life he will lead you he will guide you into all light and Truth [Applause] and then when the minister stands here and says something that's a little bit hard to be understood you can go home and you can commune with that anointing foreign and that anointing that is in you will break it down break it down break it down and you sisters [Applause] you sisters you got it even better than the rest of us because you got a husband you can go talk to you and I'm gonna tell you something if you don't know the answer he's got brother Steven's phone number I'm just saying amen it's no lie and even as he has taught you you shall abide in him now little children little children he's not even talking to the adults are you little children listening we'll let Gracie sleep we'll give Gracie some Grace she's got time she's got sisters a little reminder she's got an anointing little children fight in him now listen abide in him now listen listen listen listen closely abide in him and when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming that's worth its weight in gold yes put your anointing to work action to work I counsel you to buy of me tried in a fire and anoint your eyes with why so that you can see do you remember brother Brown telling the story about the Congress how his mama would come up there in the morning in that cold wind come across their eyes that means I woke up with what they call matter in your eyes you ever do that huh you got to go get some warm water and rub it out well she used Grease and that's how brother brown type this anointing if you know that he is righteous you know everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him now in a book called uh Corinthians the book of Correction few moments in this book of Corinthians in paragraph 15 he said if we notice he couldn't teach the Corinthians deep things they were just uh a baby fashion he couldn't go to them with a deep a great deep the messages like he did the Ephesians and he did to the Romans and teach them the Deep things because they wasn't able to take it how many my son proverbs 3. this is a beautiful proverb he says forget not my law I remember we are talking about the anointing and we are talking about the love of the bridegroom or the bridegroom's love okay watch now forget not my law but let your heart keep my Commandments I like how he says that my heart for length of days and long life and peace they shall add today let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck and write them on the table of your heart so Thou shalt find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy past be not wise in your own eyes but fear the lord and depart from evil it shall be held to your navel and Marrow to your bones on Earth the Lord with your substance and with the first fruits of all thine increase so thy Barnes so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine we'll we'll just let that one go for now it's hard not to jump on him my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his Corrections when the Lord corrects you thank him you want to talk about having a Thanksgiving the biggest Thanksgiving day you should have is when the Lord corrects you for whom the Lord loveth he corrects even as a father the son in whom he delighteth now I want you to see something here Solomon ties Your Love or your ability to receive correction with wisdom yes the very next verse happy is the man that finds wisdom and the man that gets understanding what do we have to do to get wisdom and get understanding just ask you remember the parable Jesus was talking he said you being a father if your son asked you for a fish would you give him a serpent if he asks you for bread would you give him a stone then how much more will your heavenly father give the Holy Ghost which is the oil which is the salve to them who asked it goes on to say you have not been that because you asked not and he said ask that your joy might be ball overflowing habit cook too look at how have a cook a cook was a man that and so he puts himself up on the watch he said I will stand upon my watch I think we should stand upon the watch over our spirits we should stand upon the watch of our attitudes you know I found out I'm not supposed to judge somebody else's attitude um I'm supposed to pray for his attitude but there's one attitude that I'm supposed to keep a watch on and haven't cooked too long he says I'll Stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower that's the high place on the wall and we'll watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I do you know what that word reproof means it means rebuked corrected it even means punishment it means chastisement but but but but we find out have a cook here he's on the town he's he's watching what he's going to answer when he's reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon the tables that he may run that reads it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak you're not going to be ashamed when he comes it's going to speak you're going to have confidence when he comes it's going to speak pay attention now note here for the vision is for an appointed time at the end it'll speak and not lie though at Terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not Tarry now look at if you drop down to verse 14 the Lord plugs it's about the only real positive thing in all of chapter two but he gives Abacus a little insight to the vision he says for the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters that cover the sea apartment up here you applying yourself to uh to the Lord and you're going to find out that if you love a correction that you will you will find wisdom and down here you're going to get wisdom if you love to be reproved if you if you if you're waiting to see what you can answer when you're reproved then you're going to see the time that the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord and the glory of the Lord uh will cover as the waters cover the sea now in this message call how can I overcome he said he wanted to take this subject how can I overcome because he said I think it's a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die we've got to keep Revival almost almost finished now I just want to get through this and then we'll be all done but but this has got some real meat to it so so pay attention uh help me help me to get this out we've got to keep the spirit of we've got to keep Revival we constantly revived every day Paul said he had to Die daily amen amen this is every day this is that we don't take a vacation from God We Must Die daily that Christ could live we must never let the Revival die within us and he that overcomes will sit down with me in my throne as I've overcome down and set with the father in his throne he said do you notice the the arrangement of that he said set with me in my throne not on my throne in my throne okay Esther are you ready for this what did a hazardous give Esther the half of the Kingdom and I want to tell you something that didn't mean that she had the East half and he had the West half it meant that her word in that kingdom was just as good as his word and your husband has already said if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will he has already stretched out the golden scepter to you [Applause] can you imagine God stretching out his golden scepter and a person walk away say I'd rather have my dark [Music] dog that said chills down my spot but they do it all the time Mercy see as Christ is a ruler the throne is a ruler at this time and the complete complete domain of God so will the church be with him the pride be with him in his throne in the entire domain not on the throne but in the throne sea where his domain reaches this domain is going to reach further than Esther's and I want to tell you something Esther's was pretty big but watch where your domain goes to you a throne is over a domain and a domain reaches just as far as its boundaries does and this is from eternity to Eternity just think of it he said but I come here for one purpose he said this is the House of Correction this is the throne this is the Throne of God now he's talking about the church he's talked about when they come into church okay and judgments go from the house of God and here's where we come together and gather in love with one another as only Christians can love but in here we are under a leadership of the Holy Spirit amen the Holy Ghost is amongst us and we're here to take Reckoning among ourselves to see where our short places are [Music] every time I come through that door I'm not listening for anything else but where am I missing the mark we know sin is unbelief but you know what sin means to miss the mark and that's why Paul had to strive for the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus it's not going to come with a casual study of the word keep your mind filled with God shortcomings and how we should catch up where we should be or to where we uh ought to be now where we are and where we ought to be and that's what we study ministers study those places for their people and when they see the people lack they begin to work on that you know he was uh he he liked the Wilderness so he was out walking one day in an Old Creek and he saw a log pay very close attention when if you catch what he's saying here you will never come through those doors into this church the same way again pay close attention this is paragraph 41. um in how shall I overcome if you want to look it up yourself when you get home I was across an Old Log the other day down a wash or what is called a hollow and I jumped up on this log on the outset it looked good on the outside it looked good it looked like a big old beach log and when I've jumped on it oh my a great chunk fell off it it was real rotten and dirty I said that's the way Christians are becoming now watch watch why this log is getting old and dirty can't hold any weight and then he's going to explain why Christians are getting that way oh I read this and I just Lord I'll never come to church the same way of course I come expecting anyways brother Seth I know you're listening and I come expecting that was a Monumental sermon he preached that was one for the ages amen amen where are we at now the log old and dirty but when I jumped on a great big chunk fell off okay I said that that's way Christian they've been dead in central sin and trespasses so long till they become Dodie they can't hold no way at all they don't know what overcoming means and I begin to think of this text overcome comma keep life in you overcome keep life in you when the life went out that's what brought the law to that condition free fell but where did it fall it fell into the to the Stream he's going to type that to somebody that has no life in him and he comes and he sits on a Christian service day after day day after day doesn't pay attention let's see if that's what he says I was just a a quick summary for you that's the way Christians they've been dead it's interested so long till they become dirty they can't hold no weight they don't know what overcoming means I begin to think overcome let's keep life in you and the life went out and that's what brought the log to this condition and it made it worse than ever when it laid in the branch where the water was and then there you are you take a Christian that's supposed to be that's supposed to be a Christian in other words they got a testimony I'm a Christian I go to church I pay my tithes I read my Bible I pray but they don't have any understanding they don't have any thirsts they don't want correction they don't want to be told that they're wrong brother Branham said the reason that the that the Pentecostals wouldn't receive his message is because his message was corrected him and they didn't want to see themselves wrong so they died wrong and where are they at now how many of them would like to come back and have another chance to listen to brother Brown let the life go out from him the experience the joy of serving Christ and living in a church where such things is going on he'll rotten twice as quick right living right under so if we are trying to follow the message of the hour or at least part of the message we should live constantly in the life of Christ see because it don't if you if it don't you'll lay around and know and know that these things should that you're supposed to do and you don't do it and the Bible said he that knoweth to do good and doeth or not to him it is sin amen and then you become Dodie rotten then you separated from the life of God so strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of God the Life of Christ it's one thing to read the word but you want the life that was in the word to transpose itself into you that you would be fruit bearing we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandest ages of old age all ages the land of sin Church age it's the grandest of all Church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity and then he says it's the greatest sinful age it's more a more sin in this age than there's ever been the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any age here back in the early ages a Christian like he said could just give his life and that would be it but look what he says but the enemy now has come in the name of the church and it's so deceiving the great age of deception when Christ said so the two Spirits would be so close that would deceive the very elect if it was possible see see remember Christ spoke of an elected people for the last day it would deceive the very elected if it were possible so close the people live they the people so live the people can live a clean holy life not be sinful adulterers drinkers Liars gamblers they can live above all that and still not with it this is the age of life that's why I say the Thunders are not complete they are revealed but they're not complete until they're revealed personally to you and the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that won't come with just a casual haphazard Church attendance that will come with a dedicated consecrated life when brother Stephen was talking about standing behind this pulpit it started to make me wonder do you realize that a man in the Old Testament that went beyond that Veil they had to tie a rope around his foot because if he stepped into this area here and there was something wrong with the way he was dressed or something that he had did and hadn't made right he would drop dead on the spot and they had little bells and pomegranates on the bottom of the Garment and when he would walk it would go holy holy holy and the only way that they knew that man was alive as they heard the bells and if they couldn't hear the bells pulled the Rope it's a fearful thing my sense my brothers my sisters to fall into the hands of a living God but I'm here to tell you tonight by the authority of Jesus Christ that this church is in the hands of a living God wake up take your part get on the front row start the whole front row should be filled with young people why would that God when I was your age I had a church like this to attack take advantage of it young people it'll deliver your soul and it will keep you from the most vile the most wicked age of all ages and they'll present you on that day are beautiful oh my God [Applause] you will have confidence

school tomorrow no do you have 10 15 minutes but Kelly if somebody is outside tell them to get him you might be seated we all follow this sermon and the Holy Spirit is here and God spoke back and forth back and forth back and forth and there is no way you can listen God is speaking to four category of people tonight God is speaking to four category of people find where you are fix what you need to fix if not that's between you and God amen this is what I put down when I was listening to the sermon and it kept coming back over and over amen amen that's the chart ahead amen the first category God is speaking there is somebody that is resisting the Holy Spirit and that person is stubborn I'm just gonna tell you exactly what I receive and that's what I'm going to say there is a category that is resisting the Holy Spirit God is trying to help you and that category is stubborn and it's a category that is working on the pretense thinking that everything is right but it's not right amen this is the category that is thinking that Brother Sam is here to flatter me I'm just telling you what what came to me and whoever is missing in this church make sure you listen to what I'm saying listen to the sermon first listen to this it's a category that thinks that when brother Kelly preaches here he's just here to flatter me if you find yourself here you need to correct your stuff quickly before God deals with you the second category is somebody who has still stuff in his life has not cleaned up yet there are things that need to be taken off from your life and God is trying to move you from this bad side here to the other side amen these are people that have dropped under a religious spirit and they are here sometimes they're sleeping all the time open Zechariah Chapter 3. please I'm just going to tell you what I heard and that's between you and the Lord but we will pray for you if you want to change it Zechariah Chapter 3. laughs the Holy Ghost is not tolerating things anymore that's right everybody okay if you're there you can say a man Zechariah 3 verse chapter 3 verse 1. the Bible says I'm speaking not to somebody who's here this person need to repent completely need to correct their life completely your attitude is wrong God would never do anything with you unless you correct it this person is in bad shape you got to stop what you're doing it's not helping you I'm talking to the person who is here Zechariah 3 verse 1 the Bible say and he showed me Joshua the high priest he didn't show Joshua The Sinner do you follow me Joshua is a high priest he's not a sinner on the street so it's a person and a religion the Bible said he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to do what to resist it how can Joshua be in the presence of the Lord him a high priest and Satan have the right to stand before God and to resist the man in the presence of the Lord what is in the life of Joshua that is giving the devil the right to keep accusing Joshua in front of the king are you getting what I'm saying I'm not talking about this category this category is getting things all backward amen they are preparing to always defend themselves amen they don't want to fall under the leadership not of my leadership but the leadership of the Holy Spirit amen I'm talking about this category here how can you stand in the presence of God are you a Son of God and the devil is walking in the presence of God and he's resisting you he's resisting you in front of God what do you have in your life that is giving Satan the right to resist you because God is your father Joshua is a high priest he's working for the king he's working for God but Satan doesn't feel God in the presence of God this is my job job God says that job there is no man like him this is Joshua where the Devil comes straight ahead in front of God such a boldness this is your second category verse 2 and the Lord say unto Satan the Lord rebuked him or certain even the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem rebuked him he's not this a brand plugged out of fire God is rebuking the devil do you see any changes this is the category that we will continue to pray Deliverance will not happen you will come with problem we'll pray and you might feel better here when you go out the problem comes back again there is a key why the devil is resisting Joshua what is in Joshua life that is giving the devil such a boldness until God himself have to rebuke the devil this is what it is verse 3 now Joshua was clothed with the Priestly garment what kind of government did he have that's the reason why the devil have a right to resist you in the presence of God he has a right to call you a liar in front of God do you follow me amen there is something in your life that Brother Sam say here not Brother Sam the Holy Spirit you must take off from your closet that filthy garment and you gotta burn it you gotta take those high-heeled shoes whoever is listening I know some of you are not here whoever is online whoever is back home whoever is going to listen later you have something in your house maybe a book that need to be burned maybe you have a skirt that needs to be burned maybe you have polish now we already preach about Nails we already preach about all these stuff uh I mean uh through the hotel you still holding on to those stuff that's why the devil have a right no matter how much we're gonna pray the devil will have the right to still continue coming and Buffet you all the time because there is something in your life that you need to take off if it's the nail taken off if it's your high he'll take him off if it's your conversation or your friend get them out do you follow me if not you will continue to sleep in this church you will continue as soon as the sermon started you will be starting to sleep because you don't want to give up something you don't want to take something out of your life that is a blockage that the Holy Spirit have already revealed to you through the word that this is wrong you don't want to do it you don't want to come to church you don't want to give God the preeminence continue it's not going to change I will continue to pray but the devil has a right to stand before you in the presence of God and resist you until this thing is taken out verse 4 and he answered verse three now Joshua was clothed with filthy garment that's the reason why the devil have a right and stood before the water how do you come in church with what you're wearing whether you're a man or whether you're a woman why the Bible say verse 4 and he answered and spoke unto those that stood before him saying do what as long as that government is there the devil have a right on you your haircut have a spirit the way you are grooming yourself whatever you want to copy with the fashion today you are bringing a spirit on you whatever you're wearing young sister you are bringing a spirit whatever you're bringing in your house you are bringing a spirit that's why the devil have a right go clean up your house clean your closet up clean your shoes I can even go deeper clean your underwear I'm talking to this church and I'm responsible for this church clean up everything that is bad everything that have the appearance of evil that doesn't reflect you as a Christian that doesn't make you look like a respectable young man or a respectable young woman take it off burn it amen battling depression battling trouble look what you have why is this church not filled tonight because everybody's working if I take you to people's home all of them that are home are working not all of them are working some a guy used they can sit home and watch and stream and probably they won't stream now they're going to stream when they get a chance some are working and they're trying their best to be putting stuff there some have legitimate reason there is everybody that is not here having a legitimate reason no continue I will continue to pray but that setting have a right until you take the filthy garment off the Bible says verse 4 and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him saying take away the filthy garment from him and unto him he said behold I have caused that what what is Iniquity you know that already you just don't want to do it there is Iniquity in somebody else's life that doesn't want to let it go that's why they tell you burn it amen iniquity to pass from thee and I will clothe thee with a change of water you need the Holy Ghost God is speaking to you for one more time get that thing out of your life get that friend out of your life whatever you clinging to take that out of your life so God can move you from this category here to another category that I'm about to speak whoever is not here tonight go back and listen to what I'm saying and find yourself where you are and fix your life the third category is somebody who is already receiving the word amen they are already respecting the word amen God is encouraging you tonight Amen to dedicate your life more because he's about to fill you open John first John chapter 3 where Brother Sam was reading if you think I'm too blunt I can speak more than what I'm talking oh yeah make a plane yes if a spirit doesn't want to leave there is a reason why that spirit is hanging some only like God when they go to trouble when there is no trouble they won't come first John chapter 2 and then we wind up quickly verse 19. the Bible said they went out from us but they were not of us you there on Sunday we talked about the Holy Spirit being one spirit you remember that and then we divided it like this just to give you an idea and we say this is the portion that belonged to the brother everybody okay and in this portion we got load of portion because the Bible Paul said that he give to everyone according to the measure of the gift of Christ there is a measure that is given up Christ is the only one that received the spirit with that measure every one of us we're receiving by portion based on what was already predestinated in the body of Christ because this even though it's a circle this is the head and this one is the body amen there is a portion that owes that is already appropriated or or predestinated to fill the body if you are a member of this body you are the Beloved the call the Church of God the wife of God the children of God the Beloved all those names that I gave on Sunday there is something for you here that you need to feel that's why David said do what to make up fill my cup and tell you what it runs over so there is a cup for David he have a measure the Bible says this that day went out from us there is somebody that left but they were not of us this body here Lord's willing maybe on Sunday it is called the US amen so the reason why somebody is living John is saying because in God they were not there to begin with there is nothing for that there is no representation of them that's the reason why they are living they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us everybody there were no doubt as what continue with water because the more you were bad somehow the holy spirit will come one day and will fill you you will not leave the Bible continue he said but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not of all of water they were among us but according to the Plan of Redemption they don't have any representation in God so they will come a time where separation have to happen but verse 20 ye have an option from the Holy One and you know what job to verse 24 let that therefore a bad in you which ye have heard from the water what was in the beginning in the beginning was the water that word was that logos over there now but John is saying that dialogue that you heard from the beginning look what it's gonna do the Bible said let that therefore abide in you amen which ye have heard from the what from the beginning if that which he have heard from the beginning shall remain in water your portion of the holy spirit amen ye also shall continue in the and in the water because the Son and the father are water that's the reason why the holy spirit will remain on you verse 25 and this is the promise that he has promised us even water why because you were already have eternal life here amen the promise is up to you and to your children and as many as the Lord those call are here that's why the Bible say in the book of Acts those that were ordained to eternal life you must be ordained to eternal life if you are ordained to eternal life somehow you will receive eternal life for certain amen verse 26 these things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you God the anointing which he has received of him you are receiving from that from him you are born here what you call your birthday you are here your Genesis 2 7 amen but you are receiving something from him amen that which you received from him amen but the anointing which he have received of him do what that's why Paul said you are still until he cannot leave you he was a portion that was prepared for you he have your name and that name is not your name given to the father but it's the name of the Revelation that's why the new birth is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ there is a revelation that will unfold to you and bring the Holy Spirit into you and the Holy Spirit will never leave you because it's a seal God is telling you that you are my child you always be my child I'm just coming to confirm to you that before the foundation of the world you were my son already verse 27 but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man do what that's why brother Branham said the holy spirit is in his sad teacher he's the one when we are preaching here somebody is there with you he's giving you more scripture more code more scripture more God I'm saying one thing but he's telling you like he's kind of because the Bible say he will bring in what and remember that's why you are sitting on Sunday you are listening to the sermon you see scripture coming back to your memory the one who's remanding you the scripture is the Holy Ghost and when he reminds you it seems like you understand it more better than before because he is the inside teacher the Holy Ghost is not complicated people made it complicated [Music] oh God I'm not going to preach on Sunday message here but the anointing which you have received of him a by death in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing do what of water I can go through many scriptures the Bible said they will all be taught of God and they all are the children of God and the Bible continues he say all things is the truth and is no water and even as he has taught you you shall do what there is no way you can depart from God because that anointing will stabilize you he will put an ankle on you until you look like Peter you say to whom shall we go because you only have the word of what eternal life all right somebody is already respecting the word somebody's already sucking he's already testing for the word consecrate just a little to be surrendered stay awake when we're preaching because the devil is troubling you so you don't he doesn't want you to get the word that's why he make you sleepy all the time so you can miss it because he knows that the word of life go to James chapter one come on Jesus amen can are we okay for me to continue go to James chapter one GMC's comes after evil if you dare you can say Amen glory to God James 1 18. skip it if you dare you can say Amen you there go to verse 17. every water the Holy Ghost is a what every good gift and every perfect water tell me what is a perfect gift do you see that gift being plural look at that gift it's singular do you see that being plural I just gotta run out he said he said every good gift and every perfect gift from water does the Holy Ghost come from under on the day of Pentecost they re what happened a rushing maybe we're coming from one amen we say every good gift and every perfect gift is combined together good and perfect gift amen is from above and cometh down from the father of water what do you see there [Music] [Applause] [Applause] I know yeah it will help you on Sunday I wish you keep the microphone like this amen the father of what why not one light because God is right but now he's the father of water because he's the one giving birth Oh Glory to God I'm talking about the Holy Ghost being born by the Holy Ghost [Music] you need to get this and be prepared for Sunday amen the Bible says in verse 17 every good gift he didn't say every good gift camera watch that every good it's a conjunction it's combining good gift and perfect they are combined together in either way that gift is not only good but it's still perfect but it's coming down the the Good Samaritan the Samaritan that came I mean uh someone came to Jesus Christ and said good Master they say who is good but who is a good gift [Applause] everybody okay the Bible say every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of water with whom there is no water need a shadow of water bother you tight you can't go no left and right it is I keep it for Sunday job to verse 18 of his own you there of his own will will do what we got bit means water he's birthing he's giving to birth of his own will be God He Who look he began He Who do you see the eyes of God he began he asked everybody okay with water so you are born by water do you see when brother Branham said the new birth is a personal water you are born by the e let me keep it the Bible say of he or free of his own who will be God he asked with the word of truth that we should be a water of water first fruit of his water there is a key mystery with that creature do you remember they say that Jesus Christ was the beginning of the water if he is the beginning do you think he's alone [Applause] if he is the beginning of the creation if somebody began the creation does he mean that he finishes somebody is here get tight with God you're getting it and probably tonight you already got it everybody okay another one is season he's mature get more dedicated amen somebody's mature he's he has the Holy Ghost he knows where he's heading don't be somebody who's causing trouble and making our will spin because you don't want to get in position see where you are whether you're here or whether you are there if you're here clean up God is trying to help you so we can move you over here whoever is over here get ready it's coming amen whoever is there pray for the other one let's stand let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us and father thank you for this congregation that can go extra mile to give the minute to be able Lord father to receive what you are bringing unto the church Lord because the time is winding up so quick father Russia is fulfilling their prophecy China fulfilling their part the purple curtain fulfilling their part and no doubt the pride also have a part to fulfill and we are now fulfilling our part ner may you help whoever is in this first category to come out from these complexes to depart under the working of Satan to be delivered completely from a spirit of proud a spirit that is blocking them to receive the engrafted word of God that can change them move them transform them and fill them and deliver them and father whoever is on the second category father pointed to us point it to them quickened to the heart the Bible say no man knows what is in the manner save the spirit that is in a man father may they become honest to themselves to check their life and see what needed to be taken off what do they need to cut off what do they need to burn yes yes what did they need to be removed what did they need to let go if it's a pride let go [Music] father you are sending the washing of the water by the word to remove all our complexes from our family from our birth things that we inherited and we are trapping to them we don't know we're trying to come out of it and the devil is trying to move the people away from receiving that word that can deliver them father stabilize those that are mature refill them again with your spirit may they become prayer Warrior father I was even thinking myself throughout the week that if this church can remain in prayer what could be Sunday morning like and hear your servant come and speak the same thing even the things that I'm purposed a purpose to speak on December 3rd they
