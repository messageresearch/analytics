========================================

you when God can get amazing coming it senses conscience everything lead out into the stands with God behind it in the spirit it's not a devil in the world can poke it down here right he commenced so you don't feel any better your conscience is even God the fruit so clear shouts hallelujah the outlet those are whistle blowing I don't want to challenge I'm just a clean deep air for the word of God to work through the power of God see that's the main thing there's your battle ground your battle ground is back here at the beginning that care in the soul back in your mind that opens the the mind is the gate to the soul gate to the spirit rather your mind opens up and accepts the spirit all right rejects the spirit you're gonna have a little consciousness little feelings and little sensations all these things that has nothing to do with it that's those little sensations and things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accept it or reject it God let none of a miss it see it's your mind that opens up the door our closes the door and this is to your conscience this is to your memory this is to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out ever doubt is gone ever fear is gone ever sensation of doubt is gone ever feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the Word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir you cannot battle against it now we know that's true these battles has raged since the day of the Garden of Eden the battle in human mind Satan started it what did he do when he met Eve he didn't deny God's Word but he whitewashed it he stopped up some little channels here somewhere he said but surely God Genesis 3:1 think surely got all these things that he he promised he know the Word was right but he known he couldn't have come right out and blasted out Blair II like that but he sugar-coated it like mama used to get us take medicine and she try to put orange juice and cast on my just fella take the cast or without the orange juice anything it's hypocritical see she used to have to get up at nighttime she'd give us coal arm for crude and she'd put cold oil and put sugar on it see kind of hypocritical but his burn your tonsils out nearly going down I have to sugar that well that's the way it is friend Satan tries to to be hypocritical about it he tries to show you something better easier way a more sensible plan but there is no more sensible planning that God laid down at the beginning hole that word get a grip on it let he get a grip on you stay there with it that's that's the thing a battle rage when Eve opened up her mind to listen to her reasoning that's the fluid come in that's a shame that run down her reasoning she in her soul she reasoned her eyes were sight she saw the serpent is beautiful handsome flower are better than her own husband is the most stub still of all the beasts of the field and he was probably a fair man that her husband he looked like a great masculine be standing there how great he wanted he has tried to tell her what a great thing it was and first thing she did she opened up her mind and when she did human reasonings colic why wouldn't that be a thrill that's the thing he does to a woman today someone with a lovely little husband find some great big master man this man will try to open you up the reasons read that's Satan accidental or Vicey Versey manage a woman woman to man he's away what does he do work in that reasoning power that conscience or something begins to move through but give God's Word the first place a man can't even come to vacation honey here is this coming fresh a man cannot sin until first he cast aside God's Word he can't even see his disbelief until first he gets rid of the word of God the presence of God he cannot see him Eve could not see him until she laid aside god's word opening up her channel of reasons to her soul and begin the reason why certainly my husband's never told me these things but I believe that you he told me I shouldn't do this but you know you make it so real it's so clean I believe it would be wonderful because you're making it so plain to me see that was the first battle and through that battle has caused every other whatever bloodshed that ever comes cause right not even she disbelieved God's Word and if one little IOT of God's Word was this brief caused all this trouble how are we going to get back disbelieving the word you can't do it you've got to shut off all these other things conscience memories and say reasonings and all these are they casting down reasoning we don't reason about all nothing at all we just accept the word upon the basis God said so it sets a string between you and God every channel comes open between you and God the very first front line let's not use a 22 rifle let's get a comic bomb let's do the job right let's get God's atomic bomb why is it brother eh in his word that's coming mo sickness and devils right left get an item discreetly oh it it's it just destroys it disintegrates every king that's ungodly when that bomb of faith drops in there with the word of God behind it it blows ever devil ever sick he says that right brother branham is why does it own sermon are all others it's because of the channel you can look out and see it but you've got to have it in here looking this away not out there looking in you got the in looking out you can't come through reason you can't come through these other things you've got to come right down God's channel of it right into the soul how do you do it what's the last channel it'll read right on daddy say senses oh I can feel it yeah oh I am I smell it or so forth these things you're there yeah let's sing your reason well it looks like he oughta know what he's talking about the doctor says I can't get well that or to meet you see right there you're you're wrong that's the devil citizen that's the devil pokin these things into you don't you believe it hallelujah God above all things I would you prosper now how can you be a real soldier out there won't your Cosford help there it is right there those channels you just get them open up don't want ears bypass him then if sing you gets you there get by these concerts and all these other things then he gets right down here to end of the soul in the mind now if he can just get you you'll never you'll never look at one of them until first you have to let him in here yes lady meet him then when he gets in he's got control then what does he do he use the conscience he begins to use this begin to use this outlet what is it see taste feel smell hear imaginations conscience memory reasons affections he began to use all those different little channels as long as he could get in above this one here he's got to come in your mind first and you have to accept it he can listen it can batter against you but it can't get to you until you accept it when Satan walked up to even said you know what the fruits pleasant she stopped for a moment well that's what she made a mistake when she stopped for a loop don't stop for nothing you got the message Jesus lives not to hear the message don't stop for nothing no Beasley's no nothing else but she stopped for a moment that's when Satan walked right into that mine said well it sounds reasonable hmm oh do that is take what God said Abraham what if he stopped for reasoning when I told me he's going to have a baby with Sarah and she was 65 and him 75 and when he was a hundred and she was uh and she was 90 he still he he confessed that God's Word was true and he called those things which were not as though they were her he he even hope was there any hope he didn't even use hope when you say I hope I can get all right I hope I be well I hope I get the Holy Ghost I hope I'm a Christian I hope I do this you don't want that anybody never even look at that hey I get so peace you don't believe God's Word faith is beyond hope faith comes from back here in the inside faith comes from here how does he get in through this mine this door the battlefront standing there now when you get the battle set in the rain now the devil setting right to Everhart this morning he's setting this little girl's heart he's setting at your hearts you're sitting all around there he said well I'll see you try before I've heard that before cast him out whether the Bible say your text casting it out that's right Cassy mount we've been trained I think what's the matter with us preachers I want to look how the training we've had God's training for this great battle Matthew 24 said there and also Daniel 12 said there'd be a time of trouble such as never like on the airs before and we're living in that time when culture and education and things just smell it over the Word of God and got into reasonings and so forth the battle is now who said hallelujah the battles ready to go and she's ran out look what a great opposition we got to her who will be like David said you stand let that uncircumcised philistine the fire all goodbye Haven votes many women this morning you can raise them say ah take the Lord at his word be aware this is not what that did that has nothing to do that you Saul's and so forth you hear afraid of me get back where you belong but God's armies moving far hey man--oh Baylor faith understanding they don't have to be smart there had to be educated they have to be channels God takes those little channels she stopped for a moment to read and see monoliths deep well just like what if the this little lady this morning no doubt that the doctors told her she's just about the end of the room [Music] has got tons of song books in here normally we put that

don't want to trade your plans for something familiar I can't waste a day I can't stay the same I wanna be different I wanna be change so all of me is gone and all that remains is a fire so bright the whole world can see that there's something different to come and be different in me I don't want to spend my life stuck in a pattern I don't want to gain this world videos matters so I'm giving up

possible Jesus bless you this morning we greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ you say it again brother Stephen yes it is brother Stephen I spoke to the brother asked them to give me grace to lay this foundation but if anybody's burning the more than welcome to let me know and I will pass the ball so they have now express it you still got me it's just to answer that question that might be lingering somewhere sometime I get your question before you even speak them as they are chapter 40 it's not me I'm not a prophet by the discernment is in the body of the Lord as they are 40 you start a little bit late one o'clock show you had plenty come to rest go on sleeping no one snoring so we stay awake just and I'd say put the spiritual jacket you know where we are as they are 40 verse three if you dare you can say Amen the voice of him that cries in the wilderness a voice crying it's a person are we there he says a voice but that voice is crying how can a voice cry the voice and the person is same thing the voice of him that cries in the wilderness this person must be in the wilderness so when you see somebody moving in the wilderness you don't know why they go in in the wilderness because prophecy will dictate the event you might be seated as we continue the voice of him that cries in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord so there is a voice in the wilderness and the purpose of this voice is to prepare the way of the Lord father I thank you for this anointing repair you the way of the Lord is preparing the way of the Lord you will catch it later make straight in the desert a wilderness the desert same thing a highway for our God so this person is here to prepare the way to make a way for somebody who is coming everybody clear let's go to Malachi 4 remember God is a revelation and he doesn't change but he can add to that revelation to give you more clarity so you can receive the revelation when it comes alaka'i chapter 3 verse 1 if you dare you can say Amen brother David a day for its God behold I will send my messenger now it's talking about a messenger over there he was a voice but this time it's a messenger behold I will send my messenger when we you hear in the message we're talking about the messenger the messenger the messenger we not fabricating stuff brother branham did not fabricated it is in the scripture this man is called a voice this man is called a messenger what a Steven why do you say this man of Isaiah is the same man of Malachi 3 okay I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way oh I thought he was the voice preparing the way it's the same person are we clear preparing the way of the Lord I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord it's very specific now the Lord over there in Isaiah we didn't know who was coming we only knew somebody who was preparing the way for someone who's coming now we know the one who's coming is the Lord he said the Lord whom you seek now not everybody was seeking the Lord remember the history group of people we got the juice we got a Samaritan and we got a Gentile where the god Branham get this stuff if you need a scripture see me I will give it to you everybody there but these group here the gentle we were not waiting for a messiah but they say the Lord whom you seek the one that were seeking a lord to come was the Jews and a Samaritan that's why the woman at the well is Samaritan says that when the Messiah will come are you there so not only were the Jews and this and not only were the Jews only waiting for the Messiah by the Samaritan also was waiting for the Messiah so when they say the Lord whom is sick it is hidden in the thunders when you read it you just see the Lord whom you seek you need a prophet then the Prophet will tell you he was the Jews and the Samaritan that was seeking for the Messiah so this men this Lord this God that is coming up it's telling you he is coming straight to the Jews and Samaritan clear rowdy now you're gonna realize that anointing the Lord whom you seek to nation do you know when this came to me I was sitting right there behind him that's when he drove the Lord whom will seek shall suddenly so you I want you to keep that one the Lord is not coming slowly sudden it's something quick that happened you need to remember that something quick the Lord suddenly so maybe something will be done and suddenly the Lord entered enter way the Lord shall suddenly come to his temple but we know the Messiah was Jesus Christ how many times Jesus went into the temple so many times did Jesus enter into the temple suddenly he was walking that's not a sudden enters but this Lord when he entered in the temple he's entering suddenly so it's a quick work and our Lord is in the temple is that temple a building or is it a person who in the surgery you need to get used to my sense of humor when I say deep water I'm telling you we are I need your attention we are deep in the message when I say put your life jacket all I'm telling you I'm gonna drop deep in the message I need your full attention when I say you were not exposed to this I'm telling you from where we came from I'm not talking about here I'm just clearing the air shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger again of the Covenant whom you delight in behold he shall come say the Lord of hosts everybody clear now let's go to Malachi 4 next chapter ad if you dare you can say Amen I'm going to read this this entire chapter you need it for behold the day cometh it's a day that cometh that shall burn as an oven so there is a burning connected to this day when John the Baptist come did the earth burn let's continue that shall burn as an oven and all the proud it's talking about people yea and all that do wickedly people shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up so there will be a burning of people remember when the fire dropped down in the altar of Elijah I hope you follow this theory that fire burned the animal which is the flesh remember that fire also burned the wood which is botany the fire also took care of the stone and a dust everybody there the element of the earth shall melt remember your Bible and he also leaked the water because in Revelation chapter 21 we won't have water the Bible said there will be no sea but I will deal with that one on the mystery of the three heaven then you will see what is the sea okay and there shall come and the day that come shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts and that it shall leave them neither root rather abate if you remember is neither root nor botany botany your branches bodily right no branches but to you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness be created you read your Bible it is the rising of the Sun okay it is the rising of the Sun there will be a Sun that gonna rise go to the three mysteries of the mystery of the three heaven you will remember we're not spoke about the Sun there will be a rising of the Sun the Sun of righteousness it's a Sun with righteousness like a judge the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings so this Sun has links you remember in the book of Revelation when we preach about the mystery of the three heaven we spoke about the angel that was standing in the Sun anybody remember that oh my god go listen to the sermon in Revelation there is an angel that was standing in the Sun and we prove to you that dad angels brother branham and God hwadam had a vision where he was spending in the Sun preaching as well so that son had an angel that was standing there and that manger was a prophet so there is a Sun connected to a prophet go listen to the message because I gave you the coat in that message it's on the one drive or something you can see the line everybody there now we see that there is a Sun that is rising up and that Sun for some reason have wings but when Israel was coming out of Egypt the Bible says that God told them that I carry you on the wings of an eagle are either and brother branham said the wings of that ego was Moses are there so those wings who are speaking about a prophet are you there so there will be another son that's gonna rise up with a prophet which connects you to the book of Revelation everybody seen but under the wings of that prophet there will be hearing there will be a gift of healing they will be healing companion shut the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grab as calf of the store but what I'm say that's the Millennium and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be wantin remember it's burning off flesh right okay it's going to be ashes everything but any life everything ashes and they shall be what ashes under the soul of Europe so when this happened we will again touch the earth with our feet remember the first coming Jesus came the second coming I gave you caught he cannot touch the earth he is going to be staying in the air because we're going to meet him in the air my last week approved to you that when he comes on the third coming his feet are going to be upon the Mount of Olives not only his feet are upon the Mount of Olives but our feet also will be sitting on the earth because when he come in revelation 19 is coming with an army I wish I have four hours then I'll prove to you who is that army are you dead and under the sole of your feet in the day that I shall do this say the Lord of hosts now remember O God what do you want us to remember remember Moses my servant look at your Baba I don't want you to say brother Stephen say remember Moses my servant I remember the law Malachi 4 applied to the Jews know the Jews has Moses and Elijah we prove to you but now he's not saying remember Moses by remember the rule I know why I'm cleaning this up remember the law of Moses my servant which are commanded to him in Horeb horrid horrid horrible I thought God met Moses in Mehsana so there is another meeting in Horeb why horrible what is in Horeb why does God want us to remember God is about to say something but God is saying before I tell you what I'm trying to tell you I want you first to remember montipora remember the law I give in lot horrible why do we have to remember Horeb what is horrible remember the law of Moses my servant which are commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel with the statute and judgment behold behold behold behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before he speak about Elijah the prophet he said I remember first horrible go back to Horeb girl fondant what happened in horrible once you get that clear then I will send you connect that with a larger the profit not just a larger why did he have to say a larger profit because usually the refer emergency emergency but this one he said Elijah the prophet why the Prophet why not Elijah Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord so before that burning Elijah will come brother Steven you already proved to us last week that Oh Moses and Elijah will be there then the earth will burn so that's what you mean Roddy no problem and he shall turn the water do you remember what Elijah did with Israel he told Israel come closer to me first because he had to turn the heart so it's not Scripture were not written just like that to turn the heart of the father to the children okay and the heart of the children to the father it looks like it's the same person Lester come and smite the earth with a curse everybody clear here the Lord somebody will prepare the way of the Lord that day ooh burn there are people Jews and Gentiles that are waiting for him and I shall send you Elijah the prophet but there is a messenger that's gonna come when the messenger cometh the Lord will suddenly suddenly suddenly enter into his temple everybody clear let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and a full everything you're doing for us father we thank you again for giving us opportunity to gather together around the reveal word of the our Lord we are committing ourselves unto the hand and the people that are following virtually may the Holy Spirit break forth this morning Lord and may you teach a word to your children Lord father may you heal those that are sick may you bind up those that have broken hearted Lord may you seek those that are lost Lord may you open the eyes of those that are blinded may you stabilize those that are shaking may you feed those that are already solid and standing Lord may you be the Alpha and the Omega this service Lord we move every hindrance Lord speak to our soul modely in the name of Jesus Christ amen now before we can continue here we are on the unchanging pattern of God our theme is Malachi 4 part three part eight before we begin to where we are going we need to clear up something because brother Branham say that as usually as usually as usual when one regards a verse superficial he comes with a superficial understanding if you look at the verse superficially you gonna come up with a superficial understanding that's why I say deep deep we need to go deep so you can catch not the Rhema but the logos the thoughts behind the world that is there if you just look the Lord whom you seek you want to come up and say somebody was looking for the Lord when you dig deeper then you wanna find out that it's talking about two nations the Jews and Samaritans everybody clear now God's togas in the book of Malachi to remember the law that happened in Horeb I cannot move him without clearing horrible this came in last evening what is horrible horrible what is it more horrible what is it let's take Exodus chapter 3 I'm going slowly you had plenty time to sleep even if you sleep at 3 a.m. you have killed 12 or something Exodus chapter 3 if you dare you can say Amen unless you work a third shift Exodus the to everybody there verse 1 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God there is a mountain that is called the mountain of God a mountain of God Martin of God what is the mountain of God he said he came in the mountain of God even to Horeb horrible horrible I'm repeating three times because when I say he the people are now online are missing it when you're saying they can catch it so I'm going to start repeating so if not I'm putting an emphasis on something they came to the mountain of God that mountain is called horrible so from today Horeb is the mountain of God very clear and the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush and he looked and behold the bush burn with fire and the bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called to him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses and he said Here I am so what I'm trying for you to remember here is that in Madhav that's where the burning bush experience happened so when we usually say Moses met the Lord in a pillar of fire the burning bush in a burning bush it happened in Maude Horeb everybody clear no problem let's go to at chapter 7 we are trying to decode something when once we be coded when they say remember horrid your mind will not never think the same again are we there let's go to the book of out to chapter 7 you need to keep your Bible it's a combination preaching teaching Bible study all of them mixed together so it's like a pizza you got mushroom where you got tomato you got everything it's healthy add to chapter 7 everybody there verse 29 and flag who Moses Moses Moses you know why I'm repeating now say he's repeating three times why he thinks we'd only signal then fled Moses Moses Moses and this saying and was a stranger in the land of Midian where he is far when where he fathered two sons and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of Martin Mont sana linear added Assad here Montana or sometime we call sauna with an I so you can see the Old Testament sometime I say Elias Elijah harass if you need a teaching on that you tell me you will see the difference are we there then he the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount sana an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in the thought the mountain was called is coming the mountain in other word not Horeb is what any question if you need more scripture on that you see me our Lord you and the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mehsana an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush when Moses saw it he wondered at the sight and as he drew near to behold the voice of the Lord came to him same story same experience different name Mount Horeb and Montana when they referred to our sauna they're talking about the same thing if you come to the book of Exodus when God came down there speaking about sauna if you go to the book of Deuteronomy the gonna tell you the same story but they use the name this is the Tron of me you need a scripture see me this series Exodus so when God says remember horrible God is telling us go back to the book of I'm going slowly are we clear so in this mountain Horeb God came down when God came down we found a man by the name of Moses because he says the law of Moses now what happened with losses in a horrid because we try to see the law of what Moses that happened in Horeb we trying to decode horrid let's go to Exodus chapter 32 Exodus chapter 32 I would strongly encourage you to watch your Bible especially young people watch your Bible the devil is trying to destroy the next generation Exodus 32 verse 15 if you dare you can say Amen alright what happened and Moses turned and went down from the mountain from the Mount everybody there and the truth table of the testimony were in his hand so when was his wife covered it God gave him to table of the law everybody clear ok no problem the truth table of the testimony were in his hand the turbo we're waiting on buffs their side on the one side and on the other were they written I want you to notice verse 16 everybody sleep everybody clear where the work of Moses the work of God I did where the work of God and the writing was the writing of Moses the worries of God God God graven upon the table so first of all we found out that the two table were given by Moses but when those stable were given by Moses but the work of those table everybody following me and the writing of those table were done by who in other word man had nothing to do with this part of the world of the table idea and Robbie has no input into it it is completely written given man by God everybody clear for his God job to verse 19 Alleluia and he came to pass as soon as he came near to the camp that he saw the calf Israel was in a Dollar Tree are you there and they're dancing and Moses anger was hot gangrene and he cast the table out of his hand and broke them beneath them if you study you will see that underneath this mountain there was an altar and it was in that water that Moses crushing everything everybody clear so this first table here that was borne by God written by God was destroyed because of idolatry are we there okay we trying to decode Exodus let's go to Exodus 34 if you dare you can say Amen Exodus 34 verse 1 and the Lord said to Moses everybody you knew you'd ever go cut out to table the second table of the law have the work of the hand of him or the head of the Prophet everybody here the Prophet went and the prophet has to take it - and that - must be sharp and go to the rock and begin to cut the rock but a Robert hope you are they I can I can hear the damn man everybody there he was a red beacon and he was the one I was referring to all the time so just bear with me and the Lord said what a random say be you and people who know how to deal with you okay and the Lord said to Moses you out cannot - table of what stone like to the first don't make a difference and I will write upon this table the words that were in the first table the word on the second table is the work of the prophet Moses by deriving the interpretation again because right here they give to love this table with riding on it but the second table of the law [Music] are we clear Samar's this one to God with table with stone without any Scripture under stoner everybody following me and he was God who come to interpret again to interpret the stone without writing but following me but the interpretation not respond contradict the first table of the law let me start it again the first level God did it God wrote on Normandie the second one moses cut the table Moses had the tool in his hand he caught the table and then when he cut the table there was nothing written on that table he has to go into the mountain for God to give them to him the interpretation of they are written slowly the director protection is exactly line up with the first stone hallelujah God writing we okay but Elijah is it clear are they okay and be ready in the morning and come up into the month morning to the mountain which mountain everybody clear okay we know that is home and present yourself there to me in what in the top of the mountain of the month and no man shall come up with you Moses must be wrong the prophet Moses must be on top of the mountain alone when he goes for God to interpret the stone they have no riding on it he must be alone and no man shall come up with you neither let any man be seen to out of the mountain neither led the flock nor heard feet before the mountain and he you who you'd Moses to table of stone like today whatever Moses is doing he already have a reference he saw the first table and when Moses is cutting out he must make sure he line up with the first one hallelujah and Moses rose up early in the morning and Juana and went up to mung sana as the Lord has commanded him and took in his hand to table of stone do they have writing no everybody clear and the Lord descended in there so when Moses goes over there with that stone that is now written there is a cloud that's gonna come down on the mountain if you have not caught it yet just keep your seat belt this message is perfectly line up with the Bible where God and the Lord descended in the cloud and the Lord descended in the rocket and the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him day and proclaim the name of the Lord let's job to verse 27 and the Lord said to Moses write you this word for after the tenor of this word I have made a covenant with you and with Israel and he was there with the Lord how many days let me write it here 40 days and what else 40 night so in horrible we have 40 days 40 night of Moses big winner Martin everybody follow we meet he did eat bread he neither eat bread nor drink water and he worked upon the table the word of the Covenant the Ten Commandment did Moses it no eating no drinking so no eating no drinking for forty days and no problem now let's see what's going on here how about when a little minister friend of eICU associate sister church junior Jackson come running up to us one night me down there say a head a dream Gino Jackson had a dream brother Branham that is bothering me I've seen all the Brethren gather upon a hill everybody following me and said upon this hill this Martin there you are teaching brother Branham was standing in the mountain teaching you are teaching us out of the letter that was work so we found out that in the vision of junior Jackson junior Jackson saw a big mountain and the mountain has leather already wheatondale there was a stone right here a mountain and they were the mountain but this letter pre-existed before brother branham get a holiday he was not the work of brother branham brother branham did not create the mountain is not right the letter in the mantle brother branham was only interpreting the letter Devils are already in the mountain hallelujah upon a hill you were teaching us out of letter that was world would look like in some letters that time he was before credible times had carved out he was not random Tom's have called out in the scripture in the rock okay when you finish that when bran randon finish interpreting that all Devils finish you told us say what when Elijah was about to start his show in the Bible he told Israel come water any question I will then do you see why we have to teach the way we go okay now come close and we we some of us and some of us and we will Elijah told Israel to come the Bible saying what or Israel gather together you remember now and we all gather up and you wish he finished with the first part which is the storm with the riding which is the first table which is the first table the help writing he finished with that everybody else then he moves to the second part then you reach from somewhere look like you got a clever brother branham got an instrument like a chroma in this not a clever akuaba is used to remove now but this look like a crowbar and a crowbar in the middle again then with the crowbar you will brother branham cut that stone everybody clear the first part written by God created by God but the second part the hang of the Prophet is holding an instrument and the Prophet is carrying the rock everybody clear and then you whip the top of this little pyramid open and when you did say granite rock with everybody clear when Moses cut the second table there was no writing on I am going slowly okay no writing on it as you told us to look upon this and notice he was going toward the west just as hard as you could toward the serving of the Sun a larger in the Bible weather until their offering of the evening sacrifice when the Sun is felling praise the Lord and I stood there a little bit till the Holy Spirit will fill this vision are you there what is the real in spirit say I said the bubble so this mountain with scriptures that were written before is your bubble but a Stephen say is brother branham himself who said that the entire bible as much as been revealed to men through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in jesus name and all these things has been so the first part of mother Branham ministry is to interpret the Bible are there but there is secret that is the Bible in such Department today because the Bible is sealed with seven seals I must go there to the west to find out what is the interpretation of the are written stone everybody clear Vera Branagh and notice the next thing now I took some kind of what about El Paradis Moses carried off second stage and on the inside of the rock they had nothing the second table nothing Raja Bullett and Adam have started to the west and I told them all I said don't go out west stay here and look on this till I return when once for what West so that blood there is a panda that comes me return back to the east after the experience of God coming down in a mountain on the cloud are you deaf with the Holy Spirit interpreting the our weekly world that's why when somebody came to brother Branham he said brother Branham this seven thunders are there gonna be something outside the Bible we're gonna say no you cannot add or take away from the Bible it is something that is in the Bible it was just hidden in other words the revelation of this message can never contradict the Bible because Moses when he went in with second he got to make sure whatever he does here much as the first table of shown we fear praise God will happen in Horeb that we need to remember jr. Jackson listening you remember the dream he had that I interpreted going toward the Setting Sun and this happened on on Sunset Mountain it is evening time Elijah waited until the offering of the evening sacrifice it is a fleeton sunset on dissociate message and it shall be light at the evening time upon sunset mountain in the Coronado forest remember the law of Moses on Mount Horeb then I will send you Elijah the Prophet everybody clear God to the pedicle structure this day the restoration of the gift my lord those men may be some present here some of them hearing the tape around the world many realize that this is the calling out of the blood not a pelican message you cannot step on this pulpit and begin to preach to us the message it parts for coming he said brother Steven Sasha I'm sorry I heard what happened to you is this true I say yes that's true what are you doing I say we got going together he say I was planning on a trip to come meet with you if I come will receive him I say as long as you preach the message don't get here and preach Baptist doctrine the preach metal destruction this is not a permaculture message the Pentecostal message wants to restore the gift back to the church but this is the calling forth of the blood another message that was just those two come just before so the wants to be that they shall burn like an orphan let them understand dear God first I believe this because it's revealed by your spirit though through the Word of God he has been vindicated and made manifest to the whole world certainly Lord in the minority always your group are that way when the Holy Spirit shall come he will glorify me what does glorify me Jesus you are the mad God you are the Prince of Peace you are the everlasting father you are the principal and acosta do that but that Jesus is the mighty God is them chemicals that do that what is glorified me Jesus said father the hour has come glorify thy self and the voice said I have glorified you and I will glorify you again when Jesus was working was he saying I am the mighty God I am the magic God this is a different message let's take the economy chapter father I have not even started autonomy chapter 5 we still according Horeb everybody there everybody there Chapter two everybody there the Lord our God made a covenant with us in her horrible horrible buddy seat do you see a bubble in horrid they Lord learned not discovered it with our Father but with us even us who are all of us here allows this day the Lord talked with your faith with you face to face in the month out of the midst of the fire I stood watch very good stood between the Lord and you so between God and the people there was a man in the middle by the name of Moses as stood between you between the Lord and you a data to show you the word of the Lord for you were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up in the mud so the Israel God approached him to meet him but when Israel approached God Israel refused to come closer to God so God you have to take Moses and Moses stand in between God and the people he got the instruction from God and he come and tell it to the people everybody clear so far let's job to the verse 20 a very important 22 very important now are you there God Davida connected no complaining about now reading or anything okay praise God these words the Lord spoke to all your assembling in the month of the midst of the fire of the rocket of the cloud and of the thick darkness with a great voice and he added no more and he wants them into table of stone and delivered them to me everybody there and he came to pass when you heard the voice of the voice out of the midst of darkness for the mountain did burn with fire that you came near to me if you notice there is a thunder there there is a cloud there there is fire there remember those elements however okay therefore the mountain did burn with Myra we file that you come near to me even all the head of the tribes and your elder what are they looking for with Moses and you said behold the Lord our God had shown us his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire we have seen the day that God does talk with men and he lives now therefore why should we die in other white will since so much demonstration will send a fire within the cloud why should we die did God kill them why should we die for this great fire will consume us if we heal the voice of the Lord our God anymore then we shall die in other word brother it's been thundering thundering thundering thundering we can't take it anymore if we continue like this we're gonna die everybody clear for who is there of the flesh that has heard the voice of the Living God and speaking out of the midst of fire as we have an lives in other words there is no mortar that I ever have this experience and remained aroused if we continue like this versus we can all die okay go you need let me heal all that the Lord our God shall see and speak to us in other word you houses you go not us you go talk to God everybody there and speak to us all that the Lord our God shall speak to you and he will hear it and we will hear it and do it and the Lord heard the words in other word the Lord agreed Israel toward God your way of speaking face-to-face to us is too much we cannot take this anymore if we continue we're going to disintegrate or die we're going to propose you something from now on you use Moses let Moses go to you you talk to Moses and then Moses will come back and talk to us I'll interpret to us what you God are speaking to us God say agree everybody clear and the Lord heard your voice the voice of your word when you spoke to me and the Lord said to me I have heard the voice of the world of these people which they have spoken to you they have well said they said good all that they have spoken in other word God says what Israel spoke I am agree with it in other word from this day forward I will never to my people face to face but following me I will always have somebody in between me and the people and that person is going to be a prophet the prophet will come to me and ask me to him and that profit goes back and tell you what a spoke remember my covenant with Moses in horrible in horrible the world's a law that came from God that I will always speak to you by a prophet remember already that's why I will send to you Elijah the Prophet the tirana meet after 18 we are still in the tournament do you see Horeb in the trauma me do you see in the tournament he was hidden in the Tirana me in sauna we just knew about the table of the law but in the trauma me he tells you that God is going to be speaking to you through a middle person that person is going to be a prophet that why he said horrible when you read go to the book of Deuteronomy and watch what I did in Horan there is something in Horeb there is a key in a horrible that key is very important for you to understand why I am sending elijah the traffic the tournament taking everybody there verse 15 first God everybody there the larger God we work to you so God in his mind he has the Messiah come down to Israel but because of what Israel asked for God was obligated to shake the Messiah to meet the requirement of horrible so the Messiah now must be a prophet hallelujah the Lord your God will raise up to you a prophet the midst of you of your brethren like unto I am the one Israel you say go stay between me and God so when a prophet comes he was gonna be like me okay to him you will hearted according to all that you desire of the Lord your God in Horeb horrible horrible everybody see that in Horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God did let me see this great fire anymore that I died and the Lord said to me they have well spoken that which they have spoken I will raise them up prophet from among their brethren like to you and I will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak them to all data speak them all that I have that I shall commend him in other word from this day forward when I'm gonna talk to men I'm gonna use a prophet the prophet will be an interpreter will happen in Horeb Horeb we found out that there is two table of the law there is a first part and with the second part the first written made by God the second part they are written world and we showed to you the connection with our ministry will happen in all there is a law there is a declaration that God said from this day forward when I'm going to speak to you I will always use a prophet everybody clear their walls Moses anything else in the whole let's go to the book of asking for skiing 19 when I finish this then I start my message let's clean up the 19 all of this was last night last evening everybody there first Kings chapter 19 everybody there maybe I will stop with this slider and then we have to pick up first Kings chapter 19 everybody there verse 8 parades day

finished eating and drinking and went in the strength of dammit in other words when Elijah begins the journey normal eating normal when Moses was in law sada in more Horeb no more no more for Harlem and for the night okay let's see Elijah and he arose and did eat and dream and went in his study strength in the strength of dammit 40 days and 40 nights 40 days and 40 no idiot no drinking why is Moses and Elijah always the same thing the mystery of the name of Billy poor Billy brother branham Paul the Apostle Paul if you notice Billy is before Paul but Paul came first and brother branham last okay and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of the mid 40 days when for the night to what Horeb the mountain of God Exodus 3 first one movie was in horrible the mountain of God Elijah in Horeb the mountain of Moses was in the London of God for the day's 49 no eating no drinking Allah I went there 40 days 40 night no eating no drinking Moses we know what happened what happened to Elijah first night and he came there to a cave oh my god okay let me raise this one the first thing when a large ideas came there you got it okay he found a cave what a tip really you got it Elijah had a cave Elijah had a cave Elijah had became why is this funny man going to pray into a cave it is fabricated and he came there to a curve so when Moses was there they never spoke about him you know he just went took the table came down went to determine come down but with Elijah they are disclosing to us something that was in her and that was never revealed to Moses that at the bottom there a larger when he comes there is a cavity in his first ministry he need to handle that ministry we became what are you trying to say brother Stephen brother David can you turn the camera please that water go home brother brother brother Baxter was with me the other day [Music] I'm still letting that sinking like Nevada move around very clear I have got a curved way back in the Hills where I go to I showed him where I met the angel of the Lord so in that cave God met Brad Branham did God meet Elijah in the cave let's read the Bible first man and he came there to a cave and large day and behold the word of the Lord came to him in the cave and he said and he said to him what do you hear who Elijah Elijah talk to God in a cave if you don't understand something in this message respected leave it alone swallow what you can swallow when they tell you something about the message just say Amen and move forward let another minister or God Himself unfold to you ah demons don't get on crazy website crazy intellectual crazy thinking crazy reasoning crazy am Americanist way illogical logical stop your brain lean not unto thine own understanding I was going back there all Torah when the larger came to this matter Jezebel was chasing him he was that thrown up brother branham said I was going there all torn up why the coincidence turnip and I met who him on the path down many times the pillow file and down through life I tried to tell people with the sincerity of my heart and they wouldn't misunderstand it they call it everything in the world well one night up yonder in Greenville Indiana to a cave where I was in a place the angel of the Lord appeared in the health when the larger need more horrible the first thing a caves remember horrible remember the law of my servant Moses in Horeb behold ascent to you Elijah the prophet hallelujah let's job down verse 10 and he said I have been very jealous zealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant so Elijah comes when the faith is already destroyed because he need to always repay the altar for second the Covenant pradana altars altars in the Bible churches write and learn your prophets the preacher with the sword slandered them backbiting front binding site biding abiding down biding all kinda biding in the message and when they meet you publishing Catholicism brother branham say preach on the poopit the way you talk on the street you cannot be on the street and then you get here religious spirit and behind back begging side biding front body under biding whatever biding your profit with the soul and I even I only I am left and they seek my life to take it away watch verse 11 now put your seatbelt when I say put your seatbelt and means I need your full attention so if you need the dictionary I'm giving you my dictionary so next time when you have a problem you just search the sermon he says it means that's a sense of human brother branham sayings Jesus have a sense of humor in case you want to attack I have a quote verse 11 and he said go forth and stand upon the mount which mark Horeb before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by who's passing by it's the Lord whose Kasinga be all the lords are passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains when he came out from the cave when he left his cave ministry what at him grilling he move on to the second stage are there in the second stage he went on the month of horrible like Moses and God told him that I am and when God come down he came down with what if stronger can you read it for me buddy Mike Adelie a strong a great leader a great a great strong wing if you look in another translation it's called a windstorm which we always referred to are you there God come down in a whirlwind and struck the mountain are we there whether John coda is helping you already there was a blast or what we call a Kem strike the mountain the first thing that came a whirlwind came struck the mountain what does it mean okay help me body one marriage a divorce and that you have did so much Lord I am sure in the sight of these people they shall hang all to this light come from me there's so much medication until you they can understand that this is coming from from from God and to bear record here today of many people sitting here that even so the Sun up there is a son but he's a voice behind the sandbar Michael there is a son that son up in there where the angel of the Lord came in there we are in the mountains the seventh angel when they were jumping down they were dropping down in the when God wanted to talk to Elijah the first manifestation of God is a da blast the mountain the rupture but there is a man standing here now was standing on it with me when you all heard me preach the sermon sir what time is it in the morning exactly where he said he would be there stood what standing right there from there when they come they were coming either let's see when they come out and ask them when up their whirlwind then when Elijah left his health ministry into the second stage of his ministry he went on top of forever just like God spoke with Moses this time with Elijah he is coming with whirlwind remember their law I say in her ever behold I will send you Elijah der okay let's go back to our scripture verse 11 brother John this is a different gear moving on here I don't think I believe when I finish this I will stop and let you go sink this then next time I expect a brother Express something then we continue with what I was preparing today everybody it's no need to rush we can rush and you come out here 20 years on a message you know even understand what you believe you believe in the trade for what is the table I only hear people saying deadpool 10-4 10-4 temple no more that no more that no more that verse 11 and he said go forth and stand upon demand second stage before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and strong and strong and and a great and strong wind did what right it's a blast brother job learnt the mountain and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord so brother Robert when this brush hit the rock bastard brother Stephen what else are you trying to say when you look at the scripture superficially you're going to come up with a superficial understanding and you will be like any other denomination this message is mysteries the voice of the seventh angel when he shall sound all all the mysteries of God shall be finished what is wrong with what even rocks it's a problem praise God brother John so why don't we love you you know we have been a good time this day this scripture is fulfilled once we say done morning we were talking about the seven angel when they come down they came down Aza were we okay brother Michael watch them again when those seven angels come down and blasted the earth brother John body your blood bless the dear earth and rocks through every way are we clear in the Bible when God came down and blessed the mountain walking out in pieces why is this exactly the same no he was he was also in rocketry the bubble it is not a rocket in the Bravo it's only a rocket when it's fulfilled and they rub through every way seven angels today and say return back the voice came after you've noticed that the voice came later after from where you come from for the seventh seal of the seventh is the service so difficult of the seven busy will be opened one in a million seven angel just as clear as you standing here come sweeping we know they were coming with a whirlwind sweeping down from heaven the last rabbit the rocks in the mountains roll out and down the hill and people standing there were screaming and going on you and the dust flying everywhere each angel will be one of them the seal of the first angel first few second angel second seal teenager is that complicated and the servant who have the chest like this he was the seventh seal which is the anthem message now let's go back again to a bubble this is how I read my book and with a verse 11 and he shall go forth and sprang upon the mount before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and a great strong with a whirlwind we already proved to you blasted went to the mountain and broke in pieces what you saw the alocs day everybody clear the rocks beneath the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind okay and after the wind a what the best rock rolling down then earthquake brought like the wind the rock then earthquake okay trying to do God a service with a habanero being God's will for you and the seven angels same thing I'm going with seven angels I showed you seven angel coming down with her whirlwind seven angel when the blast rock war rolling down against seven angels seven angel came and busted this and ground busted now we in the ground I'm going slowly and everything else rough we already talked about rods roll out of the mountain 70 they're all sure they all shook everywhere earthquake are they blasted rock shaking with who Elijah when in mock foreign behold I will send you Elijah de rocks does as roll down dust flying like that and look and standing there with before me stood seven angels down the seventh seal which is there you get your own definition simple but yeah so we've sound out rocks riding everywhere this one earthquake blasting now what else let's go to verse 11 just one verse and he said God softened stand up on demand before the Lord and beyond the Lord shall pass by and a great and strong wing the world will rent the mountain plus that brother John and broken world in pieces the rocks before the Lord but the world but the Lord was not in the wind if you notice they say the Lord pacified who came down in the whirlwind God who blasted the mountain God who'd shook the earth God but the Bible say but God was not in why all right you ready the holy let me say this a whirlwind is the manifestation of God I hope together at under blasting it is the manifestation of God go with brother bran Rock flangers where God is manifesting his power are they can't quite put it God it's a manifestation of God the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost I hope I can get this straight praise God the Holy Ghost can make you speak in town you gather the Holy Ghost can make you professor you got it the Holy Ghost can make you to cast out the devil but a Brian speaking in tongues is not the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost the Lord passed by but the Lord was not in it prophesied in the Holy Ghost can make you prophesy but prophesy does not mean you have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost can make you cast out Devils but everybody that cast ever have the Holy Ghost in that day they shall say Lord Lord have we not prophesied in earnest have we not cast out the devil in your name have we not speaking in tongue in you name the Lord was not there yet the Lord was the one speaking in town the Lord can make you prophesy the Lord can make you cast a devil but this is not where you focus the Lord is not there any question that interpretation came before I came to church this message is deeper than you think opening of the Seventh Seal the Bible it's a new book you don't preach like Pentecostal it's a different sound when you start preaching the message it takes you into a different level you cannot preach the message and you standing Baptist whether you an evangelist whether you a teacher whether you have profit whether you have pastor whether you an apostle when the sound of this message is going forth you going to sound different verse 11 and he said I'm going to stop in this slide I know I can God go Father and he said go forth and stand up on the mound behold the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind went the rock the mantle and broke in the pieces the rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind you understand what it means that it was God doing that but don't get caught up there because the devil can
