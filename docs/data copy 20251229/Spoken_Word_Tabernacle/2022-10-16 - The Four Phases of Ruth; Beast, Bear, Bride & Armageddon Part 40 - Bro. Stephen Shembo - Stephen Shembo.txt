everybody okay we're still dealing with roof we're dealing with the second oil and I want to remind you this coat very important brother Branham say any Bible reader here knows that all scripture has a compound meaning these are the keys that brother Branham gave us through the message and without those keys you're gonna get locked in the scripture there are many keys in the message this is one of them amen and brother Branham say every prophecy some most all of it brother Angelo you're on board praise God where you see it let's preach my friend okay I preach with brother Angelo if you have a problem that's your problem or his brother Angel yeah give him the mic so we can preach yes sir let's go ahead and preach amen he has to do a time there or two times or more and it shall be answered as a revolving history so keep in mind history repeat itself read story revolve prophecy can come back multiple times it just changes forms and changes name everybody okay thou have been said let's go to a scripture of Malachi 4. glory to God amen oh God where is it okay praise God now you start getting used to preach foreign after a while I will switch to somebody it's a shift all the young folks here buddy there is no way you can hide especially men who will rock you back and forth shake you and everything amen amen with love because I love you amen verse 1 will be okay for behold the day cometh that shall do what as water so this day is a burning day you might be seated what is going to burn he say all the Prada so if you have this Spirit you better make sure you get it off [Music] I believe everybody knows what a proud spirit is a show of spirit we can smell it we can see it on your Facebook on your WhatsApp and we can detect it get that thing off he say yeah and all that do wickedly hopefully there's nobody doing this to you shall be stubble so if you are a proud man or a proud woman you're going to be a stubborn amen and the day that cometh shall burn them up who want to be a stick well well well done get those stuff off of your life amen they shall burn them up say the Lord of hosts that he shall leave them neither water nor water in other words there is a day that is coming that's gonna burn everything on this planet Earth everything that you see here all are beautiful cars all our beautiful houses even this church everything that you see here will be completely burned your beautiful flower everything that you cherish will be completely burned what do you invest your time too ashes so there is a day that is coming and that day will burn everything to ashes good to see you brother Robert amen Hallelujah he say but to you so there is two category and grow up bend the door they are all jumping for you amen amen amen you shall tread down stop being you won't see anything they will be well cremated anybody okay I feel everything that you're working on is action everybody that was mean to you am I saying something wrong amen unless they repent the Bible says when I came when I was six you came to see me in a hospital when I was hungry they said when did we do that every time you did to the list of man you did it unto me but there is another group that didn't do it everybody okay they were mean to you when you had the cough uh I mean a flat tire in front of their car they called the police quickly they said get move your car out of here [Music] and somebody else say can I what can I do to help you you will remember that person in heaven you will say not this one I remember him father can I negotiate you don't know who you are do you know that Abraham negotiated with God even the number of people that can be saved Hallelujah he said he says you shall tread upon the ashes under the soul of your feet in that day that I shall do this so when we're entering the Millennium we're walking on the ashes of the wicked in other words everything is burned amen say the Lord of hosts Remember You The Law of Moses we went through this in the hotel and before in deep detail if you don't remember this you go back to the unchanging pattern of God because we establish malachite for we gave you scripture everything demonstrated brother Branham from the scripture or background without a court you can take this bubble and show somebody this message without a quote amen because it's bubble Foundation he said Remember You The Law of Moses my servant which are commanded to him in horrible for all Israel with the statute and judgment behold I will send you home Elijah the prophet not just Elijah Elijah deep prophet amen before the coming of the Great and Dreadful day of the Lord so before this Burning before discrimination happen we must see Elijah the prophet amen so Elijah the prophet is a forerunner of the dead of the Dreadful day or the burning day everybody okay praise God he he says verse 6 and he shall turn the heart of the father to the water children that says here that Elijah would turn the heart of the father into the children amen let's continue Kama and the Heart of the water children to the water fathers and the Heart of the children to the father if you don't know how to read your Bible now you're going to get confused here amen because these two speak of two elijahs we went through this I hope nobody will sleep today I'm just warning amen this is to Elijah here do you see them there will be an Elijah that will turn the heart of the father I'm just reviewing you can go back on the unchanging pardon of God you will see more detail on this there will be an Elijah that will turn the heart of the father to the children and there will be another Elijah that would turn the heart of the children to the father where do you see this this is your own interpretation you message people in the Book of Luke chapter 1 verse 13 the Bible says but the Angels say unto him fear not Zechariah how many know Zechariah for that prayer is heard and that and that was Elizabeth's son and you shall call his name who John everybody okay so we're talking about who here no John the Baptist was brother Branham from a Baptist Church too and that shall have joy and climates and many shall rejoice at his birth the birth of who John for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither water wine no water did Brother Branham drunk wine history repeat yourself I love this church everybody okay I'm not going to preach Malachi for you already know what I'm talking about amen and he shall be filled with water the Holy Ghost even from his water mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the water and he shall go before him in the spirit [Music] did he say the children to the father why did they only use a small portion of it everybody okay according to Malachi 4 Elijah will do two things he would turn the heart of the father and to the children and by the scripture who did that John the Baptist John the Baptist so who is going to turn the heart of the children back to the father show me one scripture in the Bible where this was put somewhere do you remember Jesus going into the temple one time and they handed him the scroll and Jesus opened the Bible and instead of reading the whole scripture Jesus read up to the middle and he stopped and he left another part [Applause] everybody here because the ministry of Jesus Christ we have to be forerun by the ministry of John so where John stop Jesus stop but there is another Elijah that should come and another and Jesus also have to come again so there is a portion from Malachi for and a portion from Isaiah 60. [Music] did I lose you this message is beautiful everybody okay so we got to Elijah here scripture don't play with let me read it again I love that the Bible says this scripture doesn't play with water words whatever is in the record is there for the water anointed did you see this this morning how many sees that so your eyes are anointed everybody okay it is there for water for a purpose the scripture don't stop like that I can show you another scripture just like this where the Bible says smart the shepherd and they only quoted that and they stopped right there because the second part belonged to the second coming of Jesus Christ everybody okay praise God so let me go back again he said and he shall turn the heart of the father to the children that's John clear over there and the Heart of the children to the water fathers that's Malachi 4 that's William Marion Branham you have a problem with that be my guest everybody okay lest uh come and smart the Earth with water occur so before they're coming your boss want me to tell you something when John the Baptist came you who think it's John the Baptist or maybe online somebody struggled I don't know who's struggling did the earth burn did everybody burn no no your boss told me to tell you that did the earth burn it was everything burn so did John fulfill that because they say before this Burning Day come I'm gonna send you Elijah the prophet if Elijah fulfilled if John fulfilled this entire prophecy after John the Earth should have burned did the earth burn is the earth burning today but the latter came is not to turn the father to the children but is to take the heart of the children back to the father so we must see some burning sooner everybody here that's why when you're gonna walk on the Millennium you must walk upon the ashes of the weekend so when we're walking on the ashes we say brother Branham that was true because you should have come before this day this day I did scripture have been fulfilled we are walking upon the ashes of the wicked because a larger prophesy amen if I lose you raise your hand let's go to revelation 13. glory to God it's Sunday one service take your hand off your pedal of time brother Greg sent me a message he said he's already in an overtime mode in other words amen let's go to verse one if you're there you can say Amen and I stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw a beast rising up out of the sea having seven horns seven heads and how many horns ten horns this Beast do we know him it's a mixture of the three beasts from Daniel it's a mixture of a lion and a bear and a leopard anybody okay and his characteristic is seven heads and ten horns he loves number seven and number 10. [Music] this that was quick somebody figured that out amen yes sir that Beast Within him has a seven and a ten amen so for you to master that Beast you need a seven and a 10. so when you coming with your seven and ten you hook ten here you hook seven then you begin to maneuver that Beast amen why did that happen in Revelation 10 7. and upon his head the name of water when you home during your week spend time listening to the message certain time reading the Bible you won't get lost and you will see whatever you listen you come here and comes from the pope you'll be amazed like wow because your boss is telling you I was there listening with you now since you didn't understand this portion let me confirm it to you amen verse 2 and the Beast which I saw was right to a leopard it's there and his feet was as the feet of water bear a beast usually like uh like that kind of beast when he fight what does he use to fight with but the feet are there so you need a bear to get them the bear and the bear must must fight we okay that's why they bear me to get him we okay and his mouth as the mouth of a lion Babylonian and the dragon which is Satan the old serpent gave him power and he sit and a great water so this Beast is the devil everybody care because whatever he's doing he got everything from Satan amen verse 3 and I saw one of his head as he were wounded to death you know what happened we're changing from Roman Pagan to Roman pepper pepper and his deadly wound was healed and all the world did water wondered so the world will wander after this Beast the whole world will wander after this Beast I put that because you need those details verse the four and they worship the dragon which gave power to the Beast and the worship to be saying who's like to the Beast who is able to make water war with him so it's a beast that can make war amen job to verse uh five I'm gonna put a box here because I need to keep it here and let's see how I'm Gonna Fly how we will take the flight in Lane amen and there was giving to him who is him the Beast everybody okay a math speaking water great things this beast in his mouth they gave him a mouth yeah amen he already have a mouth that look like a lion but they gave him a mouth in other words they gave him a speaker [Music] everybody okay this Beast already has a mouth that look like a lion but they gave him a month they gave him like a Spock man a speaker a representative everybody okay they give him a human being that can talk we okay they're giving my mouth amen and this month speak great things they speak great things and and speak water and speak blasphemy so it's a bad mouth dirty mouth everybody okay and he said and power was given to him to continue so 40 and two months if the life of the Beast are we okay are we okay the time of the Beast is 42. amen the Beast work with 42. yes were you okay just relax it's not complicated just relax job two verse 7. uh verse uh six and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God and to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle The Dwelling Place of God and them that dwell in water so this Beast doesn't like the people that dwell in heaven doesn't like God doesn't like the city of God doesn't like the Tabernacle of God nothing is enter God amen verse 7 and he was given to him to make war with descent so the wall of this Beast he makes war with descent he doesn't like sense because we come from heaven amen and to overcome them so some of the scent will be overcome by the Beast he will kill them everybody okay and power was given him over all kindred and tongue and water he can kill anybody everybody okay job to verse 18. I read this we could not get to it here is water wisdom let him that have understanding you remember wisdom now you understand that what it means now cut the number of the beasts for it is the number of water and his number is 600 to his car and water six so this Beast is a man and he have 666 which is three men you remember the bear coming up with three ribs everybody okay turn to Revelation 17 and then we pray you there you there let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto the hand Lord we are human being and we realize that we have to master the human element father may you move me not only me but the congregation away from their place that Lord father no intellectual will grasp for this word but may this go straight to the heart under the power of Revelation so that they can see with the eyes of the heart and not with their head father we pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you take this service unto the hand be the Alpha and the Omega remove every demonic spirit away from this place and speak to our soul in a powerful way and touch Our Lives Lord in Jesus precious name amen let's go to Revelation 17 keep everything buckle up the best that you can stay alert we're moving okay let's go to revelation 17. we already started if you're there you can say a man we're going to verse one I want you to follow me carefully you already know the subject the Beast the bear the bride and Armageddon everybody okay the Beast the bear and the bread all of them how are they connected to Armageddon why do we need Armageddon amen so stay alert your pastor say stay alert come on 17 verse 1. and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows everybody okay and talk with me saying to me come here I will show you the Judgment of the great whole that sits upon water many Waters so the one who is calling John is the Angel one of the angels that have the seven vows everybody okay in a hotel we preach about this and we found out that this Angel was nobody else but the angel personal that worked with brother Branham everybody okay this Angel was nobody else but brother Branham everybody okay if you have a problem it's on YouTube you need to go listen to it you get your Bible you got all the scripture amen so this Angel ever because every Angel Ever every messenger have a message of Deliverance and they also have a message for judgment amen they send the message of Deliverance first the children of God pick it up and whoever rejected The Vow come back and poor and judgment struck them amen and this one have the seventh vow and he is the one that is calling John to show him the judgment of God upon the whole everybody okay so far glory to God verse 2. with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with this woman and the inhabitant of the Earth has made has been made drunk with the one you remember this of her fornication because everybody that got this this one get mad it's in the Old Testament if you remember Isaiah that's what happened to belchazza he took the wine of Babylon he got crazy he stopped playing with the stuff in the temple if somebody doesn't respect what is going on in the church you must have been drinking from Babylon everybody okay foreign because only The Madness of Babylon brother Branham say a fool will walk where angel don't even want to step there in other words if you don't discern the presence of God in this church you will continue to behave the way you behave and you're gonna get hurt because you're drinking from Babylon everybody okay so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet color Beast he was spoken that she's sitting on the water but she's actually sitting on the Beast and the Beast came up from the water in other words the woman and the beasts are joined together they are one that's why the Bible says she sat on the water but when you look under her he's a beast so she is the wife of the false prophet that's what brother Branham say and the one and the man the the husband and the wife are that's why the Bible said that the woman sit upon many water the same as the Beast sit upon many water everybody okay praise God he said full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and how many horns it's over there now follow me carefully job to verse 6. and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the sand we send that this Beast here is a killer and kills the center so whatever the Beast is doing the woman is doing it they're one person everybody okay with the blood of the sin and with the blood of the Morty of Jesus so this is after the crucifixion and when I saw her I wonder with great admiration and the angel said to me wherefore did you Marvel in other words what do you wonder I would tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beasts that carry her remember the devil coupled together with Eve together the woman and the Beast amen and I will tell you the mystery of the woman and the Beast that carry him which has seven heads and water so this Beast here is joined to a woman and a woman we know is a church anybody okay this church is drunk with the blood of the scent which we know it's a Catholic church we already went through that yes verse 8 follow now the Beast that you saw was everybody okay and he's not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless feet and go into water tradition remember this beast in Revelation 13 have the number of Amen 666. so in other words it's a man carrying a woman a week okay are we okay are we okay praise God he says and they that dwell let's go to verse 8 the Beast that you saw was and he's not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit which is hell in other words the pope from origin comes straight from hell amen don't worry continue to love your pope amen and they shall do and they that dwell on the Earth shall do what my brother Wonder if you notice this Beast here they that were on the earth were doing what wondering everybody okay shall Wonder whose name were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold they beat that Rose and is not and yet it is everybody okay this is a repetition of Revelation 13. in other words Revelation 17 is telling you that this Beast have seven heads and ten horn it's exactly the same description of the Beast that was in Revelation 13. everybody okay job to verse 9. and here is the mind which has water wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman does Waters so we already found out that the seven heads number one there are seven mountains we went through this the two seven mountains we also have seven mountains anybody okay so we know how to match him we got a seven we got a ten we got Mountain so we're matching every plant every outlet that the Beast has we are plugging them up you have seven we got seven you got ten we got ten you got seven months and we also got seven mountains so we plug in the Beast everywhere [Music] because the Beast is filled with the Devil and we got the definition when you bring Seven Mountains we got seven mountains when you bring ten we got ten you bring seven we got seven so this message is a full package full coverage everybody okay if you see something coming up you don't know how to deal with it just know it's them even if you have not seen it yet it's there you're gonna see an emergency bullet another word whatever the devil displays to you is a signal to you that you have it already did you understand me do you understand what I'm saying if the devil say hey just know in your luggage you already got a everybody okay if you test for water it means you already have water in you because there is a deep that will come to the deeper it doesn't happen by any chance you already have it you are not just aware of it and the trial you going through is just a way for God to reveal what you have already knew so you can wake up [Applause] the disciple had Jesus in the boat and Jesus was sleeping and they were trying to solve the problem their problem was to tell them God awake Jesus Christ God tell Jesus wake up we are dying here Jesus was there but you must wake him up come on it's getting yummy my friend everybody okay don't be acting when you go to trial like you don't know like you're a baby crying crying crying crying when a trial come you sit down you say no no no no no what is behind this trial I'm not the devil that's an attack like that if you are attacking me there must be something going on what are you hiding behind what are you trying to teach me why didn't that trial happen yes here only this year have you seen somebody playing with your husband's sister huh and do you know what you feel in your heart you didn't know that thing was there until somebody play with your husband then you just like the Holy Ghost have to come quickly hey everybody okay because that thing was there he was laying dormant the challenges bring it out [Music] [Laughter] you taking my time by pulling me sideways I'm trying to stay on the main line everybody okay jump to verse 9 and here is the man which have wisdom the seven heads when Kamala came Indian Biden Irish brother Branham was Irish and Indian together so everything we keep plugging [Music] do you think it happened just like that everybody care the Bible says the seven heads are seven mountains which the woman sits watch now and they are also authors 17. so there's seven there is a compound meaning here anybody here if you stuck with the mountain you're gonna lose something the seven represented one the seven Mountain which we already know the two irrepresented seven Kings we okay now we already dealt with this one if you miss it you go back amen and they send their seven Kings Farms are Fallen and one is so it's number six and the other is not yet come number seven and when he comes he must continue a water short space so definitely we are dealing with seven natural Kings for the natural Kingdom of Rome everybody okay watch now carefully verse 11. you there and the Beast that have seven heads and ten horns that is six six that the whole world wander after the beasts follow me are the beasts that was and is not even he is the water so the Beast is also a king is it okay is it okay the beach they have seven heads the seven heads are Kings but the beasts himself is also a king he is number eight the Beast is the eighth King everybody here everybody okay he's the eighth King and he's off the water yeah what are you saying brother Stephen the Bible says that they are seven Kings amen but surely they are eight King everybody okay when you look it's seven Kings but they base himself is a king but the Beast being a king he's the eighth King but he's part of the seven that's why I told you buckle up what are you trying to say brother Stephen brother Branham brother Branham say five Kings which is which was Fallen five Kings if you want that from the history I shall show it to you in other words this King existed brother Branham even gave name but I don't want to go to that detail if you need it you see me later on I can give you the detail brother Barnum said if you want from that that from the history as I show it to you and you also if you want you see me I will show you the quote and one is and one to come now watch the Beast now the Beast was not a king follow me carefully he was one which is which is not and yet he is and is not yet he is and is not what is it a succession of water hopes so right here we are moving from Pagan room everybody okay into a paper room did I lost anybody did I lost anybody glory to God he says succession of the Pope a power Abyss ruling that is when Pagan Rome was converted to make water Apple room Pig and rum was converted and then it became the papacy which they had the Pope in the stead of the king and the pop is a water spiritual King so these were natural King you have to go see them you need the node yes you you will bypass God and everything but the purple normally Italy has like wherever have a president but the pope is not the president yet the prop is a president everybody here but he's not a natural president he's a spiritual King everybody care why because we move from the natural Kingdom into a spiritual Kingdom Babylon is no more Babylon naturally it is a spiritual Babylon which is the woman mystery Babylon everybody okay glory to God brother Branham said that is the reason he's what they're putting a crown on the Pope the pope has a crime he's a spiritual King everybody okay spiritual King claim to be the waters welcome the fight Jesus which is the replacement of Jesus Christ everybody okay where are you going brother Stephen brother Branham say there are seven Kings five are fallen and one is who that's number six brother Branham give you the name and one is to come number seven and when he comes he must continue just a short space you remember what he done Nero burn the city and laid it on the Christian and burn his mother and put his mother on a single tree of the horse and run her through the street he killed his own mother amen and feathers and fiddled while ROM burn and there was and the Beast that was and he's not even is he is what a pagan Rome brought into water purple wrong when they connect the Antichrist Spirit become incarnate and was crowned and was made a clan king of water both in state and Water Church what are you talking about brother Stephen we got seven Kings one two three four five six seven everybody okay the Beast all of these are not your king all of this a human being and they are natural amen Kings everybody okay but there is a nice King I hope you see amen the eighth is now a spiritual King everybody here but he's part of the self in other words he's connected to the seven everybody okay everybody okay what are you trying to say how many churches do we have everybody okay first churches second churches third churches fourth churches 50 changes sex searches seven Church ages how many churches do we have but we also have the brothers [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay but the brand age is part of the seven [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay we got the bright The Edge which is number eight but it is part of the seven it looks like a different age but it's an edge within an edge it is a king within a king so he can have number eight we also have numbers [Music] everybody okay did I lost anyone did I lost anyone job to verse uh 12. and the Tenon which I saw how many kings 10 Kings Ten Kings which have received no Kingdom as yet but receive power as king one hour with the Beast we know that's the power of communism everybody okay they have one mind and shall give their power and strength to the Beast amen they shall make war with who the lamb now we found that that these ten horns everybody care are also Kings but we found out they were giving one power one hour which they called The Dictator you remember and it's the power of communism amen what I want to show you here is communism will also make word to Jesus Christ I mean everybody okay it will make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of Lord and king of King and there in other words Revelation 19 king of King Lord of Lord amen and they that are with him are called chosen they are called and chosen and they are water faithful so the lamb also coming with his wife just like the key the beasts also have his wife everybody okay the beasts work with his wife the lamb also cannot go himself he must go with his wife everybody okay we imagine the beasts everywhere seven we got seven ten we got ten seven Mountain we got seven mountains Indian and I wish we got Indian and Irish you got the eight we got an eight you coming with your husband we also coming with her husband everybody okay everybody okay one is the beast when are these 10 King making war with us brother Branham brother Branham says that he quoted the scripture he said now when I read this sometimes my heart lived for joy all right when I think of how that we are living here in the water brother means happy he's not depressed saying oh my God this last day are bad I wish we can go to heaven no brother Branham say I'm happy the last day have come sure I'm even joyful I'm excited when things get bad I'm so happy why are you happy why is there nothing you're singing everybody okay everybody okay he says these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them there come the water that was Armageddon ready for water the Millennium so brother Branham say this sin here will happen at the border of Armageddon everybody okay so according to brother Branham in the battle of Armageddon we will be fighting with Russia slow down and let that sink let me help you up again we will be fighting with communists the Beast the bear the bread and Armageddon what is going on pastor I'm Plato take your seatbelt let's go everybody okay everybody okay we know that the bear destroy Babylon and God promised according to Jeremiah and according to Isaiah that I'm gonna reuse that Spirit again to destroy not old Babylon but the Babylon does sit upon many orders which is the Babylon of the end time which is Mystery Babylon which is the woman called Jezebel everybody clear so far now when God promised to do that we have to detect where is Babylon we found out that Babylon was in those two beasts because the Devil incarnated Himself in Revelation 13 in the first business day then we found later on in Revelation 13 that there is another Beast America which at the beginning started very good like a lamb but after a while America turned into speaking like the dragon in other words the dragon that was in Rome made way to America thank you everybody okay and how did we know the dragon sat on America we saw two property two prophecies separated happened at the same time and next Catholic President and a woman wearing purple telling you that wrong now is not setting in but ROM is in the cabinet everybody okay when Rome is in the cabinet you follow me something happened Russia Rose and attack Ukraine while we're dealing with Russia china Rose you don't know you don't know check your news China is trying to make war with Taiwan just that Putin is attacking Ukraine China also want to launch an attack why is United State triggering something in Russia and triggering something in China we okay we okay brother Branham listen to us the Lord do what I predicted how many curtains in the name of the Lord there is one called the water which is water Russia is Russia a walk is put in working watch Red China that shall be the water they are horrible can I continue so when you see Russia rising up today and you see China Rising up today they don't do it by just accident [Applause] everybody I'm saying watch three of them when the purple curtain Rose in America Russia stick his head up and one Russia is sticking his head up China in other words the three curtains are telling you we are here United Way they are calling in other words when they call for them one say present do you know when the teacher call you in school they say Kalima you say here they say God you say here they say John brother they say here so when America say here Russia have to answer to God here shall not have to say here modern events are made clear by what but watch that purple curtain that is rising well the United States and water over the world the Roman water Empire the water coolest of them all why because this one gets drunk with the blood of the center everybody okay remember in the name of the Lord do what my brother get away from me get away I don't hear this microphone you can put it up get away from it come away from anything that is water flee to the Rock the coming of the Lord is water when you see Russia worth in his hand Shanna waves in his hand Rome worth in his hand Jesus is about to come any question any question what does this have to do with Armageddon [Music] we know that Russia according to prophecy to destroy the Beast Russia will destroy birth of this Beast he will drop an atomic bomb in Rome and drop an atomic bomb in America but this Russia that is destroying this Beast is not a Christian Russia remember last week amen Russia have two Spirits it is not the realm of Russia but it is the bear and the bear is atheistic the bear is ungodly the bear is unto God that's why brother Brian I'm saying he's horrible that's why after a while that same bear will try to make war with God everybody okay so if God have to destroy the first destroy the second what will happen to the bear foreign does God want to keep an evil spirit he want to get rid of it he give him a dirty job when he finished he take him and slay the evil spirit how does that happen you ready now thank you Jesus this great first battle that was ever thought begin why in heaven thank you Jesus when Micah and his Angel thought so there is a battle that starts first before anybody before even sin started in the Garden of Eden the trouble never started in the Earth the trouble started in heaven that trouble didn't start just in the air the banner that started in heaven that battle started in a specific place or in a specific location and that location is heaven everybody okay follow carefully brother Branham says when Michael and his Angel fought against Lucifer and his Angel he first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on Earth he originated in heaven and then he was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on water human beings then the batter from Angel became water a human battle so this battle here was Angelic battle everybody okay and these angels are not myth they are not imaginary they are real angels in other words there was a physical battle that happened between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil in heaven he was a physical battle that happened in heaven amen this battle moved from heaven and dropped to the Earth and it becomes a human battle everybody okay brother Branham says that then the battle from Angel became human battle and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he had set and come to destroy it that is what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle begin here on water Earth in US this battle in heaven was within a certain location and the people were fighting the angel of Satan and the angel of God Michael and Lucifer were fighting but when this mother get into the Earth instead of this battle being outside of us this father got within us are you following me the battle became inside this battle was outside [Music] brother Stephen why do we need to know about this battle what is important about this battle brother Branham says this what is it it is going right back the way he did he started well in heaven it's coming to the water and some battle the first thing in heaven was about Lucifer was kicked out and come to the Earth then he polluted them then he's been polluted ever since and now from the battle in heaven is coming to the battle on Earth and it is to be water finished on Earth at the water in the Battle of water Armageddon stop I'm going slowly okay my friend so right here what is armageddon are we okay are we okay sin the first father introduced sin so we must finish sin somewhere [Applause] everybody okay are you following me so I might get them can you give me my time can you give me time so Armageddon Armageddon is the finishing are you following me let me put it this way Armageddon is the ending they're finishing their completion they're capping the Fulfillment of the battle that start from heaven [Music] this battle started and never stopped but somewhere we gotta put an end to the battle so to finish the battle to stop the battle to complete the battle to fulfill the battle to cap the battle the cupping of that battle is Armageddon amen everybody okay glory to God brother Barnum said not anyone knows that the battle started in heaven holy so they kicked him out Michael and his Angel overthrow him was run out when this battle started in heaven you were there [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you were in the side of Michael to his Lucifer amen and you and you're become Lucifer everybody okay then youth if I come down and destroy your grandpa Adam so we need to come back and just Lucifer where he is in order to deal with Lucifer amen and to remind him you remember what we did in heaven [Applause] can I continue glory to God brother Branham say and when they did he dropped right down to Eden and here start the battle down there he says now the battle started where in heaven it shall be finished what on Earth in the water [Music] everybody okay everybody okay glory to God brother Stephen but when a battle is delivered there is a principle that goes with the battle you don't fight just anyway this message this message my friend take everything leave me the message and the message will create everything amen [Applause] foreign [Music] Church he says before any battle can be put anyway they first have to find the water leading ground or a water place I have wet the water have to be watered it must be a water selected because originally the battle started at the location [Music] amen so if we need to finish the battle we must find the location where we and Lucifer have to meet everybody okay Amen brother Branham says like when Israel went to war with the Philistine there was a hill on each side where they gathered and that is where Goliath came out and called to the army of Israel that is where David met him in the water so Israel over there Phil is staying over there bring a champion so Goliath came down and the other came down so we all so must find the place well we gonna drop down and say Lucifer let's meet now everybody okay God of Adam say there has to be a personality there has to be a water neutral ground and no mainland they fight here at this place they just don't one fight here in one day and one run of it there has a Battlefront where they meet and they do what just the powers when I was in heaven I was not a human being yet I fought Lucifer as a spirit now now I become human being I bypass my theophany I need to go back with Matthew then I need to fight Lucifer to test Lucifer again when I'm a human being [Music] [Applause] [Music] in other words Lucifer I fought you when I was his Spirit now I might fight you when I am human amen let this stop power again [Applause] my God he says when they test their power where each Army do after strange and guess what another and maybe water because when the father start here it was physical when we get to the Earth to human being he became on inside because what brother Branham saying that when this great battle started on Earth they had to be a mutual meeting place they had to be a place selected for the battle to begin for the battle to rage and that Battleground begin in water the human mind there is where the battle started the human man was chosen for the place of what battle where he was he was begin and that is because that decision are made from water the mind this mind this mother was in the mind that's start in heaven was not in the mind he has a location amen so we must find a place where we and Lucifer gonna find ourselves there and I take my shirt off Lucifer take his shirt off everybody okay let's go to revelation 16. I'm good in time my friend Lord help me Hallelujah if you dare you can say amen amen Revelation 16 verse 12. some are still turning their pages revelation 16. if you dare you can say amen amen anybody here verse 12 and the sixth Angel poured out his vow upon the Great River water Euphrates and the water the rough was dried up that the way of water the Kings so we found out that there is a river called Euphrates and when they pour the valve he made where he opened the highway what is the purpose of the highway the highway is for the Kings plural plural Kings which Kings we'll find out for the kings of the East the king of the East who are the king of the East for the king of the East might be prepared and I saw three and clean Spirit you remember this now you remember them we went through recently like frog came out of the dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mass of a false water so we got a trinity there if you remember we got the Dragon you remember that you got the Beast and you remember and the one is the water the false prophet amen and then for they are the spirit of devils working water Miracles you see why you have to be careful which go forth to the king of the Earth amen and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of God who oh my God so Lucifer you remember this happened before the opening of the seals so Lucifer is already recruiting people amen for the battle he's using Spirit to deceive the people and get them in their Camp God also is recruiting [Music] the prayer spirit they approach you do miracle and convince you God also approaches the same way he does miracle bring healing and catches his belief so the message of the hour is going all over the world recruiting the army of God the soldier and luciferosa is recruiting his Soldier so everybody is busy now everybody here so when God come he look he say by the Benjamin Maddy Men of Valor Benjamin say me might be made of hollow I don't have anything he said Gideon you don't know who you are when I call you Mighty Men of Allah don't look at yourself I know what is in you [Music] I know not people just like that I seen something in you that you don't know because you are still under Amnesia but I will teach you who you are amen foreign [Applause] when you look at them the first picture you see them like this after a while you see them like this where did the muscle came from they put exercise and keep giving them food they keep access putting them food tomorrow try your today trial those are exercising but what you don't see the six pack are coming up the six pack are coming up the six pack have come now I've after a while you begin to walk like this you're not afraid afraid of what Jesus is Alive [Applause] you used to cry all the time now it looks like you don't cry anymore when trial come you say Satan you back in the wrong door you came in this house you're gonna go out what happened the muscles are building yeah [Music] can I continue oh I wish I have three hours buddy let's go to verse 15. I'll come as a water when God is talking about Armageddon he bringing his coming as a thief [Music] they're coming as a fifth is in the age of Luther God said I will come as a thief he promised that in it let's continue if blessed is he that what watches and keep his water damn it lest he walk how naked and the sea water which age did God spoke about nakedness so this prophecy this battle belonged to the people that are going to which age [Music] everybody okay everybody okay so this prophecy have to happen when God is emphasizing about being close so that your nakedness doesn't show up so it goes a prophecy that goes towards you need Scripture you see me I'm trying to skip that job 2 verse 16 and he gathered them together in a place called in Hebrew tongue water everybody okay now everybody okay now watch what happened and the Seven Angels he never pour His Valiant he was keeping his vow until everybody get to him again and the Seven Angel make sure you watch your scripture pull out his vow into the air everybody here whenever Bobby is John together then he prays Val in other words he anointed the place so the battle can be really yummy everybody okay Indian and there came a great voice out of the Temple amen from the throne saying it is what done and then were voices let me drop down quickly to to verse uh 18. uh let's go to 18. and there were voices and Thunder's enlightening and there was a great water earthquake such as was not seen what was not cease men were upon the Earth somebody an earthquake and so great and the great city was water divided into how many particles three parts and the City of the nation fell and great Babylon came to remembrance before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fairness of his wife and every answer every island fled away and the mountain were not fun and they fell upon men a great hell out of Heaven every stone about the weight of a talent 100 pound and Men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hell for the plague thereof was what exceeding what great everybody okay what are you trying to say here what are you trying to say here now we found out by the scripture that Armageddon is also a specific place amen it's a place also it's a location and the battle is going to be physical because the battle that started started physical he have to end up physical everybody okay brother Branham says this that now we found out that the angel poured out his vowel upon the Euphrates even and dried up that the king of water where did Brother Branham get the King of the North the Bible said the Kings of the East brother Branham said the King of the North let me just put it there the King of the North and brother Branham came who is the King of the North today Russia by the battle continue he said I think what that will actually be will be at the end time when they come into water Armageddon they have to come run down through what Egypt how can Russia come to Egypt he likes they have to come through Egypt but the Bible say they also have to cross water Euphrates relax brother brother said write down through them countries they shall have to cross the water to get in water so somehow there will be people crossing Euphrates and some will come from the way of Egypt all coming to the battle of Armageddon where is that place Armageddon where is it happy man everybody okay brother Brandon say now then you Freight this evil is made is is when this made way for it to come down see making way for the king of the north to come down the water you see now brother Bradham goes to plural so in other words brother brother me selling you that among these Kings one of the king is the King of the North to Russia we okay now and that shall take place during that time of the battle of Armageddon in the water last days glory to God brother Branham from the four corners of the earth they gathered them gathered them to water Armageddon gather them together to the great day of the battle of the Lord now on this mixed color which is the Pale Horse wibbly Pearl siglos just think of it you know that is a bad thing now watch where he gathered them from the four corners of the earth they are gathering now for the water Showdown The Showdown will be a water Armageddon so Armageddon is not only a capping not only a finishing not only a fulfilling not only an ending but he's so sorry shutdown we gotta finish the deal they are finished mother we gotta finish it everybody okay everybody okay now this battle in heaven starting a specific place a specific location on the earth a specific place a specific location call Armageddon but where is Armageddon brother the Bible says in Hebrew chapter 12 that by year come on to water Mount Zion and to the city of water the water Heavenly Jerusalem to an innumerable company of what angels then it's not not just heaven and that seed in heaven is called Jerusalem this is where you got Angels everybody okay do the general assembly of the Church of the water so that's why you were in in heaven your church didn't start here you were already in church in heaven in Jerusalem amen which are written well in heaven before the foundation of the world and to God the judge of all and to the spirit of just men made perfect brother pranam say in the scripture we got a Jerusalem the church has it is in heaven a Heavenly water Jerusalem where who God is God Lucifer started the battle in heaven and in heaven the battle started when Jerusalem was [Music] everybody okay if prophecy repeated itself everybody okay everybody okay if history resolve itself so if this battle must be also fought we must save this battle in the place called Jerusalem [Music] foreign that's a deduction chill out everybody okay the Bible say in Revelation 20. everybody okay the Bible say when the Thousand Years expired this is after 1000 years follow me carefully after 1000 years Satan shall be loose out of his prison everybody okay and he shall go out and do water relation which are in the four corners of water yes to water God and Magog after a thousand years we found a place also called Gog and Magog so there is another battle call what the dog and Magog so we got a battle called Armageddon we got a battle called go again what is going on between Armageddon and gargant Magog brother the Bible say to gather them to the battle the number of whom is as the sand of water if this battle is again the devil recruiting people to fight against God this battle must be also in a specific location if the first battle happened in Jerusalem and we are supposing that Armageddon happened in Jerusalem so go again Magog by prophecy being revolved must also happen in Jerusalem the Bible says and they went up on the breath of the earth and compassed the camp of descent about the water what is the Beloved city called Jerusalem so God get my God happen in Jerusalem the greatest battle the first father in Jerusalem where is Armageddon happening everybody okay and then fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them follow me carefully and the devil that deceived them was cast into the water you remember the Lake of Fire the second death and brimstone where the water Beast and the water false prophet stop so when the devil is entering the Lake of Fire he sees the Beast and the false prophet how did the Beast and the first prophet got there we okay because the lake of fire if you remember is the second death it destroys the souls and the spirit so that they vanish forever so we won't have any more Devils any more demon amen when they take the devil they put him into the Lake of Fire the Father the devil when he entered there he sees the Beast and the false prophet oh the Trinity of the devil is the Devil Himself the Beast and the false prophet so we found here that God get Magog will finish Satan tonight hey everybody here but we got the Beast and the false prophet but when the devil entered the Lake of Fire he seen the Beast and the false prophet the devil got into the Lake of Fire after a battle we fought in Gog in Magog after the battle we put him in the Lake of Fire but when he entered there he sees the Beast and the false prophet so how did they get there so there must be a battle everybody okay that pick the Beast and the first prophet and put them so there is a battle before God Magog that is gonna take the Beast and the first prophet and put them in the Lake of Fire then go get my God would take the devil and put him in the Lake of Fire so the X battle are two separate battles any question William Marion brother will you please explain how Satan is Born the Thousand Year being loose again for the battle in Revelation 20. you there that is not the Battle of water Armageddon everybody okay everybody okay amen you see how brother Branham is scripture that is not the battle of Armageddon the battle of Armageddon take place oh all right when the tribulation period has water indeed I love the message now what relation does this have with the Battle of water how many relations no [Music] no so it is still separate battle the Battle of God in my God the chief prisoner is the devil we take him Rectify but when we put him in the Lake of Fire two prisoners are already there how did they get there if they if the devil got there after a battle there must be a battle that took the false prophet and the Beast and put them into a prison everybody okay one is the Thousand Year on the other side and the other one is the end of the water Thousand Years the one is before the thousand years is Armageddon and the one after the thousand years is because it's taking care of the Trinity of the devil everybody okay now as mentioned in the fourth seal will God get mad dog be gathered from people of the new Earth Satan was lose out of the prison and went to gather the people the wicked and bring them to this place and God Ran fire and brimstone out of heaven and they were consumed see it is water [Music] all together what are you trying to say let's go to revelation 11. I'm almost there I'm gonna go straight oh God help me let's go to revelation 11. if you dare you can say amen amen if I get to Revelation 11 14 19 and move on to Ezekiel then we drop to the airport so

water second world war and now it's ready for water and it is the birth pen again it is in Batman again and there is one thing that can bring peace that is who Christ Amen brother Branham he said we talk about we talk about several the world and rumors of war and fee days and fee days and three days it shall finally wind up into the great battle of what Armageddon and that shall be there last of it when she come to the battle of Armageddon that said that the whole thing just before the water great Millennium everybody okay Armageddon is to clean off the Earth anybody here the Earth is so dirty we have to live with Jesus Christ for one thousand years we need to clean up everybody okay she purify herself with this atomic blowing and the volcanic ashes and things sink this suck blood of men upon the Earth and sin and cram she sink beneath the earth and the volcanic breaks out again and renew and cleats the Earth for the water that's why God is cremating everything everybody okay but

but here it's bubbling amen what is it Israel in her Homeland waiting for the Messiah the gentle Church the Pentecostal age Luther Wesley and now the Pentecostal age has got lukewarm and spew out of uh spew Jesus out and he's and he's spewing them out right the pentecostolate but just at the end before the world needs to be the show Jesus said as he was in the day's office they're burning again so shall it be in the coming of the waters that the Gentile church will receive the same power the same the same everybody here that's why before they destroyed Sodom with burning we fire energy and turn his back to the congregation giving the son to the congregation about the burning fire that is coming now everybody okay glory to God Amen amen why do we get this job to Revelation 14 quick Lord help me jump to verses into revelation 14. oh God jump to revelation 14. Lord help me Revelation 14 verse 15. I'm gonna I'm gonna skip most of them you can read it at home job to verse 19. amen verse 90. the Bible says and the angel trusts in his sickle into the Earth and and gather Divine of the earth and casted into the great wine press of the wrath of God and death wife's friend and the one press was trodden out of the city and blood came out of the out of the wine Prince even to the horse is what brother by the space of a dozen and 600 600 Furlong so this Blood people will die so much until blood will come up and our horses will smell the blood of the people go to revelation 19. I'm gonna run quickly go to Revelation 19. if you dare you can say Amen verse 1 and after these things I heard the great voice of many people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power to the Lord are for our God for true and righteousness and righteous are his judgment for he has judged the great whole which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication and has Avenged the blood of his servant at his hand amen and again they say hallelujah and her smoke rose up forever and ever jump to verse 11. I'm gonna we already went through this but let me jump skip something and jump to verse 17. you already know we're coming with Jesus in the Army if you dare go to verse 17 and I saw an angel standing in the Sun and cry with her voice saying to all the fowl that fly in the midst of Heaven Come and gather yourself together to the supper of who so Evangel is standing on the sun before the Bible study he's calling the bird he said Bird come I have steak prepare for you we're gonna be burning some steak here we're gonna kill some people God have a supper for you come from everywhere you're gonna eat the Flesh of the people everybody okay remember the Beast and the first prophet Gathering to the Lake of Fire before the devil how did they get that everybody okay job to verse 18. and that you may eat the Flesh of water the kings that was deceased by the spirit of frogs and the Flesh of the captain and the Flesh of the mighty and the Flesh of the horses and them that sit on them and the Flesh of all men brought free and born both small and what great because everything will be destroyed and I saw the water these everybody okay and the king of the earth and the Army gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his water so in Armageddon Russia would not be the only one there the best also will be there my dad or the Beast the bear the bride and Armageddon we okay job to first uh 20. and the Beast was taken in that battle and with him the water false prophet that wrote Miracle before him which well with which he deceived them that received the mark of the beast and them that worshiped the Beast these both were cast into the water burning with water and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which sword proceedeth out of his mouth and the file which were and and all the files were filled with the water we see after this battle that the Beast and the false prophet are taken captive so we kill everything and we capture the Beast we capture the false prophet and we put them all the way into the Lake of Fire everybody okay then we start enjoying our honeymoon for one in one day which is a thousand years after the honeymoon we free the devil then we take the devil and we put him also in the Lake of Fire where the Beast and the first prophet are everybody okay now everybody okay now that is the Battle of what Armageddon so the Battle of Gogan Magog take the prisoner of that battle is Satan the dragon but the Beast and the prophet are the prisoner of Armageddon everybody okay let's run quickly now so we can go to the airport why do they burn them why do they eat their flesh why is blood coming up because we're dealing with Jezebel and since history repeats itself we must see how did Jezebel die in the Old Testament can I continue can I continue brother Branham say after death the dead body where he started he said in second king throw her down Jezebel so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled to the world and on the water the blood of Jezebel went to the horses if we coming on Armageddon we all will deal with Jezebel the blood of the people must touch our horse because history prophecy he beats itself everybody okay he said and he showed her on the water remember the trotting on the foot and when he was coming he did eat and drink jihu and say go now go see now this cursed woman and bury her for she is the king donor and they went to bury her but they found water no more of her than what and water and water who ate Jezebel why is the Angel calling people for the beasts he said come and eat the flesh because we're dealing with another Jezebel somebody must eat human flesh wherefore they came again and told him he said this is the word of the Lord which he spoke by the servant who Elijah why does Elijah have to come back in the end time because there was a jezebel how are you blind every time Jezebel come a larger mask [Music] everybody okay and then the teacher saying in the portion of Jesus shall water eat the Flesh of who and the carcass of Jezebel shall be as water upon the face of the field in the person or in a portion of water so that he shall they shall not say this is who they gotta kill and eat her let's go quickly after death brother brought them say their bodies are destroyed by wild beasts you know that that is true like this had the type of food Jezebel brother Branham explained he said they ask him a question explain blood on the horse's brother brother Branham say Brothers beat the Armageddon the Bible predicted that in the last day he will trap Catholicism romanism and all them communism and all of them together in the valley of because Armageddon means the valley the hill of megido he will get them into a megido he get the bear he get the Beast he bring all of them in Armageddon there until there will be such a Slaughter amongst them until the blood will water from the horses brother everybody okay we are just fulfilling prophecy everybody okay brother Branham said then I just heard you all repeat it over keep your eyes on who remember that keep your eyes on who she will wind up in water and then it all won that finally in water so the bear and the beasts are together we work together coming back for a fight remember it shall all wind up in Catholicism in the end time that is exactly right I'm gonna zero it into the airport I gotta skip some of them amen and that is the battle of Armageddon right over here when Christ come who himself what are you talking about brother Stephen we will the prophecy of Ezekiel 38 I can go with you through the scripture but I'm skipping because of time we can do that maybe in the question and answer everybody okay will the prophecy of Ezekiel 38 and 39 be fulfilled before the rapture back all up my friend back all up my friend amen I think not I think the next thing we're looking for is the rapture of the church then what when God get Magog comes down is water this God get my God is not the god of my God after the millennium because prophecy only repeats itself everybody okay everybody okay write the Army coming down amen will Ezekiel 38 and turn it down come to pass before the rapture Ezekiel 38 and 39 deal with whom [Music] the water because in Ezekiel you're gonna see the talking about the not the the the King of the North coming up amen but after the Millennium everything will be killed no Russia nothing we kill everything everybody okay I do not say that this is correct but to my way of teaching it it come to pass after the Rapture after the church is water God deals with God and my god when they come down before Israel I have the scripture and think that it will come to pass after the water Rapture but that is my way of teaching it I suppose that is what they want to know what Madea was everybody okay what are you talking about Daniel is giving this assurance of the end of the Gentile dispensation when you go home tomorrow read Daniel 11. you can see how the King of the North is coming down which is nothing else but water like a water and the great battle of Armageddon will be fought right there near the Gate of water because the first battle started where God get mad God will Saturn and what do you think Armageddon would start where Elijah Moses were killed everybody okay everybody okay now let's Wonder go to uh Daniel 11. then I go to the airport I have to come back with Ezekiel let's go to Daniel 11. Lord help me yeah we gotta Wonder put your seat belt and we're gonna head to the airport glory to God amen you there Daniel 11 go to verse 40. if you're there you can say Amen you there brother Brandon said he's coming like a werewood and at that time of the end shall the King of the South push at him and the King of the North shall come against him like a water this is what what Brahm says with Chariot and with Horsemen remember these people are seeing our weapon but they don't have the vocabulary amen with horses and with many sheep and he shall enter into the countries and shall also flow and pass over so he's wiping everything like a locust he shall enter also in the water glorious way glorious land which is the land of Israel that's why brother Branham said he will be fought in near Jerusalem everybody okay because the first battle started over there Jerusalem Jerusalem Jerusalem and many countries shall be overthrown by Russia but there these shall Escape out of his hand even Edom and Moab and the chief of the children of Ammon everybody okay and he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries and the land of Egypt shall not Escape you see why he's coming from Egypt and but he has but he shall have power over the Treasure of God and of silver and over there all the precious the precious things of Egypt and of the Libyan you see why they're coming from Egypt amen and of a champion you see where they're coming and shall be at his step but turning out of the East and out of the North shall trouble him when Russia is attacking everything therefore he shall go forth with great Fury to destroy and to orderly to make war with many amen and he shall plant the Tabernacle of his Palace between the sea in the glorious holy mountain Russia will go right there on Israel with color Fury everybody okay yet he shall come to his end and None Shall happen what is Russia going attacking turnaround and go to Israel what is he looking for in Israel everybody okay buckle up so we go brother Branham say the world but after all he speak like a beast like a dragon an exercise all the power of the Dragon did before him a bitter religious persecution we are near that town you remember church that you are living in the best day that you ever live in right now until Jesus comes it's not the worst day it is the best day anybody here don't be crying amen he shall gradually not gradually but rapidly get water waste and waste when Russia goes down there to get water everybody okay look out that is all she need that is what the prophet said he will do does Israel have oil yes Deuteronomy 33 verse 24 and of Usher he said let Usher be blessed with children let him be acceptable to his presence and let him deep his water in the water Asha was under the eagle anointing that shoe shall be water and water so in Israel we don't only have oil but we also have minerals cannot continue everybody okay the Lord that God bringing thee into a good land Israel and land of Brooks and water fountain and depths of spring all out of the Valley Hill a land of wheat a land of Bali and Vine and fig tree and pomegranate and land of olive life oil uh olive oil or and honey a land where we disha that shall eat bread without scarceness that shall not like anything in it a land who's stronger water another who's healed a land which the Lord that God cares for the eyes of the Lord their God are always upon it from the beginning of the year until the water so the land of Israel is a Richland why are you saying that the material is there the Jews will reach then the same thing will pollute their Camp again they shall come right down the cities of the world Russia will come down say well just got to have that stuff that is what what do you do with uranium what do you do with you anymore atomic bomb and everything down there we got to get that and as they go down then we'll be the Battle of water that shall be when God will stand like he did in the valley for the children of Israel and fight again but it shall take place but that shall take place until the gentle dispensation will be watered when the time when that time is finished is what so we found out that the battle of Armageddon that started in heaven and that is finishing up on the earth he's gonna be fought in Jerusalem and that battle evolved Rome the Beast involved the false prophet involve Russia and not only involve those people but the bride that Jesus Christ will also feasting on that battle everybody okay everybody okay but we remember in the Old Testament that we have three kingdom we have three kingdom we have the kingdom of Babylon which was a lion we okay we have the Kingdom of Middle passion which was a bear okay be careful I'm dropping to the airport we have the kingdom of the leopard which was the Greek Empire okay and that was a great military servant amen all those Kingdom will wind up into one which is the Beast of Revelation 30. but we found a man by the name of David I show you this before I'm gonna make my point what happened in David David said that that servant slope of what and what everybody okay and this uncircumstance what Philistine which is a mighty military man it shall be as water one of them the Lord that deliver me out of the power of water the lion out of the power of water will deliver me out of the end of water and we found out that the first kingdom was a lion the second was a bear the third was a great military man Alexander the Great and David killed the lion and he killed the bear and the third person he killed was a mighty military man by the name of Goliath so whatever was happening in the life of David was a son to what God would do as the son of David [Music] everybody okay because the Bible says that man and present let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch Who David here but that he was both dead and buried and his Sepulcher is with us unto this day therefore being a what prophet who was a prophet so David was a prophet and the prophet is a son are you following me so what David the prophet is doing naturally it is a son of what God will do spiritually down the road David killing the lion will stop it was typifying Jesus Christ killing Babylon everybody okay David killing the bear was typifying Jesus Christ killing the second Kingdom David killing Goliath stupefying Jesus Christ killing the third Kingdom in other words the three killing of David spoke of Jesus Christ so a prophet do stuff in his life everybody okay everybody okay that is a message amen for what God because they did it naturally but now we are the Fulfillment now God have to fulfill what David gave us a type Hallelujah why are you saying that why are you saying that brother Branham say I saw a vision that morning was why the problem a prophet yes I saw a vision that morning and I seen a large animal laying on the side of the Hill anyone he had the water a memo set of water I was hunting a trip in the vision I got all along about which hours everybody okay and I sleepover and shut that animal so it's One Vision brother Brian I'm sorry anymore and shoot that animal and kill that animal everybody okay then following that animal in the vision came another animal and this Vision happened brother Barnum killed both animals and he took them to his home and brother Branham laid buff animals on his home until today if you go to the house of brother pranam you're gonna see these two animals Landing can I continue can I continue what are those animals [Music] can I continue break the second animal and then I seen them take the horn and a little re let me go here and then on the road back a mammoth big water grizzly bear raise up against me and I did what shut him foreign saw one Vision but in that vision is killing two animals and he went and it happened the first animal he killed was a deer everybody okay and the second animal he killed was a bear why does God have to take a vision and give his Prophet a vision of killing a deer and killing a bear what does that Vision have to do with us why does God let David kill a lion don't kill a bear then kill a military man what does he tell you cannot continue can I continue brother Branham says this that and then I seen them take the water the Horn of the first animal everybody okay and then leave the hand reach and get the water put the
