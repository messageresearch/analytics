and those that are on the prayer list Lord God we claiming it all done in Jesus name we pray amen and amen hallelujah no just an opportunity to stand here I guess y'all have to get some tilapia and rice tonight huh the red snapper is getting a break but uh same Holy Ghost right so you we want the Lord to have his way by the grace of God at just a way of a little testimony before we get started we have one brother he's he was from Florida and um he was incarcerated for uh it's been 14 years and I finally got the set free to this month and he had been innocent he was innocent and um it's amazing his testimony and he had seven years on death row he was facing death row and he kept telling me he was innocent and then somehow they got him back here and uh got thrown in and he had to sit for about seven years here it just doesn't work like that they set you free like that but anyway that's the system and um I just wanted to thank you I know I may have brought his name up but uh thank the Lord for him and he can get there and get back with his family by the grace of God Amen so I won't keep you standing but um let's go to Joel chapter 2. and um tell you so y'all have to forgive me if I'm in and out around working around being born again I've been kind of working that with this saint so uh you pray pray with me but we're gonna try to hit the spots surface on this thought here I was looking at another way but then I see how the devil was was just raging and um I want to read this scripture here and I better follow the leadership of the Lord Joelle chapter 2 verse 25 he says and I will restore to the years that the locusts have eaten the canker worm the caterpillar and Palmer worm my great Army which I send among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that he had dealt wonderously with you and my people shall never be ashamed amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word I'm gonna read verse 23 also you may be seated and he says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he have given you the what the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you that wasn't for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month Hallelujah you know this is the hour sanctum you know we're looking around we see the prophecies coming forth but you know what it won't be long we out of here you know what I mean you can see it heating up you see the battle heating up but you know I wanted to reach something here before we go there into the scriptures you know but our topic was you know the Lord will protect his season and then I want to say I will you know that's what I've been working with I will restore I will you know when you look around there and it's just a simple little word that but it's powerful when and who it's coming from when it's coming from God and God say I will you know you can claim it Saints you can grab a hold of it you don't have to worry about it all you have to say are God said I will is that right so that's what we was bringing them into this hour here now you know that's a future promise is that right so we're talking about here and I want you I wanted to look at this here by the grace of God because I um got the uh little inspiration here and um if you're writing it down and those that are home of course I don't have the board now so y'all gonna have to bear with me don't look better though I got my little computers here so y'all keep praying for me he said now it's 4 22 62. this quote here coming out of I guess uh I'm gonna say paragraph 80 let's see 85. yeah and get over there we'll look at 84. he says uh I want to look to restore restore means to bring back a claim can be enforced now to bring anything back to its rightfully owner you see that's what happened in the garden you know Satan thought he was going to get the rights is that right but when he deceives even Adam you know but we know that the abstract title deed had to go back to the original owner is that right because God had a plan and the plan that God had he had to restore things back God somebody hit it before the foundation of the world because we're talking tonight we the predestinated Sea of God uh that's who we're talking about tonight uh we getting into something come on bride up Satan is attacking up we get ready to send Satan back we getting ready to send them back we belong he's trespassing he's touching our families touching our children touching our job touching our finances we get ready to set him back God's giving us the word tonight [Applause] yeah yes my brother yes sir touch God's right no no no no no no no no no no no no no no God said I shall restore the power and the cake it were in the caterpillar locals have eaten any religious spirit he said now look he said anything back into its rightfully owner he said where it belongs he said therefore some way it went away from its rightfully owner and can wander around anywhere but to restore is to bring back to it who really owns it ah we come from God we go back to God we got a father that lovers we gotta father that own everything we got a father a good creator her Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done [Applause] and he chose his elect his predestinated seed he said look he said that you should bring back in order to bring it back to its natural state where it was at the first time he said bring it back to his natural condition in order to do this we have a right to what enforce it you got right to enforce it you ain't got a right to speak the word you got the right to is that right we claiming nothing Hallelujah yeah what do you say sister This Means War huh huh we wrestling out against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rules in high places but Satan yeah he's sending his demon for it he got a an army but what the Lord tell us put on the whole armor of God a high sister to you baby would stand against the Wild against the trickery against Satan in the same time [Applause] he said look it's the word of God don't know

trouble now ah [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] he said like if anybody stole some property he said his likes help me Lord he said look he says to bring it back to his natural state where it was at the first time bring it back to its natural condition and in order to do this you have a right to enforce and you'll see the Holy Ghost will back you huh you mix it with faith the holy you have a right is that right Satan is trespassing and when he's trespassing because our God is that right he has restored everything back in his hour here now he has restored the perfect word uh of bringing it in this hour here now Saints Hallelujah he said like if somebody stole some property and they're holding the property captive he says then you can take the law and go into this person see and the law what forces it see we have a law is that right if you're worried abide in me and I abide in you whatever you had you can receive is that right come on Saints we're going to put him on the run you know

this person to restore this property back to his natural owner into his liability of a state is that right he said I shall restore who said to them God said in this hour here now God brought you God saved you I was telling the brothers then there he promised them what is that you must be born again is that right if God said you must be born again then God got a word to bring you with back to where use was from the beginning is that right he told him I will do what I will take away only heart I will uh I will give you a heart of Flesh I will uh I will do it oh let's look at it let's go to that and just drop down to my spirit let's turn to Ezekiel Tony Ezekiel 36 we coming back Hallelujah once you born again saints come on now you're moving into that predestinated seat done you're the predestinated seat uh we're moving into something Lord just didn't show us about that theophany Sunday for no reason at all we're moving into something Saints he said look what he said huh we're just

whether they win they profound my what her holy name and when they so when they said this to them these are the people of the Lord and our going forth out of what and laying well see you got to be careful because you recognize you got a different character is that right when you go out there and you go in the wrong area the devil recognize who you are he recognized that you don't fit in he recognizes in a character he recognizes something there is that right but you got to recognize who you are we're talking about moving into the bride tonight we're talking about now taking back everything that Satan tried to take from us this is what we're moving in huh hallelujah look what he said he said but I had pity for my what Holy Name verse 21 which the house of Israel have profaned

when we was drunken he thought he has when we was among him he thought he had us when we were smoking weed he thought he had us when we was failing he thought he had us spending but what did God do God hid it he hid this seed right until his right time came is that right he thought he had us in the clubs uh he thought he had us up there racing cars uh but what did he say I slew the Lamb of God

he planted it on the day of what Pentecost is that right he says and he brought that tree there for a purpose he said he wanted it to bear his fruits we're getting somewhere now they're his fruits he said the word right he wanted it to bear his fruit the word ah the restoration I shall restore the word of God again we are not born of the corruptible seed but The Incorruptible seed which is the word of God that's exactly right help me Lord Lord God God's word he wanted a church that would keep his word ah he knew brother Robert and we're going to keep his word he know that you're going to keep his word he saw you that's why he have you here don't worry about your family member if he didn't choose them you stand in the gap for them bring them up in prayer remember them in prayer God has

he said God word he wanted a church that would keep his word all down Through the Ages Neve had failed to to keep it the Jews did fail to keep it the law had failed uh all have failed uh so God planted him a what a tree [Music] well let us keep going he said now remember there was two trees in the garden we know you call them whatever you want to I'ma drop down he said that tree of life come from God the other one it says that one wasn't defiled out of God he said your fathers eat Manna and are dead but this tree you eat and you live for what ever and the angel guarded and the angel guarded that tree of life from the Garden of Eden King he kept it in Eden that tree of life isn't Eden now spiritually speaking he said look he said now when this tree that God planted it was to Bear what nine different kinds of fruit ah ah First Corinthians 12 is it he said now look he said that was God's tree hey don't y'all be ashamed you got to get consecrated you got to get a prayer life uh those gifts are in here God put it in his church God is going to manifest everything before we leave here because we have to restore the full word has to come back again is that right because Christ is here in spirit form Holy Ghost back on the scene again Hallelujah you gotta understand when he came down there he had that one signer they have to realize that sign that had to come to the Gentiles is that right people had to tell the church the other week it got over there what the Holy Ghost tell them they wanted to knock that picture they want to knock about him telling your spirit's moving around here we got to teach you how to fight you got to know to have the enemy going to come at you when the enemy come in like the flood God promised to lift up and standing against it I wonder what did he say I want to take a picture is that right if I want to take that picture and I call the brother up here to take a picture with me that's my picture I'm inviting him that's god's picture it's a balance you got to see what's moving you got to see what's moving in this message right now you better be able to discern those spirits but God said I'll send you a Sinai we're no longer on the Leviticus signer I'll send you mail because of that God this generation needed to see that sign of God came on use that body I told him never to smoke or drink or defile that body yeah I got to use that body for the last Sinai to let them know that the Messiah is back on the land again uh in spirit for Holy Ghost Karma [Music] look what it says always so limited any time he says I'm going to skip I'm at Paris one Army uh 150. paragraph 150. he said now when this tree that God planted it was to Bear nine different kinds of fruit nine different kinds which means nine spiritual gifts nine fruits of the spirit to go with the nine spiritual gifts he says that was God's tree God said I shall restorer see but with the denomination see more of them got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it was the restoration of the gifts is that right but God did not stop there he had another message that's going to come he comment on the Lutheran Wesley's age on Pentecostal ways John but layover Asia but in that lay of the sea it's a bride ages that's right we're in this world but we're not of this world we're way above Pentecost [Music] [Applause] we looking for him to come down take over this body when he said I need you to get up huh that theophany say what I need you to get up uh it's three o'clock in the morning you're having some of y'all experience then you can't lay there you got to get up because your real body's telling you I need you to pray get out somebody need prayer get up [Applause] we're moving into something saying the revelation of the word you're going to walk right out of here is that right huh the revelation of the words to the believer to that bride is that right you're the Bride of Jesus Christ son and he saved the best for last let me keep going I'll show you help me Lord he said I was the tree he says he planted it in the Earth on the day of Pentecost brother random say but that was the Zuzu Street The Upper Room experience that was azuzu Street there that was not what we have now we had the Pentecostal experience by what by the opening of the word now bringing us that God and through that opening of the word not just the letter but the spirit we said I shall restore I will give you the former rain I will give you the latter rain I will give you the mechanics I will give you the Dynamics I will give you all because you're my bride paragraph 151 now let's stop always so Limitless he said now I'm going to skip it down a few scriptures paragraph 151 he says and go down here to Psalms Psalms 1. he said David saw this tree ah see Joelle saw the Joelle saw those Church ages he got sold it to him by inspiration so you have to understand that's why the Lord is telling us through the church ages through the bright age and that was the son of God is that right that was the son of God Ministry so he said over there in Revelations 1 and told him about that he went over to Revelations 2 I think the prophet said when he said paps paps was a good garment that a woman that's right Pastor so that indicated it was the bride uh it was the bride through that age is that right it's going to be a collective bride in every Asia they were gonna see her brother in Luther's age we're going to see our brother in Wesley's age we're going to see our brother in Pentecostal age right now what he's saying go hunt My bride is that right you can't hurt them with any food you gotta have spiritual food and do new season [Applause] he said now look Psalms 1. he said David saw this tree a long time ago and of his writing of songs for something what joyful he said that was the first thing he wrote about he saw this tree and it was planted by the what rivers of water look what he said Hallelujah Psalms 1 and he shall be like a what tree God's tree planted where by the rivers of water plural he said the rivers of what water singular ah now the method is about this no uh uh just rivers of one water nine spiritual gifts by The Same Spirit nine fruits of the spirit coming from where at the same channel we moving now come on Saints the same holy ghost in you same Holy Ghost up here and me is the same humble yourself and listen let the Holy Ghost take control of your life Saints we got together we're going to show you we can't let you can't lose he say look uh he said he said he shall be like what a tree that's planted by the rivers of water paragraph paragraph 153 as David saw it he spoke he said blessed is that man and notice he said could not what could not die ah because we're not with it oh sister forgive me I forgot you back then translate hello [Music] Hallelujah he said now he said now and notice he says he said he could not die his leaves were not wither we're moving somewhere now bear with me he said now look he said his leaves were not withered I remember I'm a reason in a minute he said now we're not with her no no matter what they do they'll never kill that tree that's why we say the Lord will protect his seeds they can't do it who knows the mind of God uh who can counsel God uh no one could counsel God is that right I'm so glad he hit it from the wide and The Prudent and revealed to babes that was such learned God hidden in Simplicity and revealed in the same way [Music] he says where is it why why can't he die he says it's where he's playing it that's what what does it is where he's planted he's planted by the rivers of water he said now notice David said his roots won't die oh boy again somewhere now Hallelujah they cannot die he said now look he says he says you know you know you take a treat he said a big old tree and when he said well now I'm gonna drop down a little bit he says and that's the way mockery laughing making fun of a Christian what it does it persecute it shakes the Christian to make him pray more dig down get a better hold so he can do a stand the storm on if somebody come on parents we got to teach them to pray yeah you got to get down and pray with them you got to show these kids about praying son uh here's what you do uh if somebody pick at you if somebody talk about you if somebody laugh at you you just get down there around mama daddy take him to the prayer room uh and tell them about breaking through uh and that's okay let him start praying for about 30 minutes and then if it gets tires tell them to sing his favorite song uh or tell your daughter to sing a favorite song uh but it will take a tree that's planted by the rivers of water and when the enemy come in now the roots go deeper you got to start praying more you got to seek God's face though the Holy Ghost will come and interceding Satan before you get in the car uh always prayer just don't get in there ask the Lord to be with you at all times up he said the angel of the Lord and Camp around them that fear you come on Saint John you recognize how he's coming at you [Music] he said now to make he says now that's the way mockery laughing at you picking at you making fun at you what it does is persecution shakes the what it shakes the Christian to do what to make him pray more Ah that's the solution is that right is that right first you got to realize before you have the Cure you got to know the cause and some people don't want to know the cause of the Cure because first you gotta admit it's a problem somewhere huh what are you talking about with uh I'ma telling brother Steve right now we got around in there we went you want to see your mama look huh you want to see a mama look and I know she love her husband but we went to that emergency room and there was a baby there and she was sitting in there and boy you want to see a stone face on her mama when it's leaving Steve was ready to go and mama was sitting there with that Stone Face making sure my baby was all right we gotta understand what's going on in this hour here now Mama vice versa daddy you don't let nobody both of y'all the parents of that child done you got to see is something wrong if you admitted something wrong then Daddy Mama come together and when you come together because the Bible says uh train up a child in the way that he should go and when he grow old he will not depart from it he just told us we got to pray uh bind those Devils up on whatever demon is coming at you whatever demons coming at your husband whatever demon is coming at your child they're trespassing is that right they chose you uh claim your mama claim your sister they coming in you claim them we're the Bride of Jesus Christ all right [Applause] look what he said he says persecution shake to make him pray dig down to get a better hold on on what he can when the Storm come he said now what if a man is planted in such a thing as by the river who am I where the Springs nine different Springs feeding into him he said what they establishment he has and a man that's planted by the river the rivers of water one water one Spirit there are Gifts of healing Same Spirit Gifts of Prophecy Same Spirit and

Lord and I saw in the Bible where Jacob wrestled all night with the angel order you not only change his name father you gave him a new spirit father so it's the same Holy Ghost Lord but this is the spoken word father over in Acts chapter 10 Lord uh you say that's Peter speak these words uh the Holy Ghost fell upon your children all you had to do is what ask it shall be given seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be open glory be to God our father wants to give it to you more than you can desire it he says now David saw him as he was planted by this tree he could not die any little out
