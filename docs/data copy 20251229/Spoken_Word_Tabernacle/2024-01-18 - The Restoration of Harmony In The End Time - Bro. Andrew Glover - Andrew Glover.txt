things are possible let's just bow our hearts together together for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we come before you this afternoon Lord we thank you for your mercy and your grace that is in so enduring in our lives Lord we fail you so many times we make so many mistakes but Lord your mercy and Grace still stands as an atonement through your blood and father as we come here tonight we are a needy people there's many sicknesses and viruses and germs in the land but Lord we know that you're still a Healer we know you're still a deliver ever oh god father we know you're still a way maker we know you're still that anointing that destroys the Yoke of the enemy so father we're inviting you to come in this meeting tonight in the power of your Resurrection oh God lord may you drive out every

we commit this meeting in our faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we do pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God Rich you bless you this evening if you have your Bibles we'll invite you in your scriptures we want to turn to the Book of Matthew the 18th chapter and while you're turning there tonight we do want to greet you in the name of the Lord we sure count it an honor and a privilege to be here with you once again brother Steven in the church uh we really been looking forward to it it's always a blessing to get to come and fellowship with you good to see brother CLE it's been a few days God bless you buddy and your family and amen we are sure honored tonight to be here with you and we're glad to have brother Judah Martin with us wrote down tonight and amen so it won't be such a a lonely ride back home we'll have somebody talk to but we sure appreciate him for coming and and being here tonight and also bringing greetings from our pastor brother Shawn Martin the Saints there at home send their greetings to you as well so amen we just want to get right in the word tonight in the Book of Matthew the 18th chapter and the 19th verse I know this is a very familiar verse to you but Jesus here speaking said again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven now he's speaking of two places one is Earth and one is heaven if any to agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven now in the Book of John the 15th chapter The Book of John the 15th chapter and the fifth verse uh Jesus here speaking once again in John 15 verse5 and he's actually identifying the Believers as the branches of the vine and in John 15:5 he says I am the vine and ye are the branches now he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing now in the 15th verse he says henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you now it's almost as if he is shifting a dispensation to the believer in the 16th verse he said ye have not chosen me but now I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring fruit and that your fruit should remain and that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it unto you so if any two or three agree is touching anything on the earth it shall be done here he's saying what was done between him and his father is now going to be done between the Believers and his father and if you look in the book of Acts the 2 chapter and the first verse it's a very very familiar reading we'll give you our subject and let you be seated but in Acts the 2 chapter and verse number one my good atmosphere in the building tonight amen Acts chapter 2 and verse one and the Bible said when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the the house where they were sitting we've gone now from the fatherhood dispensation to the sunship dispensation to where now the prophet said it's the Holy Ghost dispensation in the body amen we ask Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word as you can have your seats here uh this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments to speak to you tonight and if I title this tonight I want to speak to you on the restoration of Harmony in the end time the restoration of Harmony in the end time I use that word harmony because I personally believe that there is power in harmony I believe there's power in Harmony and I believe that we can easily take that word power of Harmony amen and exchange it to the power of agreement so where there is harmony there is an agreement and where there is an agreement there is harmony now in the message question answerers 1954 brother BR said the main thing above everything is to keep the church in harmony amen and in love of God and moving on if we can all believe that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin and unrighteousness then if the woman sitting next to you or the man sitting next to you if he doesn't believe that Jesus will actually come visibly again then let's just believe it and go right ahead anyhow we don't agree with him on the scripture but let's make the church move on for harmony because in there we're going to catch some more people amen but when the church is out of Harmony he said then you hurt the church and you hurt the ca so when the church is in harmony amen the power of Harmony has the ability to catch some others amen but when the church is out of Harmony you are hurting the church as well as hurting the cause of Christ again he said I believe that everything in the natural line amen Works in harmony or should with the spiritual in the message the Inside Man let that Faith just meet the condition and it'll be for that thou has said as thou Hast believed in thy heart so shall it be he said and make the whole atmosphere here Lord make it a creative atmosphere of one soul of one mind of one Accord and one purpose amen my heart is so hungry to see that atmosphere see the atmosphere is what brings it if every person here would get in one Perfect Harmony amen it would be settled see like the natural way for an egg to hatch is put it under a h and then it'll hatch because it's the atmosphere it's warm but you just wrap it in a blanket keep it warm it'll hatch anyhow put it in an incubator it'll hatch anyhow amen it's the atmosphere that brings the results amen it's the atmosphere that brings the results amen can I give you one more he said now this person what if you could ever get this Soul on the inside so in harmony with God Amen that your soul and God would be one together amen that your soul and God would be one together then you could ask what you will and it shall be given unto you amen I believe that this is the hour amen that Harmony has been restored to the church I believe that this is the hour that we're not one with a denomination amen we're not one with a system we're not one with a man's idea amen but we are one with a word amen and there is an agreement between the believer on the earth and their father in heaven and they can ask what they will amen and it shall be given unto them amen I believe that God Amen desires Harmony in the church amen I'm going to say this tonight Lucifer hates Harmony amen he despises Harmony amen and he will do anything that he can Amen to see that the harmony is broken amen now I'll say this amen what Lucifer will use is he will use Discord Amen to break up Harmony Lucifer will use Discord to break up Harmony now you all know the Bible says there's seven things that God hates amen and one of them is he that sth Discord among the Brethren now that word Discord means Strife or contention so he that sth Strife amen or contention among the Brethren is a tool in the hand of Lucifer to break the harmony between the Earth and Heaven in other words Prophet said one thing God's hate amen is sowing Discord among the Brethren that's right he said and thems the organizations is what's done it amen organization has SW Discord amen among the Brethren he said we should be standing in the breach amen and saying that we are brothers amen now come on because denomination is divided amen they're divided on Doctrine they're divided on preachers they're divided on groups amen now let me just say it that devil didn't stay out there amen but that devil is trying to creep his way amen right into the ranks of our message amen and divide brothers and divide churches and divide Fellowship amen but I believe in the fatherhood of God and I believe in the Brotherhood of Man and I think that we're brothers together and that's the way we should be amen and God has his children now maybe some of them are a little odd to our belief or your belief or mine amen but God has accepted his children amen so we accept them as our brothers and our sisters now come on church amen cuz not everybody's going to see it the same way not everybody's going to see it like you or see it like me amen but there is one thing that we must see and that is the message of the hour we must see the message of the hour then the message of the hour becomes the basis of our fellowship amen now when you start when you start preaching about Harmony and unity in the body amen the devil raises his head and says well we got so many Revelations and we got so many deep things amen that we don't need to preach on Harmony we don't need to preach on Unity amen but I believe it's more important than we realize I believe that Harmony I believe that Unity is more important than we realize amen amen amen amen amen amen I'm just going to say it amen we must be in harmony or in tune with God Amen to declare the supernatural amen now can can I read you this quote the prophet of God said in the fourth dimension he said people can prove that right through this room now is coming radio activity see there's radio messages coming right through this building now it's coming television pictures but it's too fast for our eyes now you go a million miles beyond that Dimension and you'll go into a place that is just as real as television pictures is in this room this morning he said and there's the Lord Jesus Christ amen the resurrected Son of God standing here and the reason that you cannot see him is because our heart hasn't become tuned amen down to it so it's not that he's not there it's that our heart is not tuned down Amen to pick up what is there amen we're too tuned up to the world and tuned up to what this church is doing tuned up to what that preacher's preaching amen but don't you think it's time Amen to come back to the homeland of the church amen the message of the hour amen and tune our heart up with what a prophet has told what the scripture has spoken what the spirit is revealing what the anointing is manifesting I think it's time Amen to restore the harmony of the spirit of the Living God in the Church of the Living God with the authority of the Living God manif esting the Greater Works of the Living God in this generation amen amen amen amen amen that's the reason that's the reason we can't see television pictures he said that's the reason we can't see them amen is because we are not tuned down to them he said our bodies are not set as instruments to pick up mechanical sent things but when our body becomes in tune with God when our body becomes in tune with God becoming a part of him then our soul can pick up the power of the Holy Spirit to vindicate the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in all of his power and omnipotence listen you don't realize how powerful you are you're not just a church member you are here as an instrument on the earth to declare Another Dimension come on we can see we can taste we can feel we can smell amen but the only way we can declare him is he comes into us and our soul amen will pick up his power our soul will pick up his omnipotence and our soul will declare him as real in this Dimension as he is in that Dimension he said he has risen from the dead he lives among us today and he wants Fellowship back with his people again his great Majesty his glory is now spreading forth and he's Desiring to Fellowship again with his people like he did in the Garden of Eden now in the Garden of Eden you know there was perfect Oneness and the prophet said that perfect Oneness amen is God and His creation amen God speaking lit to ear amen perfect Oneness is God and His Creation in Fellowship amen hearing directly what he has to say to the creation amen now you know that the fall in the garden amen come in and Lucifer the serpent amen that the devil caused the harmony between the Creator and the creation to be broken and you know when Harmony is broken amen there are going to be repercussions when Harmony is broken the prophet of God said like this he said one time when the Lord was sending me among the Pentecostals he said I went and told my mother-in-law and she said you're not taking my daughter among that trash he said well she's my wife she said she's my daughter she said I'll go to my grave heartbroken he said now watch I listen to my mother-in-law instead of listening to God and he said sorrow said in immediately he said in 1937 the flood came up and then Sorrows begin to break in and things went wrong the congregation begin to drop amen just get out of harmony with God one time he said and friends I will regret it amen as long as I live now I know what you're thinking you're thinking he was a prophet so because he was a prophet amen he didn't have to have no correction amen God would let him get out of Harmony and then just let him go on as if everything was okay amen but you got to remember that the spirit of the Prophet amen is subject to the prophecy am now come on church and God is no respector of persons if he got out of Harmony and had to endure the chastisement to get back in harmony amen you best believe that if we get out of Harmony we're going to have to endure the correction to get back in harmony amen because God is no respector of persons amen I'll say this that God by the new birth and the baptism of the holy spirit amen has made a way amen for harmony to be restored brother said the new birth is an experience right it's a gift of God it's the Seal of your faith the holy spirit is a seal Ephesians 4:30 he said God made Abraham the promise and Abra believed God and was justified by faith and God give him the sign of circumcision as a seal amen so he does today amen we believe him and then if you say you believe and do not receive the Holy Spirit then you do not believe cause God promised Amen to give you the Holy Spirit when you did believe now remember what Paul said he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed amen see when the spirit of God comes into a man it quickens him he becomes a new creature he believes in the immortal God and he believes that he does all things and his heart is in tune with God when God comes in a man amen he makes him a new creature he quickens him to the Revelation that he's not a man-made God he's an immortal God he's the only wise God he's the only true God Amen and that man's heart becomes in tune with another dimension so he begins to declare things amen that is in another dimension Oh Glory to God he begins to declare Things From Another Dimension in this Dimension and you see a supernatural manifestation of a Heavenly God on the earth his heart comes in tune with God now let me say this no matter what happens no matter what happens amen you keep your heart in tune with God Amen Get Your Heart Out Of Tune with Fox News Get Your Heart Out Of Tune with CNN Get Your Heart Out Of Tune with Leota Get Your Heart Out Of Tune with all the gossip and backb and tail bearing amen get your heart back in tune with the Living God amen amen y'all know I'm telling the truth amen we don't see God like we used to cuz our heart is not in tune with God like it used to be we don't feel the anointing because we come to church and our heart's in tune with this show and it's in tune with this song and it's in tune with this career amen but why don't we come back and say God tune my heart up amen tune me back up to the supernatural tune me back up to that Dimension where there is a resurrected god with a power and an omnipotence to declare himself now the Bible said the Bible said keep th heart keep by heart with all diligence for out of it is the issues of Life brother said no matter what you got here in this world or what you haven't got you keep right in tune with god well brother Andrew I got a million dollars stay in tune with god well brother Andrew I got $5 stay in tune with god well brother Andrew I got a good job stay in tune with God brother anderw I ain't got a job stay in tune with God amen amen amen amen well brother Ander all my kids are Sav stay in tune with god brother Andrew some of my kids are running from God stay in tune with God if you can stay in tune if you can stay in harmony there will be a signal that'll be Sent From Another Dimension it'll be a message of Deliverance it'll be a message of authority and that Heavenly declaration will break the Devil's Backbone in your situation if that's right with God our heart he said you'll come forth as sure and as certain as there is a God in heaven if it's not right with God you've got to take the other route so you make your choice today for Christ amen now somebody said well brother Andrew you know I don't think it's very important that my heart stays in tune with god well brother Ram said there was a man coming one time Amen to the to the communion table and he asked brother Ram a question they said brother why would Christ appear to me as I was about to take the sacraments so here's an individual Amen brother Steven walking down to the communion table and Christ appears to them said well no doubt amen that your heart was just in tune with God and you was coming sacredly up to God and that's why he appeared to you see that would be the only reason that I know not because they had a lot of money not because they had a lot of understand in but because their heart was in tune with God and he could speak he could appear he could reveal he could show himself as the wise God on the scene I believe in the power of Harmony I'll just tell you what the definition of harmony means it is the combination amen of simultaneously sounded somebody say sounded musical notes Amen to produce chords amen and the chord progress agressions having a pleasing effect so Harmony is bringing many parts into one part that there would come an agreement that that agreement would bring a pleasing effect oh the quality of forming a pleasing and a consistent hole amen Harmony is very important in musical Productions amen because the purpose of music is to display the ability of Harmony now let me say this Jesus was the greatest manifestation of Harmony that we ever seen the prophet of God said our lord Jesus as we're speaking of him he said I love to read after him because he never made one mistake amen everything he done was perfectly in harmony with god oh how much time we waste as we Leisure around see amen but Jesus never at one time amen was ever caught gting around every move somebody say every move every place he went amen every place he went everything he did every word he spoke it had a meaning to it and was exactly in harmony with God and the will of God come on church I Pro I proposed to you tonight that Jesus was the word made flesh he was God In the Flesh amen and every word he spoke every place he went every AC he did every move he made was a perfect reflection of the harmony between he and his father and he was not in heaven declaring that he was on the earth so in other words he come from God and he went back to God and the prophet said the very evidence the Holy Ghost is here is because the same God that descended into human flesh is the same God that ascended and sent back his Spirit Well the devil may not believe there's no Holy Ghost but he's come too late because I am a living I'm a breathing witness that there's a holy ghost in the Earth today I've got the Holy Ghost you've got the Holy Ghost every place he went every word he said every mood he made everything he done had a meaning to it he said that's the reason he was so pleased with him saying this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased what does harmony do Harmony brings simultaneously amen sounded notes into one cord to where that one chord would have a pleasing effect oh and all that was in God he poured into Christ and there was a Harmony between the father and the son that that Harmony would bring a pleasing effect amen amen amen well glory to God everything was perfectly in harmony with him now can I show you one instance in St John 5 Jesus passes by the pool of beesa there's many sick folk laying there there's many lame laying there but he goes to one man he bypassed hundreds and went to one and he healed that man and brother ca he healed him on the Sabbath day and all the Jews and Pharisees and Sadducees they got all mad and they sought to kill him because he had not only broken the Sabbath but said also that God was his father which was making himself equal with God that's right now can I show you something the man was in a sick condition he was in a lame condition but because there was an instrument on the earth who was in harmony with another dimension that that Dimension from Heaven could speak to this dimension on the earth and they could come into one heart into one agreement and they could say rise and take your bed listen there was a pleasing effect of the harmony of God That Came Upon that impotent man and he went off walking and praising God Amen and everybody got mad and Jesus looked at him and said the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things he doeth amen these also doeth the son likewise now can I preach this to you brother B said when he passed by the pool he seen all the people but he healed one man amen amen amen amen he and the Jews questioned him and said why and we notic that Jesus was a kind man I'm turning the corner now take your time Jesus was a kind man take your time my brother he was a humble man yes my brother yet he was a man of power he was a kind man he was a humble man but he was yet a man of power when he spoke he was very humble and gentle but when it come time between to separate amen the truth from the error Jesus was very Stern so the same man that was kind and humble when it come time to separate amen the truth from the air he become very Stern and he platted ropes and he ran the money changers out of the temple the prophet of God said he was a man who could speak when it come time to speak he was a man who was full of love amen can we declare war here for a minute he was a man who was full of love but he loved his father so much till he stayed in harmony with his father and anything amen anything that interfered with that Harmony then Jesus drew the line that's it that's it Oh Oh Glory anything that interfered with the harmony between him and his father is where Jesus drew the line come on church he loved the Pharisees he loved the sades he was a kind man towards them but when their Traditions tried to get between him and his father he drew the line he loved the Sadducees he loved the scribes but when their rituals tried to get between him and his father he drew the line Well church a living God I think it's time for the Bride of Jesus Christ am meant to get anointed with the same spirit that was Upon Our Lord and anything anything anything anything that interferes with the harmony between us and our Lord we ought to draw the line draw our sword and cut that devil's head off and make way for the harmony of the Holy Ghost amen amen amen come on I'm preaching to you right now amen I'm preaching to you some of y'all would have a lot more joy if you would draw the line you would have a lot more peace if you would draw the line you would have a lot more anointing if you would draw the line you would have a lot more Authority if you would draw the line amen amen amen I know what I'm talking about people don't want to draw the line they don't want to draw the line compromise come on they don't want to draw the line but I'm going to tell you what if you're a Seed of Abraham then you're in the same lineage of shamgar and shamgar got sick and tired of the Philistines stealing his crops so you know what shamgar done he drew a line and said you stay on your side and everything will be okay but the very minute that you cross the line and you interfere with the food to feed my family is the very minute This Means War this means war and there is a bride on the earth she's a loving bride she's a virtuous woman she's a humble woman but the very minute I said the very minute that that devil begins to interfere between her and this message between her and her peace between her and her Joy between her and her Liberty is the very minute she'll draw the line and say you've gone as far as you're going to go you've gone as far as you're going to go amen amen amen amen amen you you you may not like me time I get done but I'm going to tell you the truth amen fellowshipping with unbelievers Will zap the life come on am come on I know what I'm talking about well they're friends and they're friends amen any person who is against this word is not your friend they are your enemy come on and if you're fellowship with them Devils come on I I know what I'm talking about if you're fellowshipping with unbelieving Spirits then you just watch one service two Services three services four Services you can't no more amen like you used to you can't no more raise your hand like you used to you can't no more break out and shout like you used to because a devil has interfered with a Harmony between you and your Lord amen draw the line draw the line am take your Liberty my brother take your Liber draw the line amen anything amen that interferes with your walk with God draw the line anything that interferes with your ability to break out in praise and worship and power and faith and anointing draw the line and put your foot on it and say I'll stand with Jesus and let the confusion go [Applause] by amen amen amen now I know what I'm talking about because people walk away from this revealed word and they don't want the benefit of the revealed word but they want the benefit of your friendship they want the benefit of your prayers they want the benefit of your anointing so they hang around like leeches and they scare you and they intimidate you now I'm just going to go ahead time I'm just going to go ahead and say it I'm here you are H amen a man told me one time a man told me one time he said well there's a guy who left the message been on the internet blasting the message and all kinds of things several years ago they' been doing all these things he said but me and him had lunch the other day he said I said had lunch he said oh yeah we go for coffee and fellowship he's my brother I said you mean he's your brother he's your brother he calls what you believe a lie he calls your Prophet a false prophet your Liberty he calls the pillar of fire idolatry and he's your brother wake up Church draw the line and be a believer and stand for the word of God stand for the principles of God and stand for the harmony of the word of God have an [Applause] effect you say well brother Andrew that was Jesus and he drew the line can I show you a Vindicated prophet he said the only thing I'm here for is to follow the instructions of my brothers as long as it doesn't interfere with the things that God has for me to do now I I I'm GNA I'm GNA I'm going to drive this point home for a minute your time that word interfere means to take part or intervene in an activity without invitation or necessity thank you very much thank you very much so lunch with unbelievers is not a necessity amen amen amen repeat it over again repeat it please birthday parties with reprobates it's not a necessity repeat it again my brother come on Church Fellowship Gathering with unbelievers is not a necessity come on I tell you what they're doing they're coming in your life Uninvited amen amen amen am that word interfere means to prevent a process or activity from continuing or being carried out properly it is of a thing to strike against something when it's working it is to get in the way of now watch this to handle or adjust something without permission so when something begins to interfere it means you're adjusting something or you're handling something and you don't have no permission to put your hands on it am now usually when there's some interference there's a repercussion of damage because somebody who was unauthorized to touch the thing put their hands on it and when they got done with it they damaged it amen can I just say this Satan he is the master at interfering we brother said we find Satan right quickly at work with God's program he said we see that malignant eye of the devil that serpent that's always tried to interfere with God's program before it comes on the earth so before the program of God comes on the earth the malignant eye of the devil is trying to interfere with that see but now now can I give you a Biblical example amen there was a man named Moses who was ordained to lead Israel out but there were two impersonator named Dayan and K there was also a Janice and a jambers who were interfering with the Deliverance of Israel amen amen amen now do you all agree that brother brandham was our Moses do you agree he was our Moses and can I show you something can I show you something take your time brother sitting earnestly contending for the faith right in Connorsville Indiana brother's just preaching along brother Steven he's just preaching along about Divine Healing and the power of God and the p fire hanging over him and signs and he said that's what it is today amen they have a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof he said from such turn away amen do you believe that to be right I believe with all my heart he said now look then he said let me die the death of the righteous now if you go look at this sermon on your folio views you will see in Brackets these words brother brandham stops as a model airplane noise interferes uhhuh so while he's preaching he's just preaching along and all of a sudden he stops preaching and a model airplane uhhuh a model airplane airplane noise interferes with his preacher and brother said hey he said see how the devil will do that's right now if you want to see the devil look out there he got in them men out there and see them do such a thing as that now someone said do you mean that was the devil what other thing would interfere God's spirit but the devil amen amen amen here's a prophet preaching the word and two men get in a model airplane airplane and they're trying to interfere with an astronaut preaching [Applause] anointing so to interfere let's go fire up the airplane he said certainly a bunch of preachers now watch who done this he said a bunch of preachers turned them out there to do do that to try to stop the meeting but you can't stop God because God will move right on just the same there's nothing simply nothing that can stop the power of God we are an Unstoppable Force we are an invincible Army you can interfere you can chatter chatter chatter you can cluck cluck cluck but you'll never stop us we are the astronauts with the anointing to break gravity and to break got into another dimension amen amen am Hallelujah I'm talking about somebody who is Anointed to overcome glory to God now I'm telling you something take I'm telling you something take your time interfering with this message is a serious offense it is very serious very serious interfering with this message is a serious offense very serious I'll say it what a prophet said he said them same people if they don't repent they will lay in Hell forever that's amen amen am I know people don't like that kind of preaching but that's what the prophet said you say you're judging no I'm not by their fruits ye shall know [Applause] them so here's some men who are in tune with a devil and Anointed with the devil to start a model airplane and interfere with the prophets preaching and he said they'll lay in Hell forever if they don't repent that's right amen we're contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints amen amen amen amen are you with me now interfering with this message is a serious offense preach my brother can I tell you why it is because they were not interfering with brother brandom that's right they were not interfering with brother brandham that's right they were interfering with a communication between the mentions hallelujah hallelujah they were interfering with the mouthpiece of almighty God to declare another dimension is as real as this Dimension amen amen amen amen can I prove it to you take your time he said these things I do shall you also that's God's sworn Covenant true is his sworn Covenant true then what are we worried about Jesus is here his spirit is here now what happened just now I went into another world I went into another world see it's an Unseen World we become so conscious of looking at one another like this but there's an Unseen World and it's greater than anything you can see and here is Christ in this building here are evil spirits at War and there are Christians Anointed with the angels of God encamped about them amen trying to energize them with faith and here I am standing yielding myself and the holy spirit's moving this is what you call Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but remember Satan is always a skeptic at the sons of God he always does that some of a skeptic idea when they do that he's just trying to interfere but can I can I can I dedicate something to the devil last part of that quote but Christians always overcome aen Christians always overcome I'm not worried about you Christians always overcome no matter how low you go no matter how bound you get no matter how sick you become Christians always overcome no matter who walks off we overcome no matter who raises up we overcome no matter what the devil says Christians always always always anywhere anytime any place under any conditions Christians will always overcome amen amen amen amen you know why they'll overcome because they're Warriors because they're soldiers because they're praisers because they're worshippers they will not lay down and let some old devil shut a door in their face they'll break out and praise God until the Devil Falls powerless in the name of Jesus Christ Christians glory to God Christians always always always always always overcome Glory I'm going in the Rapture I'm going in the future home I'm going to walk on the streets of gold I'm going to walk through the gates of per I'm going to I'm going to Feast that's the tree of life I'm going to drink from the Crystal River Christians always [Applause] overcome wo brother Glory Glory they always overcome they overcome on good days I said they overcome on good days and they overcome on bad days amen they overcome on the mountain amen and they overcome in the valley they overcome in church and they overcome at the job they overcome in church and they overcome at school they overcome in the hospital always always have you forgot who you are you are the elected Overcomers of this age and the same Harmony that was between the father and the son I said the same Harmony that was between the father and the son come on Church you know why I can say you always overcome it's because Jesus always overcame when he was tempted he overcame when he was Hunger he overcame when he was sick he overcame when they were trying to deceive him he overcame when he was on the mountain he overcame when he was in Pilot's Hall he overcame In The Garden of Gethsemane he overcame that's the cross of Calvary he overcame I might as well say it in hell he overcame in hell he overcame and on the resurrection morning the stone was rolled away and the same God that overcame in Hell overcome the grave and has the keys of death and of hell and of the Grave if he overcome we'll overcome Glory Glory Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah we're going to overcome Leota we're going to overcome America we're going to overcome deception we're going to overcome unbelief GL we have been anointed we've been anointed am to overcome amen amen the devil don't know what to do with you I said the devil don't know what to do with you hell can't bind you the grave Can't Hold You Satan can't deceive you Spirits can't get you Devils can't break you unbelief can't discourage you because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world he's already overcome the world and now the God who is in Jesus is in the bride and she's overcoming every day every hour every month amen amen amen amen amen Glory Hallelujah greater is he that is in youen amen amen amen then he that's in the world take your time he overcome lust so will you he overcome women so will you amen come on I'm not talking to church members no sir I'm not preaching to church members I am talking to Overcomers you're Overcomer you're an overcomer and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb amen and by the word of of their testimony what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying there is an authority in this bride you can put a Red Sea in front of us but God will open it up you can put us in a lion's den but God will shut the mouths of the lines you can put us in the fiery furnace with our hands tied up and our feet tied up but he'll take the heat out of the fire and we'll shout and we'll praise God and we'll break the change we are Overcomers we're not losers we're Overcomers Oh Glory to God after everything I've been through I'm still standing after everything I've been through I'm still preaching after every skeptic devil tried to shut the I'm still here because I am an elected seed of almighty God ordained chosen anointed anointed anointed to tear the devil's Kingdom [Applause] down some of y'all wonder what's on you right now it's not an emotion it's it's not a feeling it's not a sensation it's the anointing it's the anointing amen it's the anointing [Applause] amen glory I believe in the anointing I believe in the anointing I believe it like the Bible said it ran down over Aaron it ran through his beard it ran all over Oh Glory to God he that is in you has already overcome the world and who is in you the anointed word and greater greater is the anointed word in your soul than the lies of the devil in your flesh greater greater greater is the anointing of the word of God in your [Applause] soul I feel like a prophet Isaiah right now he said the yoke he said the Yoke amen amen shall be destroyed amen why because of the anointing you know what the prophet of God said Hallelujah he said we are God's fruit Bears am and we are God's lightbearers he said there is an alloted portion of the word of God that's been laid out for this season that's been laid out for this age you know what he said he said so God sends the anointing amen God sends the anointing oting into the age to find the soul that's got the seed and that anointing strikes that seed and click that seed and that seed comes to full maturity and when the pillar of fire when the Loos of God when the anointing strikes the seed the seed loses the Yol can I just say it brother Steven you never wear the Yoke again who the son has made free is free indeed ye shall know the word and thy truth is the word and the word shall make you free the word shall break the anointing glory to God can I say it to you like this amen the anointing does not break the Yol the anointing destroys the Yol amen Amen brother Steven there's a big difference there's a big difference in something broke and something destroyed when something is broken you can take it to the repair man he can put it back together and it can be fixed but when something is destroyed annihilated it's beyond repair it's annihilated yes sir it's beyond hope amen oh Church of the Living God I'm talking about the anointing of the harmony of the father and the son has come into your life and has destroyed the nature of the devil and the nature of the devil can never raise up again in your soul for the soul who has believed on God has passed amen has passed from Death unto life unto life amen amen Oh Glory to God the yoke I said the Yoke has been destroyed because of the anointing amen amen amen the Yol take your time the Yol take your time has been destroyed yes my brother take your time because of the anointing Hallelujah so what's happened go ahead the soul has passed from Death un life amen Amen brother B said you're a Triune being just like father son Holy Ghost you got a body you got a spirit and you got a soul that's right brother said the soul is the control tower of God he said now watch he said that soul is the nature of the spirit that's right the nature of the spirit that controls the body see that's right now in your inner man you're made up in the system of a Tabernacle in the outer courts the holy place and the holies of holies the Shak glory on the inside the veil yes now watch this you have the outer Court you have the inner Court you have the holies of holies but in the holies of holies you have the shik glory you have the Sho bread you have the visible manifestation of the presence of God in the holies of holies in other words the old man is crucified and the new man has been risen now I've got a bunch of scripture on it I'm just going to go through it quickly in Ephesians 3:16 he said that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man I love this one in 2 Corinthians 4:16 brother CLE for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day amen now now in Colossians 3:9 lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him then there is an anointing coming in this age and it's not just striking the outer man it's not just striking your spirit the anointing is striking your soul amen do you all know that brother said like this did you know there's another man inside of your body and that is a spirit man that's in here that's the inside man he said there's a conscience there's a subconscious and then there's God now watch this he said but way down now watch the ship going overseas the man up here gives the orders the man goes down in the ship to run the ship down here well don't see where he's going but he takes the order from up above well now he says steer to the left steer to the right give the engine more whatever it is he just works by orders but way down in the midst of us here in our heart is the subconscious and it takes orders from up here so the subconscious brother Judah is taking orders from the conscience and the conscience is taking orders from God amen amen take your time are you seeing this there's three parts coming into harmony to get the ship out of the harbor God is giving the orders the conscience is receiving them and the subconscious is acting on the orders that has come down to the line glory to God he said now now I said if that's right and the conscience is right and the subconscious is wrong and does not agree then we won't get out of Harbor he said but until that does it won't work he said see if God the subconscious and conscience is agreed then something is going to move amen something is going to move are y'all hearing me amen Jesus was the son of God he did nothing but what the father showed him so the father showed him the immitance man and Jesus manifested the orders of the father and the omnipotent man got up and took his bed and walked home as a manifestation of the harmony between the father and the son now brother says in you is God right you have the Holy Ghost God is in you let me show you then the weakness of the church now can I can I have a few minutes in closing here take your time he said let me show you the weakness of the church y'all remember Paul in the Bible received a vision and the vision said you'll stand before Caesar it was a heavenly vision in the vision it said you're going to be Shipwrecked now watch God promised Paul by a heavenly vision he was going to a certain destination now Paul was Shipwrecked and he got on an island and he was gathering some wood oh God glory and when he gathered the wood there was a serpent that come up out of the wood that's right am and bit him now these serpents were so deadly that the minute they bit you you would be dead within a minute or two minutes that's right A M go ahead would be so powerful that it would bite you and you would be dead within a minute goad thank you brother Steven it was a Mamba yes sir so he was bitten by a Mamba to kill him watch what the prophet said and the native said he escaped the storm but he won't escape the serpent go ahead other words he escaped the false church but he won't escape this situation he escaped that but he won't escape this oh but if you got God if you got the anointing in your soul if he escape the strip wreck if he escape the serpent he'll make it to the certain destination are you hearing me so Paul grabs a piece of wood a serpent comes up and es onto his arm and he's standing there with a serpent with a Mamba hanging on his arm and there's people standing there saying any minute he's going to die uh any minute he's going to die any minute he's going to kill over any minute they're going to quit any minute they're going to give up any minute they're going to quit believing let's see how long they going to hold on so Paul just stood there and after a while brother said this the subconscious amen amen was in agreement with this am the conscience and both of them was in agreement with God and the Bible said they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm them brother said Paul just went over there and he shaken off from the fire I could preach here for an hour Church Living God it's time to get up it's time to go over and shake it off it's time to shake it off come on brother said the Holy Ghost in Paul he said his body was so full of the spirit as much as it was of the blood that the Venom of the serpent did not even affect Paul amen because he was in harmony with God the Venom of the serpent could not affect the life of Paul amen met the success now yes my brother now you all know I'm telling the truth take your time because the power of Harmony amen amen amen is when when many parts amen come into one part amen amen can I say it to you like this harmony requires more than one string amen amen amen in other words Harmony requ I'm going to close on this take your time requires many parts amen amen amen anybody can sing a solo uh-huh uh-huh anybody can sing a solo but Harmony requires another part amen amen you all know the pro of God said in the last days he said God's got a great Symphony amen he said amen amen you know what he said he said he's got three parts he's got the composer he's got the director then he's got the musicians all three must come into agreement and receive the spirit of the composure now come on because what does a symphony do he said like Peter and the Wolf he said there's not little woodpeckers flying around in wolves he said the music oh God he said the music creates the atmosphere and the symphony makes the music a reality in other words when they all get in the same key they all get in the same cord they all get in the same Spirit then Harmony comes in and harmony can take a piece of sheet music and transfer it into reality amen amen amen amen can I can I give y'all just a just a simple just a simple little illustration take your time I'm not very I'm not musically inclined okay I know that okay but I was in music in high school middle school I played the trumpet now in the in the Middle School band we had the sixth grade band and we had the seventh and eighth grade concert band in that seventh eighth grade concert band when you when you left sixth grade you went in there you begin to play together so I was in seventh grade playing in seventh eighth grade band and it come time for our Christmas performance our Christmas concert and Mr Brown our director brother stepen he come through and he passed out the Sheep music and it was a song called The Carol I think it was Carol the bells or something like that and he put it on the on the on the music stand and he said here's your concert music when I looked at it I automatically knew that there was something different about that than anything I'd ever seen so we begin to play it well brother Stephen brother Mr Brown was my director but I had a I had a private instructor so on Tuesdays and Thursdays I would go to private instruction lessons and then I would go back to church I mean go back to the band I'd go back to concert band and we would play so one day I go in for lessons and sister zy I'm sitting there and the direct or the the instructor he says what do you want to do today I said well let's practice my concert music so he I put the concert music up he looks at and he says no your concert music I said that is my concert music he said no you're in seventh grade he said this is 10th grade concert band music I said sir that's what my director gave me he said this is too hard for you to play he said so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to in other words I'm going to dumb it down I'm going to rewrite some parts of it it'll make it more easy for you to play the problem was brother Zach when I went back to concert band rehearsal and we all started playing Mr Brown stopped and said something's off somewhere that's it that's it that's it so I just kind of sat there you know and I didn't look around I didn't make no motions and he said let's try it again so he got the stick up and he began to direct and he stopped again he said something off somewhere something's off somewhere I said no I said no really he said yeah something's off somewhere so he says everybody put your instruments down so we put our instruments down and brother Stephen he comes walking through looking at everybody's music and he comes to mine I'm thinking dear Lord don't let him look don't let him look and he looks at it and he says it's you I said me he said yeah I said no way he said yeah he looks at the Sheep music he looks at the Sheep music amen amen and he says Andrew who dumb this music down I said what do you mean he said somebody has added Parts in here that I did not put in there so you're playing added parts and the whole thing is out of rhythm the whole key is Out Of Tune come on church I looked at him I said well Mr Brown my instructor he said he's an instructor I'm the director ahen the instructor didn't have the spirit of the composure he said listen Mr he said listen here Andrew he said I want to know why he done this I said Mr Brown it's too hard I'm closing on this he said Mr I said Mr Brown it's too hard I cannot play that he told me it was too hard it was above my level he said Andrew I gave you that music he said because I know inside of you is the potentials to play it no know I know the potentials is in you to play something harder come on church we had played the first pole we had played the second pole but it was time for somebody to get in line with a composure to get in line with the director and receive the same spirit and they would all be playing the same part amen can I say it like this the composer comes into the director and the director comes into the musicians in other words words the prophet the spirit the prophet and the bride will all be saying the same thing amen amen Harmony has been restored now can I ask you this and I'm done Harmony yes sir requires more than one part am Amen in other words the walls of Jericho are tall the walls of Jericho are wide the walls of Jericho are very strong very strong you can live on them you can race chariots on them they're they're there but they got to come down can I say this but a solo ain't going to do it testing one two testing a solo ain't going to do it and we've had a lot of solo around this message they've sang Return Ministry they've sang seven Thunders they've sang perusia they've sang Two Souls they sung all kinds of things amen but the walls are still standing because a solo ain't going to bring the walls down it's going to take a symphony brother Steven the walls are there so one person let's go March around them okay one person March around them brother brandom said I'm going to interpret it for you you don't need the quot you just need me you don't need what them tapes say you just need me I'm going to bring them walls down and the walls are still standing that's exactly but in the end time the composure came down to the director and the director picked up the stick and said we're going to March around these walls seven times we are going to March around these walls seven times and on the seventh time we're going to let out a shout in other words there ain't enough power in one voice there ain't enough power in two voices but when all the voices come back into Harmony and they begin to sound out the shout the walls are going to come down well Church we've got to shout and the shout is the [Applause] message and if we can all say the same thing the walls are coming down let our musicians come tonight oh I didn't you all forgive me the word of God is a great Symphony now can I say this to you brother said watch he said if you don't understand the symphony it's a big bunch of Racket to you if you don't understand the symphony it's a big bunch of Racket it's all done by signs and motions but it acts out of drama in the symphony the only one that understands a symphony is the composure and those who are interested in knowing it they know its changes they know what takes place now brother BM says it very beautiful he says the Sheep music is not going to give an uncertain sound he said the seventh Angel's message is going to be a certain sound right right the genuine revelation will be made known made perfect in that sounding so there is the spirit in the last days and it's the spirit of God and what it's doing is it's bringing us back in tune because the composer the director must be in the same spirit and so must the musicians be in the same SP Spirit see God's Bible and a Believer will come together am amen amen amen can I say it to you like this the prophet of God said there was an auction one [Applause] time he said and they went in there and there was a violin over in the corner he said the the auctioner went over and picked up the violin it was Dusty had scars cobwebs Out Of Tune he held up the violin and he said who will give me a dollar who'll give me a dollar who will give me a dollar nobody bid who give me $2 said finally somebody said I'll give you two he said finally there was a man standing in the back so there was a man there there was a man there that could turn on the light there was a man there that said that shouldn't be sold for that amount so he went up there and he picked up the violin he dusted it off he tuned it up laid it on his shoulder got a bow and rosined up the bow and began to play one of the most beautiful sounds you ever heard but remember when he got done playing they said 2,000 5,000 10,000 he said what was it the Master's Hand revealed what was veiled in the old instrument can I say this to you he didn't put the music in it the music was already in it it just needed somebody to reveal it to unveil it and to bring it out so the pro of God said and today the word of God is laying on a denominational auction he said what are they doing he said they're bidding it away for anything he said oh but may God step forth surely and send that Prophet that'll pick up the bow you know what the bow is amen the bow is the believer the violin is the word the bow is the believer and he said can't you hear the Master's violin pull across the bow across the word he's the same yesterday today and forever won't you stand your feet with us tonight what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying we're not manhandling this word We're In Harmony amen amen now y'all forgive me here take your time right but every spirit that confesseth not Jesus Christ is the Son of God and has come in the flesh is of the Antichrist amen amen and the Bible said there are many Antichrist right that have gone out into the world that's exactly right y'all forgive me take your time but they're passing out their own sheet music that's exactly right that's exactly right they're taking the sheet music and hacking here and cutting there and adding here and place in there and put that's why mess and now we got people trying to lead the symphony with the wrong sheet and one's playing this and one's playing that and brother so and so said this and brother so and said this but when Jesus got Stern is when it come to truth and error and everything that interfered with a Harmony he drew the line it now y'all forgive me cuz it's an age of Technology take your Liberty it's an age of it's an age of Technology crazy and Co put everybody on the internet that's exactly right every church every Ministry every preacher every direction everybody's out there and so you now what you know what we got happening now is we got people listening to this preacher here and that preacher there and this preacher there and this one's correct in this one and that one's correct in that one Spirit come on that's exactly right and what they're doing is bringing a different sound to the Sheep music exactly right so the Sheep music said there would be greater works well this guy said no that's just for brother brandom so he changed the sheet music that's right that's exactly right and now Jehovah comes in the midst of his bride and wants to sing a song and all the musicans are Out Of Tune that's exactly right can I can I get y'all do me a favor go ahead can I can I get you do me a favor okay I want you to play Amazing Grace Just you brother okay I want you to play only Bel and I want you to play our God is a awesome you know that song confusion and I want you to play When the Saints Go Marching In can you do that for me confusion can you play that for me play it Loud confusion there's not a pleasing effect that's exactly right that's exactly right my brother but when somebody says stop everybody play Amazing Grace amen amen say Harmony amen Harmony has just now been restored amen amen and now there's a pleasing effect amen amen hallelujah now I tell you why the devil don't want the musicians on the same Pages cause music drives out evil [Applause] spirits music drives out evil spirits so if he can get the musicians on different notes and different songs and different Tunes the devil has a stronghold in the church but when Harmony is restored and the sound of the cords Blends into one it begins to push out evil spirits what about it church we are the musicians of the message of the hour and as long as the devil's God is playing our own songs singing our own Keys playing our own Tunes in Rhythm out of rhythm in harmony out of Harmony the devil has a stronghold but when we come under the spirit of the compon the devil loses his almighty God we bless your name here tonight Lord hallelujah father I pray some way somehow Lord you could take these thoughts Hallelujah and Lord you could positionally place them in the hearts of your children here tonight father I know we're living in an age where there's so much confusion so much disagreement Lord so many different voices but father I I believe if there's ever been a time as the Overcomers of this age anointed elected to overcome if there's ever been a time lord to draw the line now's the hour to do it if there's ever been a time to say Satan you've gone as far as you're going to go Now's the Time to Say it Lord if there's ever been an hour father to let that devil know he's defeated and Lord if there's every been an hour to Humble ourselves and come back to teaching the word in the purity and the power and the clarity that your Prophet delivered it to us in now is the hour father I join my faith together with every anointed Overcomer and I bind the devil of confusion I bind the spirit of contention I bind the spirit of Discord and strife and Satan we call your bluff tonight you've interfered in our family long enough you've interfered in our churches long enough you've interfered among our young people long enough we're coming back to one voice to one message to one anointing to one Spirit to one Prophet to one Pillar of Fire father we surrender our ideas we yield our members as instruments of righteousness and not unrighteousness father we come to you tonight Lord and we're asking you for Grace father Lord if there be one here tonight that the devil has changed the Sheep music and they're playing out a rhythm they're singing out a key they're playing out a tune father their hearts out a tune dear God it's been a long time since you appeared to them father I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by The Same Spirit that raised my Lord from the dead May that Spirit take their heart tonight and take the strings of their heart and begin to tune it up Lord father don't lay us to a to a to a denominational tuning fork don't lay us to a denominational tuning machine but Lord bring our heart to this message the message of Malachi 4 that was sent to turn our heart that was sent to tune our heart and Lord let our heart strings come back in tune with the voice of the seventh angel that Lord we could play according to the Sheep music and Lord we can see the manifestations and the visible Declarations of your presence your omnipotence and your power father I bind the voice of Hollywood I bind the voice of leosia Father we're going to overcome Lord because you have already overcame in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ let the worshippers arise here tonight let the Overcomers arise here tonight in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ how many can say Lord tune Me Up amen tune Me Up amen how many can say thank the Lord Harmony has been restored in the end time as our pastor comes tonight God bless you church God bless you Church [Applause] [Music] hall hallelujah can you give me more volume my brother just increase the volume because of my voice amen hallelujah I believe the holy spirit is clear somebody need to draw the line somewhere amen I'm going to read couple quotes of brother Bram this is what I felt led to and I'm going to read him amen glory to God hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah brother brandham say you hang your heart with somebody that is a thief I'm going to put this in the church group chat you shall be a thief yourself do you know how I know that your Association is wrong it's when I watch you the way you behave the way you groom yourself the way you keep your nail and all this kind of stuff I know exactly that you're drifting because the scripture says that evil communication corrupt what he didn't say that good manners will influence the evil communication so you can't beat the scripture so if you hang out with somebody in the message that is not solid don't worry that person will influence you in the wrong way you can't beat the scripture Amen brother brandham says glory to God he says that you hang around with somebody that is a thief you be be a thief yourself my old kentaki M used to say you lay down with a dog that's got fleas you get up with fleas too you take you take a woman that is no good a girl and put her with a good decent boy and the first thing you know he is as honary as a Pap turn it right vice versa you are known by your company amen segregate yourself in other words separate yourself I'm not talking about separating from the people outside the message even somebody who is in this message and who's compromising and the more you stick with that person that person is bringing you down instead of you going up you need to draw the line that's why I stand the way I stand in this church when it comes to the word no matter what you do even if I lose anyone I will stand with the word because if you compromise and that person be visited by the Lord later on that person will look at you like a hypocrite I tell people if your friend is drifting away you stand with the word because they don't understand at that time but when they understand they will love you more but what we do we have our own uh message love oh let's show love let's show love before you know it you're the one being drifted brother Branham say segregate yourself I'm just reading brother Bram he say segregate yourself come out from among them and the Bible say be ye separated that's right the second one brother Bram say Samson got into Bad Company and you always can remember that when you are in the Bad Company you are out of the will of the Lord my old southern mommy used to tell me if you lay down with a dog that's got fleas you get up with the fleas that's rather a rude expression but it's got a lot of common everyday sense to it you just can't associate yourself with the things of the world except to stay spirit and and expect to stay spiritual and humble before the Lord it won't happen that's why we struggle if the Lord and just understand this as much as we are here together as a church God deals with you individually so if God give you the Revelation onto something do it don't look at the other person don't wait for everybody to be going at the same time because this one will be today the other person will be maybe two three month down the road you move on with the Lord that's it that's it Church it is the matter of life and death draw the line I've been hanging around with this person look at the way I'm grooming my hair look at the way my high heel are but we already been preaching about high heel why are you still struggling with it it's because of the company you're going with amen you will say brother Stephen you keep coming back on this thing all the time I will sit down and draw the line I love you but I have to draw the line when it come to the word of God amen remove jealousy work together in harmony if God is blessing somebody don't attack it because God can choose one and out of that one he's going to bring everybody there if you start fighting it you can fight your own blessing because you think you should be in that place but God didn't see you there amen amen just like he showed here every musician in this spot let's work with Harmony the main thing we come in the church is about the word of God Church draw the line don't play game you're going to pick up Spirit oh we going to lunch you're going to pick up spirit amen Lord's willing because I know this step there is an N octave that God is taking this church the problem is there is an identity Crist where we don't know the value the caliber that God put in us that's why we follow people that's why young people are following this and following this because they don't know themselves up but let the master play the violin and you're going to realize what kind of caliber you are amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for speaking to this church Lord I know exactly what you spoke brother Kelly is back there he's my witness I didn't talk to brother Angel he doesn't know what I know but father you came and you spoke May your children be sensitive enough to understand what the spirit is telling them and line up with the word of God for their own blessing because we will always overcome father our Victory is certain Lord may you strengthen brother the angel may you remember his family may you protect each one of us in the midst of this cold weed father touch those that have been affected and let the healing power the bread of healing Lord be granted unto them wherever they are Lord in the name of Jesus Christ father give us travel mercy and continue to minister to our soul in the name of Jesus Christ amen go ahead brother [Music] said amen I just want us to praise the Lord tonight amen with no you not amen know you not know you not you are the
