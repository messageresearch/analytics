here God bless you um I'm I'm just a spare tire whever they at I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to hear the pastor okay oh May Lord's will you around Sunday you you're get an opportunity to uh uh um I'm hear but I tell you it's just been a blessing here the Lord's been richly blessing us he's been bringing souls in they say where the souls at look on the look on the YouTube you see where they at they coming in huh huh that's where they at is that right God's Gathering his bride up all around the earth just like he said is that right that's right brother Seth just like he said he's going to gather him up so let's look at uh verse uh 26 I don't mean to have you standing I appreciate your patience I'm verse 27 I'm sorry verse 27 so God created man in his in his own in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female he created them you may be seated let's turn over to uh Matthew 20 Matthew 24 we'll see which way he go uh by the grace of God I don't know which way the Lord's going to go but uh I just want to get myself out of the way so he can have his way I'm just a clay and he's the Potter and so we're looking here tonight you know we're looking at uh the reputation um as a Christian you know the reputation as a Christian I was just got the inspiration I was kind of listening to Memorial and something uh the prophet of God said in there let's look at verse 32 I'm going read also Matthew 2432 he says now let a parable of the Fig Tree which his branch is yet tender and putteth forth his leaves you know that the summer is nigh of course we know the Fig Tree is Israel and we see what's going on now we know recognize that the uh fig tree came forth in 1947 right they was Bud they became a nation and um so it's been a while now is that right because we looking up now you know God's getting things mounting up according to the scriptures we getting ready to get up out of here he says now he says so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors and and forgive me I say good night I mean rapturing time we getting ready to body change somebody don't want to take it literally okay he says he said verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass through all these things be fulfilled but this the part of the scripture I wanted to look at Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass you know we were in there and uh we got another scripture Matthew 6 same book let's go to Matthew 6 because I got a uh some quotes I want to read here tonight and y'all be praying with me God know which way he want us to uh to go Matthew 6 and we know the Lord been working in prayer been doing the beautiful thing for us God's been uh really tearing Satan's kingdom down is that right prophet of God said that's one of the most powerful weapons we can have is prayer is that right so now you're moving into that those secret weapon is that right they talking about the weapons they flying around over there in Israel is that right they talking about the weapons that can knock down missiles out of the air but we got a me we got a weapon that can tear it all down don't we prayer is that right we could drive a demon out of a man life we can move anything out by prayer is that right God said speak the word is that that right oh Hallelujah help us Lord he said now look he says he says after this manner therefore verse 9 Matthew 6 and9 he says pray ye what Our Father which are in heaven and Hallowed be thy name is that right the Lord's been teaching us how we addressing we addressing our great father he's a mighty God is that right he want us to worship him we lift him up on high he says that Hallowed be thy name holy be thy name he said thy kingdom come and thy will be what done in earth as it is in heaven not just the kingdom coming but God also want us to bring it up is that right we going to come up as he come down we going to come up uhhuh I know parents it is now see praise the Lord hallelujah he said now look as it is in heaven he said give us this what day our what Daily Bread may the Lord this is where I wanted to uh look at by the grace of God I got the little inspiration that struck me is when the Lord was showing us you know he's giv us this Daily Bread day by day is that right so the things I didn't ask for I've been asking for huh I've been asking for because the Lord told us ask and it shall be what given and seek it shall find and knock it shall what open is that right because lord said this is the hour now that we can do these things so we want you look at here but he said daily bread and when we look that so that mean God has a reputation God has to keep a reputation anytime God says a word you don't have to worry about it comeing to pass because God got a reputation to [Applause] keep and if he got a reputation to keeping now the devil we got the answer for the devil's problem for the devil's we got his answer is that right a reputation is a overall quality or character as seen or judged by people in general he says you see the characteristics or ability so a car so no matter who you are no matter what position you are no matter what walks of life you are no matter what sex you are no matter how old you are you are living for of what you have a reputation people are watching your character people are watching as you you walking that's why he was saying that what we have a reputation as a what a Christian is that right you we're not a Catholic we're not a Baptist we're not a Methodist we're not a Lutheran we're nothing against the people but we're against the doctrine is that right we don't have that kind of Doctrine because why if you study under the Catholic you become a Catholic uhhuh if you study under a Baptist you become a Baptist is that right if you study up under a Pentecostal you become a Pentecostal is that right but God has bringing his bride a word that he has BR he says up we going to be studying under the message of the hour so we become the what the Bride of Jesus Christ is that right so you what you Tak in the word you become the word in the beginning was the word the Word was God the word was with God and the Word was made flesh is that right so now we coming here our example is Christ Christ is the word now in Christ they were called Christlike and Antioch is that right so we now we're being molded and shape in the character of Christ we may not appear to be like him but we will be just like him when we come is that right so we know God has a reputation and that's why he say his daily bread uh I give you that Daily Bread every day Saints that means there something essential God will get you the essentials God will meet all of your needs uh that's what God said he's going to do oh Pastor the Lord is unfolding so much in this hour here now Saints it's bringing us to another level you have to remember praying church is over with right we coming in the time here now we're moving into the position as that bride and just bear with me uhoh I guess you're on overtime again last time I was here you was on overtime let me start this clock here huh I tell you Lord forgive me he said what I'm learning y'all I'm learning I'm learning y'all got be I went back to my papers tonight I said I going fool with that that computer tonight brother huh Hallelujah y'all pray with me Hallelujah we talking about what we talking about a reputation when a man's got a reputation people are watching that character so now God saying we are what the Bride of Jesus Christ is that right now in this church is going to have what the spoken word Tabernacle spok broken word mean it has a reputation is that right you cannot mix Creeds and then dogs much with coming through here is that right you got there one law is love it's one book but the Bible it's one called Creed but Christ is that right and Christ is the anointed word in the Holy Ghost form and this our here now is that right that's why when you take the reputation on being the bride the Holy Spirit loves the word uh he loves for you to pray and read the word uh that's why the pastor is asking you what he's asking you is that right he's bringing up for the time bringing you up into this age what God is expecting and what God is expecting out of us in this age here is that right bear with me tonight Lord have mercy I know some of you ate out in your car some of you came right from work pray with us on tonight we ask the Lord God who's rich in Mercy help us the Lord he said now thank you Jesus you want to read something going to be coming out is 815 yeah is 85 uh 57 God help me Hallelujah some of yall familiar with it not we you know here it was a gentleman he wanted they wanted them to build the bridge and when they wanted them to build the bridge there if he want to follow me and those that are streaming is 8 1857 I'm looking at uh paragraph 100 so you know where I'm at he says after a while a young architect up in England come down famous man a reputable man had a good reputation he says and I like that a man that has a good reputation oh you don't have to be a big man you don't or be a PO I mean you don't have to be some kind of big famous person you could be a poor person you could live in an alley you be living in the woods you could be homeless you could be from the bush you could be from the concrete jungle it doesn't matter everybody has to have a reputation it's a certain character reputation that's going to identify you to the ones that's watching you let us keep going but at this time here they was trying to build a bridge and it was numerous people that didn't have the have the wisdom and knowledge to build this bridge uh is that right but this man here he had the reputation of Building Bridges is that right he knew what he was doing and he knew that his reputation would be at stake uh on this bridge because all the other the experts the scientists the on that were there they said it couldn't be done is that right but he knew down inside that it could be done that he was going to build this bridge so when he come down there this man he says he says this man down there with a wonderful reputation he said he looked that he looked at the situation over he walked the banks for a for a few days he studied it he tested it he sounded he looked around while he went to the mayor and said I'll take the job he said why he said sir you know what you you are taking he said I thoroughly understand uh is that what he said people got to understand uh when understanding comes your confidence come when your confidence come your faith come and your faith is a revelation so the Revelation is being revealed to you now you got the confidence is that right hallelujah look what he said he said but sir I'm not afraid of the job I'll take it he said I realize that I have a Wonder a worldwide reputation he says as a bridge builder he says but I'll stake my reputation for I can build it he said you see oh he had a vision oh I want I want you to see the next Point that's about to come up then we going to elaborated on it God give us Grace and he said oh we have a vision before before a man can make a reputation he has to have a vision of what he's doing God bless you Pastor ah because you got the vision of the message of the hour and God gave it to you where is the where is no vision the people perish that mean that mean where there's no Revelation the people [Applause] perish huh this man had a revelation this man knew what he was doing amen God he felt confidence his reputation is at stake uh God knows what he's doing he's put it in you before the foundation of the world uh God's the best builder is that right we got the expert Builder is that right he come in here what did he say he made us of what body is that right spirit is that right and soul is that right down in the soul he put a seed is that right and in that seed is the germ it's the germ of life that comes from God we come from God we go back to God is that right so we don't have to worry about anything when you sing that song brother Rober the body go back to the dust uh when the spirit goes to God uh but the theophany pick up the what the soul and the Sea down in [Applause] there huh hallelujah look what he says he says he has to have a vision of what he's doing he said that's Proverbs 23:13 he said oh blessed be the Lord that's the reason that there's a heaven to go to that's the reason we can have a reputation as a Christian he says we know what the material is build the building is building that's right what is it he said it's the blood of Jesus Christ he said is in this building is that right the blood of Jesus Christ is in this building that's right his stained blood has washed away all sins he says he took me from the alleys of hell and made me his ser vant he says then I believe in him so I pass from Death what unto life and every believer has did that because they got what Assurance You Got Confidence why and they believe in this great Builder and this great architector why because no one else could have put us we had to come from the mind of God is that right when we came from the mind of God we was in his back now by us coming from the mind of God he's Distributing to us his mind is that right so we can make it through this last seven Church ages is that right because God is unfolding the word to each and every one of us let us keep going Hallelujah let me keep reading because I got I got a lot this good but now this is what the Holy Spirit inspired me to read so I'm going read it he says now when the man did it the first thing he did to be sure that he was was right he went down there he said now before we get this bridge started we've got to go we got to go to what a solid foundation is that right you can't build nothing on it unless you got a what it's built upon the rock is that right in the rock of

verse 14 for if ye believe that Jesus died and what rose again even so then also which sleep in Jesus will God bring what with him he says for this we say unto you by the what word the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain should not remain until the coming of the Lord shall not do what prevent them which are sleep for who the Lord the Lord himself shall descend from what heaven with a shout with a voice with a trump is that right when God came down on that mountain on the west coast is that right and he opened that book is that right he did not set his foot here on Earth is that not yet is that right it is the first time when he came back and he opened that book from he open those Seven Seals is that right and when he open those seals and now we can do what get a ready every age every loose end in every age God gave us strength gave us the Thunders revelation of the word is that right God brought us to what the second oil is that right done he said uh they all slept

he said it only gives us New Hope I'm at paragraph 115 he said it only strength it strengthens us this what the trials does this what these things do to us look what he says uh it strengthens us it only strengthen it every trial testing every time a wind hits a tree and shoves it back and forth and back and forth it only loosens The Roots so it can go what deeper and get a better what that's why he said you got to unfold the Deep things is that right huh the Deep things got to come so you may be able to withstand in this hour right now is that right God hidden in Simplicity and revealed in the same oh hallelujah hallelujah see we rejoicing because it's simple some of them can't understand it because why Jesus said father I'm glad that you hid it from the wise and The Prudent and revealed it unto babes that were such huh Hallelujah every look what he says he says it loosens the roots and it can grow deeper and get a better hold he said every time sickness strikes your home every time trials strike your home every time the neighbor say something something bad about you is only shaking you he said loosening you up uh so you can get down and get a better hold on the Eternal Rock uh he says of God's unmovable unfall onerror word of God uh let's give him a clap [Applause] off look what he say help us Lord don't get shaken don't get shaken he's getting you ready for this battle that's what he's getting you ready for he's getting you ready for what why did he change the pastor why did the Holy Spirit turn the pastor why did he turn that corner and he testified he couldn't get away from it last Wednesday because first you got to get your prayer life right you got to get it right amen yes he said I'm providing for you daily your daily bread is that right that's why he says the word uh is greater than the name Psalms 138 the word is greater than the name why because Paul says that preaching other jesuses even in this [Applause] message huh you come around in there you got to pray because God told us Our Father then the Holy Spirit also warned us what he says there's only one way huh Brother David there's only one way is to communicate with our father is that right sometime uh you want something from Daddy you might want something from Mama but you got to go in your closet is that right when you go in your closet you say the father I need you to talk to my father [Applause] he said I'm Desiring ain't that what he said teach us how to pray he said father he said you know I desire to do this this this but father he's a little tired and give him time so maybe he can I can talk to him father maybe he can hear and understand what I'm saying he said now you go to your father not doubting he said what not doubting and not angry you must go humbling so what is it uh uh Chronicles 7:14 which my people which are called by my name H if they would humble theel and pray and seek my faith is that right then I'll come and heal the land ah huh so man you got to understand is out here now the only communication the only way that we could communicate with our father is through prayer Our Father which are in where at Heaven he says Hallowed be thy name where we at we're on the what the Earth is that right he's the Father which is in heaven is that right so he's telling us Hallowed be thy name holy be thy name we just read father you said without Holiness no man shall see what shall see God uh so in the meantime uh while we're praying when through our prayer is connecting with our father is that right he told us now thy kingdom come uh the holy spirit will come down is that right I'm just testifying giving Jesus Christ The Glory I went up and out there praying and I asked my wife I said you come over there you knocked on the door she
