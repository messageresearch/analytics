========================================

change yourself into Faith from unbelief just jerk a little gear back there say well I've always kind of been skeptic but really now I'm I believe now now watch what happens then just do it once and see what happens just pray I try to get myself from the message into a gift a gift of to that the word might make itself known by the by as Hebrews 4:12 says discern know the thoughts in the heart pray for whatever is wrong with you pray and just say God I I'm needy the man don't know me but I'm needy I in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God for the glory of God and according to the word of God that I've just got through preaching I take every spirit in here under my control now no matter what happens it might be something happened just in a minute there's a Critic setting here here I'm just thinking something's fixing to happen so uh just be real Reverend if anything gets Disturbed you just set still you set real still let that person do what they're going to do Watch What Happens

spoken word Tabernacle amen glory to God let's give the Lord again a big clap off thank you very much I believe I got everything uh completed let's go straight to our scripture praise God thank you thank you Genesis chapter 40 we still on the same theme and let's see if we will wrap it up there were four element we got the first we got the second I thought I'm going to preach all of them in one day now we got it first sermon one point second sermon second Point third sermon the third one and this is the fourth one amen the requirement of Christ Genesis 40 if you dare you can say amen amen glory to God everybody can hear me okay amen okay good to see you buddy what G Jan there we go good to see you Genesis 40 verse Oneal there yes sir all right and it came to pass after these things that the battler of the king of Egypt and his Baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt amen amen and Pharaoh was angry you know this now against two of his officers against the chief of the Butlers and against the chief of the Bakers and he put them in Word In The House of the captain of the Guard into the prison the place where Joseph was bound so it's a possibility to bind Joseph you might be seated there is a possibility that you can bind Joseph I just read the Bible if my Bible is different than yours you let me know amen amen Joseph was bound Joseph Bound in prison you know who Joseph is Joseph is is who Christ so you can bind Christ amen Christ you done everything you can't stand because we believe the impossible amen amen jum to verse 14 amen and the chief Butler told his dream to Joseph and said to him in my dream Behold a Vine was before me and in the vine were three branches and it was as though he battered you know what it means now the road of haon he was a Divine inversion and her Blossom shut forth and the claster thereof brought forth ripe grapes and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand amen amen and Joseph said to him this is the interpretation of it the three branches which you understand now are three days you know what it means now yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head and restore it's a restoration restore you to your place and you shall deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand after the former manner when you were his battler verse 14 number one but after this restoration after this Deliverance after whatever God is doing have done or is about to do in your life these are the requirement of Joseph but think on me number one was remember me think on me amen amen remember me you know what it means now we went through this amen what is number two my friend and show kindness to show kindness you know what it means amen we went through this show kindness amen and what is number three and make mention of me make mention of me that was last Sunday which means testify of me amen today is the last one number four what is it and bring me out of this house and bring me out of this house bring me out of this house which house is it prison house in other word take me out of prison amen amen let's reread that again the Bible says but think on me when it shall be well with you come on and show kindness I pray you to me and make mention of me to who Pharaoh Joseph is very specific make mention unto Pharaoh because Pharaoh is the king amen Pharaoh is the president he has a power to Pardon amen he has a power to override the law amen he he only has the power to free Joseph Joseph didn't want his testimony to go back to part for are we together talk to Pharaoh Amen in other word the Deliverance is in the hand of pharaoh amen testify of me to Pharaoh amen amen Pharaoh got the Deliverance Pharaoh got theth authority to take me out of this place amen and when you talk to Pharaoh When you mention of me to pharaoh and bring me out of this place but actually it's not going to be the battler bringing him out it's going to be Pharaoh bringing him out after the testimony of the battler because the testimony of the battler in Pharaoh brings Faith amen that's right he brought Faith to Pharaoh amen okay praise God we clear amen that was verse uh 14 job to verse 23 yet did not the chief battler do what remember Joseph but he did what forgot him somebody didn't remember the instructions chapter 41 verse 1 and it came to pass at the end of what two full years so two years have passed wow two years gone completely two years and he came two years this man doesn't remember so Joseph is staying there two years whose fault is it but whose fault is it the Butler and it came to pass at the end of two year two full years that Pharaoh dream dream and behold he stood by the what river if you know this we went through this before this dream came from God you know that Joseph said that it's God who gave you the dream amen so Joseph say go to Pharaoh mention of me to pharaoh and get me out of this place when he left he forgot amen and God followed the instruction of Joseph amen hallelujah and took the dream and sent a package of dream yes sir straight to Pharaoh with the address of pharaoh and the Amazon delivered the dream unto Pharaoh not to Piper to Pharaoh the dream must come from Pharaoh two years amen amen jop to verse uh8 because you know the remaining and it came to pass in the morning that his Spirit the spirit of pharaoh was trouble and he sent and call for All The Magicians of Egypt and all the wise men thereof and Pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them to who Pharaoh because the thing was sealed by God himself amen Only God Can interpret it amen but this dream is just not a dream it's a dream to bring Joseph out of the are we together God calls it verse 9 then spoke the chief battler so this dream brought him back to remembrance because the dream is specific to Pharaoh if maybe the dream went to somebody in the street he will not probably remember that but to remember he have to come from pharaoh and when everything is locked up then something begin to ring in his mind like hey I remember somebody God knows how to put you back in his remembers amen when you forget God God knows what to do to get you back again amen amen he says then he spoke then spoke the chief battler sorry to Pharaoh saying I do remember my fault this day if you notice this man have a tendency to acknowledge his wrong that's good he acknowledges his wrong just like the one on the cross amen amen a knowledge his wrong amen amen amen he acknowledged his wrong first before he gave the testimony Lorden okay that's fine you suck that him Pharaoh was angry with his servant and put me in word in the captain of the guard's house both me and the chief Baker and we dreamed the dream in one night I and he we dream each man according to the interpretation of his dream now he begin to do what they told him to do amen he begin to testify of what happened amen amen and there was there with us a young man a Hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret it amen verse 13 and he came to as he interpreted to us so he was me He restored to my office and him he hanged verse 14 then Pharaoh send no more the battler it's Pharaoh now after he received the testimony he built Faith now Pharaoh say wait a minute this is the man we were looking for all this time where is this man everybody here is unable to interpret the go ahead and get me them but before they can get Joseph out somebody must speak somebody must testify and that testimony bring Faith am and it's the faith of pharaoh that is pulling Joseph out from the prison the faith of pharaoh amen that is taking Joseph out from prison amen amen he says then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph and they brought him hly out of of the dungeon do you see where he was two years and he shaved himself so you can tell what kind of condition that he was there amen he shaved himself and he changed his what R so he changed garment and came in to Pharaoh because Joseph have different garments he have one from his father they took it away then he went to the prison to give him another one then the take this one off and they put another one so there is a sequence of garment it's a whole sermon on that amen but that's not what I'm touching today he says and he shaved himself and changed his Remnant and came into Pharaoh everybody clear let's go to the Book of Luke then we pray you would need your Bible The Book of Luke chap 23:39 if you dare you can say amen amen and one of the mfactor which were hang railed on him saying if you be Christ save yourself and us but the other answering rebuke him on the cross saying do not you fear God so this man somehow has a little something about God in him that even if he's wrong but yet something is ringing into him that knows that man we messed up amen do not you fear God seeing you are in the same condemnation so he acknowledged his fault just like the butler amen amen and we indeed justly yes justly for we receive the due reward of our Deeds but this man now the testimony first acknowledging your own fault then testifying amen he says but this man has done nothing a miss so it looks like this was a true reflection of the battler amen because that's exactly what the battler did he acknowledged his fault and testify he says this man has done nothing nothing wrong nothing a miss and he said to Jesus Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom do you know that this man was going to prison if he ever died a sinner he will go to hell do you know that hell is a prison do you know that Jesus went to preach to the souls in prison amen amen amen amen so when he says remember me it is Jesus to pull him out of prison amen are we together are we together over there Joseph wanted to be pulled out of prison over here this one wanted to be pulled out of prison amen and Jesus said verse 43 verily I say to you today amen you come in out of a prison today shall you be with me in what Paradise so they took him from the prison right there at the cross and

brother Bram says this again he says faith is not that loose amen amen faith faith it's got to be based upon some noted fact you got to know something about what you are having faith in amen before you can have faith in it you got to know what you believing in everybody okay am so we Face must know how uh and what what God's desire is amen what does God want for you amen you must know it first uhuh amen and what God's plan is amen and how to approach God by that plan amen and then we can walk up how boldly to the throne of what and plead what the plan is promised to who us and we already know the will of God that God say beloved are which above what all things that you may what prosper and be what in health even as your soul do what Prosper it so God doesn't want you to prosper only spiritually sir that is in proper teaching because salvation come from the word called Soo it takes all so your normal natural healing and also your spiritual healing so God want you to prosper spiritually and to prosper in your health and to prosper also in every aspect of our life amen and this is God desire for you amen this is God's will for you this is God's plan for you therefore we can have confidence and Faith when we approach God that we must have what he want us to have am because we are approaching him according to will amen amen amen Amen brother brandham continues and he says this in the message the infallable word of God brother Bram say God's word declares Jesus Christ to be who the same how yesterday today and forever same in what power same in what principle same in what healing same as he ever was here now and always was and and always what will be and his attitude has to be what the same toward who every case that he has dealt with or he did it how wrong at the first time when he dealt with the case the way he did it got to be Amen in other word God's word we know that God and His word are one and God's word have a 100% predictability amen oh 100% predictability he have a perfect predictability in other word whatever God say must happen am and the way God treated the case the first time he actually lcks [Applause] God when we are talking about predictability we are talking about consistency something that can be repeated again something a course of action a behavior that is possible to know in advance what to expect am brother Bram says this again in the message expectation he say if God was ever called on the sin to what a sick man and he did and he does what healed him upon the basis of what his pain if another sick man comes to him he's got to do what the same thing or he acted wrong when he healed the first man amen so if God bless you because of a certain condition everybody that come that way must receive the same result amen if you don't receive the same result then God did wrong yes sir everybody together brother brother say if he give the one the holy ghost that obey him in the Bible EX exactly as he promised there in act he said the promis is how unto you and what to your children and then them are for all even as many as the Lord our call Our God shall do what call if the man meet those qualifications God is how obligated in other word God have no choice amen and know these kind of statement are strong but I know my God Amen I know my father amen and this is the way he is amen and let's approach him the way he is amen not the way we think he is but the way he is and his way was expressed by the prophet amen everybody okay he said if the man meets those what qualification God is obligated by what his word to fill him with what the Holy Ghost because if he didn't then he made a mistake and if God made a mistake he's what amen he's no longer God he's finite like what we are so see as Abraham children uh-huh we take God's promise and just do what hold on to it no matter what take place uhhuh we do what hold right there just what the same because God said so and that does what settles it the Bible says in the Book of Malachi that I am God and I change not Amen in other way God is predictable you can send an input and expect an output amen everybody okay God told Joshua that as I was with who Moses with Moses so shall I be with what you and with Moses god opened the right sea that's right which was an obstacle for Moses and the children of Israel so when Joshua face Jordan do you think Joshua have to think twice if God is going to be with me like Moses in Moses he opened the Red Sea this also is water even though the name is narrow at sea but it's still water what do you expect God to do he have to open the water of Jordan because he's the same yesterday today and forever the same in principle the same in essence the same in power the same in healing the same in everything as I was with Moses so shall I be with you so when God speak like that he put Joshua under [Applause] expectation one day there was a younger Prophet who took 10 years to be molded and the prophet was following another Prophet that was Elijah and Elisha amen when they reach Jordan Elisha noticed that Elijah took his mantle wrap it together sir and SM the water of Jordan what happened to the water the water parted together and they went together but when they went to the other side Elijah was taken up but Elijah left the mental and because God is predictable that same mant got to do the same thing amen Amen brother Bram is not here but brother Bram left the message amen and the message is the mental of the Prophet amen so whatever what that ment did with brother he must do do for you amen everybody together and do you know what happened when Elisha came back and faced Jordan the same river that was faced by Elijah with the same Mentor do you know what he says did you see him praying did you see him kneeling down because Elijah never pray and if God opened the Jordan without a prayer for Elijah Elijah also cannot pray because he's under the same anointing even more so the double por am amen amen if one person can do that how much more the double portion that's why Elijah stood he wrapped the mantle again and he said where is the god of Elijah a amen because where is that God that open again that open the Jordan he can also do it again amen and restuck the water and what happen 100% predictability that's why we can put our faith in God that's why we can trust God that's why we can believe God am because God is predictable amen let's go to to the Book of Matthew let's go to the Book of Matthew chapter 9 let me give you three so we can continue Hallelujah Matthew chapter 3 glory to God Matthew 3 oh sorry Matthew 9 verse 20 if you dare amen you can say amen amen we already left the airport so keep your seat Bel because the airplane is still like this okay Matthew 9 verse 20 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say and behold a woman which was diseased with a isue of blood how many years 12 years came how behind him there is even a mystery why she approaches behind because she approaches God On The Backs side the backside of God got a mystery when Sarah had an issue God gave Sarah the backside [Music] are we together are we together he says and he was 12 years came behind him and touched the what h of his G there is a whole mystery to this because the Garment that Jesus wore was according to the way Jesus is in heaven yes sir Jesus had a garment thou never had any any he was whole that was his intimate garment amen and then Jesus had another the Garment on top of that I don't know who's pulling this kind of stuff I'm trying to stay in it amen and Jesus had not the Garment on top of that and that garment was cutting for do you know that the Bible predicted that they parted my garment you remember that and when they caught Jesus Christ they took the top garment and they cuted in four part among the soldier but when they got the intimate garment they look at that they say this one we cannot cut it and they and they and they did what what do you call it cast L on and they pick it up so Jesus had many garment There Was An Intimate garment and another one that was cutting for and there is also the Hem of the Garment all of this reflect Heaven are we together because the intimate garment brother Bram say that was the top of the Holy Spirit you have no no nothing you cannot see like my my shirt you can see that they saw so the put this peace and they put that garment has no peace it's one Spirit but the other one have to be divided in four because you got four living creature around the [Applause] throne then you got the Hem of the Garment let's continue my friend we okay have I lost somebody oh sir okay praise God and the Bible says and he T and Touch the Hem of what His Garment and she said within what herself who T her that show me one scripture in the Old Testament that say that if you touch the Garment of Jesus Christ you're going to be healed brother Bram said there was no scripture in the Old Testament everybody okay so now the scripture came [Music] up okay no problem don't worry my friend let me leave it like this he says and touch and say within herself if I may but touch his what garment I shall be made I shall be how whole but Jesus turned him about and when he saw her he say what daughter be of what good Comfort be of good cheer be of good Comfort your faith so what the woman was saying that if I can only touch the Garment Jesus called that Faith amen Amen on and a faith is a revelation amen so it was revealed to the woman that there is a secret about this man don't worry about touching him because you can't make it there go ahead and touch the H of His Garment amen it was God who revealed to this woman because Jesus recognized that as faith and Faith come from God Amen that's right that's right are we together and remember this Faith was not written in the Bible it was not written in the Old Testament this is the first time such case happened Ames do you follow me we're talking about a 100% predictability everybody okay and the Bible say and Jesus turned him about and when he saw her he says daughter be of good Comfort your faith has made you how whole and the woman was made whole from that what hour so from this time another scripture is added in the Bible right amen [Applause] beautiful don't worry my friend you can choose steak you good amen at the beginning there was no scripture in the Old Testament that says that when the Messiah will come if you touch his H garment you're going to be healed never happened but this woman by faith amen God gave her a scripture amen that was not given in the Old Testament amen and that scripture was given to her and that scripture become part of the New Testament Amen in other what a case open up and God dealt with that case a certain way and the way God dealt with that case is that if you touch just the H of Jesus Christ you can get healed amen so from now on Jesus Christ oh God is locked amen God will never change that scripture anymore sir no sir in other word whoever comes am with an issue and approaches God the same way am and touch the H of garment must be healed amen if not God did wrong let's go to Matthew 14 glory to God Matthew chapter 14 if you dare you can say Amen amen Matthew 14:35 Hallelujah if you thereare you can say amen amen the Bible says in verse 35 and when the man of that place had knowledge of who him him who Jesus Jesus they knew that Jesus was there when they had knowledge of him that head knowledge means when they recognize him amen they sent out into all that country roundabout and brought to him what all that were diseased it doesn't matter what you are troubling as long as you sick all that were what disease and they besought him Jesus that they might only do what Touch the Hem of His Garment everybody okay now everybody okay all they want they say we don't we can touch it because somebody already did it amen and you already healed amen if you heal that person you are doomed amen everyone else who will come again in that same condition you must react the same amen everybody okay he said and besought him that they might only Touch the Hem of His what garment and as many as touch were made how perfectly whole because God is predictable whatever God does for one person God lock himself in other word when God bless somebody God is showing you the way he act amen amen if you have a case in the church I'm talking about living Oracle if something happened in this church and the Lord Heal someone in this church it is God language that if somebody else in this church approaches God the same way as the one that got healed God is under obligation to repeat or to do the same way amen because God is predictable if he doesn't do it then God is wrong he should not have healed the other one the first time so when you hear a testimony open your ears amen when you hear a testimony open your heart amen when you hear your testimony believe God rise for your discouragement and say thank you Jesus Christ if you did it for her praise God you can do it for me am because you are predictable am you are the same yesterday today and forever you can do it again amen from the impossible to the miracle God will believe [Applause] it my God where are you going with this my friend we talking about the fourth request of Joseph where are you building this up my friend where are you going with this this predictability okay amen amen this 100% perfect predictability causes expectation that's right that's right amen because of the fact that God is predictable because of the fact that God can repeat himself over because of the fact that God is the same yesterday today and forever amen that automatically put the people of God and the expectation this predictability this predictability amen amen generate or give birth to expectation amen amen amen so you not just believe in God like that you already seen God working in somebody El's life you already seen somebody's life change am you saw somebody who was in the street back again and change and become a Believer because of that he unconsciously create an expectation [Applause] am do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me yes sir if you follow me say amen glory to God and this expectation if it's not met this expectation if it's not satisfied he causes tension that's right oh GL he causes frustration he brings confusion because God doesn't change so and so GED and I try the same thing I'm not getting it it put you under frustration it is a normal reaction because we need to know why it's not [Applause] working the time of sitting in the message churches and hoping is off we must know why it's not working amen amen why did he work for you but it's not working for you we need to figure it out what wrong amen it give frustration amen it brings discouragement puzzles our mind I heard that you the same why I don't see you let's go to the book of J chapter 6 Hallelujah don't worry my friend I will rob you in the [Applause] message let's go to the Book of Judges Hallelujah judges is before roof Judges chapter 6 you follow me carefully my friend make sure we stay focus because I don't want you miss this if not we are doing religion over again amen amen amen amen judges chapter 6 if you dare you can say amen amen verse one if I cross this then we begin to sore quickly and the children of Israel did what evil in the sight of who the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the midan how many years seven years God promised Israel that if you messed up I will get you in trouble when Israel mxed up there is an expectation am it's predictable something is going to happen amen if you can remember the whooping come on now Brother come on now brother if I correct myself you must also remember the blessing right did you get that well do you get that well when we messed up you bringing the whooping but if we correct remember also what comes with correction you need to bring it up too it's a package it goes together it's a [Applause] comboo are we together are we together verse two and the Hand of Midian did what prevailed against Israel and because of the medidan the children of Israel made them what the dance which are what in the mountain where then Cav and where in strongholds all kind of saving plan let's go my friend and so it was don't worry and so he was go ahead and so he was when Israel had SE that the midianite came up and the amalik and the children of the East even they came up against who them and they encamp against them when the paycheck is coming when it's Friday amen amen the amalik are already waiting there the children of the Exile are already waiting there because they know that today is Friday today is Thursday Thursday evening they already waiting there some are already in the bank account they already got you overdraft no don't worry I'm not going to touch that let's continue some other things amen amen amen don't worry you will say Amen in yourself amen he says and they encamp against them that's a simple example so you can catch what I'm saying amen and they encamp against them and destroy the increase of the earth not even using it destroying it amen until you come to Gaza and left no what sustenance in other word no prod juice for Israel neither what she no what US no what us so how can I build up everything for the whole year and you come and kill destroy destroy destroy and they left you and they go we talking about predictability amen for they came up with their what cattle and with their what T and they came as grasshopper grasshoppers for multitude for both day and C where how without number and they enter into the land to do what destroy it and Israel was very or greatly Rich no can you read that word the way it's written in the Bible impoverish means what poor you looking at me like I did something wrong impoverish and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the who the midianites and the children children of Israel cried to the Lord watch carefully now and it came to pass when the children of Israel cried to the Lord because of the medanite somebody begin to go in prayer amen that the Lord sent what a prophet so the way of Correction first come by a prophet amen so when you see a prophet in the Land There is already hope [Applause] there is an instruction that is coming back sir are we together number one a prophet comes you following me a Prophet come to the children of Israel which said to them th say the Lord God of Israel follow carefully I brought you up from what Egypt is it a present or a past follow me carefully come on and brought you forth out of the house of what B is he present or past and I deliver you out of the hand of the Egyptian present or past and out of the hand of all that oppress you present or pastor and drove them out from before you present or pastor and gave you the land present or pastor and I said to you I am I am the Lord your God fear not the god of the Amorite in whose land you dwell but you have not obeyed my God is rebuking them putting them back in line we clear the message is finished next verse and there came an angel of the Lord so after the prophet follow what Angel brother Bram say he was not an angel but the angel amen of the Lord which is the pillar of fire so the pillar of fire follow the prophet amen amen number one a prophet must come number two following the prophet god of the Prophet The God That Sent the prophet himself step on the scene after the message so whenever you hear a message from a prophet the god they know that behind the prophet there is a God that is coming amen and brother Bram say a new testament Prophet is a preacher amen so whenever a preaching message is coming here God is already behind that am are we together are we together praise God verse 11 and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under the oak tree which was in Oprah that pertained to joash the abizer and his son was who Gideon threshold Tres with by the one press to hide it from what the medit now please the airplane is like this put your seat Bell because they are asteroid the prophet spoke yes he nothing changed that's right Gideon is still hiding food do you follow me normally when a prophet speaks Deliverance must come but it looks like after the message on on on the people condition seems to be like they're not changing can I continue then the Lord himself step on the scene and find out the people in that condition of fear that they have to hide stuff from the medion listen to what brother brandham said before we move forward brother R him say now I want you to notice another thing that might encourage you immediately after that Prophet message what the Lord appeared on the scene amen as soon as he gave his message the Lord did what appeared under a tree the Lord came after the message of the Prophet sitting where under a tree the people fell away got off in their ISM God sent what his Prophet soon as the prophet got through with his message the Lord did what followed the prophet's message for what Deliverance oh we are living in a what a grand time immediately when the prophet went off the scene what happened the Lord came on the scene as soon as John went what off the scene the Lord did what came on the sea very strange how God works amen but he does he does it works in the what mysterious ways are we together are we together the message came the message was delivered but even though the message was delivered the condition have not changed yet we still suffering the same thing that's right you you you are telling us about the gods that did this did did this this did this then God himself came you following me watch how God begin to act you there verse 12 and the angel you see now he was first an angel now they say the Angel that's why the prophet is perfectly in line with the scripture am and the angel of the Lord appeared to who him Gideon and said to him what the Lord is with thee the Lord is where with thee is with you you who Mighty Man of Valor so when he was hiding the thing God was already with him God God my God can I continue he says the Lord is with you he didn't say now the Lord have come to you he said the Lord is with with you you Mar man of Val somebody who's hiding something who is afraid but God is looking he said Mar man of brother Bram say when the prophet was giving the message Gideon was sitting there Hallelujah are we together I'm going slowly my friend we're going to reach there you there amen verse 13 and Gideon said to him amen oh my Lord if the Lord be with who us why then is all this what befalling us because I'm frustrated you are preaching to us God did this God Deliver us God did this God did we believe it but why are we like this because predictability give expectation but when expectation is not met it CS confusion [Music] am it bring a lot of question are we believing the right thing or not Hallelujah it put you into a lot of strength okay they are telling us that God is this God this this God is why are we in this condition then come on let's go my friend verse 13 and Gideon said to him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all of this what befalling us and where is all his Miracle amen because he's a predictable God Amen yes sir whatever he did with Moses he did it with Joshua where is his Miracle are we together yes where is his Miracle which Our Father did what us saying did not the Lord do what bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord have done what forsaken us and Deliver us into the hand of what Med so the man was confused that's right come on because the expectation is not met I listened to the prophet I heard what he says our father told us that God did so and so so why are we in this condition then and you are coming you telling me the Lord is with me and my and and most I'm a mighty man of H so if I'm a mighty man of H and the Lord is with me where is that God where is the god of Elijah hallu I want to see him now because I'm still hiding food [Music] [Applause] are we together are we together verse 14 and the Lord look upon him and say what go in this thy might with the little strength that you have there go and you shall do what save Israel from what from the hand of the midianites have I not what sent thee verse 15 and he said to him oh my Lord wherewith shall I save Israel now the complexes begin to come out behold my family is how poor they were already poor everybody was poor the Bible say Israel was in poverish so what is povery have to do here my family is poor in manasse and I am what the least in my father's house don't you think God knew all of this when God chose you he does it by his own off amen it is his own choosing in other word God can never make a mistake in his [Music] choosing I knew that you were the least of the family I know that you are poor I know what's going on but I also know what I built for amen and based on what I built you I am sending my word to match what I built you with so this message is not about your family it's not about your GNA it is not about whether your father is which or not it's about what did God plan for you in other word God is speaking according to his plan you are speaking according to what you see here God is saying Mary Men of Valor you say look at me Mary Men of Valor God is not looking at you like that God is not looking at your muscle it is not the size of the dog in the fight it is the S of the fight in the do amen amen even if you are short like this it doesn't matter goath was big but the little brought him down amen amen amen so never look at your si never look at your complexion don't even change your complexion stay the way God created you you are built for somebody you are built for something am Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory go with the strength that you have and you going to do it but the man is looking he say wait a minute you spoke all about this thing where is that God amen amen because that predictability causes expectation an expectation if it's not met it brings strength it bring question it brings confusion it bring discouragement like wait a minute they keep preaching preaching about this but why are we in such a condition it is legitimate amen because God must react because God must remain the same oh something is wrong somewhere are we together are we together are we together yes so we found out that Joseph in prison I already built the

the people if they don't get everything they ask for the first time they pray they seem to think that he's what dead what we need is what men and woman today of what a gallant Spirit men and women who

to him and do it believe and what will happen he'll answer amen [Applause] we put God in prison and we made him look bad that's right by our tradition that's right by our Creeds of false Doctrine in this message not the way William Mayan Bram thought because if you preach the way brother Bram thought he will re produce the same thing the same God that Vindicated him will vind you if you hiding the message if you are ashamed of the message if you don't want to qu the message how can the people expect the god of that [Applause] message amen it's a god that is predictable whatever he did he can do it again and he want you to call on him he want you to get him out of the prison so he can can have more freedom more Liberty to do what he want to do in your life get the limit off of God get the Restriction off of God get your theology off of God let me drive this my friend so we can go home do you know what happened when they took Joseph out the prison let's go to Genesis 41 prise the Lord I'm two minute over let me drive this so we can go home amen amen amen amen Genesis 41 if you there you can say amen amen verse 38 you there amen after Joseph came out of the prison and he display everything because God is predictable I'm amen that's why the dream was sent back to Pharaoh because what God what Joseph did to the battler he interpreted a dream so God sent the dream to be interpreted again because God is predictable Joseph said the interpretation belong to God if he interpreted the first Dream he must interpret the second dream no matter how hard that dream seems to be because Pharaoh had a double dream but the other one had only one so even if it's a double dream the same God is predictable Joseph never thought Pharaoh let give me time to pray the same way he reacted with the battle the same way he was introduced to Pharaoh is the same way he's going to replicate himself with his result and he opened up and and and broke the seal and interpret the dream again because what God open and another the opportunity to get him out of trouble you think you put to the corner you think things are tight it's another opportunity for you to get him out of prison remember him you left him in prison you are tight in a corner you don't know what to do things don't work the way you want it it's a way he want to remind you that remember you left me in the prison you only thought I can do in your life only one time I'm still there get me out of the prison and I will prove to you what I can do again the same way I did for you if I can take care of that [Music] dialysis [Music] amen you only left me a dialysis I'm just just limited to dialysis I can do more for you dialysis was just the [Applause] beginning amen hallelujah let's see when you get him out of prison what happened amen verse 38 and Pharaoh said to his servant can we find such a one as this is a man in whom what the spirit of God is and Pharaoh said to Joseph for as much as God has showed you all of this how did Pharaoh know that God show him amen as much as God has showed you all of this there is none so discret and wise as you are you shall be over my what house the potential of Joseph now begin to increase from the prison to the house of pharaoh now he have when he's out of the prison and he performs something now he's taking control of the House of pharaoh if he's in prison he cannot control the house of pharaoh but when you take him out of prison he take a hold of the House of phoh because now he's free he's unlimited now amen Pharaoh says that you shall be over a my house come on and according to your word shall who all my people now he's no longer over the house of pharaoh he's over all the land of Egypt he cannot do that in prison he need to get out of prison now he's taking off a pharaoh house is taking over all over Egypt amen amen the Bible says you shall be over all my people beule only in the throne will I be greater than you wow are you there Hallelujah verse 41 and Pharaoh said to Joseph see I have set you all the what all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it in what Joseph's hand and they aray him in what vestures of and now the Garment have changed mhm wow amen not the Garment get on the Garment of Praise for a garment is changing am from the spirit of heaviness to a Garment of Praise to a fine lenen because Joseph now is free as he's free he's taking control and you know the story he never only took control of Egypt he took control of the ire world even in the land of Canaan because he was free from the prison your God is powerful your God is mighty the God of this message is real the God is this message is alive this message is not a history this message came to take to lift God out of history and brother Bram preach that message brother brandham did his part he took God out of his history brother Bram is gone but the god of brother Bram that Pillar of Fire is with you now it's your turn to take God out of History amen for your own life amen for your own family amen for your own children amen for your own church amen take God out of your own history take the limit off of God and let him take over your job let him take over your house like he did for the house of pharaoh and everything in Egypt Prosper have you noticed that the year of Plenty started only after Joseph interpreted the dream that's right that's right right amen he didn't started only after Joseph interpreted the dream and when they gave Joseph the appropriate position then the years of plenty started and there was more weight that they could not number for you to reach a point where you got more we that you cannot number get Joseph out of prison put him in his position and let him do what he want to do take God out of your prison am let God have his way am and let God do what he want to do for your own life God richly bless you let's stand [Applause] amen as you bow ahead talk to that God call him off the sin call him for your own life and remove those limitation in our families we are always this that is the limitation you put on God that's not what God says God didn't tell you that yeah amen Jesus himself when he came he says the work that I do you will do also and you will do even greater work God wants you to do greater things than himself so why do you limit God the Bible says that there are many things that Jesus have done that was not written in this Bible so you are restricting God to operate only a certain way brother Bram say what you see in me temporarily you're going to see it how in its fullness in the BR if what he had is temporary what expectation do we have then and if that expectation is not satisfying we begin to have questions because we were taught wrong today you taught that God is predictable today you taught that God can do even exceedingly and abundantly above all that you can ask and think get him out of your prison talk to him as they playing Softly [Music] Hallelujah you didn't speak this word he spoke it and he Duty bound to his word don't P God like he's not able to do what you want to ask him to do don't pity him God don't want to be pity he want to be recognized as [Music] God no matter what God does in your life never leave him in a prison bring him out for something [Music] greater Hallelujah [Music] when they brought Joseph out the prison wherever he was going every knee were bowing down and one of these day it's going to happen let's get him out of prison Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this
