if they own two credit cards and had to knock it off that was very good but I keep it and I'll deal with you and I show you because the Holy Spirit showed me something I even missed in the scripture about had to attack a debt and pay it completely off amen so you pray for me all will be well and the young men meeting I'm waiting on brother patriarch usually brother you give brother double work back and forth back and forth before he come up with a date so make up your mind please and let's come up with something so we can move on Amen and Lord's willing on April the 27 that's our question and answer so April 20th 20 young Sisters Meeting young men to be announced and then April 27 27 that is our question and answer amen I apologized last Sunday I have to rush quickly with the last quat because I was trying to get to a point and then when I was sitting in my living room preparing the sermon brother random spoke something and a quot came up to me I said wow so I'm going to read it to you amen this message got everything everything is in this message it's amazing and usually when I prepare the sermon brother Bram is praying and before you know it whatever he says on the tape is what I over there then I know my direction is clear Amen brother Bram says this in the stature of a perfect man he says I'm getting started late this morning or no about 15 minutes earlier so it looks like today I'm starting early amen and so then we shall take our time now amen amen let me move this way brother Bram say we shall take our time now because we don't want to get in a hurry when you get in a hurry then you just ruin the things you were going to say I was listening at the tape at a tape the other day as I told you and I got so ashamed of myself not what I was saying it is not the message but the way I was saying it too fast and he kills the translator back there too fast and it's just a nervous pitch I feel like doing what waiting so these lessons or teaching are very important so I will try my best to go as slow as I can and take my time if we have to preach 20 series let's go with 20 series by the way we preach roof all the way to 90 something so if we need to take our time let's take our time and make sure you get the material and we move on this is not the Era of Confusion everything is happening in this world rapidly Iran start attacking Israel so you better wake up up because something it's a preparation toward Armageddon but thank God Armageddon won't happen with me here Amen in other word armag won't happen with me having this body I must have a glorified body amen and then when I have a glorified body meaning no bullet can do anything to me no drone no weapon can do anything to me amen that's when I can come back amen and handle the entire world in armagedon and I will fight for Israel amen I will stand for Israel because my God stand for Israel and my God say pray for the Peace of Jerusalem we are Christian we are believer we believe in our religion who started over there in Palestine it's time to Show Your [Applause] Colors showing color Buddhists are showing the color homosexual are showing the color what about you I need to show you my color not only as a Christian but as a message believer someone who believ the message of William Marion Bram I am proud to be a dentified with the pillar of fire I am proud to be identified with the clouds you touch that picture you touch me that is a perfect Vindication that the message is the truth let people know who you are and which side you [Applause] taking so people will know how to handle you and how to deal with you everybody clear so far Glory Glory Glory to God let's go to our scripture then I feel like all engine are warmed up pretty good somebody's ready to take a flight sir Oh Glory to God I didn't intend to read this one it's not there but I felt L like if I'm going and some of you don't know what happened you will have a hard time picking up unless you already read the story how many read Genesis 39 the whole chapter okay some of you don't so let me just help you up okay because when I would try to travel I want to make sure you catching what I'm saying amen let's first go to Genesis 39 instead of Genesis 41 amen amen how can a Christian country don't have Christian standing amen all the Christian are coward amen amen when somebody attack the message they're not even afraid they attacking the message plainly and if I stand for the message I will be plain amen oh God if not I believe even if you are convinced of the message you following are you if we need to separate because of this message sub it [Music] amen what am I going to lose lose the heaven because of you you stay in this hell yourself Genesis 39:6 Hallelujah see devil whenever you try to attack a service this is how he turn verse six and he left this is part for all that he had in Joseph hand so there is nothing that is not given to Joseph and he knew not anything he had what a confidence amen save in other words except the bread which he did eat that the only thing he was worrying about whether he's going to eat a salmon or a steak today that's the only thing beside that Carefree Joseph is handling everything amen you might be seated save the bread which he did it and Joseph was a Godly person a goodly person a goodly a handsome that's right that's what it means that's right nowhere have they mentioned about the beauty of Joseph it's only unveil in the house of Piper when he was in Canan nobody say he was a handsome boy nobody say he look good we only heard about the coat of many color but in the house of P we found something else about Joseph he looked good when he put his suit on I was referring to my translator he look good I was referring to my translator don't say that I'm referring to myself now I was looking at my translat amen amen so he was a goodly person a handsome man in the house of Piper a goodly person what happened with this in the house of Piper he was a goodly goodly means he is a handsome look good nice looking fellow no headache thank you my brother I appreciate it thank you thank you thank you amen he was a goodly person and he was well favored oh yes so if you look at him you will like him amen amen he says and he came to pass after these things when he was promoted so high everything under his hand that his master's wife if you notice his trouble started by a woman the trouble of David started by women amen you don't know that amen it was the women that start singing s have killed ,000 and David 10,000 that start the trouble because he was under mentorship under mentorship the trouble started with the sisters not you sister you are very good because this is a bad ill Fame woman but there is a key here then she cast her eyes upon Joseph in other words at the beginning it looks like she didn't see anything now he looks like why boy looking good why is a married woman looking at the young man brother lock it for the married people [Laughter] wow amen look it only for the married people amen something is going on you got to read between the line you got to read between the line no problem let me leave it alone they say Amen you heard amen but he refused and said to his master's wife behold my master knows not what is with me in the house what a confidence that's right P don't even know how much money he got in the bank account he have to call Joseph and say how much is in First Citizen Bank and what about Fifth Third in Bank of America and Joseph say in Bank of America it's this in W Faro you got this and this is how many assets you got he said thank you very much amen amen he said and he knows not what is with me in the house and he has committed all that he has to my hand there is none greater in this house than I nobody in the house of Piper that is greater than Joseph the top is Piper himself so from the house of Piper you can see the position of this boy amen amen none greater than I neither has he kept back anything from me but thee you you are the only thing I cannot touch everybody okay everybody good amen so if we look in the house of part the top number one is p amen amen and his wife amen then you got Joseph then everybody else down amen so the highest position is Piper and his wife because the two are amen amen so Joseph say everything done here belong to me it's under my care the only position I cannot reach is this one because if I touch this one I have entered the territory of Piper as long as I don't touch you me and P are different amen amen amen everybody okay in the back amen we clear I want you to keep this in mind amen amen he says verse uh n there is no one greater in this house than I neither has he kept anything from me but who the the only thing P I say not this one it is only wife everything else Joseph you can go up in the refrigerator go do whatever you want to do in the refrigerator that's not my problem amen amen he say because you are his wife how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God are we there amen verse 10 and it came to pass as she spoke to Joseph how day by day wow remember Samson fell I know what I'm saying DEA went day by day and Samson fell and Joseph also day by day but Joseph did not Fa Day by Day day by day like a daily bread amen amen amen a persistent woman amen amen day by day that he hearken not unto her to her to do what Lie by her to lie by by her or to be what with her in other word even if they say Joseph come and sit here sit closer here I don't want to do it because closer tomorrow is not going to be closer you're going to find yourself sitting somewhere even sitting closet no young people young man sitting Clos and no you a human being warm blooded I went through this in a hotel amen he say not sit by her or lie by her or to be with her verse 13 11 and it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business his work and there was none of the men of the house there inside she said okay this is a good trap let me take my opportunity and she caught him by His Garment very aggressive woman exactly is an aggressive woman is not good that's right that's right aggressive don't mean you have to only Touch by hand you can be aggressive in Behavior amen amen provoking amen amen amen he said and she CAU him by His Garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and did what and fled and got him what out and it came to pass when she saw that he had left His Garment in her hand and he was what fled forth let's stop right there keep that in mind day by day she did it she was the only one on top of Joseph so the top of Joseph is part and his wife are we clear a goodly young man are we clear amen now let's go to Genesis 41 verse 38 Lord help me this thing is loaded so I don't know where I'm going to stop I'm going to stop where the Holy Spirit want me to stop because if I try to download this it's not going to happen you will stay here longer amen amen so we stop where God want us to stop 41 amen verse 38 and Pharaoh said to his servant can we find such a one after he already unveiled the seals and broke all the symbols of the dream can we find anyone that is such as this one a man over whom in whom I'm just reading the Bible my friend is my Bible different than Amen in whom in whom today she's on fire Amen in whom Amen in whom the spirit of God is what is so according to Pharaoh the spirit of God is inside Joseph I'm reading the b a spirit of God is in is within inside of this man why look at what he did nobody was able to break the seals he came and broke the whole thing amen amen and Pharaoh said to Joseph for as much as God has showed you all this there is none so discreet and wise as you are no one like you you shall be over my house he be to remove everything whatever Pharaoh had jurisdiction he begin to take off his hand in other word I take off you take off take this take this take this because now I can rest amen amen amen amen now I found somebody that I can give confidence and then I can rest amen hallelujah I found somebody who's wiser than anyone am in Egypt because the spirit of the Lord is in him amen amen he said You shall be over my house and according to your word very carefully you taking over my house amen amen and according to your what word the voice of Joseph did not change no the peit of Joseph did not change so if Joseph speak he's still speaking the same way with the same voice and if you knew Joseph before you can tell that's Joseph speaking there but the problem is this time when he speak with the same voice amen amen amen things begin to move amen amen I don't know if you understanding amen when Joseph was going toward Pharaoh if Joseph say would you open the door please people are looking at him now who are you who you talking to amen but when he's coming out from Pharaoh with the same voice am that's why you don't have to change your voice when you praying for people amen amen amen amen the devil is not scared about how how how big your voice is amen hallu now devil come out come out that's not what take the devil out no it don't you might have a sister's voice but the devil need to know the authority behind your voice amen that is what moved the devil amen it is not the police officer it is who does the police officer mean what does he mean amen the police officer can be a woman which of course is a disgrace according to brother Bram but even if she's a disgrace if she stop you you're not going to move your car not because she's a woman because of the authority behind amen amen amen are we together are we together amen so Pharaoh say a according to your word so now when Joseph is coming up he say open the door even if he say open the door they're not going to do it like no quickly amen they don't care about the voice they care about the man amen and the position of the man amen are we okay amen are we okay amen so even if you tired you don't have to holler at the Devil [Applause] sir if you full of energy you can let him hear your voice you say Satan get out but if you tired you don't have to scream you can turn around and say Satan get out he will still obey amen if you know who you are amen amen everybody okay everybody okay amen glory to God this is going differently brother Kelly so I'm trying he said You shall be over my house and according to your word what happened to the word of pharaoh according to your word shall some no all all my people be what ru so who's now ruling Egypt Jose I'm reading the Bible my friend the word of Joseph amen begin to rule all all no exception all my people everybody whatever Joseph say happen Joseph doesn't have to move a chair he just speak and the chair move amen amen it is up to you who are run to figure how to move the chain not Joseph Joseph just speak if he say I want to eat a steak today you figure it out where who got the steak and the best one to bring it to him and make sure it's not burned amen it is cooked well because you're going to get in trouble I hope you sucking I'm saying sir glory to God he says only in the what Throne only in the throne will I be what greater greater than you amen verse 41 and Pharaoh said to Joseph see I have set you over what all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh took off his wing not somebody else Ring The Ring that Pharaoh used to wear he took it off wow amen amen from his hand and put it upon who Joseph's hand a transfer of power amen that's right so no longer that ring exist in the hand of pharaoh if you go in the finger of pharaoh you won't find it it is somewhere in the finger of Joseph in other word an authority of pharaoh is already bestowed to Joseph in other word you can find in Joseph a fair amen Hall you can if you look at Joseph you need to look at him good because Joseph got things of pharaoh in him [Applause] Hallelujah are we together amen are we together amen everybody okay amen every okay amen so some of the stuff that belong to Pharaoh are no longer in Pharaoh if you need them you need to find them in Joseph amen if you go to Pharaoh Pharaoh say go to [Music] [Applause] Joseph so you need to know which door you are going to amen that's why brother Bram sometimes say if Jesus stand here he won't do anything to [Applause] you because he did it am you need to know where to find those St amen this message my friend he recalibrate our Christian Life it help us understand God [Applause] Better Have I Lost somebody no sir glory to God he says he took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph hand and did what arrayed him investors of fine linen investors let me keep that name that way vestures of what fine linen fine linen so how many vure was it one one or many many many vesture or many garment amen amen but all of them of what fine linen so he got a garment of this fine linen a garment of this fine Lin the government of this fine L everybody okay so Joseph might have many titles amen ameny sometime he's wonderful amen he's counselor amen he's Prince of Peace amen he's the Mighty God Amen he's even the Everlasting amen one person amen are we together are we together amen Oh Glory to God he says and he put a water a gold chain about his neck you will see this probably even in Daniel he put a gold chain about what his neck and he made him to ride in the second Chariot which he had he was pharoh and they CED die before him do what bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of what Egypt brother Bram say when they were crying the trumpet was standing but I don't see any trumpet here where did Brother Bram get this are we together amen are we together the Bible says in the book of Psalm 8 one verse three blow up the water trumpet when in the new moon and when in the time appointed and when on our solemn feast day for this was a statute for what for Israel and a law of God of who of Jacob so this was for Israel to do what to blow the trumpet to blow the trumpet this he ordained in what in Joseph the message in the Bible are perfectly in line amen this he ordained in who Joseph for a what a testimony when he went out through the land of Egypt amen so Joseph going through the land of Egypt when I heard a language that I understood not Joseph going through the land of Egypt he had a trumpet there that's why brother brandham say a trumpet sounded I thought somebody I believe yesterday or something that if you preach this message and what you are preaching contradict the Bible you're preaching the message wrong amen that's right the message is right the Bible is right your understanding is wrong amen the message will always flash with the Bible amen because the message and the Bible are one amen amen amen amen no Doctrine in this message can contradict the Bible something is wrong with what you're preaching everybody okay so there was a trumpet that blow and when the trumpet blow everybody need to Bow their knees why because Joseph is coming everybody clear amen everybody clear amen let's go to verse uh 44 and Pharaoh said to Joseph I am pharaoh and without you do you you know what that means without your permission without your permission or without you shall no man lift up his what hand or what or foot where in all the land of Egypt no one wow you want to move your hand you need to say Joseph please can I move my hand you want to move your feet you say Joseph can I move move my feet what a power amen amen amen even a hand and a foot you cannot touch you cannot move it without Joseph saying one thing in other word no F nothing can go through Egypt without Joseph knowing it wow are we together amen are we together amen verse 45 and Pharaoh called Joseph name what Z do you know what Z means it's the man to whom hidden things are revealed did you hear that or it means the man who reveals Mysteries amen amen because he just reveal the dreams amen what I want you to keep is when Joseph is brought before Pharaoh do you follow me amen his name change let's pray so I can s my friend Heavenly Father Lord we

amen my subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part seven amen amen we clearly follow me carefully because I'm trying to tell take my time slowly and not to rush we clearly establish in Joseph five garment are we clear amen garment number one is Coat of Many Colors we went through this number two is a coat of a servant this is where we are or a slave everybody okay number three is a coat of a prisoner we clear number four four is a code to appear before Pharaoh I'll give you all the scripture that's why I ask if you were up to date with the sermon amen and number five is a quote of fine lenon amen and we find that it was many of them fine Lon amen that was given to him we established this clearly and we last Sunday we found out that one coat make way to the other coat amen One open up the way just like the caterpillar until you get to the butterfly you remember that amen amen and we found out that the one who sent Joseph to Egypt to become a slave is God Amen even though naturally speaking it looks like he was his brother but he was not his brother Joseph said you didn't send me there the one who sent me was God in other word the one who began the work amen the one who initiated the work amen the one who triggered the work the one who initiated the process is not Joseph he was not his brother he was God Amen in in other words the alpha of Joseph story is God and God never stop us the alpha when he is Alpha he must be also Omega when he is the a he must be also the Z amen and whenever God started something Paul says this in Philippian 1 verse 6 he said be confident of this very very thing be confident of what that he which has what begun a good work he didn't began a bad work no sir do you see my my screen whatever God started in you is a good work amen because you were created for good work amen do you know that the Bible say in Ephesians 2 you were created for good work amen so whenever God started with you the devil can trouble you left and right but the day God will crank your engine [Applause] the day God will start his process his transforming process he's developing process in you Paul say be confidence in this amen hallelujah amen that the one who has begun a what a good work in in in you will do what perform it until the day of what of Jesus Christ so when God start with you he won't let you go no sir until the day you going to see Jesus amen in other words God won't quit even if you want to quit God doesn't quit amen wherever you go God will chase you down amen until you reach the day of redemption amen because it's not you who started the work it is not me who started the work it is not brother BR it is God Amen God doesn't start a job and stop in the middle way when God started he have to fulfill everything amen because he's a God of perfection amen Moses told him he said look if these people died in the wilderness do you know what they will say of you they will say you pull them in the I mean from Egypt to let them die over when God heard that he said I'm not going to kill them anymore I forgive them hey take the atonement go ahead and do this do this and I forgive Israel why because God when he started something am he will always finish it amen and when he started a good work good work and he will lead you to Perfection which is the summit of the good work amen yes sir are we together amen are we together amen are we together and we found also that when Joseph was sent to Egypt when he was sold in Egypt he was sold to a country that he was seen his race was seen as the lowest race that's right amen amen because to the Egyptian the Hebrew were an Abomination am in other words the he the Egyptian despised the Hebrew amen amen they despised the Hebrew or they esteemed the Hebrew low because they were Shepherd are we there amen are we there amen so if Joseph is a perfect tap of Jesus Christ and Joseph life goes through five garment everybody okay so Jesus also must go through five garment amen amen are we together let me state it again if Joseph is the perfect typ of the Lord Jesus Christ and Joseph life is going through five garment Jesus also must follow the same pattern amen because Joseph was a foreshadow of the Lord Jesus Christ he was a preview of Jesus Christ amen everybody okay amen he was a TY but Jesus was the ANP amen Jesus was the Fulfillment of what Joseph was previously showing in the Old Testament everybody okay amen everybody okay now to decode this garment into the life of Jesus Christ which we're going to do with me me and you together amen so when I ask the two you give the two we cut and we keep moving into the surgery because we're going to work together and find this five garment in the life of Jesus Christ am because it's important to understand that this happened to Jesus Christ because if it happened to Jesus Christ we have a key am connected to that it's very important to make sure it happen to Jesus Christ if it happened to Jesus Christ that's he yes sir then we in good shape amen do you follow me amen do you follow me so to start decoding this garment we need to understand a principle brother Bram says this in the things that are to be he says this old Tabernacle Earthly Tabernacle here you know what it is this body everybody has it amen is like a what an old coat that you wear we're going slowly brother Bram say the body that you have is like a coat it's like a garment it's like a jacket are we following are we together he says it's like a coat old coat that you wear a coat that you want where but now you have one so much better you don't use it anymore if you got a brand new cloth and the other one is worn out you won't use it anymore Amen brother Bram say what do you do you hang it where in the closet for you got what one better you got a better coat it's more up to date than the one you used to wear that one is worn out M what it is what that garment you inside of that day on now Lord in other word they true you is not really the way the one we're seeing here that's the reason why when somebody die we leave your coat right there uhhuh and we take it to the cemetery and it's going to be destroyed but you are somewhere amen you are only living in the jacket uh-huh you are only living inside a car uh-huh are we together amen so we have never seen one another another really we hear somebody that is talking inside through this jacket right here brother Bram say you are inside of that there that garment only done what he bore your image because you are invisible we need to connect you to something then we say this is Brother CH but truly brother CH is not this one brother CH is the man inside this one amen so this is a physical image that's why Jesus Christ this man was the visible image of the invisible God Amen because God is a spirit we cannot see God when you see this one you see the father because me and my father We Are One amen are we clear together amen are we together glory to God brother Bram say that government only done what he bore your image am see but you don't you don't need it anymore now you have got you you have hung it up it's a rug and that's the way this old body is he bore the image of what the Heavenly let me leave that alone because you got another body over there and that body look like this one everybody okay so this is a reflection of what happened somewhere amen you got many cars my brother don't worry remember Joseph garment amen remember Joseph is changing garment and brother Bram say a garment is a body am I want you to keep that in mind he says yet it is not you you are inside of that body you the spirit of God is on the inside of what the body that is what makes the outside come into what subjections because the is inside is what it's pulling it see it's bringing in line with what the word of God your inside you yourself your what being but is saying when you got the holy spirit inside of you now the spirit of the Lord is controlling your body and pulling you and bringing you subject to the word of God Amen if you don't have the Holy Ghost then you're going to struggle but the Holy Ghost is the one pulling your body under custody amen so that your body can obey the word of God yes sir are we together brother Bram continue with this quote he says this body is just what an old C and someday what will you do with it for you was only in the Garment for a while that is like the Earthly garment what body body this body your real body your real self is on the inside of this court that you call what William brand or what or Susie Jones or what whoever it is someday it will be hang in the earth Hall of what memory of you you shall be put Yonder in the grave and somebody will put what a tombstone up here lies reverent what so and so or John so and so or so and so it shall lie there as a what Memorial of what I want you to understand brother Bram is saying that this body is a garment and Joseph went through five garment and Joseph being a top of the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus also must go through five garments amen and garments are bodies [Music] amen are we together are we together a government is a body whatever happened in Joseph was in the natural Jesus will do it in the spiritual amen are we together amen so quat number one because we going with the coat of many colors in the life of Jesus Christ brother Bram says this I mentioned this last Sunday that's all right who Joseph one of the patriarch saw down where into Egypt a perfect typ of who of Christ betrayed by who his Brethren sold for a few pieces of silver about 30 pieces about just like who Christ was he wore a coat of water of Many Colors as Christ was seen in Revelation one sitting on the throne with a what a rainbow over him if you go to the Book of Revelation you will see Jesus Christ with a rainbow of seven colors so Jesus Christ also have seven colors with him am he had a covenant with him in heaven amen and if you notice the coat of many color never made it to Egypt right amen am he stayed with the father do you remember he stayed with the father even when they took it away from Joseph they return it back to the father are we together so in heaven Jesus have a rainbow round about his glove round about his head a rainbow of seven colors so his position I with the father is where he have the cat of Many Colors amen do you follow me amen are you following me amen are you following me brother Bram say as Joseph had a coat of many he was a reflection of Jesus Christ in heaven with the father having also a rainbow of seven colors around his head amen because the seven color means Covenant amen like the rainbow thr fish which is a fish of a covenant amen but Jesus must leave this manle right here and come down into a mantle of a servant amen that's why God begin to condescend uh-huh God begin to come down from being Jehovah the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with who God God the father but the word was made what flesh and dwell where Among Us so God must change court amen everybody okay Jesus must change garment Jesus have to move from the Heavenly garment into an Earthly garment but remember whenever Joseph was leaving his father Homeland which is the heaven for Jesus Christ coming into the Earth amen when Joseph was leaving Israel going into Egypt Joseph was despised wow Joseph was seen as a man below exactly and the Bible says in Isaiah 53 amen are we together have I lost somebody have i l the Bible say in Isaiah 53 that Jesus is what desp and what rejected of men a man of what sorrow and acquainted with what grief we did heed as he were our what faces from him so when you see Jesus chross you doing this when the Egyptians see Joseph coming up they say it's a Hebrew get away from him Joseph is a perfect to of Jesus Christ amen are we together he was a Ste we he our faed for him he was what and we esteem what him not he was not esteemed just as Joseph was not esteemed going to Egypt have I lost somebody have I lost somebody he was a steam not he left Heaven coming down to the earth Isaiah said this man will be despised this man will not be esteem this man will be rejected why because he's changing the coat he left all the glory that he had in heaven and he became a human being and that's what Matthew says this we explained to you last Sunday in Matthew 12:18 behold my what my servants Jesus Christ becoming a servant to Jehovah behold my servant whom I have what I have chosen my who my beloved in whom my soul is what well pleased I will put my spirit where upon him and he shall show judgment to the water the Gentiles what I want you to notice he is Jesus become a servant amen amen everybody okay he left from Heaven coming down to the earth when he come down to the Earth he's no longer what you saw him in heaven he become now a servant a servant that is despised of man rejected of man a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and we esteem him not the same process that happened to Joseph everybody clear so far and servant meant have something my friend in Hebrew 2 verse 16 the Bible says this for verily he took not on him the what nature of angels He was no longer an angel but he took on him the seed of what Abraham because he become a human being wherefore in all things he beho him that he be made like what unto his Brethren so when Jesus Christ left his deity in heaven and coming down into to the Earth he become like one of us am everybody okay he also become a servant to Jehovah just like you are a servant to Jehovah and the Bible say he beho in other word he was important for Jesus to become L it was important for Jesus to become a servant to become like a slave it's important he beh him to be made like unto what his bre why that he might be what a merciful and what and faithful high priest in the things pertaining to what to God this government is very important it make you appreciate your work amen sir yes sir yes sir amen come Lord everybody okay everybody okay can I say something can I say something let's stay focused can I say something before I become a doctor a dentist I was a dentist assistant for years and I work with a dentist amen and I seen how dentist and doctor treat people do you follow me and because of that I took a decision I say whenever I'm going to be a doctor I will never treat my staff the way they are treat treated by other people because now I understand what assistant understand amen a man who goes directly to medical school will never understand a nurse but somebody who was a nurse before and become a doctor will respect the nurse more amen because he can feel amen he can enter in we can be compassionate he can understand the stress that the nurse goes through amen it is important for a boss to do the work that you're doing because he will understand the pressure amen because he himself went through that pressure Joseph was a servant himself he would know how to rule Egypt amen and make people comfortable because he know what a slave is like [Music] if Jesus remain Jesus Christ if God remain God he will not understand your pain amen he won't understand your headache amen he won't understand your crying he won't understand your suffering but thank God one day that word was made flesh amen and he dwell Among Us amen he begin to eat like me amen he begin to talk like me amen he begin to sleep like me he begin to have a back amen a headache a Corona virus so that when you crying to God he understands you better Hallelujah hallu he can be a good advocate he can stay on your case very well because he knows the P amen he been through there before everybody okay so when we pray to God remember you praying to somebody who understands you amen you're not praying to a Buddha you praying to a god that was a human being a God that knows what rejecting a God that was despised a God that was acquainted in sorrow so when sorrow come your way Jesus understand when people reject you Jesus understand when people believe in you Jesus understand because he himself went through the same thing amen glory to God thank God for that savior that's the perfect Kingsman Redeemer somebody a high priest a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity you not alone crying somebody understand your cry you're not alone suffering somebody's touched by your suffering because he knows what you're going through Oh Glory to God is should change our prayers it should change the way we

us to who to God he was been put to death in the What In the Flesh but was what quickened by the Spirit by which also he went and did what and preach unto the what Spirits in prison the souls in prison [Applause] amen so when Jesus Christ went into the grave the Bible say he went in the prison and he preached to souls in prison that could not repent he was not to preach to them to be repented he was just for a testimony and he only took two years because after 3 days he must rise up again and go before Pharaoh ah after 2 years he must come out from the prison and go before [Applause] Pharaoh the message and the Bible are W do you follow me after 2 years Joseph must come out from the prison after two years after two days Jesus must come out from the souls in prison the third pool Ministry of souls in prison you preaching in the prison nobody's going to get saved it's a Ministry where it's not but after 3 days that's when G comes then he had to come up from the grave and when he came up from the prison he had to appear before Pharaoh Oh Glory oh my God glory to God did Jesus also appear before Pharaoh look at how he went my friend remember in gon they pull His Garment do you follow me he went with a garment of a sinner and he died on the cross and when they put him in the grave he flipped garment follow me my friend have I lost somebody have I lost somebody this is
