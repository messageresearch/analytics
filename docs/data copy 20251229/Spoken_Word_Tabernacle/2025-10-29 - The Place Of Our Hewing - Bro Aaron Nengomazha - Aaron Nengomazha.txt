========================================

He wrestled with God. He was scared TO MEET HIS BROTHER. BUT THE NEXT MORNING, he was a fearless, limping prince. I don't need his sword or his army. Neither woman. God stepped on the scene. See, he does in peculiar way. Jesus rejected after being a vindicated son of God. But if I do not the works of my father don't believe me. He was the light of the day. Still the light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Stepped on the scene &gt;&gt; and THE PEOPLE AS LONG AS HE COULD BREAD and fishes and loaves, they followed him. But when he began to tell him the truth of the word that separated them, they had their own traditions they held on to. It was contrary. Yet, you know, he was exactly with the scripture. But the blinded eyes of the world couldn't see it. Neither do they now. Neither have in any age. I mean, as a whole. What happened? It looked like he was defeated. You notice from that very time his popularity left him. When when he began to tell him the word &gt;&gt; when he could go out and had healing services and his campaigns, everybody wanted him. Oh, rabbi come over here and rabbi come here. BUT WHEN HIS DOCTRINE GOT STARTED, OH, YOUR teaching disturbs our people. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, I can't have you in my church no more, Rabbi, BECAUSE WHY? YOU CONFUSE OUR PEOPLE. YOUR TEACHING IS SO CONTRARY to what we believe. &gt;&gt; It hasn't changed. It's &gt;&gt; not. Can't have you, Rabbi. Yet him being vindicated, proven by the scriptures who he was, yet they couldn't believe it. Finally, he went on till the last moment when Satan thought of God. He crucified him on the cross. Down, down, down, down. PUT HIM IN THE GRAVE. BUT THAT'S WHEN GOD STEPPED on the scene. &gt;&gt; Up from the grave, he arose. &gt;&gt; The same thing. Paul, he said, "All deemus has forsaken me. All men forsaken him for the word. I don't believe Deeus went to nightclubs and things, but Deeus wanted to go. Deeus was a rich man and he wanted to go with a popular group and so HE WENT OFF AS ALL THE REST OF THEM DID. THEN PAUL SAID, "ALL MAN HAS FORSAKEN ME." WHY? His ministry was coming to the capstone of it. Coming down THE END, HIS DESIRE WAS TO BE A MARTYR BECAUSE HE kept &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat.

Amen. So if they can come up. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; I have a testimony before um this song been burning on my heart for a while now. It was about a week and a half ago. I was at home and um blowing some leaves and my hair was down and I kind of leaned forward to get some leaves that was under uh a piece of structure and my hair got caught in the moto of the blower. So, it was like caught up to here. The motor stopped because it it just couldn't go anymore. So, I'm like, "Okay." So, there were two sisters at home with me and uh I went to them. I was like, "Help." And uh the sister, one sister looked at me and she's like, "How did that happen?" And God knows I was just my heart was just I was calm. But I cuz I didn't know what was going to happen. I didn't know what to do. I just knew I needed to get my hair out of there. So one sister said, "But we got to cut it." And it's all the way up here. And I'm like, "No, my hair is in this braid. No way we're cutting it." But the other one was like uh-uh we're going to work and get it out. So for half an hour pulling and pulling and pulling and it's it's getting at my roots so it's painful. So I sat there and I'm just like Lord I don't know what happened. I wasn't doing anything wrong. You have to show me what happened and get my hair out of this this in um tool. So I put my hand on the uh on the moto and I started pulling and the hair started budging. It wasn't budging before. So, I'm like, "Okay, I pull and it budged." So, one sister, she saw me doing it and she started to help. She's like, "Okay, let me help you pull it." And then, uh, she's like, "Put on the moto." Seeing that it's already pulled at least about halfway through. Let's put on the moto and release the rest. So, put it on. And it sucked all my hair back in. I was like, "Lord Jesus." At that point, I mean, I could cry, I could scream, but nothing. I was just calm and I was like, "Lord, you take control." So, she's like, "Okay, I think we need help." So, she went inside to get her phone to call someone and the other sister was there with me trying to dismantle the blower. And it was as though the Lord just took my hand, placed it on the hair, and not with a tug or a pull, it just gently pulled all the hair out. And I just want to give God all the thanks, all the glory, and all the praise. This song that we're going to sing, it was requested like about a month and a half ago, [applause] &gt;&gt; and it's the right time for it now. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I have faced many mountains, [singing] been through [music] trials and shed many tears. When I look around [music] and it all seemed hopeless, I won't [singing] fear.

I look it's already an hour and 30 minutes. I we need to close this thing because it keep going and going going. Maybe one day we need to push till 2 I mean two hours. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God is working his ways. I don't even know how to express it. My daughter say, "Can I give a testimony? Can I?" I say, "If I start a testimony here, I'm going to introduce a president because the next person will want to give a testimony." And the testimony I say, "Keep the testimony on Wednesdays. Let's get here seriously to get to prayer and move forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God is blessing us and doing a lot of stuff. So you pray for me, pray for the building, pray for the rain. We love the rain. We got the rain, but we need the rain to stop so we can pour the concrete. Amen. So let's go with the universal law. Some are looking for the rain. Some are looking for the pouring. So uh let's balance it up, but let's turn toward pouring. When it's poor, then call for the rain. And it can rain all all you want to. We don't want that to stay like that. It create more moisture and things. We got to pump the water out and everything. So you pray for the rain to stop. And when it stop the pour then rain, rain, come back again. Not go away. Yeah. No, today now we need to do go away. Come again another time. I learned this stuff with if you don't have once you get children you understand [laughter] you will be sitting watching all type of cartoons and rain rain until you memorize them say where is this one coming and when when they start growing up they don't even want you to remind them about it when I begin to sing their own cartoons I say do you remember they don't even want to hear it I say are you the one that was sitting there and watching all of it amen [laughter] this is our convent vention. It has been a while but finally by God's grace we managed to catch him. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] [applause] [cheering] We managed to catch him somehow. Brother Aaron Negomaza, you see how the church is responding. [applause and cheering] [laughter] He has been flying left and right and finally we caught him by God's grace. So we we we we got a uh a BB2 bombers and everything to guide him until he can uh [laughter] he can land on the tarmac. Amen. So again welcome to spoken word tabernacle. So he will be the one ministering tonight. We love brother Eron. Such a wonderful and tremendous gift that he have. He would tell you that he's not a preacher. At the beginning he say I'm not a preacher. I'm not a preacher. When I heard him, I say, "What are you talking about?" [laughter] A wonderful gift. So, let's pull on the gift of the Lord and hear from the Lord tonight. Amen. Forever only believe. Good to see you, Sister Divine. Oh, [music] believe.

God sees the heart behind the hand that is raised. Let us bow our heads and our hearts for prayer. Heavenly Father, we come before your throne this evening Lord [music] thanking you oh God for the rain outside. We are also father praying that you give us the rain here inside the rains of the spirit Lord. For Lord we know that when it's dry oh God the seed cannot grow. Father you promised to give us Lord the former rain and the letter rain in one month. Father we are asking [music] oh God may you just visit us tonight. We thank you, Father, for thirsting, Lord, for opening the hearts of your children, Lord, to hunger and thirst for righteousness. [music] For you said, they that hunger and thirst for righteousness, they shall be filled. Father, we thank you, Lord, for the burden of prayer, Lord, that you have placed upon this church, upon the people, Father. It shows, Lord, you're calling them to [music] a higher dimension, to a deeper walk with God, Father, to know the riches of your kingdom. Father we thank you for all things Lord. Father we are so thankful for all the testimony we have been hearing Lord and many others [music] Lord that we are not spoken tonight. Lord when you healed the lepers only one came back and you said were there not many 10 lepers [music] tonight Lord we want to give you all the praise for the things that you are doing in our life. [music] Lord I remember coming here the last time Lord there wasn't any construction but we see Lord the progress that is happening. It shows that your hand is upon this place.

God bless you saints. Uh we greet you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Um we can open our Bibles when we whilst we have you standing and then maybe you can uh can have your seats. Let's open tonight from um let's start with Isaiah chapter 51. verse verse one. If you have it, you can say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Isaiah chapter 51 verse1, the Bible says, "Harken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness." &gt;&gt; Look, look unto the rock. Look unto the rock whence you are healed &gt;&gt; and to the hole of the pit whence you are digged. &gt;&gt; Look unto Abraham your father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And unto Sarah that bare you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For I called him alone and blessed him. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And increased him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. One thing you will notice here, the Bible says, look to the rock from which you are healed. Right. &gt;&gt; And then the the Bible explains itself. Scripture inter interprets scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says, "Look unto Abraham. &gt;&gt; Look unto Sarah." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "I called him alone." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not a group revelation. It's an individual revelation &gt;&gt; and blessed him &gt;&gt; and increased him. &gt;&gt; Let us also read in Genesis chapter 35 verse 1. Genesis 35:1. If you have it, you can say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. The Bible says, "And God said unto Jacob, arise and go up to Bethl &gt;&gt; and dwell there, &gt;&gt; and make thee an make there an outer unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fledest from the face of Esau thy brother." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't God wonderful to remember? &gt;&gt; Amen. every event in our life in in in crystal detail. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, we may forget where we where where we were running away from, but God remembers. &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word. You may have your seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's a privilege and a joy to be back in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. After a bit of a sabbatical preacher, &gt;&gt; I was asking the Lord, "Lord, am I still in the message? &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. If I've left the message, bring me back, Lord." &gt;&gt; You know, when David was uh banished from Jerusalem, he was crying walking up the hill. So I felt like David. &gt;&gt; I said, "But I know one day I'll I'll come back to the house of the Lord." You know, there there are places where if you don't go back, it's okay. You know, there's McDonald's. If if you don't have to go back, it's it's all right. But then there are some places that uh you you always have, you know, in your heart. And &gt;&gt; if they say you can't come back there, then it's a it's a problem. So, so we we love the church and we love your we love your pastor &gt;&gt; and we love the worship and uh and thank you all so much for your stand in the word &gt;&gt; and uh we we especially love those who invite us to their weddings. [laughter] &gt;&gt; We always ask for for a special blessing for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I've been trying to cut all my calories, but one thing I've noticed is that for church dinners and weddings, I don't have to worry about those calories, &gt;&gt; cuz those are blessed calories. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So tonight being a Wednesday night, uh we don't want to, you know, take a very long uh uh uh reading tonight. We're just going to be a very simple sermon. We want to talk about uh returning to Bethl &gt;&gt; and um you know the place of our youing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, uh as many of you would know that to you a stone, &gt;&gt; it's like you know when they want to build something blocks, special rocks, they would you them from mountains. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and by the Bible says that I've healed them by my prophets. &gt;&gt; So So God has healed Israel from a mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a mountain is a is a solid foundation. &gt;&gt; And and and Israel was built on the foundation of the patriarchs. &gt;&gt; And we are tonight built upon the foundation of the prophets and the apostles. &gt;&gt; And we don't look to a modern day history. We look to the foundation. And that's what Isaiah is saying. He says, "You that follow after righteousness, &gt;&gt; look to the rock from whence you were healed." &gt;&gt; And he says, "Look back to Abraham your father." &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to know your father? &gt;&gt; You know, people don't have identity &gt;&gt; and they don't know their father and they don't know where they come from and they don't know where they are going. But here God is saying you have to look back where you come from. You have to look back to your father Abraham. And a man who knows who he is knows his father. &gt;&gt; AND TONIGHT OUR FATHER IS ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes we look at many different things. &gt;&gt; Sometimes our attention looks at many different things that we see flying on the internet. But sometimes God wants to grab our attention. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Listen, son. I want you to LOOK BACK, &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T JUST LOOK BACK. LOOK ALL THE WAY BACK FROM WHENCE YOU CAME FROM. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes when we get in trouble, we forget where we came from. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we forget who we are. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we forget where we are going. Sometimes we get a a little bit of AN AMNESIA. AND GOD HAS TO SAY, "LOOK BACK TO THE ROCK FROM WHICH YOU WERE HEALED. LOOK BACK TO ABRAHAM." AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's what God said through the prophet Isaiah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, because God always likes to take us back. &gt;&gt; Because Christianity is a circle. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet says. &gt;&gt; He says eternity is a circle. &gt;&gt; So Christianity is just, you know, one story that goes, you know, again and again, but it's the same story. Hallelujah. It's a story of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything talks about redemption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every morning it's redemption. In the evening is redemption. &gt;&gt; A WEDDING SUPPER IS REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; IT'S A STORY OF REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So for YOU TO PLEASE GOD, YOU MUST BE A REDEEMER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE IS ALL ABOUT REDEMPTION, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; And Jacob &gt;&gt; was chosen by God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he was elected by God. &gt;&gt; He was elected before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE HE WAS BORN, God spoke to the to to the mother &gt;&gt; and they said, "Two nations &gt;&gt; are in your womb. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE these ones were even born, PAUL SAYS, GOD SAID, "One have I loved and one HAVE I HATED." &gt;&gt; SO THAT THE ELECTION OF GOD MIGHT BE SURE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD SHOWING HIS SOVEREIGNITY THAT NO ONE CAN LEAVE THE MESSAGE &gt;&gt; BUT GOD CAN LEAVE SOMEBODY BUT THERE'S NOBODY THAT CAN LEAVE GOD &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ELECTION. &gt;&gt; So before they were born &gt;&gt; God knew the one that he wanted &gt;&gt; and he knew the one that he hated. &gt;&gt; That's right. That is why we sing Amazing Grace. &gt;&gt; Because Amazing Grace &gt;&gt; is based upon election. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PROPHET says it's like a woman &gt;&gt; who takes a piece of cloth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says the foolish virgin, &gt;&gt; he says it's a woman who takes a piece of cloth &gt;&gt; and he she has a PATTERN AND SHE LAYS THAT PATTERN AND SHE SAYS SHE CUTS OUT THAT PATTERN. HE SAYS THESE TWO WOMEN ARE OF THE same material. &gt;&gt; But the ONE THAT IS ELECTED IS THE ONE THAT IS IN THE PATTERN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. The one that is in THE PATTERN OF THE BIBLE &gt;&gt; IS THE ONE THAT IS CALLED AND ELECTED BY GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO EVERYONE CAN JUMP AND SHOUT BUT NOT EVERYONE IS IN THE PATTERN. EVERYONE CAN PRAISE BUT NOT EVERYONE IS IN THE PATTERN BECAUSE EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ACCORDING TO GOD'S PATTERN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Can I drop something here? &gt;&gt; And the pattern is given to a prophet. &gt;&gt; The tabernacle pattern is GIVEN TO A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GOD GIVES THE PATTERN TO A PROPHET. YOU CANNOT READ A PATTERN UNLESS YOU'RE AN ARCHITECT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It takes an ARCHITECT TO READ THE PATTERN. AND IN THESE LAST DAYS, GOD HAS GIVEN US A PATTERN. HALLELUJAH. THE PATTERN OF OUR DRESSING, THE PATTERN OF OUR MARRIAGES, UH THE PATTERN OF OUR FINANCES, UH THE PATTERN OF OUR CHURCH, UH HE HAS GIVEN US A PATTERN FOR EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. EVERYTHING. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE PATTERN HAS MEASUREMENTS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A BALANCE, &gt;&gt; IT'S not 50/50. &gt;&gt; It's the specific measurements that are in a pattern. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And can I drop a little further? &gt;&gt; Oh yes, sir. It was not Moses who built the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT MOSES WHO BUILT the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Moses was GIVEN THE PATTERN. &gt;&gt; BUT MOSES GAVE THE PATTERN. HALLELUJAH. TO BASEL AND A TYPE OF A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY [screaming] WHO WERE ANOINTED BY GOD TO DECODE THE PATTERN THAT WAS GIVEN TO MOSES. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AND CAN I COME A LITTLE FURTHER? &gt;&gt; There were some things that had no measurements, &gt;&gt; BUT OAB KNEW HOW TO MAKE THEM. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN MOSES SAW IT, HE SAYS, "IT IS EXACTLY ACCORDING TO WHAT I SAW. [cheering] Moes &gt;&gt; that BREAKS THE BIBLE PATTERN. &gt;&gt; BUT MOSES IS A PROPHET &gt;&gt; AND HE'S THE ONE who brings the pattern &gt;&gt; and HE GIVES THE PATTERN TO THE BUILDERS. &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAYS, "I've anointed. &gt;&gt; I HAVE ANOINTED. &gt;&gt; I have anointed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have one spirit &gt;&gt; but different anointings. &gt;&gt; ONE SPIRIT, different anointings. What is an anointing? &gt;&gt; WHAT IS AN ANOINTING? &gt;&gt; And what is a spirit? &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE SPIRIT, &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S DIFFERENT ANOINTINGS. &gt;&gt; One spirit, different anointings. &gt;&gt; Brother Arab when he was preaching. &gt;&gt; He would say, "I am trying to get away from this anointing so THAT I CAN PREACH." SO, THERE'S AN ANOINTING FOR PRAYING FOR THE SICK. THERE'S AN ANOINTING FOR TEACHING. AND THERE'S AN ANOINTING FOR PREACHING by the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND GOD KNOWS THE ANOINTING TO GIVE FOR EVERY SPECIFIC JOB. &gt;&gt; AND CAN I GO FURTHER? HE KNOWS THE ANOINTING TO GIVE FOR EVERY DISPENSATION. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. SO IN THIS DISPENSATION, GOD KNOWING THROUGH THE CORRIDORS OF TIME THAT THERE WILL BE A JEZEBEL SPIRIT, GOD SAYS, I'M GOING TO SEND THE ANOINTING OF ELIJAH. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT IS WHY WE CALL THE PROPHET BECAUSE THERE'S THE ANOINTING OF THE TIME. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME SPIRIT, DIFFERENT ANOINTINGS. The spirit comes upon me. &gt;&gt; I teach the Bible. The spirit comes upon sister Yoket. She sings a song. IT'S THE SAME SPIRIT, different anointings. SO IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANOINTING, [screaming] YOU DON'T KNOW THE SEASON &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SEASONS THEY ARE CONNECTED WITH ANOINTINGS [cheering] BECAUSE AND THE OPENING OF AN A SEASON IS THE OPENING OF AN ANOINTING. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY HAVE a certain anointing FOR A CERTAIN SEASON. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; So reformation is an anointing but for a different season. SANCTIFICATION WAS GIVEN by the anointing of John Wesley but that's for a different season. BUT IN THIS SEASON GOD HAS GIVEN US THE ANOINTING OF EAGLES. Even at home, my friends, &gt;&gt; there's an anointing &gt;&gt; for an eagle. There's an anointing for a lion. &gt;&gt; There's a time &gt;&gt; to speak like a lion in your house. THERE'S A TIME TO SPEAK LIKE A LEVITE IN YOUR HOUSEH. THERE'S A TIME TO USE WISDOM AS A MAN, DIFFERENT ANOINTINGS, DIFFERENT SEASONS. [cheering] SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES your wife may be going through menopause. It's a different season. GOD HAS TO GIVE YOU THE ANOINTING FOR THAT SEASON. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise be to God &gt;&gt; because the BIBLE SAYS &gt;&gt; HE SHALL be like a tree planted by the rivers of war &gt;&gt; and he brings forth his fruit &gt;&gt; in his season. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Genesis 31:1. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to take my time. &gt;&gt; I went to I went to Lexington and I saw the service was like five four hours &gt;&gt; and then I repent repented. I said, "Lord, I'm cutting my service. It's too short." [laughter] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 31. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; If you have it, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he heard the words of Leah of Laban's son. Sorry. Laban's son saying, "Jacob is taken away all that was our fathers. Of that which was of our fathers has he gotten all he all these glory." &gt;&gt; There was You see that? That's the origin of anti-semitism. &gt;&gt; They began to to blame Jacob. Because God was blessing Jacob. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then they began to say &gt;&gt; everything that we have &gt;&gt; has been taken by Jacob. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's where the spirit comes from. &gt;&gt; Forget about politics. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE PROPHETIC CALENDAR. STAY RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; You wonder why there are so many conspiracy theories &gt;&gt; against Rothschild against different ones &gt;&gt; is the same spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the same spirit that was rising in Europe &gt;&gt; before the Holocaust. They say that &gt;&gt; Jacob has taken away all our wealthake &gt;&gt; and all our glory &gt;&gt; because the Bible says you shall be hated by all nations &gt;&gt; for my name's sake. &gt;&gt; So the hatred is connected to the name of Jesus. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah, &gt;&gt; you have THE F THE FAR RIGHT and the far left. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They are agreeing on one thing &gt;&gt; to hate Israel. &gt;&gt; Verse two. &gt;&gt; And Jacob beheld &gt;&gt; the countenance of Laban, &gt;&gt; and behold, it was not towards him as before. It was &gt;&gt; Jacob was a prophet &gt;&gt; and he was starting to see the changing of the season. &gt;&gt; AND THE LORD SAID UNTO JACOB, &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Can you see this? &gt;&gt; Verse two says &gt;&gt; Jacob saw that &gt;&gt; the countenant of Laban &gt;&gt; was no longer the same. But then you go to verse three and then God says, "Return unto the land of thy fathers." &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; SO GOD IS ALWAYS 100 STEPS AHEAD. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN J WHEN LABAN'S FACE WAS CHANGING, &gt;&gt; THAT is what WAS WHEN GOD WAS TALKING TO to to Jacob. &gt;&gt; It's time for you to leave this place. SO WHEN GOD CHANGES THE SEASON, &gt;&gt; HE MAY CAUSE THINGS TO BECOME UNCOMFORTABLE &gt;&gt; because remember WHEN THE EGO STARETH UP A NEST. &gt;&gt; You may be in a comfort zone for many years &gt;&gt; making billions of dollars in Europe. &gt;&gt; Then suddenly there comes a pharaoh &gt;&gt; who does not know Jacob. Joseph. Then there comes a time when Laban's face begins to change towards Jacob. &gt;&gt; And and many people they make the mistake of trying to fast. &gt;&gt; They say, "Lord, change the face of Laban. &gt;&gt; Lord, change the face of THIS MAN." THEY FAIL TO RECOGNIZE IS THE CHANGING OF THE SEASON. Because God knew very well &gt;&gt; that if he does not change the face of Laban, &gt;&gt; Jacob is not going to leave. &gt;&gt; JACOB WAS NOT GOING to leave. &gt;&gt; But you know what God did? &gt;&gt; Says, "Let me just change the weather a little bit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's have a &gt;&gt; let's have a change of season. &gt;&gt; And suddenly the the the the cold comes in &gt;&gt; and Jacob and God says &gt;&gt; go back &gt;&gt; to the land of your fathers. &gt;&gt; And the way the Bible is written, you would think that God was coming down and saying, "Jacob, &gt;&gt; I'm God. &gt;&gt; NOW LEAVE AND GO TO MY FATHER." IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT. &gt;&gt; SOMEHOW JACOB KNEW AS A PROPHET THAT I HAVE TO GO BACK. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS HEART &gt;&gt; THAT WAS SAYING I MUST GO BACK TO THE PROMISED LAND. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT A MAN WITH A GRAY BEARD COMING DOWN AND SAY, "MY SON, MY SON, [screaming] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE THIS PLACE. That's why many young people struggle WITH MARRIAGE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY THINK an angel IS GOING TO COME [screaming] &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "BROTHER, THUS SAYS THE LORD. SISTER JANE IS YOUR WIFE." &gt;&gt; Sometimes God can do that, &gt;&gt; but many times he won't do that. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE WAY GOD SPEAKS TO YOU. &gt;&gt; When you received your salvation, THERE WAS NO ANGEL THAT CAME. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK AN ANGEL IS GOING TO COME JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BUY A CAR OR YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED? SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO BE &gt;&gt; TAKE AWAY RELIGION &gt;&gt; AND HAVE A personal revelation and walk with Christ. &gt;&gt; When you come to church and say Lord speak to my heart &gt;&gt; that's God speaking to you. &gt;&gt; God speaks to you in very very mysterious ways. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jacob sent and and this is chapter 31. &gt;&gt; And you will notice that Jacob did not go until chapter 35 &gt;&gt; because one thing you understand about Jacob is that oh my &gt;&gt; Jacob was blessed &gt;&gt; and his sheep were multiplying &gt;&gt; and his flock was multiplying &gt;&gt; but he was out of the will of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; He was still Jacob. &gt;&gt; HE WAS GETTING ALL THE FLOCKS, &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS STILL OUT OF THE WILL OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU CAN NEVER MEASURE YOUR SPIRITUALITY WITH NATURAL THINGS. &gt;&gt; YOU MEASURE YOUR LIFE BY THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; SO GOD WAS BLESSING JACOB, BUT JACOB WAS OUT OF THE WILL OF GOD. SO IF YOU ARE SPIRITUAL, DON'T LOOK AT THE NATURAL THINGS. &gt;&gt; YES, we want them. Yes, we praise God for them. But that IS NOT OUR MEASURE OF SPIRITUALITY. &gt;&gt; Because if we measure by kind of things, then lo and behold, Elon Musk would be a dispensational prophet. &gt;&gt; JEFF BEZOS WOULD BE A PROPHET &gt;&gt; IF WE MEASURE SPIRITUALITY BY MONEY. &gt;&gt; So Jacob, &gt;&gt; he takes the birthight from Esau &gt;&gt; and he runs away &gt;&gt; from the promised land. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he goes uph. He goes through different places and he as he was going out he was running away from Esau. &gt;&gt; Then he has an experience with God. &gt;&gt; And this experience with God, the Bible says it was a dream. &gt;&gt; Yes, it was. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says there was a ladder that came from heaven and there were angels that were descending and ascending. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND HE SAYS SURELY THE GOD IS IN THIS PLACE. And he says, "This is THE HOUSE OF GOD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. The place became CALLED THE HOUSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE GATE OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; BUT you know what? Just like all of us, Jacob made a great mistake. &gt;&gt; He should have known that. Hey, listen. God is descending and ascending in this place. &gt;&gt; Maybe there's something about this place. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Maybe there's something about this place. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; But what did Jacob do? He left the place and went out &gt;&gt; back to where his father Abraham came from &gt;&gt; and there he dwelt and there he went and guess what? &gt;&gt; Because he went out of the will of God, he suffered. &gt;&gt; God blessed him but he suffered. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And then he gets a wife. &gt;&gt; He gets a wife. &gt;&gt; What happens? The father-in-law says, "You know what? I'll give you the older sister. But let me tell you something. You can never cheat God's children. &gt;&gt; God always makes it work together for good &gt;&gt; because God in his great mind. &gt;&gt; He knew that Leah is capable of giving Jacob seven children. SO, SO, SO LABAN THOUGHT HE HAD CHEATED JACOB, BUT GOD ALREADY had a plan CUZ RACHEL GAVE JACOB two children, BUT LEAH GAVE JACOB SIX SONS AND ONE DAUGHTER. SO, YOU CAN NEVER CHEAT GOD'S CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; When you are cheated, God multiplies it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Jacob lived with Laban &gt;&gt; and he was enjoying life. He was known in the city. He was making a lot of money. &gt;&gt; But suddenly things began to change. &gt;&gt; And when things were beginning to change, &gt;&gt; God was speaking to Jacob. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Go back to Bethl." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go back to Bethl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go back to Bethl. &gt;&gt; And I want to bring this in a very sober way tonight. I was thinking about my own life. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes, you know, it's good to to preach and to to go to places, &gt;&gt; but you know what they the message for me, I feel like it first has to deal with my heart first &gt;&gt; before it can deal with the people that I preach to. &gt;&gt; And I was thinking, I said, Lord, &gt;&gt; I remember when I was new in the message, &gt;&gt; I would read four spoken words per day. &gt;&gt; Lord, when I was new in the message, &gt;&gt; I would I would pray all night. I would go up in the mountain to pray. I I loved every brother. I love every sister. I didn't care about politics in the church. I didn't care about this minister, that minister. I didn't care about things around me. I BLESSED THE GRASS. I KISSED THE FLOWERS. UH I WORSHIPED GOD. UH I SANG SPECIALS EVEN IF I was out of tune. &gt;&gt; I SAID, "WHAT HAPPENED? &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED?" I SAID, "LORD, take me back to Bethl. LORD, TAKE ME BACK TO BETHL. LORD, TAKE ME BACK TO BETHL." LORD, &gt;&gt; TAKE me back to Bethl. &gt;&gt; You know, when we were young, sir, &gt;&gt; we would never hold a grudge. &gt;&gt; When we were young, when we were little kids, we would play with everyone. We, you know, if somebody wrongs us, we forgive them. Tomorrow we are together. We say, "God bless you, my brother. God bless you, my sister. I SAID, "WHERE IS THAT GONE?" I SAID, "LORD, bring me back to Bethl. BRING ME BACK TO BETHL, LORD. TAKE ME back to Bethl." Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You know what? You wonder why you you know you want to know why your honeymoon is one of the most important time of your life? &gt;&gt; Because after your honeymoon, you will spend the rest of your life saying, "Lord, take me back. to those days. Take me back to those days. &gt;&gt; And the sisters tonight are saying, "Lord, take us back to Bethl." &gt;&gt; Take us back to the &gt;&gt; Bethl. &gt;&gt; You know where Bethl is? &gt;&gt; Is the honeymoon. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the honeymoon. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Wait, if if if the wife goes to the kitchen, honey, do you need anything? I'm opening the fridge. You need anything, honey? &gt;&gt; She calls you at work. Honey, how is how's your day? I was just checking on you to see if everything is all right. &gt;&gt; But tonight, let's go back to Bethl, friends. I say, let's go back to Bethl. LET'S GO BACK TO BETHL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We became adults. &gt;&gt; We became so careful. We began to know a lot of things. &gt;&gt; And we lost the sweetness of the spirit. &gt;&gt; And we lost the tenderness of the spirit. &gt;&gt; We became so hard. &gt;&gt; We would not never let anyone wrong us. &gt;&gt; We thought we could get even. &gt;&gt; I'll get even with her. &gt;&gt; I'll get even with him. &gt;&gt; But there was a time where we were not like that. That's right. &gt;&gt; Even if you were right, you would say, "I am sorry, &gt;&gt; honey. I am sorry, &gt;&gt; sweetheart. I am sorry." I say, "Lord, take me back to Bethl. &gt;&gt; Lord, take me back to Bethl." &gt;&gt; Because you know what? If you are a soldier, &gt;&gt; it's good to go on the offensive, &gt;&gt; but if you don't come back to replenish &gt;&gt; your experience, &gt;&gt; you know what? You rust out &gt;&gt; and you weigh out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then you would live by your old experience. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; And you say, you know, I've been in the message for 20 years. I've been married for 30 years. But where are you today? &gt;&gt; Do you remember Bethl? AND GOD WAS VERY SPECIFIC. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "GO BACK TO BETHL. THE PLACE WHERE I I SPOKE TO YOU. THE PLACE WHERE I VISITED YOU. THE PLACE WHERE YOU SAW THE ANGELS ASCENDING AND DESCENDING AND YOU CALL THE PLACE BETHL. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we CAN MOVE SO FAR &gt;&gt; WE FORGET where we come from. &gt;&gt; And Isaiah says look back to the rock from which you were healed. &gt;&gt; Look back to brother Brian. Look back to Ephesus. LOOK BACK TO THE EARLY DAYS of the message WHERE WE USED TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER, SHAKE HANDS WITH one another, but we have lost that. &gt;&gt; Everything is a competition. &gt;&gt; Everything is a competition. &gt;&gt; I am better than this one. I'm better than that one. I say, Lord, I don't want that. Lord, &gt;&gt; TAKE ME BACK TO BETHL, LORD. &gt;&gt; TAKE ME BACK TO BETHL, LORD. THERE was a time where you didn't even care whether you were cold or not, whether you were a deacon in the church or not, whether you are doing something or not. There was a DAY WHERE YOU WERE JUST HAPPY. YOU WERE IN CHURCH WORSHIPING GOD. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU JUST COME TO CHURCH AND YOU SAY, "LORD, I THANK YOU. I'M IN CHURCH." BUT TODAY WE HAVE LOST THAT. &gt;&gt; OH, they should have made me this. Oh, they should have asked me to do this. Oh, they should have done this to me. Me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me. Oh my friends, you need to go back TO TO TO BETHL TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM. [applause] &gt;&gt; OH, thank you Jesus. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A TIME WHERE WE USED TO SIT DOWN AND FELLOWSHIP AND TALK ABOUT THE SPOKEN WORD AND TALK about Sabino Canyon and talk about the the the speaking of THE SP. BUT TODAY WE sit down. Oh, this brother did this. Uh oh, this church did this. Uh oh, this pastor did this. Uh oh, this sister did this. &gt;&gt; I LOOKED AT THAT. &gt;&gt; I SAID, LORD, I'M FILTHY. Take me back to Bethl, Lord. &gt;&gt; Take me back to Bethl, Lord. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO BACK TO BETHL. &gt;&gt; I want to GO BACK TO BETHL &gt;&gt; WHERE I USED TO THINK ABOUT THE SPOKEN WORD. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU RESPECTED OTHERS ABOVE YOURSELF. THERE WAS A TIME YOU RESPECTED THE MINISTRY. THERE WAS A TIME YOU LEFT THE LORD. THERE WAS A TIME. WHAT HAPPENED? LET'S GO BACK TO BETHL TONIGHT. [applause] &gt;&gt; OH, thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. That was the PRO THE PROBLEM AT EPHESUS. &gt;&gt; The Bible SAYS I HAVE SOMEWHAT AGAINST THEE. YES. &gt;&gt; Says you have lost your first love. &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAID, &gt;&gt; "GO and do the &gt;&gt; first works." &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS THE FIRST works in your marriage. Do the first worksh. God wants you to go back and do that. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; That's what he's ASKING YOU TO DO. REPENT AND DO THE FIRST WORKS. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE MOVE UNTIL WE BECOME SO complicated &gt;&gt; until we we we lose ourself &gt;&gt; WE FORGET WHO WE ARE. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A TIME &gt;&gt; you go in every country. The message was simple. &gt;&gt; We didn't have million-dollar buildings. &gt;&gt; We didn't have camps. We didn't have clicks. We didn't have clowns. We didn't have BITTERNESS IN OUR HEARTS. We ate nothing AND WE LOVED EACH OTHER. BUT WHEN these things came, &gt;&gt; it became a problem. &gt;&gt; That's why diseases are multiplying among us because God is changing the countenance of Laban. GOD IS CHANGING THE COUNT OF LABAN. And he's saying to you tonight, go back to the FIRST LAUGH. GO BACK TO CHOOSE THE PRAYER MEETINGS. GO BACK TO CHOOSE THE PRAYER MEETINGS. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; OH, thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Aaron, I've got this problem. Go back to Bethl. &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron, I'VE GOT A JOB SITUATION. Go back to Bethl. Brother Aaron, I'VE GOT THIS PROBLEM. GO BACK TO BETHL." &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS. &gt;&gt; JUST GO BACK TO BETHL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER, I'M DEALING WITH THIS. It might be the change of season. &gt;&gt; Maybe you have become so so so cold. &gt;&gt; Maybe you have become so formal. &gt;&gt; You know how eagles renew their strength. &gt;&gt; They go in solitary places. &gt;&gt; And they break their beaks. &gt;&gt; They break their tallows AND THEY STAY THERE ALONE. HALLELUJAH. SOMETIMES UH YOU HAVE TO BE ALONE WITH GOD UH AND BREAK YOUR BIG UH BREAK YOUR PRIDE UH BREAK YOUR STINESS UH BREAK YOUR BITTERNESS AND GO BACK TO BETHL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHAT JACOB WAS MISSING. HE WAS A SON OF GOD. HE WAS A PROPHET OF GOD. BUT HE WAS CALLED &gt;&gt; JACOB. has been changed. &gt;&gt; He had he had an experience &gt;&gt; at Bethl &gt;&gt; and he saw the ladder &gt;&gt; but you know what &gt;&gt; it wasn't the full package. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the fullness of the revelation. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; So when we say we are going back to Pentecost, &gt;&gt; it's Jacob is going back to his first experience, &gt;&gt; but he's not just getting his experience. He's getting more than what they had at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; So when we say we are going back to Pentecost, we are not going BACK TO AUZA. &gt;&gt; WE ARE GOING TO the book OF ACTS. BUT NOT ONLY THAT, WE ARE GETTING MORE THAN WHAT THEY HAD IN THE BOOK OF ACTS BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE is a message of returning. &gt;&gt; RETURNING. AND BROTHER BRAM SAYS, "Wondering stars." How long shall you keep on wondering? &gt;&gt; RETURN TO GOD. RETURN TO GOD. &gt;&gt; I'VE wasted my time wondering, &gt;&gt; wondering on the internet, &gt;&gt; wondering on social media, WANDERING ON CAMPS. SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO COME BACK AND COME BACK TO BETHL AND SAY, "LORD, I want to meet with you face to face. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; The prophet says in Jacob longing in his heart &gt;&gt; everything seemed to be wrong. &gt;&gt; He wanted to go back home. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I you see some of the things we are facing is homesickness. &gt;&gt; That's exactly &gt;&gt; you say brother I'm depressed. It's homesickness. &gt;&gt; You don't know it but it's homesickness. &gt;&gt; You have to go back home. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because you can never be happy outside of home. &gt;&gt; Because the eagles when they are born &gt;&gt; they live in fluffy nests. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God puts all these nice uh you know the eagle the big eagle puts all these nice little cushions in the nest and you know we stay there in the nest. We just stay home. We just hear the tapes. We are we enjoy our nest. You know we don't need to fly. You don't need to do don't need to evangelize. We don't need to go out. We just enjoy the nest. &gt;&gt; We come to church, church dinners when we go home. &gt;&gt; But you know what? God says, "You know what? It's time to fly. &gt;&gt; It's time to fly." &gt;&gt; What does he do? He starts removing &gt;&gt; the the comfort. &gt;&gt; Chick-fil-A gone. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Trader Joe's &gt;&gt; gone. &gt;&gt; Publix &gt;&gt; gone. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Harry, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Gone. Wendy's &gt;&gt; gone. &gt;&gt; It takes all the the comfort &gt;&gt; and suddenly you start to feel the &gt;&gt; the pricks, the thrones. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Brother Stephen, something is wrong with my life." &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; It's time for you to fly. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's time for you to fly. &gt;&gt; Come to the prayer meetings. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's time for you to go back to Bethl. &gt;&gt; Because when you begin to feel to feel the thrones, &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what it you go on your knees &gt;&gt; and you say Lord &gt;&gt; have thy will in my life &gt;&gt; and God begins to show himself &gt;&gt; that's the only way that God takes away our takes our attention &gt;&gt; because sometimes we become so programmed &gt;&gt; I just go to work I come back I eat my supper I sleep I go to work I &gt;&gt; but God wants your attention &gt;&gt; and he speaks my son come let's commune My son come let's commune &gt;&gt; if you listen to the message the unchanging God works in unexpected ways &gt;&gt; the prophet says &gt;&gt; the I have to move to the west &gt;&gt; because the last tie that was holding me to the east is gone says my mother is dead &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; says now I have to go to the west &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; God was calling him &gt;&gt; yes sir &gt;&gt; to Bethl &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; now Joseph Now Jacob &gt;&gt; Yes sir &gt;&gt; had to go to Bethl &gt;&gt; but going to Bethl was not easy &gt;&gt; because he knew if I go to Bethl sir &gt;&gt; there is somebody who occupying the land &gt;&gt; and the person who is occupying that land is called Isa &gt;&gt; and I have got something THAT I DID TO &gt;&gt; ISA &gt;&gt; SO IF I GO BACK TO BETHL &gt;&gt; THERE'S A PRICE TO PAYH UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because revival comes with a price. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Walking with God comes with a price. &gt;&gt; There's a song that we used to sing. I'm going through. &gt;&gt; I'm going through. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; I'll pay the price. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; With the Lord's despised few. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he knew that he had to pay the price. And he knew he had to get rid of his idols &gt;&gt; because for you to come back to for you to come back to Bethl, &gt;&gt; you need to lay aside every sin and wait. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's sin, sometimes it's weight. &gt;&gt; The Bible says every sin and weight. &gt;&gt; There are things I don't have a quotation, but it's A WEIGHT. I DON'T HAVE A SCRIPTURE, BUT IT'S A WEIGHT. SO JACOB HAD TO TAKE OUT &gt;&gt; THE WEIGHT AND THE sin &gt;&gt; so that he could go to Bethl. &gt;&gt; And at Bethl he had to face his worst fears. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had to face his in insecurities. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you need to to face your insecurities. &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you apologize to your wife, you may feel like, you know what, I feel disrespected. But that's your way to Bethl. &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you say, "Sorry, Lord, I didn't mean to do it." That's your way to Bethl. Sometimes you say, "Lord, I didn't mean to do this." That's your way to Bethl. &gt;&gt; May God help us tonight. &gt;&gt; May God help us tonight &gt;&gt; to find our way back to Bethl. May God help us tonight to be BORN BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, TO GO BACK TO PENTECOST, TO GO BACK TO THE EXPERIENCE, THE SUPERNATURAL BLESSING OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND GOD MADE LIFE DIFFICULT IN Europe for the JEWS TO COME BACK TO THE PROMISED LAND. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Because you remember it was Naomi coming back to the promised land and he says don't call me Naomi, call me Mara &gt;&gt; because THE LORD HAS DEALT with me &gt;&gt; with bitterly. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO JACOB STARTS TO MAKE HIS JOURNEY BACK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And as he's making his journey back, &gt;&gt; he crosses into the promised land, &gt;&gt; something happens. his wife &gt;&gt; he her name is Rachel &gt;&gt; his wife's gives birth &gt;&gt; AND AS THE WIFE WAS GIVING birth &gt;&gt; because remember the blessing of the patriarchs THEY WERE PLACED AT birth &gt;&gt; so when WE SAY YOU MUST COME back to Bethl is because you're placing YOUR ADOPTION ACTUALLY IS DECLARED in your birth &gt;&gt; I mean it's Christianity is Very &gt;&gt; it's very simple. &gt;&gt; Very simple. &gt;&gt; The prophet says sir &gt;&gt; when Ephraim was born &gt;&gt; the mother said she shall be called Ephraim. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it says Ephraim means she he shall live by the sea. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says that was their blessing in the last days. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the blessing that they were going to be given in the last days were declared at their birth &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEIR BIRTH IS THEIR ORIGIN &gt;&gt; AND THEIR ORIGIN IS THE SAME AS THEIR destination because predestination looks back to origin. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE SAY GO BACK TO BETH, WE ARE GOING back to your origin. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUR ORIGIN IS YOUR DESTINATION. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOUR ORIGIN IS YOUR DESTINATION. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS ETERNAL. &gt;&gt; HE DECLARES THE END FROM THE BEGINNING. SO YOUR BEGINNING IS YOUR END. &gt;&gt; Because the eighth day is the first day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; SO JACOB, &gt;&gt; HE WAS COMING DOWN. He had 11 sons. &gt;&gt; As he was coming down, Rachel went into LABOR BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS AS SOON AS Zion travailed, &gt;&gt; she brought forth her children. &gt;&gt; So there's only one son who was born in the promised land and that man was called Benjamin. &gt;&gt; SO BENJAMIN IS A TYPE OF the 144,000. THE 144,000 COULD NOT BE BORN OUTSIDE OF THE PROMISED LAND. SO JACOB HAD TO COME BACK TO BETHL SO THAT BENJAMIN COULD BE BORN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN BENJAMIN WAS BORN, &gt;&gt; THE MOTHER DIED BECAUSE THE MOTHER WAS A TYPE OF THE HOLOCAUST. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. I SAY RACHEL WAS A TYPE OF THE HOLY GHOST. When she brought forth Benjamin, she died. &gt;&gt; AND SHE SAID, "She shall be called Boni," &gt;&gt; which means the son of my sorrow. &gt;&gt; AND THE FATHER BEING A PROPHET, HE SAYS, "He shall not be called Benoni. He shall be called Benjamin because he's the son of my right hand." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BENJAMIN MEANS THE SON OF MY RIGHT HAND. SO RACHEL THE CHURCH, &gt;&gt; SHE THOUGHT IT was sorrow &gt;&gt; to go through the Holocaust. BUT THE PROPHET JACOB SAID IT WAS THE tender hand of God. It was a TENDER HAND OF GOD. It's not Bon. IT'S BENJAMIN. IT'S BENJAMIN. IT'S BENJAMIN. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO SOMETIMES OUR SITUATIONS WE MAY GIVE him a name, &gt;&gt; but God says, "No, it's not Benoni. It's Benjamin. It's not Benon. It's Benjamin." [cheering] Hallelujah. Your situation is not Benon. It's Benjamin. YOUR BARNESS IS NOT It's not It's not It's not Bon. It's Benjamin. IT'S THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A BLIND MAN WHO CAME AND THEY THE DISCIPLES ASKED JESUS. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "Who sinned? &gt;&gt; Was it the parents who sinned?" He says, "No, it's not Benoni. &gt;&gt; It's Benjamin." That the glory OF GOD MIGHT BE MANIFESTED. UH I SAY THE GLORY OF GOD HAS TO BE MANIFESTED. UH BUT YOU MUST COME BACK TO BETHL. [applause] is the tender hand of God. Your situation uh is the tender hand of God. UH YOUR MARRIAGE PROBLEM UH TENDER HAND OF GOD. UH YOUR WORK PROBLEM TEND THE HAND OF GOD. UH YOUR SICKNESS TEND [cheering] &gt;&gt; AND ISAIAH SAW IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND he said, "Who has seen such a thing?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Shall a nation be born in one day? Let me tell you something. WHEN YOU COME BACK to Bethl, miracles will happen in one day. &gt;&gt; BLESSINGS WILL COME IN ONE DAY. TRANSFORMATION WILL HAPPEN IN ONE DAY. HEALING HAPPENS IN ONE DAY. WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THE PROMISE OF GOD. [applause] &gt;&gt; But we have wandered far away &gt;&gt; and we HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT OUR MESSAGE &gt;&gt; it's a restoration message. &gt;&gt; OUR MESSAGE IS A MESSAGE TO GO back &gt;&gt; because Malachi 4 chapter 4 verse four 5 and 6 says to turn back &gt;&gt; the faith &gt;&gt; of the children. back to what &gt;&gt; the faith of the what? &gt;&gt; So the vindication of Malachi 4 &gt;&gt; is children &gt;&gt; who are back in &gt;&gt; Bethl. &gt;&gt; That's the vindication of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Because the vindication of Moses's ministry was Joshua &gt;&gt; because when Joshua placed the people in the land, &gt;&gt; he vindicated the promise of Moses. So the promise of Moses is vindicated by Joshua &gt;&gt; AND JOSHUA IS THE HOLY GHOST AND JOSHUA IS THE DIVIDING OF THE LAND. JOSHUA IS GIVING OF the inheritance &gt;&gt; under the ministry of Moses. &gt;&gt; They'll say, "Oh, Moses, I'm sick." Moses give them bread. &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't want to have shoes. Moses gives them whatever they need. We want meat. Moses gives them meat. But under the ministry of Joshua, &gt;&gt; when the when the the men of Judah came and he says, "OUR LAND IS too small," Joshua says, "TAKE YOUR SWORD AND FIGHT FOR YOURSELF. TAKE YOUR SWORD. TAKE YOUR PLACE BY YOURSELF. TAKE YOUR SWORD AND CLAIM YOUR INHERITANCE." I SAY TONIGHT, UH, TAKE YOUR SWORD, FIGHT, TAKE YOUR SWORD, CLAIM, TAKE YOUR SWORD AND FIGHT. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IF YOUR LAND IS SO SMALL, TAKE YOUR SWORD. YOUR HOUSE IS SO SMALL, TAKE YOUR SWORD. YOUR SALARY IS SO SMALL, TAKE YOUR SWORD. WHATEVER YOU NEED, TAKE IT BY THE WORD. [cheering] Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. THE JOSHUA MINISTRY DIVIDING THE LAND. TAKE WHATEVER YOU NEED. &gt;&gt; Calb came and said, "Give me my mountain. Give me my mountain." Joshua said, "You know what? Take your mountain. Take your mountain." I SAID, "TAKE YOUR MOUNTAIN TONIGHT IN THE NAME OF JESUS. TAKE YOUR MOUNTAIN TONIGHT. IN THE NAME OF JESUS, UH, WHATEVER YOU NEED, it's even in your mouth. [applause] &gt;&gt; You know, Russia was boasting last week. &gt;&gt; They say, you know, we have a nuclear triage. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, they talk about the neutra nuclear triage. Three things. The sea, the the sea to surface missiles. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Nuclear missiles. the surface to surface missiles and the air to surface missiles. That's the superpowers nuclear triage. &gt;&gt; They can launch the missiles from the sea. &gt;&gt; They can launch them from the land. &gt;&gt; They can launch them from the air. &gt;&gt; But I thought, Lord, what about what about the church? &gt;&gt; And I went back to Genesis and Adam was given dominion &gt;&gt; over the beasts of the earth, over the fish of the sea, OVER THE BIRDS OF THE AIR. SO YOU ARE AN ADOPTED SON. YOU HAVE A NUCLEAR TRIAGE. YOU CAN LAUNCH FROM THE SEA, FROM THE SEA. YOU CAN LAUNCH FROM THE LAND. YOU CAN LEARN FROM THE SKY. YOU HAVE DOMINION OVER EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE. [applause and cheering] If it comes through your children, you can fight it. If it comes through your job, you can fight it. If it comes through your church, you can fight it. YOU HAVE A NUCLEAR TRIAGE OF THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Brother says when the weakest of the of the saints begins to pray, he shakes. HE SHAKES. I SAY HE SHAKES. OH, SHAKE HIM TONIGHT. I SAY SHAKE HIM TONIGHT. WHEN THE WEAKEST OF THE of the saints BEGINS TO PRAY, HE SHAKES THE GATES OF HELL. &gt;&gt; And tonight, &gt;&gt; we don't want to shake them. We want to leave them like Samson &gt;&gt; and place them &gt;&gt; on top of a mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I've got &gt;&gt; five minutes left. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Lost their first love. &gt;&gt; And God is saying, &gt;&gt; "Return." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To a place of origin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham in the message, the uniting time and sign. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; One of my favorite quotes. &gt;&gt; He says the sermon, they can live in the sea. &gt;&gt; Say right there. &gt;&gt; They can live in the sea for four years. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They can live there, &gt;&gt; right? But you know what? At the end of their life, &gt;&gt; they make a journey back to come back to their origin. &gt;&gt; And there is nothing that can stop them. The bears in the way cannot stop them. The fishermen cannot stop them. The weather cannot stop them. Construction will not stop them. They there's a law in them &gt;&gt; that they have to go back &gt;&gt; to their point of origin. &gt;&gt; And God, I don't have time declared it in Leviticus. He says the land &gt;&gt; shall not be sold &gt;&gt; forever. &gt;&gt; Forever. &gt;&gt; Says if if you become foolish &gt;&gt; and you sell your land like some of you tonight have sold your land to the devil. He has taken your health. HE HAS TAKEN YOUR JOY. HE HAS TAKEN SOMETHING FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; HE says you can always &gt;&gt; go back &gt;&gt; to the place of your origin &gt;&gt; when you hear the Jubilee trumpet. &gt;&gt; May God bless you. Let's stand up on our feet. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, take me back tonight. &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, take me back. This message is more for me. I say, Lord, take me back. I want to go back to the old days where I used to pray, read my Bible, listen to the tapes, didn't care about message politics, didn't care about message camps. I just stayed in my land. &gt;&gt; Waited for the Holy Spirit to lead me. &gt;&gt; Go where God wants me to go. Do what he wants me to do. I want to go back &gt;&gt; to Bethl. &gt;&gt; I want to go back to the beginning. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Heavenly Father, tonight &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; we thank you [snorts] Lord for your word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We thank you that you called yourself the God of Jacob. &gt;&gt; How the patriarchs would go back and even dig the same wells [music] that their fathers dug. And Lord even Solomon tells us remove not the ancient landmarks that your fathers have set. Lord sometimes we forget who we are. We forget where we come from. [music] Sometimes we wander away from place to place. Sometimes, oh God, being pilgrims, we lose focus. We lose sight of of the vision. But Lord, we thank you that sometimes you change the season to bring us back. [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, as we raise our hands to you, we are saying, Lord, take us back, oh God. Restore our marriages, Father, to the prophet says never let the honeymoon's feeling to cease. Bring us back, Lord, to the old days. Lord, bring brotherly kindness back to the [music] church. Father, you spoke about the restoration of the bride tree, the restoration of the leaves, the restoration of the fruits, everything that was taken by the enemy. Lord, you said, I will restore, says the Lord. Lord, you have given us a message in this LAST DAY THAT RESTORES all these things. Uh, and you said, I WILL SEND you the former reign and the later reign. Lord the prophet came and Elijah restored all things. Uh as you said in your word THAT ELIJAH SURELY SHALL COME AND HE SHALL RESTORE ALL THINGS. UH AND ALL THINGS IS ALL THINGS. UH RESTORE OUR FINANCES, RESTORE OUR MARRIAGES, OUR HOMES, OUR MINISTRIES, OUR LIVES, EVERYTHING. UH WE THANK you father for the ministries you are raising up uh Lord to bring us back to Beth back to the beginning.

[music] [applause] What a masterpiece tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go back to better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the place of origin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can we start prayer in couple three weeks ago and the Lord comes back and tell us to go back again in prayer? &gt;&gt; Amen. A season has opened up again. &gt;&gt; Things are going to change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever you are, if there is something that is not correct, go back to your first love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Forget about what is happening left and right. Forget about what happened. Forget about how people push you or whatever happened. Go back to battle. Amen. It is not about people. It's about your own heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants your heart to be clean, &gt;&gt; to be pure, so he can pour his blessing beyond what you can even imagine. Amen. So all the sorrows will be changed into Benjamin. Amen. &gt;&gt; Get away from the website. Get away from the internet. Get away from the social media. Get away from the fighting on the internet. Amen. Get away from those environment where they keep talking about the preachers, the preachers, the preachers until it becomes a common thing to talk about ministers. In this message, you see sisters talking about ministers and brothers are talking about ministers until there is no respect to a minister. We don't even know how to respect a pastor anymore. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we got used to talking about a pastor and then when you have one, you don't even know what is a pastor. What is he representing? What is a man of God doing here? Because we got used to those things. Amen. Let's go back to battle. So when a minister stand right here when he's talking, you're not looking at a man. &gt;&gt; You are trying to hear from God. You say, "This is God talking to me. This is God telling me what to do." You pick up the the the the the message that has been delivered. When he said, "Receive it in Jesus Christ." It's not brother Aaron. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. He went through many things that we preach here. It was not him. It took a long time before he get here. It is God. You can even tell he's already he he he is already taken over by the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's many things he spoke. We can preach a message on any one of them. He he he was completely off his note and he went completely off. He could not even control and finish his thought because the spirit of the Lord is ministering and going left and right and the sword is going up. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is a Joshua ministry. Amen. We will help you. We pray for you. But you got to learn how to fight for yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why we going through this prayer. Amen. I was even thinking throughout the day. I say I believe and I hope now young people begin to know how to pray. Because we taught you how to pray, &gt;&gt; but you want to see it in in experience. &gt;&gt; And as we doing and we going through prayer all the time. Now you need, you are learning little by little how to worship the Lord, how to enter in, how to spend time in the Lord versus just coming five minutes and say, "Lord Jesus Christ, give me this, this, this, this, and you go to bed." No. Now you are learning that, hey, before I even talk about asking anything, the first thing, let me thank him for the day. Amen. Let me worship him. Let me ask him to to to to cleanse me. Let me repent and let me ask and let me sit quiet &gt;&gt; and let me wait. I know I give you two minute and three minute. I'm giving you an exercise. But you need to start learning now more than two minute or three minute. In other words, when you praying yourself, you sit quiet. Maybe 20 minutes. Just sit calm. This is when you're going to hear instruction. Sometime he can speak to you. Sometime he will speak to your heart. Sometime he may come from a tape. Sometime he may come. There's many ways he's going to come. If you sit quiet and you just listen slowly, you will begin to listen to hear him coming up. And from there on, you will learn how God deals with you. &gt;&gt; Not how God deal with somebody else. &gt;&gt; How God deal with you. Because there is a way that I'm going to tell you this is God telling me. This is the spirit of the Lord is telling me to do something. and you wonder where do you hear that? There is a way that you commune with him and before you know it, you develop that uh uh a relationship with him and you begin to know what he's telling you. Amen. &gt;&gt; God loves you so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God loves you so much. In summary, God want to change everything into a Benjamin. But there are things that was on your way &gt;&gt; that has been blocking him &gt;&gt; and you have been wondering a long time why it's not going away. He brings the answer and he's telling you I'm already there. I'm already ahead of the game. &gt;&gt; Everything that you see around, I'm the one orchestrating everything. Take the teraphim off. Clean up everything. Go back to that battle and you will see how I'm going to change everything. It's a new season. &gt;&gt; If you missed the message, I summarize everything for you. This is a masterpiece, Eagle. God bless you and welcome again to Spoken Word Tabernacle. Amen. &gt;&gt; May we pray? Heavenly Father, Lord, we [music] approaching you humbly tonight.
