die you're gonna go there and come back then you are back you are fighting that battle in a different perspective amen brother branham said the reason why jesus went into the tomb because david already prophesied so when he was jumping into the tomb he knew that he would never leave his anointed sea corruption so no matter how dark he looks for the disciple no longer he told them all he fools amen the scripture will dictate the event it's gonna even dictate the clothing your vice president will be wearing amen maybe she woke up in the morning she thought she's going to put a red

invite you to turn in your bibles to colossians chapter 3. i believe it was the the last time i was here i i just made mention of this message and then brother stephen told me he said we we're gonna get you back then just uh to try to share what the lord had given us there so we trust be a blessing to you this evening this is my first service uh ministering again after kind of dealing with that virus and everything so i'm looking to give the devil a black eye tonight amen we thank the lord who gives us the victory amen we'll be reading beginning at verse 12 of colossians chapter 3 and let's just go to the author of the word approach him in prayer once more this evening heavenly father lord we are so blessed to have the opportunity and the privilege to come and gather and join with one another tonight lord join our voices and our hearts together in worship to you lord and to approach the table that we believe lord you will you have prepared to serve and to feed our souls tonight and we pray father that this this atmosphere will just be pleasing to you lord to come into our midst and break the bread of life to us lord as our brother was was referring to a few moments ago lord how you rebuked those disciples after the resurrection and you said oh fools and slew of heart and lord they they pondered in their minds and they even rejoiced lord at the words you spoke but it was only when the doors were closed and you broke the bread of life lord were their eyes open and they realized lord you weren't dead you weren't still sealed in a tomb lord you weren't a memory you weren't history but you were living lord there to fulfill the promise of your word and lord we pray that you will again make yourself known tonight lord in the breaking of the bread lord may you take what what has been prepared lord and just serve it tonight lord minister it may you speak in our midst father god and may your may your holy spirit have complete preeminence lord in every part of this service give us grace lord we pray that your perfect will may be done in jesus christ's name we ask it amen colossians chapter 3 uh beginning at verse 12 put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness long-suffering forgiving one another for bearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any as even as christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and be ye thankful let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god in the father by him let's also move down to verse 23 as we continue and whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to the lord and not unto men knowing that of the lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the lord christ but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done and there is no respect of persons may the lord bless the reading of his word this evening you may be seated and i want to take for a title tonight for this thought three kinds of christians three kinds of christians now we know that the prophet of god preached on the believer the make-believer and the unbeliever and that's that's also three types of believers but i i'm not going to be dealing with that uh those types tonight i'm going to be dealing with three other kinds of christians or so-called christians and so the the first one i want to to speak uh speak about tonight is the casual christian the casual christian and the way i would describe the casual christian tonight is the laodicean christian amen because we know the laodiceans they were not hot and they were not cold they were lukewarm in a lukewarm condition and that's the way this casual christian is tonight he's not hot he he's not really on fire for god but he's not completely cold either amen he's just somewhere in the middle and so this contemporary christian he is a is a unique character because you know no matter what he claims to believe he can blend in in almost any crowd or any setting because he's a casual christian amen he he can be a he could fit in at church amongst believers and he can also walk right out the door and fit in amen at work he can fit in with the contemporary crowd he can fit in with the the unbeliever the denominational believer you can put him in any setting and somehow he will just blend in and fit in in other words he's not going to offend anyone with his beliefs he's not going to make anybody including the devil uncomfortable with his convictions amen he's not going to speak out against something that's wrong or something you know there's hardly anything that offends this person and they don't offend anyone else now they want to be saved and they want to go to heaven when they die but they just don't want to take things too far they've seen others get too carried away and fall into fanaticism and so this individual is not going to invest their whole life their whole heart and their whole soul into anything pertaining to the things of god they're uh they're happy to watch from a distance and they're happy to watch the blessings fall on everyone else in the service everyone else in the church amen the power of god can be moving and the spirit of god can be falling amen people can be rejoicing and praising god but this casual christian doesn't want to be branded or identified as a fanatic so so that so he or she is not going to get into the spirit they're not going to really enter into the service they're they're not going to be called shouting or dancing or screaming or praising god or or speaking in tongues or any of those things because that's fanatical but they'll stand right there and watch everybody else get a blessing amen watch everybody else get a touch from god watch others be saved and healed and delivered and they'll walk out of that same service the same way they walked in to the service now if you're not careful you will offend the casual christian if you work with the casual christian be careful not to talk to them at work about what happened at church don't talk about how good the service was don't talk about how the word of god was broken and and fed your soul and thrilled your heart they might even get offended if you pray over your meal because they are a casual christian they don't want to be known as a fanatic they don't want to be known as an on fire christian amen if if they pray for their food it might look like they're just you know wiping their nose at the same time or something like that because they're they're they're uh they're a casual christian they're they're a covert christian amen they're almost like a spy they want to be to be known as a christian but yet they want to be undercover so be careful if you're reading your bible on the job you might offend the casual christian if you pray over your food in public if if you begin testifying of god's goodness his salvation is mercy man if someone has received christ as their savior just speaking about it kind of makes the casual christian a little bit uncomfortable you know i i hate to call names but i think it's okay uh years ago when i was when i was a teenager we went to a christian concert and it was in asheville north carolina it was a gaither concert so it had the gaither vocal band and all of these other christian singers and groups there and at the beginning of this of this concert gloria gaither bill gaither's wife was asked to give the opening prayer and i'll never forget it because she prayed this prayer and at the end of this of this beautiful prayer that she prayed she said and we ask all of these things in the name and that was the end of her prayer and i on the inside i was boiling i wanted to shout out in the middle of that auditorium his name is jesus amen jesus is my savior jesus is who bled and died for my sins jesus is who was buried in the tomb and jesus is who resurrected on that third and glorious day amen it was jesus jesus is his name but i thought you know here is a person a highly renowned a a person known throughout the world for the songs that have been written and the gift of god in her life but yet in this modern age where we're not supposed to we're not supposed to make anyone uncomfortable we're not supposed to be branded amen we're all supposed to just blend in anymore she didn't want to mention the name of god and possibly offend a non-non-believer or a muslim or a person of some other faith but you know what i'm a christian tonight amen to be a christian you have to be identified with jesus christ you have to be identified with the word of god and i want to tell you to be a believer in this hour you won't be ashamed to be identified with the revealed word of this hour or with the servant of god that he sent the prophet of god to this age amen the true believer amen cannot be a casual believer amen but they are not ashamed to be identified with jesus christ and who he is amen the prophet of god says this in the message the breach he said a woman just called up another woman said you know i'm episcopalian said i spoke in tongues the other day i believe i received the holy ghost but don't tell nobody don't tell nobody the prophet of god says i doubt that very much you might have spoke with tongues but you set a man on fire how is he going to sit still that's right can't do it amen he said can you imagine peter james and john and them up in the upper room saying oh we got the holy ghost now but maybe we better just keep still brother through windows doors and everything they went amen out in the street acting like a bunch of drunks that's the holy ghost hey amen i thank god tonight amen i do not want to be a casual christian i don't want to be someone that feels like we've got to be able to blend in to whatever setting we're placed into amen i'm thankful tonight that the hebrew children was not casual christians amen when daniel was commanded when it became illegal for daniel to pray out loud he never changed his habits he never changed his relationship with god he threw open the windows the next morning and said all thank you jehovah god for giving me another day amen he was not a casual christian amen in acts chapter 5 verse 17 amen let's you know i think sometimes it's good to look up our family tree [Music] and to identify with our ancestors amen the bible says in acts 5 17 then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which are which is the sect of the sadducees and were filled with indignation and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison that was one way believers were known in that hour was they were being imprisoned for their stand you know some brother kelly this just struck me the other day do you know who persecuted the the true christians the was the so-called christians it was the jews it was the followers of moses i mean it was the jewish faith that persecuted the spirit spirit-filled christian in the book of acts they were the ones who killed james john's brother amen because the bible says herod killed james the brother of john when he saw how much it pleased the jews it wasn't unbelievers who were bringing this persecution so much it was their so-called jewish brethren oh my jesus said rejoice and be exceeding glad for so persecuted they the fathers before you amen oh my they laid their hands on the apostles put them in the common prison verse 19 but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said be still and be quiet was that the angel's commission did i read that verse correctly verse 20 no the angel said go stand and speak to the people all the words of this life and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught the high priest came and they they were that were with him and called the council together and all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and said saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keepers standing with out before the doors but when we had opened we found no man within the chief priest and the captain of the temple and excuse me when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them where unto this would grow then came one and told him saying behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people it doesn't matter where man puts you or where men put you god is going to take you from that place and set you and establish you where he desires you to and give you a voice to speak his will amen it was the the it was the religious leaders that put him in the prison but god put him back in the temple it was the religious leaders that tried to silence their voice but god gave them a voice it was religious leaders that was trying to extinguish this amen but god found it back to life amen oh glory to god i don't want to be a casual christian let's go on then went to captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned and when they had brought them they sent them before the council and the high priest asked them saying did we not straightly command you that you should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us then peter and the other apostles answered and said i like this response and i think it's something we should all commit to memory tonight peter said we ought to obey god rather than men amen we are accountable we are answering to god amen we are reporting to god we are his agents amen we are his soldiers amen he bought us with his blood he gave us this commission go ye into all the world and preach the gospel heal the sick amen cast out devils amen if you shall drink in the deadly thing it shall not harm you amen and you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover i am operating under orders from a higher authority than the united states government than any world government world power church leader no man has authority over the believer amen he is under the jurisdiction of the holy ghost amen peter told him i'm operating under the chain of command we ought to obey god rather than men amen it doesn't matter what your vote is it doesn't matter what your consensus is it doesn't matter what the world opinion is amen what god said is what matters amen we ought to obey god rather than men the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom you slew and hanged on a tree him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses of these things [Music] and so is the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them amen peter and these apostles were not casual christians they were extreme christians they were not laodiceans amen they were not lukewarm but they were on fire for god i want to tell you this you cannot be a casual christian at token time amen when the token message goes forth you're either going to apply it and be spared or the death angel is going to strike you home amen there is no middle ground there there's no in between amen there's no lukewarm you were either in or you were out amen and if god brought this message god gave this provision it is god who is backing it god who is enforcing it and we are obeying god's commandment amen and we are under his protection to be spared from the effects of the death angel amen praise the lord you can't be a poser any longer it's manifesting time it's manifesting time amen in in the tassel stage it could be anything in the stock stage it could be anything i mean when it comes up it can be any but when the seed comes forth at harvest time it becomes very evident that's a wheat and that's a tear that's a wheat and that's a tear amen there's no more confusion amen there's no more ambivalence about it it's either one or the other you're either in or out so that is the casual christian now i want to go to another type of christian and i call this the costume christian oh you think halloween is the only time of year people put on costumes and pretend to be other people or other characters no that goes on year round and one of the most popular places for people to wear costumes is church church [Music] and the costumed christian is the most shameful of any of these three categories because they can appear as anything and they can act as anything and they can make a very persuasive and convincing argument amen or give this project this image to almost anybody to be almost anything judas was a costume christian he never had a birth he never had the life of jesus christ living out from him he was never sold out amen he was never completely convinced but he acted the part he dressed the part he even even performed miracles he even took a part in the ministry of jesus disciples and was so trusted he was allowed to hold the the money and the treasure but you know what when judas became offended when judas became ashamed when judas when when the pressure was on and he no longer wanted to be identified as a disciple he put on another costume and he went right out to the authorities and sold the lord jesus for 30 pieces of silver the costume christian their christianity is a costume or a character that they play on sunday morning they put on the costume of a christian and drive to church and come into the service and my how they play my how they act you would never think this is the casual christian because they can sing the loudest they they they want to sing a special they've got a testimony to give and they they they have influence and they want to be influential because they want to convince everyone they possibly can that they are not just a christian they are a good christian they have all the appearances of a devout christian and they will put the casual christian to shame as far as the appearances like i said they'll show up for church they'll lead in prayer they'll sing and they'll shout but when that's all over and they get back home that costume is very carefully removed and buttoned up with no wrinkles no creases no blemishes and it's put on a hanger and put back into the closet and it won't be worn again until the next church service or maybe if the pastor comes over for dinner they'll pull that out of the closet and put it on again but for the most part that costume only gets worn when they're going to be around other christian people because they have other costumes that they put on as well so when the christian costume goes off they'll put on another act or the the real person will then come out and they'll be hateful to their family hateful to the husband hateful to the wife hateful to the children hateful to the neighbors amen they they they are a terror to be driving around them in traffic because they're rude they're angry they're impatient amen they will they they will cut you off and then they'll they'll do they see that christian costume is in the closet they don't have to be a christian any longer that's been put away now they're just out there scratching with the rest of the world they're out there rubbing shoulders with the rest of the world you see they'll use different language they'll they'll all they'll tell the dirty jokes with the co-workers they'll laugh they'll they'll they'll drink they'll smoke they'll do they'll you know sometimes if it's a young person uh oh she'll wear dresses at home in a church but she's got a pair of pants in the locker room at school and she's going to put those pants on when she gets to school because she wants to fit in with the worldly girls and christianity to her is just a costume and it ain't just girls the boys do the same thing they got their little jewelry and they got their shorts and they got their stick on tattoos and they got all these other things that they'll put on to try to blend in with their classmates and their school friends this is a costume christian at church they look like a sheep but their outfit has a zipper it'll set off a spiritual metal detector when the costume christian comes into the service the holy spirit is like an x-ray machine and it'll make that costume christian uncomfortable and they'll be sitting there in a suit and just they'll look nicer than the pastor but when real conviction begins to be preached amen and now let now they'll say amen for the mysteries and they'll say amen god sent a prophet and as long as the deep things are being preached and the doctrines are being told and all the wonderful things of the message are being laid out they'll say amen but if you start preaching on where they live and you talk about conduct order and doctrine or you talk about tithes and offerings or you talk about christian living amen or the baptism of the holy ghost all of a sudden they got to go to the bathroom they got to go outside and take a phone call something just came up and they have to remove themselves from the situation and the holy spirit is exposing the zipper that wool didn't grow out that wool was put on and can be taken off and that's a costume christian but i want to tell you tonight the costumed christian is a dangerous dangerous role the costumed christians that the bible describes to us never have a good outcome there's never a good ending to their life and one of those costumed christians was the name of was by the name of king ahab king ahab amen he could he could appear religious he could consult with the prophet amen he knew where to go to get the word of the lord but he had a hard time accepting it and putting it into practice so we know how they called for the prophets that day and uh shall we go up to rhemath gilead and all the 400 prophets said go up and and i believe it was jehoshaphat said don't you have one more and he said yes but i hate him because he knows i gotta every you know i can't i can't pay him off i can't influence him with my money i can't offer him prestige and position and power there's nothing i can do to persuade him he doesn't like me and anything he says is the word of the lord and he never said one good thing about me and you know somehow jehoshaphat knew that's the guy we need to hear from that's the man we need to hear from the man that cannot be bought the man that cannot be persuaded and the man that tells the truth because it's not his words it's god's words amen that's who we need to hear from and when mekiah spoke he said go up go up but you're going to die go up because you're not in control prophecy is in control the words of the prophet that was spoken the dogs are going to lick ahab's blood those words are going to be fulfilled it doesn't matter if the prophet is present it doesn't matter if he's still alive the word of god is going to be fulfilled so you know what ahab's idea was i'll put on a disguise he said jehoshaphat you dress up like a king you you put on your kingly garments jehoshaphat and i'll dress like something other than a king he was going to put on a costume because he felt like if if jehoshaphat could be noticed as a king it would put the spotlight on him and he would become the target of the enemy and his life would be taken instead of ahab's of whom the prophecy was given that he was going to die but i'm going to tell you all your costumes is not going to go around prophecy prophecy is going to still be fulfilled no matter how much you try to hide from it no matter how much you try to disguise yourself i mean no matter how much you try to change the outcome god's word is going to be fulfilled and and they went out to battle and the enemy spotted ahab they spotted jehoshaphat too but they said that's not our target there's ahab and they shot him they they shot up leave us with arrows and he died that day and prophecy was fulfilled amen the enemy was not fooled by the disguise you know another costumed christian was saul who tried to disguise himself as someone else and go to the witch at indoor because he could no longer hear the word of god the word of god wouldn't speak to him any longer amen it was it was like the heavens were closed and he had made witchcraft illegal it was a a punishment of death it was a death sentence to be practicing this but yet he had he felt like he had to resort to this to learn of his future so he disguised himself and he goes down and goes into this medium who is a witch and as soon as she entered into that realm his disguise wouldn't work any longer she said you're saul you're saul you can't hide who you are amen all your robes all your disguise won't work i can see who you are and and she brought up the prophet samuel and he said tomorrow you'll be with me you know saul liked to operate his whole his whole ministry as king was under disguise he wanted to be identified with the prophet even when he had no word of the prophet he said you know remember when the enemy came in and he cut up those oxen and sent the pieces out throughout all of israel and he and he said so saith saul and samuel samuel never said that the bible doesn't say samuel had any involvement with that but small realized he had no credibility unless he wrapped his message in the cloak of a prophet and and presented it as the prophet's words or the prophet's teachings or the prophet's doctrine or the prophet's idea but the prophet had nothing to do with that that was saul amen trying to attach himself to a ministry that was vindicated that was authenticated by god and god was backing it amen with vindication oh and brother we got a lot of saul's roaming around this world today amen that want to borrow from the prophet's influence and to give their own ministry credibility when they don't believe the message they don't line up to it they haven't accepted it amen but they know it has power so they want to attach themselves to it [Music] amen but the holy spirit can see through that disguise amen it doesn't matter how much you love brother branham or tell his stories or i want to associate yourself with the things of the prophet if you don't have the the if you don't have the life of god living through you amen the word of god hasn't been quickened by the power of the holy spirit amen the holy spirit will expose that disguise amen the bible says in uh just very quickly first first peter told us this i don't want to be a costumed christian tonight and first peter 3 says likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price paul said that inward character that inward life that beauty can win the center it can win the unbelieving husband i mean it's not about it's not about how much you put on an outward appearance of a christian it's that life down on the inside amen that will compel even the unbeliever they know what you have is genuine it's it's like the the men in the bar room were talking about there's no genuine christians you know they're all hypocrites they're all unbelievers they're they're all just posers but the one man said that's not true i know of one who is genuine and he took those drunks to his home and and woke his wife up and said make us some breakfast you know and then threw the food on the floor and was breaking the dishes and she didn't hit him with the bible she didn't tell him who her pastor was she didn't start quoting quotes and reading scriptures and all those things she just stood in the frying pan stood at the stove in front of the frying pan must jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free she lived the life amen she didn't have the outward it was something genuine on the inside and those men acknowledged that night there is a living genuine christian amen there are some real christians in the world today amen i'll just mention one other here a costume christian aiken was a costume christian he was an israelite but for some reason in the spoils of battle he felt to reserve to himself a golden wedge and a babylonian garment wonder why he was keeping a babylonian garment hanging in the closet you know why because he was never convinced that what he had was good enough he was never fully convinced that god's prophet and his message was enough to conquer every enemy every nation everything that stood between them and the promise he was not convinced that was enough so he kept the babylonian garment on standby just in case they were ever attacked and overtaken by the enemy he could go slip on a babylonian garment and spare his own life as if god wasn't strong enough to spare the lives of the believers so aiken kept a babylonian garment on standby and you say brother tim there is nobody nobody like that today all but there are there are people who come from baptists catholic uh other forms of beliefs i'm not picking on anyone i'm just saying they got something in their past and in their background that they have never fully released and they are keeping those ideas they are keeping that identification they're keeping that there as a fallback just in case something ever goes wrong with the message because they're not convinced that the message is enough so they're keeping a babylonian garment in the closet for backup or for standby but i want to tell you if that's the way you are tonight your end will be the same as aikens in because the babylonian garment could not be hid from the holy ghost amen he could have hid it from his brothers from his sisters from his wife and from his children but joshua a type of the holy ghost says wait a minute this would not be happening except there is hidden sin in the camp and he says come here and he brought every tribe in review until finally he come to achan and aiken said yes i am the costume christian i don't want to be a costumed christian today a costumed christian never has a good end i'll say this tonight the only good end of a costume christian is the altar where they repent and burn that babylonian garment and melt that golden wedge amen discard everything from your past discard everything from from how you've been taught or how you've been believed or have you been indoctrinated leave it all behind because it only brings death amen now i'm coming to my last the last type of christian and i want to read from jude chapter 1 verse 14. the bible says and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all of their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and all of their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him these are murmurs complainers walking after their own lusts and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of advantage but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who would walk should walk after their own ungodly lusts these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit but ye beloved but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference oh mice we got a lot of people who are being different and trying with everything that's in them to be different but the scripture says make a difference amen be the kind of christian that makes a difference and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only wise god our savior be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen so the last kind of christian i want to talk to you about tonight is the contagious christian the contagious christian this is the man the woman the boy or the girl that makes a difference i do heating and air conditioning and you forgive me if you've heard me share this before i'm in the heating and air conditioning business and you know there are two things one is a thermometer and the other is a thermostat and the thermometer only tells or declares the temperature whatever the temperature of the room is or whatever the temperature it is outside that thermometer just rises or falls whatever is going on around it is what it becomes because it's a thermometer and all it does is tells the temperature then there's something called a thermostat amen and it knows what the temperature is but unlike the thermometer the thermostat is connected to a source of energy and it has a setting that can be raised or lowered and it is not controlled by the temperature but it has power to change the temperature and what i'm trying to tell you tonight is god has not called us to be thermometers laodiceans are thermometers even whatever is going on around them is what they become but god has called christians to be thermostats because you are connected to a source of energy amen and although you can recognize what's going on around you you are not controlled by what's happening around you rather you are having an impact on the circumstances around you oh brother sister amen you get a real holy ghost field thermostat christian amen they can walk into a cold formal sticky situation maybe a worship service or maybe a meeting in a home maybe maybe into a business meeting that you you can put them in almost any circumstance and they can begin changing things they begin clapping their hands they begin lifting their hands they begin worshiping god why they are not reacting to what's happening around them but they are connected to a source of energy and as he turns up the dial amen they begin to warm up the room around them oh brother i'm thinking about paul and silas when they were cast in prison that night amen instead of feeling sorry for themselves instead of saying we just be like the other prisoners we should sit here and cry and complain and moan and gripe and think about how could we be treated this way oh no they were not thermometers they were thermostats they began seeking praises to god they began shouting amen they began worshiping god hallelujah and the holy spirit came down into that prison and not only freed paul and silas but it broke the bars it broke open the doors even it brought the concrete down it freed all the prisoners and saved the jailer too oh my friend amen they put three thermostats in the fiery furnace one day they thought they could destroy them with fire but they was controlled they was connected to a source of energy and one angel said i'll go and another angel said i'll go and he said no i am the energy that is connected to shadrach meshach and abednego and jehovah genre even came down from his heavenly throne and he began to fan the flames of that fire and he began dancing he began rejoicing he began praising god they were not ashamed to be identified with me and i'm not ashamed to be identified with him hallelujah are you a contagious christian tonight are you connected to a source of energy hallelujah yes i know it's laodicea yes i know it's the end times yes i know there's a virus going around but i'm not affected by what's around me i'm connected to what's above me hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah they're starting fires everywhere they go amen they are fire starters they're burning embers they're alive coal off of the altar and they're glowing and they're radiating god's glory oh my amen praise the lord amen thank you jesus [Applause] this is the kind of christian the devil hates the devil can't stand this kind of christian and every demon in hell knows who the contagious christians are because every time they are given an assignment to go and tempt them torment them afflict them those demons come back having second thoughts about what side they're on they are more affected by the person they went to torment than the person is the reason they're affected is because the believer is connected amen hallelujah stephen was a contagious christian he was being stoned he was being killed his life was being exterminated but as they were trying to smother out the flame of his life it jumped like a spark from a brush fire when they stomped and they stamped the fire leaped over to a man by the name of saul and he had been around powerful influences he had been groomed and had been raised and had been exposed his whole life was in a vein to become something but in this burning christian by the name of stephen his death had a greater impact on saul's life than everything that had ever happened to him up until that time that's a contagious christian i'm coming to a close but let me just share a few things with you if i made this all right in the book of revelation john turned to see the voice that spoke with him and when he turned he saw seven golden candle sticks or lamp stands and the prophet of god picks this up and he says now what is the candlestick it's a lamp stand and notice how beautiful when he turned to sea or when he turned he saw this one like the son of man standing here in the midst of the seven golden lampstands which means seven church ages to come and each lampstand hooked into the main big oil sensor and in this oil come forth up to a little odd-shaped lamp that set with a wick in it and the wick hung down into the oil they poured oil into the top of the stand which filled up the big main stem and the big branch and it ran out into the stems like this and the lamp with the wick hanging down this pipe kept burning day and night you never had to light it it never went out they just kept pouring oil in the main pipe and these lampstands that come out like this had the lamp sitting on top of them the wick from the lamp run down into here got its life out of here oh what different it is from a candle you see a candle is just wax with a wick in the middle and once it burns down it's over but a lamp stand amen it's everlasting the fire is always burning because the wick is dipped in the oil and it's drawing the energy from that oil and it's turning liquid into light amen it's turning liquid into light it's turning oil into a power that can illuminate and can radiate and warm amen it's how you turn the word of god into action i mean others can read that word but it means nothing to them but when your life is dipped into it you change it amen it converts the energy into something that can give light and warmth and healing and salvation and deliverance you see now these lamp stands the fire that was on these lampstands in the old testament when they lit one lamp they could not light the next lamp with the same fire they had in their hand they lit one lamp then picked it up and lit the other lamp and then set it down and lift this lamp and then took and lit this lamp with the same fire that they had at the beginning oh i hope it don't go over your head jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the same fire holy ghost split every one of those churches right down through the ages so the fire that has quickened you tonight the fire that has let you amen is not a different fire it's not your pastor's fire it's not your parents fire it's not the prophet's fire but it's the same fire that fell on the day of pentecost and it has been passed from believer to believer to believer to believer even from saul to the apostle paul from stephen to the apostle paul and on down our radius amen on and on columba martin amen all the way down through this age amen you didn't get the fire of the prophet you got to fire the holy ghost amen the same fire that lit the prophet hallelujah oh my these lampstands all fit into one great big bowl one great big holder seven different lamp holders come out of it and when they did each one of those lights was drawing from the main resource of its life and its light was because it had its candle dipped down into this main barrel oh what a beautiful picture of one of those seven stars it represented with his light on fire with the holy ghost by faith he's burning with the holy ghost and his life is a candle or not a candle but a wick that's dipped into the holy spirit into christ and through that wick he's drawing the life of god out to give light to his church oh what a picture of the true believer now that's key because brother branham wasn't making this exclusive to the messengers but he's saying oh what a picture of the true believer what kind of a light is he giving the same kind of light that was when the first scandal was lit well no wonder jesus told them terry in jerusalem until you be endured with power from moon high oh my i feel like i i i want to skip over but then i don't want to skip over just when the first stage church age started it was ephesus paul the angel of that church one of the stars there's seven stars which means seven angels seven messengers this week i can take the scripture in the history and prove to you each one of those are true in each angel and every angel had the same light that's right and then right between those ages that great one to come now notice they're drawing from this main barrel of oil the life is dipped into christ you are dead and your life is hidden christ are hidden in god through christ and sealed by the holy spirit there's no way at all to ever get you away from there how can you do it nobody can tamper with you nobody can tamper with you the end of your life is burning with the holy ghost burning giving light where is the other end of your life dipped into christ you are dead and hidden in christ the holy ghost is blocking it off there that you can the devil can't touch you [Music] oh my he can blow he can puff but he cannot extinguish the fire amen the devil can't touch you amen he can whiz and make a noise even death itself can't touch you oh death where is thy sting where is thy victory thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ i want to be a contagious christian amen saul when he became converted after seeing stephen stone to death and after meeting the pillar of fire and getting his candle lit he became so contagious he became so persuasive oh my agrippa said almost thou persuades me to be a christian and i want to tell you when you become a contagious christian the devil does not have enough disinfectant there's not enough gloves there's not enough masks the power the power of your contagious can penetrate anything that the devil tries to place there to block it it can be an unbelieving husband it can be an unbelieving wife it can be unbelieving children it can be an unbelieving boss man or co-workers no matter what the situation is amen you have become a contagious christian amen and the effects of your life on fire with the holy ghost affects everything and everybody around you is that the kind of christian that you want to be tonight amen lord make me a contagious christian let me be let my life be a wick dipped into that oil and burning on the other end all granted tonight let's stand if you will amen three kinds of christians amen and may we just bow our head for a moment tonight as hired musicians return and you know the thing about it is brother and sister we could probably all be honest tonight with our heads bowed and their eyes closed and say lord at some point in time in my christian journey i have been one or at various times all of these types of christian i have been casual at times i have been the costume christian or i remember a time when i was a contagious christian i could not contain the joy it was just bubbling over everyone around me knew what god was doing in my life and maybe your desire tonight would be lord change me lord take me and and restore my life i know what kind of christian i am and i know the kind of christian i desire to be and lord that's what i want tonight i want to place everything on the altar i want to surrender everything out of my life i want the holy the fire of the holy spirit to come and consume everything out of my life that's not like him just as we read in the opening scripture tonight if you've got an alt in your heart if you've got bitterness if you've got a grudge if you've got something that will hinder your flame as a christian but you can you can place that on the altar tonight you might say tonight brother tim that person owes me an apology that person needs to repent i i know how that feels brother and sister but the bible didn't tell us to wait for an apology the bible didn't tell us to to wait for repentance the bible said to forgive even as christ forgave you the bible give us the instructions how to be a contagious christian if that's your desire tonight won't you just lift your hand lift your heart to the lord say lord i don't want to be casual i don't want to be an actor i don't want to be a hypocrite lord i don't want to be lukewarm lord i want to be on fire for you heavenly father lord as we lift our hearts to you this evening father god we believe that the fire of the holy spirit still burns and your power lord can still move lord to expose every foothold lord everywhere the enemy would try to come in and grip our life lord and begin to cool us off lord or relax us lord allow things to creep into our lives which compromise lord our strength as christians and lord tonight we we we say lord let the rays of that holy spirit lord penetrate into the deepest depths of our lives oh god into every corner every avenue every channel lord god let the holy spirit expose satan lord and and remove father god every foothold lord every grip everything he's tried lord to place over us to hinder us tonight lord we don't want to hold on to those things lord we don't want to we don't want to feel sorry for ourselves lord or make excuses oh but god we want to place ourselves lord on the altar before you tonight lord you know exactly who we are father god lord you know our coming in and our going out lord you know our uprising and our downfall lord we're your children tonight and we just want to surrender our lives completely into your hands and say lord lord as isaiah prayed let an angel bring a live coal from the altar and touch my lips lord god lord make me a vessel make me a vessel lord that you can use to live your word and live your life through granted tonight lord we ask that you'll grant it touch every heart and touch every life move lord in every hearted life this evening lord as they feel the urge and the move of the holy spirit may you move our god may the deep call to the deep may the waters of life flow freely lord feel that thirst tonight in the soul of every believer thank you jesus amen sing a little song if you will tonight there is a river [Music] there is a river that flows from deep within there is a fountain that frees the soul if you come to this water there is a vast supply you believe that tonight oh there is a river that [Music] there is [Music] [Music] aren't you thankful tonight it frees the soul from sin if to this water oh there is a supply i know there is a [Music] sing this little song i feel [Music] no more costumes no more casual he speaks to me somewhere down on the inside and i agree this is the desire of my heart lord please come and take control oh i feel the pull once more now with all your heart i feel love aren't you thankful something on the inside is magnetized hear the call blessed are your ears that you have a hearing tonight and i know his spirits it's smoothing me to give my all give him your all tonight oh he speaks [Music] lord please come [Music] thank you jesus you love the lord this [Music] evening thankfully thank god there's something down on the inside that can respond to the move of the holy spirit amen if you've got any tug in there tonight whatsoever you're a blessed person amen just follow the leadership of the holy spirit let him have complete preeminence in your heart and life he'll guide and he'll provide he'll protect he'll preserve you and he'll bring you through to the other side i've got confidence tonight i mean he that has started a good work in you will be faithful to perform it through the day of jesus christ take control i feel the holy sing of what's worse our brother comes let's worship have you been moved tonight to give my all [Music] lord please come and take control i feel [Music] we need that pull in the heart that's why david say my soul is crying he's crying for the living god this is a masterpiece tonight it is not just a message to get intellectually but it's actually the moving of the holy spirit amen this brother brother tim cross was supposed to be preaching for us last wednesday and for some reason we have to schedule this wednesday and i believe he didn't know what was preached here on sunday when the holy spirit spoke to us how we came out from the wilderness of sin and somewhere in dhaka where god has been knocking to your heart trying to get access to the inner men and some accepted it they got baptized and they moved from dovka to alosh when you become part of a congregation part of a church part of a fellowship but still you have not drunk from the rock yet and the holy spirit was moving toward referendum which means rest or a resting place a rest for your soul because christ said that come unto me ye that are laboring and i'm gonna give you rest to your soul and we stopped right there on sunday and we went home and the message that was supposed to be given last wednesday god arranged to be given this wednesday and god is giving you an opportunity even those that are online god is giving you probably a second or the last chance before the rapture to give you an opportunity to get the holy ghost amen the holy spirit stopped me a referendum just say rest don't explain anything because i need to clean up certain things in the midst of the people and he came tonight and he spoke and what he spoke he said there are certain christians that are in alice you are in a congregation maybe you were born in a messy church maybe you came like rachel you stole others from your father and you were bringing this adult toward the promised land you were keeping that babylonian garment bringing that up toward the message and trying to keep it as a plan b in the message and the holy spirit spoke and said if you are in the stage of a casual christian a christian that is a shame of the gospel you need to make sure your heart is good and you get into a serious prayer with god these prophecies are not things to be just talk about where we just rejoice talk about it and then tomorrow we forget about it it become a history it is telling you that the time is ahead and god is giving another opportunity telling you if you are a christian christian stop what you're doing refocus your life this church is not a continuation of the old church we came out of no that's why the holy spirit wants to clean up amen some of you are custom christian amen and all of them ended up wrong being killed in the bottom amen you cannot hide from the holy spirit you cannot be a christian and play out sometimes it shock me when i see things that people are posting they can be quiet here in church they can be fine here in church and they're always posting stuff whether it's on facebook whether it's on whatsapp and you read even the words and the terminology they are using those terminology are found in a hip-hop star in the stars of the world and the christians are putting them on facebook on whatsapp keep posting things sometimes you wonder what is the purpose of what you're posting what is the message that you're posting what are you reflecting by your posting can somebody look at your posting and detect your faith amen then on sunday we are christian then when we preach here you see people rising up going into the bathroom sometime i preach i finish preaching i go into the lobby i see young people sitting there why are you not in church we preaching you are staying there laughing playing iran speaking to your spouse speaking to your sister speaking to your brother while the holy spirit is ministering and tomorrow you going somewhere and you live any kind of way they can send me a video they say look at how they're dancing we sing here we dance here you don't dance you're quiet you're so holy you are fine you go to a wedding and the way you dance is it is unbelievable when somebody look at you do they wonder is this a woman or a sister that danced before in the night club or what and it's recorded and we go more on our stupidity and put that on facebook and put that on whatsapp for people to see the craziness of our lives you eat you post it who cares about what you're posting who cares about what you're eating who cares about which restaurant you want to eat who cares about which boat you want to rent to show your good life who cares about it what is going on now [Music] amen in consecration brother david if we get the chance i know some of them majority a lot of people are not here some even do extreme they're not going to look at them we're going to send their mustaches to tell the people go back and listen to this message before sunday so when we preach sunday you know where this brother was coming from that it was not this brother it was the holy spirit if you have not caught what is going on in this church you're going to be left behind this is not just a gathering of the people even though we love to gather with one another this is a preparation for the rapture what else do you expect in this world the weather is not on our side what do you want to have everything here will be burned this hot air will be burned our houses will be burned our clothing will be burned everything will be burned by the fire of god what do you expect from this world what can you take on the other side just once more lord they're giving you an opportunity check your life the bible says examine yourself whether you are in the faith if you pray in church if you have pants that you get here you on uh on a long skirt or on a long dress and home you dressing with pants the holy spirit spoke to you if when you go to work you wearing pants over there and when you come on sunday you turn around you put a different costume the holy spirit is talking to you how are you talking among your peers in school what kind of language are you using what kind of words are you using what kind of work how do people know your work do they know you as a joker or as a christian do they know you as a serious man or as a vulgar man let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love and your mercy father because he only take mercy to bring a message such as this one lord father you the one that stopped me on sunday where i had to stop not to explain [Music] [Applause] until the holy spirit does a house cleaning father tonight you came sweeping your house sweeping your temples calling for a higher call to a life of sanctification a preparation lord for the feeling with the holy spirit father may your children be so spiritual to catch it to understand the working and the moving of the holy spirit that it's not about our pastor it is not about brother stephen it is not about brother tim cross but it's the holy spirit ministering to my life and trying to get me into a place when i am ready to meet my brother groom lord father shake the word the pride of life the lust of the flesh the last of the eyes father you spoke to those three major lord father category to this church and our brother came again and emphasized on the same line lord because you wanted to save somebody you want it to change somebody's life you want to bring your power of transformation into the life of the people make those that feel led to fast may they fast them does that feel like to be consecrated may they consecrate their life
