e e this message God doesn't call him into to judgment without first warning him by Brother William Marian branam was was delivered Wednesday evening July 24th 1963 at the Branham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville Indiana USA Bram the Jeffersonville Indiana the North America now my uh sight falls upon a texture of Isaiah Isaiah 38 let's read over to Isaiah Isaiah 38 in those days was Hezekiah sick unto death and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amos came unto him and said unto him thus sayeth the Lord set thine house in order for Thou shalt die and not live then Hezekiah turned his face towards the wall and prayed unto the Lord and said Remember Me Oh Lord I beseech Thee I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and e ezekiah wept sore then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah saying go and say to Hezekiah thus sayeth the Lord the god of David thy father I've heard thy prayer I have seen thy tears behold I will add unto thy days 15 years may the Lord add His blessings to this reading it's a very um outstanding uh subject for a short message here I believe I want to call it God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning and we are we we C the the background or the platform of it here and this text tonight God warning man before bringing him to uh his death now everyone has this we might say well this fell died without a warning no no no God never you don't know what was in that man's heart you don't know what's been going on in his life see God never brings any man to his death without first warning him about it telling him it's something a preparation God is is Sovereign and he he knocks at the heart of every man giving him the opportunity to come now he might War it away and turn it down and and shake his head to it and walk away so it's just a funny feeling I'll get over it but anyhow it was God God speaking to him amen and God never even brings judgment upon the Earth without first giving the people a warning God never does nothing without declaring it first what he's going to do and he gives people a choice and you can you can do right or wrong that's his see God can never change his nature his program can never change from what he started with because he's infinite in his program and his ideas are all perfect so if he would change it that would show that he'd learn more so being infinite he cannot learn more his his first his first decision is always perfect and there nothing can ever change it God before man ever was put had a chance to do wrong God put him on the basis to where he could accept or deny he could receive or not say by the way if that minister in here brother Baker uh I believe was on the the interviews the other day I've got his questions that he had wrote out for me on the serpent seed I got him laying back here now if he's sure well well I don't see him anywhere right the present time but and Sh he and his wife a very fine man and and a woman but they they couldn't understand a few things about the teaching of the Serpent's Seed how that that some questions about what I said in in sermons beyond that and and talking about the the pregnation and so forth but I um then it's just like a a brother fine man just a Christian for a couple years or two but just didn't understand you see it's hard if you don't you have to depend on the holy spirit because this Bible is wrote and riddles you just can't sit down and read like a newspaper it's head yes how would you ever justify God when he told Moses uh up there said now don't you make any engraving images in his Commandments don't you make anything like heaven any any angel or anything else don't make any engraving images And yet on the same day he told him to mold two angels out of brass and put them right at the mercy seat where Mercy's at you have to know God in his nature before you can understand his word he he he has the key to that word himself amen and he he's the only one can can handle it open it and so he's the one has to reveal it and now we find out that is naturewise here that always to warn a man uh before judgment to warn a nation before judgment and so forth he always gives his warning a reminder to we of a responsibility we are responsible amen and God has put us her on the earth for a reason and that reason that he is Punisher for we are responsible to him for that reason you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do if you don't if you went to work for a man he give you a job on a ranch or something other and you just went out to the barn and just sat down out there and say well see you must go ask him what he wants you to do and then do it if you're working for a man find out what your duties is and then if our life is on the the Earth here then we should go to the one who punish her and Lord what would you have me do what what what must I do why am I here if it's to be a housewife dishwasher if it's to be whatever God wants you to do then you do that the very best that you know how to do it no matter how little no matter how little it is you must do it you say well the trouble of it is each one of us wants to do the next man's job we all want to pack the ball as we say you see like this watch here now every little movement in there has its place now every part of it can't be the hands now I only look at the hand to see what time it is but if one of them little wheels in there gets out of order that won't keep the right time that's the way it is with people we've all the body of Christ has got to be in their position and Harmony see and then we can look around and see what time of day it is see then the world's looking to see what it is see but they're watching you and if you're just a little hairspring main spring or whatever you are you do the very best job you can at that now because we have a responsibility that we've got to answer to God someday for every man that come on the face the Earth has to answer to God for our responsibility and to many of us a stewardship we have to answer for we this responsibility is a stewardship that's been committed to us by God I don't care what it is as I said a few must go a housewife then be a genuine housewife that's right if it's to be a farmer be a genuine farmer whatever it is that God has put you to do you got a stship to that you've got to answer to God for because it takes all these things to do it Hezekiah was told to make ready and to get ready because that he had to meet his maker ezekiah was a king and a great man you notice this plea here Lord I beseech you to consider me I I've walked before you with a perfect heart what a testimony that is to to us today it should be a man that walks before God even death was pronounced upon upon the man and yet God changed his mind about him amen because Hezekiah wanted to do something and God said he would give us the desires of our heart's time had come and he got a cancer on him or something other they call it a bar in that day but we know bars don't regularly kill you they just get well but it's perhaps a Cancer and it opened up like a bar and and God told Isaiah said go up there and tell him that he's going to die and hez had something he wanted to do yet yet yet when you plead anything to God you got to be a reason for it it's just like this scripture that is so often refer to if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe that what You' said will come to pass you can have what you said now that's all together controlled on motive and objective or it won't happen so you just can't go out here that's where many of us makes many mistakes is going on say now I'll show you I got faith to do this now you're wrong to begin with God don't give you gifts just to play with it as I was saying a while ago they don't show you Visions just to play with that's nothing to play with that's sacred just use it in as the Lord will let you be a prisoner to him no matter how much you want to tell that guy is wrong and what this that or the other you hold still to God says so then when God says so then you can come with thus say the Lord and tell that just forget about the the world today just like Hezekiah was then it's been warned it's constantly being warned the church is being warned and now these things just don't happen by uh by chance they've all got something behind them now Hezekiah being sick having this bar that wasn't by chance God sent Isaiah up there and told him to set his house in order now because he's going to die Hezekiah wept and told God I walk before the perfect heart and I I pray you spare my life for a cause a good cause a cause of God God told the prophet said go back and tell him Now isn't that strange Hezekiah was the greatest man in the land Hezekiah was a king and a godly man he was a real man if he could plead that before God and God didn't rebuke F I've walk before you with a perfect heart now that's a saying a whole lot and God never said no Hezekiah you didn't do it but he admitted he did do it and he said I'm going to I'm going to spare your life a little longer see I'm going to give you a request see because he had been a just man he had been a a real servant to Christ Lord and then we feel that we have a right to ask something if if our objective is right and then our motive to it now we see today that for the past many years I'd say for the past 15 to more years that constantly there's been a warning out Across the Nation amen repent our Parish you notice I was talking today to the wife just early this morning and I early at breakfast we were sitting at table talking before I left I said wife uh she's was talking about Billy Graham and about his wife just how common and everything they tried to live I said that is a real servant when he Tri not when a man maybe makes two or three million a year out in his campaigns but he doesn't receive it his foundation takes it placing it back into the work and the broadcast and so forth and Billy gets about 25,000 she said how would he ever spend 25,000 year I said he he takes just what he has to have that's all all he's got a home to pay for and everything and went on I said I've got lots of respects for Billy Graham I said because he has a message and that message is repentance and I I tell you there's nobody that I know of in the lands today that God has used for that message like Billy Graham oh he's got a down pat he just stands there and I mean he calls them politicians and church members to repentance but that's as far as he goes Billy and here comes brother or Roberts another great servant of the Lord and there's nobody comes out there and compare with or Roberts Roberts Roberts that Bulldog grip of if uh just casting out evil spirits and calling the name of of the Lord and and little Sensations and so forth that uh about Divine Healing that's exactly right there is a messenger to the Pentecost there is a messenger to the church denominational world see and the co world then look around at our own little humble Ministry standing Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you see what's that doing calling that bride group you see Hallelujah it it calls from both those groups it's taking a wheel out of the wheel see what I mean Hallelujah and then God confirms that message that Billy Graham preaches God heals the Sick by or robers prayers and God produces the things that Jesus proved that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday forever and it's calling those sa it's messages of the hour Billy GRS and each one of those messages is calling repent our perish amen amen that's right repent or perish there's no hopes it's all gone worlds warned of his coming each one of the messages speaks and warns of the coming of the Lord Jesus both through the chur Church remember God's always in threes like Father Son and Holy Ghost and justification B and sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost so forth these now God is that message of repentance to the church nominal God's in that message of Divine Healing to the church Pentecostal God's in the message to the bride so we find out that all of them calling one to this this to that and that to that God calling the church out of the world the calling the church in the denominal church into Pentecost and calling the bride out of P like Luther Wesley and now see it just all perfectly typed up and there's no mistake about it I've hit all around the ends of it and sides of it inside and outside of it and showed it by the scripture and the chronology of it till we know that it's absolutely the truth Wesley there's no mistake Sunday I hope that God sinks it so deep that you'll never be able to get away from it now God giving warning prepare for a judgment the atomic bombs are in the hangers everything's setting ready and God before he can let this thing happen he makes a call down through like he did in Sodom come out of it get ready there's something going to happen like in the days of Noah before God sent the waters to destroy the world in the great Andel luian world that had come off into sin as Jesus clearly said that it was a day just like this as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man how that uh the women on the Rampage and and marrying and giving and marriage marage and and the great scientific achievements and the smart educated going into the intellectual sides and the little humble flock sitting off to one side waiting the pending judgment and the Escape and before God sent that judgment he sent a prophet just like he did to Hezekiah said get ready for the judgments are ready to fall and and he made the people ready for the time Noah made the people ready and it was a call of Mercy before [Music] judgment was made to know before their time God looked down to Nineveh and he said I'm I'm just tired of these things I I understand that that great Heathen Gentile World their city as it was in them days they judg him by City not by Nations now at the population has spread the way it has he said that great city is give over all together to sin and God before he would send judgment he sent a warning message come out of it get right watch the prophet never set up but but to get said within 40 days this city will be destroyed D and oh how sometime it's hard to do such things as that to tell people if the prophet don't watch he'll get in trouble because he'll kind of go off to one side trying to make it easier compromise a little bit you're a little bit there but the real prophets got the order from God should never compromise nothing he should absolutely lay it right on the line that's the reason he use the spirit of Elijah so much see because that spirit always carried out his arm ERS you see it brought his AR just exactly what it was and always a come back to the word always a bring him back to the word now it's find Nineveh in sin and the prophet was hant because it was a gentile world see it's a gentile Nation gentile people not his own it wasn't Hebrews they were Gentiles the Great uh ship commercial sea port at Nineveh was great fishing industrial there the people fished and and they they had must have had a great sinful country there plenty of money and and more money is planful and people are in a popular opinion of the day sin always sets in and violence was tired of it so he had a prophet in the land so he said to his Prophet go down there to Nineveh and cry out and say within 40 days the city is going to be destroyed now Jonah thought now you know I might get in a little trouble so he wanted to be more sure so he thought he take a little vacation and and go down to tarus and we found out that the there's just 40 days left see so the message is urgent the time is at hand don't play around with other things and get a Bachelor of art degree and find out something the hour is at hand what's a matter people today we're trying to uh build up big schools and have big things like that when mercy why if we preach a coming of the Lord what do we need with schools we need repentance towards God like Hudson Taylor said to the young missionary he said a young Chinese boy come to him and said Mr Taylor said the Lord Jesus has filled me with his spirit said I I'm so happy said shall I take 10 years now and get my degrees and so forth he said Son don't wait for degrees if the candle's lit Go Tell It Go Tell it don't wait for degrees no you'll be half burned out before you get on with your degrees let's when it's lit if you don't know nothing else just tell how live just don't try to take somebody else's place or something place when you know just tell what you know to be the truth This Is Where It come on me and this is how I feel about it that's you don't know no more than that say that let's go the message is urgent the time is at hand what if Isaiah say well now I'll wait and see how it gets along with that b first you see see I I see God told him go up there and tell him right now and he told Jonah to go oh my and when he got out there and that ocean and that deep sea and and the ship got stalled in a storm and that harshed up the sails and turned around around they wonder what the world was the matter out there but they couldn't make out look like the thing getting water loged and every man calling on his God and first thing you know Jonah was on his vacation so you thought he might as well sleep he must have went out the booke of the ship and laying up there his feet propped up asleep and he said awake oh Slugger and call upon your God and Jonah knew what was wrong so does every man know what's wrong today and he said it's all my fault take me and bind my hands and throw me out in the sea and then this trouble will let up and they were kind of gentl like bunch of fellas and they didn't want to do that but they found out he was a prophet know what he was talking about he said I thought I'd take my vacation first but but the Lord don't want me to take this vacation I got to get down there I got a job to do I thought I'd rested up a little bit before I went but I got to go the the message is urgent I got to get there I'd imagine when that certain prepared fish uh got Jonah down in his stomach he done a about face and throwed water all over the country and Tuck out for n of his hard as he could go God was taking that message over there that certain prepared fish and he took out for Nineveh just as hard as he could go because he he had the messenger board and he had to get him over there he took the wrong ship but God provided a ship for him so you know God's able to do great things if we just listen see he he'll make he'll make ways where there is no way he is the way see and when the message is absolutely urgent as it is today God provides a way we notice again when Amos I preached on this fellow Amos if you'd like to read the story sometime it's great read the story of Amos first chapter of Amos he's another type of the the warnings before judgment strikes [Music] sin now um the city that he was uh going to warn against over there was a bunch of Jews and that he all got kind of off of the beaten line and become a great tourist center and and I imagine as I give the illustration that morning speaking on him that when he bald head come up over the top of the hill and his little eyes narrowed as he looked down seen the sin of that great nation and people uh his white beard as he fingered it like that W what a thing but nobody knows where he come from nobody knows those prophets they just Rise Up from somewhere and go the same way but he went went into the city with thus sayith the Lord repent or perish for God will destroy this nation he'll he'll wipe this place off of the Earth you've made an agreement with your enemy and you're you're at peace you think with your enemy but all the time the Assyrians are are building up out there you can't walk to together unless you be agreed that's all so he God wants us to separate ourselves he wants us come out from the world not try to live with the world and God too not try to Fashion After the world after God you have to live for one or the other you have to believe one or the other now we find out that this Amos he certainly predicted a judgment upon this people except they repented and and M so so well does it fit our I think this great city as looking back to this again the great City down there high that is all give over and and a great uh economy they had of everything prosperous and they thought they were just exactly in the will of the Lord because they were prospering but they found out that God is not always the author of prosperity am no God sometimes when Prosperity strikes the church usually gets away from him you know God spoke of Israel one time said I found you blood in the field washed you up and brought you in to be his own child and then when he got big and a beautiful young woman you played the part of a he said you you just give yourself to every passer by for see but when you were poor and needy when when you had need you serve me but when I bless you and give you plenty then you went away from me and it's just about prove that oh my now we find out that this Prophet really struck down on that Nation this Amos just a plow boy but we find out that when he did struck down and told him what it would be and told him that they didn't get right with God that the enemy that they had taken in Partnership would be the very one that destroyed him oh now we find out that our proud America is not going to escape the wrath of God I spoke one day since I've been here I'm sure it was here uh of the everything at the end you know I I can't see nothing to build to you can't build a politics it's gone you you can't build uh to uh social life because it's so demoralized there's there there's nothing that you can build to there and uh you can't put no hopes or nothing how about the church well you can't do nothing with the church it's so farm and gone there's nothing left they've done sold out their birth rights for a mess of pottage and and they're just waiting judgment the Holy Spirit has cross this nation showing his signs and wonders they continually spurn his grace vindicates himself and proves by his great Vindication that he's a word of God God manifested in this day and they still turn it down there's nothing left now you just can't always do that to God see all right we find out the first he sends his prophets with warning he doesn't change his way his method of doing things he does not always strike when he warns I want you to watch this quotation God gives a warning but he don't always strike the same time he warns did you notice that amen and then when he doesn't strike when he sends a warning then the prophet is mocked you didn't have it you told a lie you you wasn't right this same thing might have been said to Isaiah what do you think that man thought when he went up there and prophesied the King was going to die then come back down said no he's going to live come we that love the Lord and let our Jo be known joining the song with sweet Accord join the song with sweet and the The Throne oh just sing in the spirit the thr oh Mar to that
