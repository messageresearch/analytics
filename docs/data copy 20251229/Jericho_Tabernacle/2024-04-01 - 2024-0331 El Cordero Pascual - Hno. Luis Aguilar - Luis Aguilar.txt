rodri brother ector Rodriguez in the petition of your need you're in the right place in a special place for the power of the spoken word it's manifested we place our hands over your body and that

my hands because the word says that place your hands over the sick and the sick shall be healed and whichever person is hearing right now and they have pain or they have pain somewhere or just an Impulse or whatever they may be wrong with their body may you place your hand wherever the pain is at and believe it we place our hands over the sick and the sick shall heal in the name of Lord Jesus

Fridays glorify the name of the Lord to give him the worship and the praise show him all honor and Glory and why because he deserves it he is the only one who deserves praise there there's so many other gods out there that Proclaim that they're the one but there's only one true God and he loved you so much he sent his only begotten son to to save you to give you your healing to give you your deliverance to give you everything you have need of because God know you knew that you couldn't do it on your own that's why we celebrate today we celebrate our Lord Jesus Christ we celebrate that brutal sacrifice he did for us because that should have been me that should have been me up there because I'm the guilty one I'm the one full of sin but God chose His only begotten son the the the the only lamb that was so innocent he knew no sin he knew no sin he didn't know what sin was but he took it all on himself because he loved you can you say Amen to that because he loved you so much WoW Saints I don't know why but when when when I hear that and I have that reassurance in my heart I can't help but myself but say praise the Lord Glory To Your Name Lord because you saved me I love you

single purpose just to worship the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we're just a bit nervous because of the occasion it's a very important occasion and it's because of Easter amen and if you wouldn't mind opening up your scriptures with me to the Book of Exodus chapter 12 and verse 26 [Music] amen we also want to thank our pastor for giving us confidence to be able to speak his word be a reading out of Exodus 12:26 and it shall come to pass when you children shall say unto you uh what mean ye by this service that you shall say it is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover who passed over the house of the children of Israel in Egypt when he smoked the Egyptians and delivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshiped before we sit down let's B bow our heads our heavenly father Lord we're here in this morning in this Easter [Music] morning a very important day the day that you Rose amongst the dead and now we find an empty tomb and now we find ourselves in this place worshiping your holy name and now we ask that you come into the hearts of each and every one of us in attempts to rededicate our lives unto you and that this this day may be a brand new day for us encourage those that need encouragement heal the sick and deliver the captive and Lord we take hold of every Spirit that's contrary to your word in this morning Lord by the power of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen before you sit down why don't you greet your neighbor give him a smile tell him God bless you you brother amen amen want to thank musicians and the song leaders you may be seated happy Easter amen amen happy Easter and this morning we just want to talk about a simple message and we want to entitle it the Easter lamb redemp Resurrection with the subtitles of redemption communion and Resurrection and this morning for many or probably some of you who don't know what the Passover is and this morning we wish to kind of elaborate a little bit on that I think by this level or this time we know that this has nothing to do with the bunnies but if you wish to crucify me then go right on but the children are not to blame amen but we want to go back to the main story of where this Passover and we know that in Genesis where the Lord sacrificed a lamb he was actually the first one who slain the lamb and gave clothing under Adam and Eve and then we find ourselves in the book of Exodus where the people of Israel are now in captivity and the descendants of Abraham find themselves now under slavery they have now become slaves the children of God were had become slaves in Egypt and then God sent a deliverer by the name of Moses Moses rose up and it's a very beautiful story and brother benam says that that's one of his favorite stories and then we see when he arrived in Egypt we see that Jehovah told Mo Moses you shall be like and Aaron shall be your prophet and so then we find out that Moses was like God and since Moses was a little bit slow to speak and it looked like Aaron had the ease of being able to speak so then God told Moses you tell Aaron what he must say he shall be uh your prophet and so then Moses and Aaron find themselves before pharaoh and then he we see that he directly tells Pharaoh it was two men with a rod they came face to face with the most powerful nation in the world and he said let the people of God go let my people go and Pharaoh just laughed and he tells him who do you think you are to tell me what to do and he replies god Jehovah has said because he had remembered of the promise that he made unto the children of Israel and then we see that Pharaoh's heart had hardened and that's where we're going to begin on the Passover Passover in English it's called Passover and it interprets itself as it passing over us it is a day of Celebration a day of remembrance because on that day the Lord took the people out of is or took the people of Israel with an with a strong hand from the house of slavery in Egypt because God wants the people to remember that God took them out of slavery is the reason why we have the Passover and the Lord told the people in Exodus 2:2 and this month shall be the first of the month this shall be unto you the first months of the year Nissan or there you can see that it kind of says like Nissan or abib or or in other words in March or May and these days and this month shall be the beginning of the months in uh March or uh April because on this month the Lord has taken us out of Egypt and then in this month there's a a feast of the Lord one of them is the Passover and the other one is the unleavened bread and the third is the uh tithings uh the first fruits the first fruits Sor the first fruits of the barley and in that month of Nissan in other words in March April and so on the 14th day of this month is Easter which means Redemption and then on the 15th day are the unleavened bread and that will continue on unto seven days and that means to live a holy life after you have lived a life of redemption and that's where you eat the bread between the seven days and then on the 16th day are the Feast of uh the first fruits the uh Harvest of The Barley is a type of the resurrection and we know that Jesus Christ is returning and then the Saints and then we're going to go into a little bit more detail into that but then when Moses came face to face with Pharaoh there were 10 plagues that hit Israel the first one was the water turning into blood the second one was the frogs and the third was the lice uh the fourth one was the Flies and then the fifth one was a pestilence on the livestock and the sixth one was the boils upon men and livestock H the seventh was the thunderstorm of hail and fire number eight was the Locust and the ninth was the three days of darkness upon Egypt and then the very last plague that hit Egypt was the death of the firstborn son that's where God told Moses to prepare all of Israel because in this night death is going to hit Egypt but it will not hit Israel but there will be a statute there will be a word that which we must follow to protect the children of Israel and then in this day we have the same thing it's the word of God we must fulfill it up to the dot if the children of Israel did not fulfill the whole thing it was a physical death there was literally going to be death within their we're not talking about a book of lies this book literally happened there was a death that hit struck the people and so then if you read the full chapter 12 of Exodus Moses begins to tell the people of Israel what they must do it says the 10th day of the month of Nissan abib which is March April you must take a lamp without uh any blemish there must not be any blemish on this lamb and you must uh hold that lamb for 4 days and so then that will be the 14th day and then on the 14th day you shall slain the lamb before the congregation of Israel and in Spanish it says in between the two evenings in the English version it does not say the two evenings but in Spanish it does and everything must be consumed you must consume the whole lamb and if it's not possible for you to do so you must burn what's ever left and no bone must be broken on that lamp must be complete and now notice this is the law that God told Moses if one word is out of place there will be death amongst the people and then the blood must be on the both posts and on the lentil of the door because the death angel will be passing through the homes amen amen and then on the 14th day uh we're going to repeat it once again on the 10th day you shall take the land without a blemish you shall keep the lamb for four days and then on the 15th day you shall eat unleavened bread and then on the 16th day are the Feast of the first fruits now that was just a shadow of the land that was to come it was just a foreshadow over there with Abel it was a foreshadowing of what was to come and then the the lamb over here in Exodus was a foreshadowing of the perfect land that was to come on this day and that lamb was the Lord Jesus Christ when that lamb arrived that lamb was so simple it was so humble that the people didn't recognize who he was they thought that he was just another ordinary Prophet but then when John the Baptist saw that the Lord had arrived him being a prophet Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world the prophet recognized the word because the lamb came with the purpose but before that purpose was was to be fulfilled that lamb first had to be washed that's the reason why he came to Jordan River he went straight to uh John the Baptist and John the Baptist being the prophet recognized that he was the Lamb of God and he said why do you come to me for for me to baptize you but I'm in need of you to baptize me but all the scriptures must be fulfilled and even the Lord Jesus Christ he who had no sin he also had to be baptized the lamb had to be cleansed and then after he was baptized the Dove came down which was the type of the Holy Spirit now in First Peter for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversations received received by tradition from your fathers what what does the scripture say there that you were not redeemed because somebody paid a check for you with silver or gold or with a a a check because our bank accounts was too much our debt was too high no sufficient amount of gold or silver to be able to pay our de but we were purchased with the precious blood of Jesus Christ just like uh verse 19 says but with the Precious Blood of lamb as of lamb without a blemish and without spot remember the laws that God gave to Moses that lamb must be without a blemish and so then we were never purchased with silver or gold but we were purchased with the precious blood of Jesus Christ and then when they took the Lord Jesus Christ they didn't take him because he committed adultery not because he broke the law not because he lied they wanted to crucify him because he had healed somebody on the Sabbath because he wanted to help someone on the Sabbath and the Lord told onto the Pharisees if there's a lamb out stuck in the Haywire uh or stuck on the ditch is because it's Sabbath you're not going to go and pluck them out I'm going to wait until tomorrow no let's go take him out that's the reason why they wanted to crucify him not because he had committed a sin but because he took our sins and then in Exodus 126 and remember that the lamb was to be held until the 14th day and the Lord was kept held captive there for four days brother Brandon says that our Lord was there uh before the critics for four days and nights a perfect type of what had happened in Exodus to hold or keep keep that lamb for 4 days uh and then in Exodus 126 it said that they were going to kill it between the two evenings and then in numbers 284 uh the one lamb Thou shalt offer in the morning and the other lamb shalt thou offer at eve even there's the two evenings so then in Matthew 271 when the morning was come it's morning time all the chief priests and Elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death they took him in the morning and then on the second verse it says when they had bound him they had him like a lamb they had bound him in the morning every scripture must be fulfilled that's the morning and then in Matthew 27:45 now from the sixth hour there was Darkness over all the land until the ninth hour now at that moment that's when the Lord had passed away at the n9th hour which typifies roughly between about uh 3 in the afternoon they took the Lord Jesus Christ as a type of the Lamb they took him in the morning and they bound him like a lamb and then he uh passed way in the afternoon fulfilling the scriptures and now the blam had to be without a blemish or a spot and then when Jesus was there chained up and pilate went to go speak with Jesus and he began to speak with him and then he came back and presented himself before all the congregation of Israel and pilate told all the Jews I find no fault in this man I find no fault in this man but the people of Israel still wanted to uh crucify him and they shouted let the blood of this man be upon us and our children but pilate wanted to wash his hands it's something very tremendous and then on John 19 uh 31 31 that's when Jesus had died at the cross uh the scripture says that that was the preparation of the uh Passover and nobody was to be uh hung on the cross or to stay there all night you can find that on Deuteronomy 21 and22 that all the bodies that were crucified must come down and it was a perfect type of the Lamb that nothing must stay up there everything must be consumed and if it can't it must be burned and the Lamb of uh God should not be uh remained up in the in the cross every scripture must be fulfilled and then when they were at that point to take him down the soldiers told uh pilate let's break his bones of the men that are hanging they broke the bones of the first one and then of the second but then when they arrived un Jesus since they had already seen him dead they did not break his legs it was a perfect type of the Lamb just like it says in Exodus 12:46 that no bone must be broken all the scriptures must be fulfilled now this happened back in Egypt because a literal physical death was to come and the blood of that lamb was going to protect that home it was going to protect that firstborn son and all those scriptures had to be fulfilled to the DOT if there was a father had missed just a single word there was going to be death all the word must be fulfilled must be without any defect must be kept for four days must be eaten and if you can it must be burnt the bones must not be broken everything had to be fulfilled and then in this day we have received our lamb which is the Lord Jesus Christ and then in Hebrews 10 18 there is there no more offering for sin because annually the children of Israel had to fulfill these Feasts as a type of remembrance so that they would remember of what God did for their fathers because they did not see what had happened in Egypt their grandchildren didn't see Moses their great grandchildren didn't see all those Locust but it was just for a remembrance so that they would remember be able to tell the story that in this day that this month that the Lord took us out with a mighty hand from the house of slavery of Egypt he took your grandfather out he said you weren't there my son you weren't there but he took my father out I was just the child when that and when that grandchild he's going to tell his children what had happened in that day and that's why we read the scripture when your children shall ask what is this ritual why do we come to church on the Easter and you shall tell your children on this day on this month the Lord Jesus Christ the Lamb of God died for our sins I wasn't there when he died for us but time passed and here we are today fulfilling those feasts and that's what we're doing this morning and when the Lord was there on Earth death and the devil weren't completely convinced that he was truly the Son of God why is that because the Lord Jesus Christ was so humble he was just like any regular human and the devil questioned himself is he really the one that was propes because the devil knows the Bible he knew that the Virgin shall conceive but then there was a rumor that was that there was a virgin that conceived and he said that this one doesn't really look like it because if truly he was him why doesn't he look like a king he doesn't look like a king he looks like any regular old a regular person he appeared as a lamb blessed be the name of the Lord that's why when a wolf comes and the Wolf is seeing where the pastor is at because he wants to eat the Lambs looks like a lamb speaks like a lamb and when the wolf comes he has no idea who the pastor is and that's the same thing with he was so humble that the devil didn't even know who he was so then the devil came to tempt him if you're truly the Son of God if you are turn these stones into bread Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God because not only by Bread lives but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and so then the devil took him up to the highest peak of the city and he said if you surrender unto me all these nations all this land shall be yours and he said get thee behind because he knows the scripture he said that no uh the would he would send his angels that his son shall not trle one of one of his toes one of his toes and he said no even the Lord was tempted with all the riches but then when the crucifixion arrived we see when that evening came he began to pray and he he began to say Lord your will may this cup pass over me but nonetheless let it not be my will but Let It Be Your Will because even though that the Lord was God he was in human flesh he felt the fear he didn't want to die that's the reason why he said Lord if it's your will may this cup pass over me but nonetheless let it not be my will but let thy will be done that's why uh the Lord was watching theil was watching the devil was watching the Lord pray and he said this man has fear this man has fear of dying this is not God because if he was God he would not fear it but he had no idea that it was God incarnated in human flesh God had a secret plan that the devil didn't even know the plan of God and when they took the lamb to the slaughter they began to to beat him they they uh St they spat and he said this is not God this is just another Prophet this is just another regular man and when he was on the cross and when he passed away death began to come near death became and death is something really strong to because death did have its power because when it was the time of Abraham death came and and jailed him when job Came Death took him when Daniel and Ezekiel and all the prophets came before death took all of the prophets away but then when the Lord came and death came put the Stinger into the Lord the Lord took it and he said death I shall be your death and then by that time death it was already too late because death had already uh gave out his thing and death said this man is not only just a Prophet this man is the pro is the Son of God I had I mistaken this is the child of God and so then now death has no more power and so then when he did die he went to hell and he began to knock on the door of the devil and he said that's the prophet that I've been waiting for and he said Satan I'm here give me the keys of hell and death he said you're the Son of God he said I am the son of God and then on that day the Lord Jesus Christ broke the backbone of Satan and he resurrected with the saints that were in paradise and now death has no more power the only thing that death does is to take you to your creator it's the only Power death has no more power to the Christian who has accepted this lamb and then after this lamb has been accepted and everything has been consumed then the unleavened bread come which is a type of the communion to live a holy and clean life separated after receiving the Lamb of God because it's not just to receive him and then go out and live any lifestyle that you wish I'm going to tell you once again it's not just accepting the Lord Jesus Christ and then start to live the life that I want to live no there's a certain style of life that must fruits are required and there's a certain lifestyle that must be brought forth after you've accepted it in First Corinthians 5:7 it says like this perched out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrific for us because our Passover is Christ which was sacrificed for us our Lord Jesus Christ is our Passover we no longer have to take a lamb like they did back in the old days because the Lord Jesus Christ did that for us already the Lord Jesus Christ is our Passover and so therefore we uh celebrate the Feast not with old leaven Nei neither with leaven of malice and wickedness but with unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth amen amen those breads or the that life that we must live must be sincere and it must be of Truth and if and if it's not that way then we have a leaven life we must live a life worthy of the Gospel of sincerity and truth and then in Exodus 12:19 seven days shall there be no leaven found in your house in your houses what is it that we speak about in our houses what is it that we do in our houses there must be sincerity there must be truth in our homes blessed be the name of the Lord every word must be fulfilled this Feast must be brought up to the dot that we must be living this life to every word and if we take just a single word out it's death the scripture says that there must be no leav found in your houses and what is it that we do in our own homes what is it that you speak speak about in your own homes what do you say in your homes is there leaven is there sincerity and TR because in this day of Passover must be unle must be cleaned it's not just the Holy Week but every week every week every single day not just because it's the Passover week I'm going to behave well forgive me for what I'm about to do I'm going to sanctify myself just like the the Catholic say no it's every single week in our homes the bread typifies Christ the word and then those seven days of eating that bread typifies the seven Church ages and and it says that it shall be with no leav don't add on to the word and don't take away from the word in our homes what is it that you say in your house do you add or take away once you start speaking about the word in your home you have to eat this bread in your home and in this month we celebrate the Redemption uh bread without leavon and uh the first fruits we have accepted that Lamb of God this bread of God without Le we're not going to take away or add to it we want to fulfill the scriptures because that bread has no taste that bread does not have any kind of sugar It's s such a simple bread for those that have taken the communion you know what I'm talking about it's there's no there's no salt to it it's just a simple bread because the lamb the Lord Jesus Christ is very simple he has no sugar he has no salt he's just a simple bread and since bread is sometimes very simple we want to dip it into the coffee so that we can give it a little bit of taste but the word must be eaten just the way it is is bread without leav and if the children of Israel had failed just one word it was death are you following me we're on our route to some place don't get lost now it's a divine order Redemption Passover the lamb to eat the bread un leaven to uh live a a life uh holy after leaving here that we continue to be Christians uh when it comes to be Tuesday and we continue to be a Christian until the next month we continue to be a Christian how many can say Amen unto that until the month of July let's continue being Christians when the month of August comes let's continue to be a Christian when the September month comes oh right there we can just take a break no let's live a holy life even after eating this lamb and then the third thing comes which is the Harvest of The Barley the first fruits remember that happens between the month of April and May and we believe in a resurrection and we're waiting for a resurrection and to be part of that Resurrection we must first accept the Lord Jesus Christ take that lamb and live this word and also mature along with this word because the lamb the prophet came to the word and we're waiting for that Resurrection in the old scripture times biblical no me she found herself with Boaz in the Harvest of the barley and brother B says that she arrived at the perfect time she found herself with her Redeemer with Boaz in the time of the Harvest Ruth and Boaz was the Redeemer of Ruth Ruth and Boaz got married with Ruth in the time of the Harvest of the barley and that's what we're waiting for in this day that Our Redeemer returns once again that we will marry with him but in this day the bride is getting married with the word she's accepting the word because we're waiting for that Harvest Time and in that Harvest Time that grain has already matured and it's ready to be plucked and the Harvest must be ready and we're talking about the individual and now when you see a wheat when you see a wheat that's just standing up straight it's not ready it's not enough because he's still with his head on high he has his chin up high because he's thinking that he knows everything but then when the wheat begins to mature it begins to bow down because he knows that he doesn't know everything he knows that he can't save himself a mature weat always bow his head and that's the reason why the Lord Jesus comes to pluck up the Harvest not to pick up those that are but those that are matured and have the Grain in them and we're waiting for the resurrection of the Dead when we see that the Lord Jesus Christ first rose that's scriptural that's biblical and then after him the Saints Rose now I don't know who was the one that rose right after Jesus I don't know who it was but brother brandham kind of always seems to say the same thing he said says that after Jesus rose Abraham rose up and then the rest and if you go searching for different quotes the Lord Jesus Christ Rose and then Abraham and I asked myself why was it that and it doesn't say that it's thus say the Lord say the Lord yeah don't take it don't take it as a doctrine that I'm trying to put forth that's just a quote that I'm sharing with you he says that Abraham rose right after Jesus H Willam Bram and in this day we have received William Mariam Branham H am the Lord Jesus Christ Rose and then Abraham now it doesn't say that he was the second one but that's how the prophet says it and we are also waiting for that Resurrection in the and I believe with all my heart just as the scripture says that the last shall be first and the last messenger of this age Bram his last name is uh Bram if you wish to accept it or reject it it's all up to you but we are waiting for that resurrection and with that resurrection of the Dead there will be a Rapture and to in order to be in that rapture we must be ready we have to accept the Lord Jesus Christ we must eat this word of the Lord and live a worthy life of the gospel and be ready for that day just as our Pastor said this morning this could be the first day of the Resurrection we don't know but the prophet said that it will be a secret it won't be a chaos people think that the Rapture will be a chaos it's going to be a secret and life will continue on people will continue to go to work and those who think that they're going to go into the Rapture they don't go let's stay humble let's stay prepared and let's accept this word because there's going to be many surprises on that day that's what the Bible and the messenger say that a life worthy of the Gospel is required and may the Lord have mercy on us because we're coming close to that day and perhaps today might be the beginning of those days they're going to knock on the door they're going to walk through the walls that's all biblical the Lord Jesus Christ after he rose he said do you have something to eat bring me a fish a cooked fish cook fish he didn't want a raw fish he wanted a cooked fish he ate a fish uh before he rose up and so let's wait for that day when those beloved return for those that we've been waiting and when that happens then the rapturing faith will come in that is going to come when our beloved loved ones and forgive me for what I'm about to say when our sister sees brother come can you make me those beans that I really love that coffee that I really enjoyed amen and then at that moment our sister o will no longer be an elderly she will be a young woman again I put her as an example because we have a lot of trust with one another now our sister we won't recognize her she will be a young lady again she will be young and that's what we're waiting for and the devil wants to take our vision away from but we're waiting for the resurrection of the dead and those that are ready will be there but it will be a secret not everybody was going to see it brother Johnny is going to rise up and brother Johnny really loved the hamburgers he didn't really like menudo he loved the hamburgers so then let's get ready and my question to you this morning is do you want to be there well you have to fight every inch just as the Apostle Paul said I have fought the good fight when he said the good fight that tells me that there is a bad battle there's an incorrect battle so then what are you fighting this morning I'm not trying to fight to stay as an associate pastor you can stay with that title here you can stay with the church here and you can stay with my house if you like to but I will not stay here if you want this Tabernacle you can stay with the Tabernacle if you want the title of an associate pastor then you can have it but I'm going with the Lord Jesus Christ so then what are you fighting for this morning are you fighting with your brother let's fight the good battle may the Lord help us may the Lord forgive us with that Holy Blood of the Lord because that lamb is already been slain he's already been slain and that Easter lamb is already at the cross our Easter I'm closing now in Exodus 12:7 and with the blood of the Lamb shall strike it on the two posts and on the upper post of the houses how many can you say Amen unto that okay I'm going to ask you a little bit later on if you're still going to say Amen but remember it was a commandment from God to Moses and from Moses to the people of what they must do and he said with that blood you shall take the hup it's just a common weed and you're going to dip it into blood you're going to put on side post of the house and on the upper door post of the house because on this night the angel of death is going to hit Egypt and on this day it won't be any physical death it will be a spiritual death I'm going to say it again it will not be a literal death it will be a phys uh spiritual deatha the housea in that house there is a door and on the door there's two side and a lentil and my question to you is the Lord came down and told me what are those two side posts and I said Lord It's the husband and the wife and the Lord said you're right and then I went to go search it out into the message and the prophet says the lentil that typifies a cross there's the door the two posts and lentil you're going to put blood on all three but not on the floor not on the ground because the blood must not be trampled on it must not be trampled and those two post mother and father blessed be the name of the Lord in order to have a strong Church it requires to have strong families I'm going to say it again in order to have a strong church we require families that are I'm going to say it again in order to have a strong Church it requires a families that are it requires that mother and father stay in the word and [Applause] brothers we are living in the end time there will be spiritual death if Mother and Father they must be covered in blood they must be submerged in blood it's a triangle it's a pyramid the husband and wife and the Lord Jesus Christ amen it's tremendous amen was it Moses's fault if a son died no it was a commandment from God to Moses and then the responsibility of Moses to say it his job was only to say it exactly the way that God said it if Moses failed at it and then that's between him and God but then now it was Moses unto the parents and the Bible says unto the priests who the priests the parents of the home no no no the the boss the bosses of the home the Father the father is The Shepherd of the home amen Moses told unto the priest of Israel Moses never told the wife to the motherinlaw to the but no he told it to the pastors of every home there's going to be death better grab the blood on the both posts and the lentil it must be submerged in Blood of mother and father they must be covered in the blood so is it the pastor's fault of the Prophet no we have the word and now the responsibility is in our hands there will be spiritual death that's why the prophet says it's not the ministry's fault if the young people don't want to come to church you parents must bring your young children you must bring your children to church bring them to Christ and it says apply the blood on the both posts I'm closing now if you wouldn't mind standing and the musicians come up and if the song leader can come up as well the prophet says like this but they stayed under the blood God said when you are under the blood stay there that's right and so then when they were there in the old times he said Moses put the blood on the post and don't come out don't come out not in and out in and out stay there and after a while it come midnight the Great Dark roaring Cloud come up I can look coming back there through yonder and I see two big black wings spread across the nation here it comes will you put that slide for me brother sister the first one it says uh here it comes I can hear the priest of the family the father who is the priest of the family the pastor of the family the Father the father is the pastor amen and so then it falls on the laot of the pastor of every family to fulfill these Scriptures it wasn't Moses it was the pastor it was the pastor of that home I can hear the father say there is the death angel sweeping the land now too late now and directly I can see him go dip down into the valley hear a scream come up from the house the son is dead he's gone directly here he comes and then again onto another house go in the big black wings close around the house a scream comes up the son is dead I can hear the little boy say notice this that even the children their own children say unto their fathers daddy take another look be sure the blood's on there and the the child was fearful because literally you can hear screams and the child was saying in that home my my my friend Miguel used to live there he's dead now we could hear his scream and then in this house we have and his father didn't apply the blood onto the PO I used to play with Him Father please make sure that there's blood on the post and brother BR would say that the son would grab onto the garments of the he say father make sure please because the son knew because father was going to die Mother wasn't going to die who was going to die was the first born it is not juvenquency it is the delinquency of the parents and the poor child and tears grabbing under the garments of the father father please make sure that we're ready you are my pastor please make sure because if you don't I will die not naturally spiritually amen and the prophet I tell you if ever was a time a man ought to be examining himself is right now is the blood on the door what's the door mother and father and the Lord Jesus Christ is the blood on the door watch around and look good then the next thing you know he kept watching for that little old fellow said Daddy Them Wings make me nervous and he said and the father said Son be of good cheer there's blood on the door and that's God's provided way we're in his way we're following his word we're following what the prophet has told us doesn't matter what the world says we're under that blood in this day it's not a physical death it is a spiritual death let us bow our heads oh Lord Jesus Christ father Lord what a tremendous thing your word [Music] is father I put mother and father into your hands that this day that we may be covered with blood Lord because our children they're not dying in a physical manner but they're dying spiritually Lord help each and every one of [Music] us help every father and every mother and every child that's here present Lord Lord if they haven't accepted you may they accept you on this day
