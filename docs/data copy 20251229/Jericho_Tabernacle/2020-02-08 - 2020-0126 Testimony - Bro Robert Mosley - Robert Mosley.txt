a few of the experience that I had with the Prophet most experienced most young people want to know each other was over these kiddies of it what was it like being around brother branham go away and I started to let my brother in one way in nomine he was the same where there is in the pulpit or out there lemis knows he's done it but in another way he was different it literally fit anything one time I was across a campfire up at the sunset mountain you and it was when he was preaching some pretty hard things right here in Phoenix about education and things you know what he said about very Llyod ocasion because the second awesome locale this year and he was talking about people with PhDs and all their degrees and studying and also he kind of got onto the women he tambien him for Pentecost which I was raised in in Pentecost and while human created so there's nothing new to me nor another new para me women with long hair nothing good is gonna be a lot of long dresses los vestidos largos in other words what I called a Christian woman I'm almost stadium 79 car seat angle agenda Austin was attending women I remember yo man recuerdo the first time I seen a woman in shorts la primera vez

cosas well they was in the world when I was a child where's your sister no no you are a Hogan but they started creeping into the church they don't pester and pasaron and dryer I like Elisha so brother Branham was hitting it real hard entonces el hermano anonymous our goal pra so so as I was standing across the campfire from brother Branham I see he says does people think I hate women they say lamanno brahma la gente piensa que yo audio las mujeres now it's on tape you've heard him say that is was Thomas ethos this and ask each other and he says and we had heard people say he hates women [Music] well I'm thinking about it there's a recent evangelist very big on it's probably has the biggest church and state in our nation okay like that many lifes Iglesias must run this in an ass you know he made a statement that when he gets to heaven he wants to meet Paul le so LD who are you okay Li ho keep on the you Jager Cielo yo quiero conocer Apollo to chastise him about he got on the women and how they should rest the gas T Garlow or como el ataque Avalon's hit las mujeres for consoles TN what did it say in the last days they would call good evil and evil good KD CNN dos Ultimo's

brother branham said i preached it just like paul an amount of random do you open it equal equality public and what did they scream back you carelessly illegally tyrone we're resting on that it's thomas despair and oh it is I am to your time so again I'm to be here give you a little testimony I told brother John I I said I'm no preacher I said yo soy and Raoul estar aqui jelly human Oh John you know so you break at all you want me to testify 10 or maybe 15 minutes mr. Garriga yo this defeat a yes oh he's asking say minutos they said Oh know what maybe one hour he's asking know what as I don't know you know Sarah won but it was good to hear what the Prophet said what's on tape is what we need everything we need is on those tapes bueno escuchar look is no different Profeta Tomas Estela sentence stay in the tapes get in sickness that's what he said he give us five things and one of them was only say what I said of course cause I said I saw release here to look at your than you I got these notes so I thought maybe I'd forget so forgive me doesn't know that I just got over the flu about a week or 10 days ago and it was probably the worst I ever had and I still got a little cough I'm gonna get my handkerchief out here and when brother give me a cough drop boy whenever he said he attack even at a mile a do not pass to eat the pie that Corinthos so I hope I can get through this testimony without having to call for whole lot espero que yo what I said is that the that's the morning you'll see you pray for me see for me let's have a word of Prayer well I was heavenly father Celestia is we're standing here this morning I see but others esta mañana to give testimony without a testimonial it's of your goodness and grace but Lord we have to the Bible said to testify of what you've seen and heard ELISA test if you look at most bestow escuchar oh I'm going to read a scripture in a few moments boy just about that bless me Lord I pray not that I deserve it then II seem insane Yoda is looking for medicine but I could be a help to these people and an encouragement there and I use the ayuda para esta gente bless their ears and their hearts Lord that they would hear it vinícius Oh eNOS is corazones Caliban escucha and give us understanding Lord we all need your revelation that isn't any mental todos nós estamos de - we thank you for this little church the damos gracias por si esta página iglesia for these my brothers and sisters estos mis hermanos Y hermanas we ask these blessings in Jesus Christ's name Amen I have to wear these to read I was first in us brother branham was one of his services when he speak tat brother Garcia's does anybody here old enough to remember when they had to church down on 3rd Street and and I think Jefferson or Hadley well I think that was later just thought I keep one list I was just a little bitty kid this is by about 1947 just thought I keep honest like listen and mano Garcia my folks were Pentecostal mrs. Pirus Aaron pentacle stairs and his brother branham said on the tape he said the mostly boys he said their mother is a woman preacher the ground is Yenisei Bironas es una mujer pre-k or of course in my young years I didn't think much about it the Word of God didn't mean that much to me although your opinion of significant mucho para mean is a tiempo so but when I realized and brother branham said what he said about women preachers when are you really saying okay say personas mujeres que rompe Rica Dora's that's when I looked into his word it's gone the UN Paseo buscar in super elaborate and what brother branham said I believe he told us the truth my mother had a lot of things that she said proved that women could preach then yeah bastante schools diciendo que up with this many member sister phoebe in the bible that helped Paul Alma noses quicker than a man aphelion Amelia K are you though I Pablo she would refer to that quite a bit Sarah ferry is Dante and one of the judges in Israel was a woman I forget her name you know that was with Sunita in not recorded a number that I mean yet I want to hear it and I was looking at my notes here and I forgot to read a scripture forgive me yes Tommy enemies not I see similar layer when I stick to that perdóname are you ready it's first John the third the first chapter in the third verse benedict juan america be too low he that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye obey also may have fellowship with I need a lot of light with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ I'm here to say what I've seen and heard a mother cannot administer lo que hemos visto Yeouido eso owes an museum owes para que también vosotros 10 guys communion con los otros in nuestra communion verdadera mente s con el padre y con sus hijos s cristo SOI estoy aqui para decir lo que ha visto no so you break out so as to go on and carry on my thought but I think it pensamiento we were raised in Pentecost as I've said from creado sand Pentacles days and so we went to brother branham services when he come to town you almost Alice Teresa Romano Branham convenings brother Oral Roberts he'd bring his big tent it was in a manner old Roberts gonna tenía su gara gara muy grande even brother eh eh Alan I mean I see still most gonna determine aaand and I at the time we were going to brother outlaws many people hurt nor heard of them is that the employer mostly lesser than hermano outlaw and I remember in Sunday school class yeoman recorded unless one of them in he can we as children I see the picking ethos wanted say I like oil robbers who know this yeah I mean it Gustav old Roberts and the other one would say oh I like aaand you he dramatizes everything I ultimately CIA me gusta la gusta como esta mateesah todo I don't know but in my heart no separate my Corazon I said I like brother branham your this year I mean megusta Romano growing even as a seven year old child I see the ruining of the city onions I could feel when he come into the building your Cynthia cuando el in travel if he didn't have to get up and speak not in the arcade sua da caparica it's when he come in there just would be a different atmosphere cuando el in trauma units most fara differently I noticed that as a child I didn't know what it meant unit area so they need you know Sevilla lo que significa ver so I'm just giving you a little background esto durante una algo transformed loop again tienda I think my dad was a farmer out here on the west side we provide our own story and when
