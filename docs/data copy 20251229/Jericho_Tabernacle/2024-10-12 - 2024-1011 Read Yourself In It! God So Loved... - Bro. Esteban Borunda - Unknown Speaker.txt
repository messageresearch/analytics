Lord Jesus we want you to speak Lord Jesus and Quicken us Lord Jesus so we can respond Lord Jesus to your word Lord we ask all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen before you you take your seats my name is estan bua can you hear me back there all right okay um for missionary Outreach Ministries missionary Outreach Min we are your brethren right we are your brethren I am your brother maybe the exterior may show that uh I'm inapproachable but I'm very approachable and and and sometimes I have to control myself because uh some people may not uh I might come off too strong but God made me it this way for this certain time that we're in you'll you'll soon hear and you'll learn amen uh I'll share a nice little testimony for the Youth share the word of God overall it's God's power of transformation it's not my power it's not what I could do to for myself I couldn't do absolutely nothing so let's go ahead now that you know my name is esta let's go ahead and go to the the scripture I had a thought I don't know if you if you read that I don't know if you're uh God God bless the musicians sometimes the title itself uh throws people for Loop it says read yourself in it and and how when brother Johnny had asked me to I'm just going to go and relax when brother Johnny your pastor he had asked me one time to do a Deliverance service I said no problem I was in my office I I started to go through I put my message together I G talk about God being a high tower mighty tower I felt the stirring in me this wasn't the message and and so I I just stayed at my desk I asked God said tell me what you want me to speak and then and then I started to hear three times fire fire then third time fire I said that's it it's fire and so I open my bible and it opened exactly where Elijah had called down fire and so I went with that and that's what we need today if you've gotten a little bit cold if your fuel if your oil level is a little bit low if the carbon needs to be trimmed if you've never exper experience that fire that I'm going to talk about or the fire that you see says I pray today it will be that day because within that fire is everything that you have need of for this world to journey in not only in this world but that fire is the ticket take you from this world to where God wants us to be amen amen John 3:16 ju and many people are going to say John 3:16 we hear this so many times people have John 3:16 on their shirts how many watch wrestling or you used to watch wrestling tell the truth there's a guy named Austin 316 atin people would wear those shirts but they know nothing about John 3:16 true meaning that's what the word of God is to to people nowadays they blashe it front of it John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life you may be seated I started to make another mistake I sometimes make this mistake I am being myself right now I'm relaxing myself so you can relax all right so you so the Lord can have his way with you and have his way with me I I often make this mistake I bring my timer I I forget to push start so as a witness we putting start so that the trap door doesn't open up and I go down or the Deacon they call the Deacon to pull me out for the scripture says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life whosoever matter if you're a drunker a drug addict you're black you're white Chinese whatever you were whatever the world has put a title to because the world puts titles to you they'll either call you a Holy Roller they'll call you a bum they call you a homeless whatever but it's a title as long as I read whosoever it means whosoever amen amen oh I never had a chance he he didn't mean he didn't say me he didn't mean me whoever man John 3:17 for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten [Music] son how how many how many can see Mark 16 in that isn't that beautiful it says uh Mark 16 go ye into the world preach the gospel the word preach in the Greek means evangelize and it says preach the gospel the gospel is the good news good tidings isn't this time that all you you watch the news right now bad news bad news but he says the good news but I I have some bad news for you before you hear the good news you have to hear the bad news this is for the young people right now all right because right now they said oh oh there there's no better place right now to be than right here under a a great influence a greater influence than what the influence is out there we must understand there's only two Powers two powers in this world and it's God's power the Holy Spirit or Satan's power it's not my brother who's against me it's not my mama who's against me not my daddy who's against me Pastor who's against me no there's only two powers trying to bring you under that influence God's power God's power is the only one that will break that can break the devil's power not no counseling classes not the garbage they teach you in school today because what they teach you in school today oh they say it's from the Bible also if you want to be a cat you could be a cat what kind of garbage is that today that in California they have litter boxes in the restrooms for those that are demon possessed under the influence of Satan that if you want to be a ferie one day you can walk around and act like a cat you can act like a dog well it's the Bible Jesus was transfigured uh before the disciples before Elijah and Moses so you too can be transfigured what a bunch of hogwash do you understand what I'm talking about huh no we pray hope you pray over your children when you send them to school that's not my message but just one word influence Direction so what influence are you under what influence do you want to be under I'm going to give you I don't have it I'm I messed up but I want to give you I'm just going to read the the definition the power influence the power of capacity of causing and effect in indirect or intangible ways to sway and then the other word same word just helping you guys understand because more that word influence if you go to theology which means the true the study of the true sense of the word we to this influence an astrological term streaming eal power from the Stars When in certain positions acting upon character or destiny of men then that word Stars took me to Lucifer uh Lucero in the Hebrew it says the bright it said lightbearer and then it said Morning Star and then when I was reading it I said hold on there's only one one morning star that I know of how could they have the morning star under the Hebrew definition of Lucifer it had to be brought to my memory once again that Lucifer Luci was God's right hand man and Michael was on the left hand side so therefore there had to be a title switch so God took Lucifer why why because there was iniquity found in him and he took that title of Morning Star and put it upon Michael and then Michael KCK lufer out what is this got to do with what you're talking about brother you see what just that word star I want you to also understand if you could just read I'll give you Isaiah and also Ezekiel who your enemy is and how Splendid he is and how beautiful he is but still Michael kicked him out of Heaven he has no power your enemy is not your mom or dad you may look in the mirror and see an enemy because we're told that the greatest enemy is ourselves we Hinder am I still on bad news you want to hear some more bad news can can you guys handle it can your kids handle it we GNA give you some more bad news Psalms 515 you never had a chance never had a chance each and every one of you never had a chance behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me how many heard brother Bram speak of this and many people say he's not even speaking in scriptures because he said I was born in sin sh iniquity I came out speaking lies they say that's not even in the scriptures what brother Bram did he grabbed two scriptures Psalm 5831 D hailed it together and he brought it forth said that I was born in sin shaped in ini and I came out speaking lies and here's the scripture David's acknowledging behold I was shapen in iniquity and in s did my mother conceived me then Psalms 58 the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they born speaking lies you never had a chance but God so L the world that he came to give you a chance that's why the title again I'm gonna need your help you're gonna think I'm conceited or maybe the st's full of himself but the title says read yourself in it read yourself in what the word of God there's nothing wrong with that you have to find yourself in the word of God and that's what we should search it like when brother Bram gave that illustration of that German car maker he gave a book to the uh to his his uh uh supervisor and he read the book and he says don't bring that stuff here to work again why he said because don't I think he said don't bring that garbage here again this guy called me a buzzard and he said what I don't I don't know why he called me an eagle and he says amen so you got to find yourself he that believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life now are you a Believer or are you an unbeliever I didn't say an a make believer you're either a Believer or an unbeliever what well I'm just not sure I hope today is your day all things 19621 that's Slide [Music] Five like a story I read here some time ago an old C up on the sea and he had a pretty near lived his life out in sin but once he had heard of The Bible and God and he laid dying slide six and he said is there one person that could talk to me about the Bible or is there one Bible on my ship see he'd been waiting a long time think about that but God's full of Mercy paragraph 120 slide seven and they found a boy that they picked up on the ship and he had a Bible and he told him he said come in son and sit down by my bed and read me that Bible slide eight and the young lad turned to his turned to Isaiah 53 and it reads like this he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes stripes we were healed the little boy turned and he said Captain sir he said yes lad he said let me read it the way my mom used to read it to me it gets good and gooder but here's the way that Mama the word the the one who teaches you used to read it to me said go ahead son read it the way your mother read it slide 11 said Mama used to set me up on her knee and read he was wounded for willly puits willly he was bruised for Wily's puit iniquities will the chastisement of Willie puit peace was upon him and with his stripes Willie pu was healed you mean me the old Captain said I wish I'd had have had a mama like that how many Mas do we have like that maybe we should start cast those Devils that followed your children they come home from school with such a horrible influence upon them they don't understanding themselves don't know why they're being tormented themselves so it's always good to get them like brother Bernie would always say his mother did she wasn't always just checking him she said she would check his ears no check his ears what did you hear at school and she would No Doubt with the Holy Ghost turn to her son look him over pray over him you came from school and casting those anointings away I plead the blood of Jesus Christ upon you putting the blood upon your ear putting it upon your forehead I the blood of Jesus Christ she wasn't saying it that's what she was doing maybe my name could be read into it that's why the title little boy said just a minute Captain let me read your name into it he was wounded for John quartz salvation johnz amen he was bruised for John quartz iniquities johnz the chastisement of John quartz peace was upon him with his stripes John quartz was healed light flashed over the old Captain's face I see it I see it and what he did is he got where's my clothes and he dressed himself amen amen [Music] God so loved that he gave his only begotten son that one day when he was in belief he would hear the gospel even though his grandpa was Pastor an evangelist a minor prophet his dad is this his dad is this I'm sorry but it's an individual Affair I don't care if your dad is a pastor I care if you're a relative of brother BR it's an individual Affair and when the preaching of the Gospel which we are told to do why is preaching the gospel CU it's a commission if you ain't out there preaching the gospel to The Prostitute to the drunkard to the drug addict to the one who has diabetes the one who has high blood pressure the Lost then you're missing it you're not doing what God commanded you to doen amen next slide 15 uh trans and when he was this is living dying buried rising and coming and when he was on his way down to the grave of Lazarus speaking of Jesus Christ I think that was another great time that he expressed what God is to the human beings not not only is he a God that could forgive the lowest sin that could be committed this is what this world needs to to there's too many people paying the price and they need to hear Jesus Christ paid the price for you don't torment yourself you couldn't help it didn't I read the scripture you were born in sin shaped in iniquity you can help speaking lies the moment a man or a woman would step away from God's influence you're on thin ice because there's another influence that is there and that's the enemy and take the guilty and make them Guiltless by his pardoning love God so loved the world that gave His only begotten son if you don't get anything into your mind tonight I'm gonna drive this down God so loved what about me brother you got to read your name into it can you read your name into it how many can help me right now I'm going to say my name my name is Aon we're going to hear I want to hear a lot of different other names are you ready are you ready God so loved [Laughter] I want to hear all your different names amen amen read your name into it God love book to you he knows your name sooner or later if it hasn't been revealed to you and I hope it's sooner that your name will be read out of this book how by the preaching of the gospel because the gospel says in Romans chapter 8 for the manifestation of God it wasn't that just one day you became a Son of God before the foundation of the world were a Son of God you were a daughter of God but it's not known to you that's why the scripture says that the Earth is moaning gring for the manifestation because the Earth is barely holding together hurricane after Hurricane after over fire over earthquake if you're not listening listening to the word of God is testifying to you hurry up I Want to Break Forth into a new creation he's waiting for you boys and girls what is manifested the word manifested people avoid it but in emology it means this in the Latin hand to be attacked to be struck so what do you think that scripture means for the manifestations of the sons of God when you're born manifest W it says Oh you mean what some say Lord manifest yourself to me manifest yourself to me Lord show me the way and then the hand of God comes and gives you one oh my god that hurt yes but what are you now I'm awake Lord so long go out there prach the gospel don't teach to the the the you got to learn the Seven Seals but I have you know you're getting thunder you're getting lightning now God so loved that he put him in a path of a man named Johnny aado Johnny a he got on a bus and punishing himself he didn't know how to go back to God baptized at 9 years old became a gangster drug ad he lived on a streets he slept in the Parks slept in the alley walk the streets with no shirt all I had was a lighter and a pipe because that was the life that had captured me I thought I could outsmart the devil I became a methamphetamine addict sh testimony with people they can't believe it you look so young what had happened God's power transformation a man who would rob you and I robed many of you I robed you of your time or whatever it may be for me for 15 years but he was baptized at nine but the influence that's why you can't stop for just being baptized you're meant to go on further of the Holy Ghost not only to be Sons and Daughters of God butto the adoption to be adopted to be given a message to speak life where there's death you need rain I send you rain in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I see the dark Spirit upon you the name of Jesus Christ diabetes and it leaves alah come here somebody has to testify come stand up here this wasn't planned turn around so they can see you two years old cancer attacked her I believe it was two or three level four the hospital ready to check out no hope for her brother Alex brother I want you to understand I'm nothing I'm dirt I'm garbage I'm dust I'm nothing I'm nobody but God found it God so L that he saved them he cleansed them he filled them he changed them go forward a heart like a child I love everybody I love everybody even if they didn't love me I played football I know what the stiff arm is but when football you also know how to get past that stiff arm we went there with the family delado family of you have heard her testimony or anybody's ever even testifying say it again or if anybody's ever testified of this we prayed the prayer of faith we gathered around her bed the doctors took her to the surgery they couldn't find the cancer in her spine they they returned and they said to brother I don't know who your God is but you guys were sure praying it was a prayer of faith she's here now at 16 my desire for her is for her to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and she's not even my child but that's my heart's desire for each and every one of you to receive what God has for you God so loved as that I would get on a bus and I couldn't even look at brother Johnny smelling like paint stumbling around drunk getting off of the bus just so I can smoke some weed don't get religious on me now now you go and get it for free and it's called Uh I think it's called casual or recreational thank you not that you go it's a recreational thing everybody does it go ahead and do it I drive by and I said look at L to my wife look at the lines look at the lines I says if I were to go there and say I'll pray for each and every one of you you know what they would do to me hello police is disturbing our money is just income to them I see precious Souls Souls under an influence that the influence of the Holy Ghost that can break every chain bre break every fed only break it keep you from it an addict for 15 years and then I sat in that very back seat and if you heard of brother ala go and ask him he says he doesn't remember what day it was but it was 20 on a Friday service I came to church I think it was cut off bald head looking like a crazy [Music] gangster I sat in the back hiding when he came up here and said he was giving a testimony he said that how he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost when he finally cried out and said God I can't take it no more they keep on telling me you can run this yard I'll give you the drugs but when I was looking at him I said the same guy that we used to run around and run the streets it didn't look like him there's light we used to call him raccoon because there was always Darkness why because we would go months maybe three or four weeks without sleep you want to see the devil you want to see some Demon Spirits yeah you'll see them all right they'll torment you too but when I said hold on I got there I did all my meth I did all my pain pills I smoked all my weed and I said I know what happens when you go to church nothing goingon to happen to me the reason I went to church like that was not to hear the word of God it's because my sister she had an experience of the Holy Ghost and she told my mom she says don't worry about EST I'm gonna pray I'm gonna go after him and my sister were like this until she got married if he sees this until Texan came and took her for you Texas okay we used to get into it we used to wrap ourselves with socks and fight each other when I got jumped I'm not I'm I'm right on target one day I got in a fight at Trevor Brown in Trevor Brown this guy I'm not gonna brag I'm just let you know I got down from Brother John's bus Johnny and and and I had to hide my face cross the street and there was a guy I'll let you know he was from AFL AF a Loos and his name was Beast big beast and he walked on to the campus I'm a real man you're this this and that oh yeah boom went down he left that fight looking like he was an Incredible Hulk RI shirt busted everything everything the only thing that saved me from killing that man that was a bus driver brother Johnny stopped his bus and got into the middle of the street and when I'm under the influence I have a gun in my back pocket because the day before I got jumped by LCM so it ain't G to happen to me again because I'm gonna get whoever steps in my way I hear remember all these years I've been hearing also I haven't even I don't even respond to a I don't live at the house somebody screamed at ston like it was in my ear and I jumped off of the guy and Johnny's on [Music] campus what are you doing God so L the St he put a man in his way that he would call his name then one day I was in my office I my parents allowed me back and I heard my name as loud as could be in my ear and but in that the very moment I was feing I need a fix I went to get my pack of cigarettes when he dedicated me a Bible brother Perry green the blue one and then I put it on there never touched it but the prayers I know I'm jumping around when I needed a fix I went to the dope houses I knocked on the door I knocked at all my gangster home boys and when they saw me coming the door on me turned off the lights and I was like what's going on fight after fight people that I bled Sweat and Tears with committed many offenses to could be in prison for for 50 years my destination was prison or death but God so loved that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life I still have time if you want me to shut up all right I got the devil on the run you may not know it see your face being interested I you're interested if you want a refilling refilling if you want your Liberation claim your Liberation he's waiting for you speak it tell him what he what you want not what you want what you need but you have to speak it he wants to hear his children cry out so like a loving father come to you and embrace you just like when a son or daughter hurts themselves you hurt yourself they're crying the hug of a mother word I'm not talking [Music] about talking about the Lord Health all your disas I went to my mom's house and was right there and and I looked at her I can't even look at my sister yes she had short hair but there was a glow on her she had just received the baptism of the Holy Ghost by going to church and supporting my sister Alexis dedicating her child how beautiful God works I'll just go with you to listen do you know God's gon to have his way with you you like it or not if he puts you on your back so you have to look up said
