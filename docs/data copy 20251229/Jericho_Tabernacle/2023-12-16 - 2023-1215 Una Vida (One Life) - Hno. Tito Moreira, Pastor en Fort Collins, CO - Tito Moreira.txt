Redeeming the time now say Redeeming the time now in English it says redeeming because the days are evil let us read one more scripture in the book of Colossians Colossians chapter 4 the Apostle Paul

and our enemy wants to enter into our lives my desire Lord is to love you more each and every day and please you each and every day Lord we place ourselves in your hands that it be you speaking to our hearts let it be you open up our eyes and our spiritual your ears and that we can receive everything that you have for us and to not leave empty-handed because I believe it's not a coincidence Lord that we're here on this ask of your help in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated Brothers God bless you God bless the musicians God bless the specials what beautiful gifts God has placed in this place we're happy to be with you once again we're going to enter into our theme we want to talk to you a little bit about time about the one life that we have uh one person once said time is a strange commodity we can't save it re retrieve it relive it stretch it borrow it borrow it loan it stop it or stop it or store it but can only use it or lose it time it's the most valuable uh currency in which we have if time was money we would be able to say every single day God gives us let's just say 1,400 minutes a day we either use them or lose them it it would be like if someone said to [Applause] us I'm going to give you $1,400 a day but you have to use them well and if not you're going to lose them I believe if that was the case believe we would make sure that we would use that money correctly we would take advantage because if not we'd lose it now time has a funny way of passing through our lives I have a couple things I'd like to share with you now a couple pictures of videos that I sent sent them back there they're they're my own personal pictures and videos but I believe it it shows us all if you can please the first video please it shows us how quickly or fast time goes by I don't know if they have uh uh sound now this is my little boy Alden yeah I still remember when he was a [Music] baby [Music] seea it was barely a month old there I still remember when he was born he was born with a cone shaped he looked like an alien and in one occasion I recognized time goes by so quick it just looks like you just close your eyes blink if you can put the next picture and and then if they can put up the next one no not that one the other one that one there you go it just looks like I just barely blinked and this was his first day at preschool first day at school that we're going to leave him and I don't know how many parents remember that first day seems like it's recorded in our minds and then you blink once again and you can show the picture of how he is now he's about to be 12 years old and this is my son thank you very much and our lives have a way it seem like time escapes us so [Applause] easily and I believe this is what the Apostle Paul is trying to say to the church when he's saying redeeming time him saying take advantage Well of Time a writer once said a a poet a missionary Roberto called Roberto muat we will have all eternity to celebrate our victories but only one short hour before the sunset in which to win them I'm going to say it again we'll have an eternity to celebrate our victories how many are waiting for that day for the day in which we're able to celebrate our victories the day where we able to see each other in eternity and we Embrace and we start to testify what God did in our lives we have an whole eternity to celebrate victories but it seems like we just have a couple of hours to win some victories if we don't have victories in this life what are we going to celebrate come on church if we don't have victories what are we going to celebrate when we're there in eternity what will we say to David what will we say to Paul what will we say to Daniel what are we going to celebrate where we feel like we haven't gained victories we're going to have an eternity to celebrate them we simply have a couple of hours Brothers to gain or win those victories as I start to think a little bit in my life I want to share a little bit more of my life with you I still remember when I was 8 years old and an evangelist came in the church in which we were visiting we said who would want to accept the Lord Jesus Christ and I still remember that moment because I believe when you accept the Lord Jesus Christ to your life and you remember that moment there's something that stays recorded in your heart and I can remember saying it to God in that moment I was eight years old and I remember saying God I want you in my life I want you to be my savior I want to surrender my life to you and I remember then I started to learn the guitar started to sing more in church started to do more for God and I still remember the day I baptized myself and I I remember being the director of worship music sorry I would play the instruments and then I remember worshiping in church I still remember my first preaching I was 16 years old I preached a message called The Almost Christian that was my first ever preaching the almost Christian and I preached about how many we almost Christians and we're almost about to make it and we're almost almost supposed to be what we're supposed to be we talk about the 10 virgin about the foolish virgins I remember all of that and when I go back into my memory I'm proud of what I did for God I'm proud that I gave my life to the Lord I'm proud that I did what I could for him but there's something within me now that says what about these years what about these moments what about this day when I'm older and I look back to these years look back to these days what will I say of these moments what will I say of these days did I take it advantage of my time did I do everything for the kingdom of God I ask you the question church I ask you the question what will you say of these moments maybe you're very proud of what happened in the past or maybe you're not proud of your past but what we have is the now what we have is this moment many times Our Lives it's not composed of great emotional moments no sir we think that life is composed of Great Moments oh the first time I got my first house my first car all all the youth remember their first first car oh finally the person I wanted to talk to is talking back to me and we think that life is composed of those moments God but life is not composed of those Great Moments not only those moments but composed of small moments that we make great small moments days like this days like today that we decided this is not just any other service this is not only another day this day shall be special we make it great if we take advantage of time well that's right amen sir the Christian the Son of God how to take advantage of time he knows how to take advantage of difficult days he knows that the most difficult of days the saddest of days in the future become the most special of days a son of God take advantage of the problems to give Glory unto God say son of God takes advantage of the tears to go Embrace of him a Son of God takes advantage of the pain he realizes in the most painful days be our greatest victories of those greatest victories will come out of the most difficult days that we've had we're going to be able to say all the devil gave it his but I didn't stay there I didn't stay on the ground but I rose up again yes sir amen what counts is not how much time or life we live but how we live it how we live it brother brandham says a greater than Solomon is here he says and I think the same thing tonight he's he's talking about the Queen of Sheba and how she gave it all when she realized what Solomon had was the truth she gave it all and he says I think the same thing tonight if this Plan of Salvation that we're contending for is right other words if this is a truth he says we owe everything that we got our life our time our everything [Music] else if it's not right then find out what is right cuz you only got this one life and it will soon won be over let me tell you church I have found what everything means to my life this message is the best that I have found this message is everything to me and if it's right if it's the truth if Jesus Christ is real that he deserves that I give the best of me he doesn't deserve half of me he deserves all of [Music] me Paul trained a young man a young man called Timothy he taught him how to take advantage of time he taught him when he was a young man he taught him how to Quicken to re to rekindle that fire that was in his heart in second Timothy first chapter one verse when I call to remembrance the UN unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelleth first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother un and I am persuaded that in thee also wherefore I put Thee I believe that's what God is trying to tell us tonight wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou ser up the gift of God which is in thee now now look what Paul is trying to tell Timothy he wants that Timothy Timothy stir up the gift that God gave Brothers I want to tell you God has given us all gifts we can all do something for God Amen we all have a gift of God you say brother I have well you got hands right you can appla to the Lord you can raise them up you have a mou to sing you have a mouth to say God I love you sometimes we come to church and it seems like we have nothing to offer God we have so much so him Hallelujah we have a voice oh you say I don't know how I sing that doesn't matter he looks at the worship that comes from your [Applause] heart now Paul is saying to Timothy stir up the gift within your hearts then the first thing he says before telling him that uh when I call to remembrance of unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelleth first in your grandmother Lois and thy mother Unice and I am persuaded that in thee also Paul is saying to Timothy he's saying Timothy look from where you come from look from where you come from look who are your parents are look at your mother who your mother look who your grandmother is I believe that have several of the youth here could say my mother my father are sons of God my father is not a coward my mother's not a coward come on is there youth that's here that can testify my parents are not a bunch of cowards my Paul is a of Timothy look who your family is look from where you come from now I come from a Christian father I I come from a father that taught me from a young age that taught me to love God I remember when my dad would take me to the Park to the plazas he would give me a guitar and in front of everyone that was in that Park we would start to sing and he would start to preach and I was embarrassed my friends from school would look at me and they would say oh look at these odd balls I but one thing that my father taught me up fear to speak of what God has given you and testify of him yes sir amen but I ask you the question where do you come from oh you say I didn't have a father that taught me I didn't have a mother that taught me but spiritually what types of parents have we what type of spiritual father have we had come on Church how many can say here God gave me a spiritual father God gave me a spiritual father that Tau me correctly from where from where do we come from church that's what Paul's trying to say to Timothy Timothy look from where you come from we come from a lineage of people courageous people that have stood up for God testified of the wonders of God Amen yes sir God gave us a powerful message with a powerful Prophet we're children of this message say it again children of this message Church how many can remember from where they came [Music] [Applause] from Paul says to Timothy remember where you come from let me tell you Church we have the same message we have the same Faith it's not another message we didn't we don't serve another God we don't serve a different God we serve the same God that does the same Miracles that changes lives that brings you out from any circumstance it's the same God and the same Faith amen yes sir you know what I've realized in our time we're accustomed to boredom we're used to boredom okay we're it seems like we're okay with being bored entertaining ourselves with the phone it seems like we're okay with not with with not seeing the miracles of god it may seem that we're okay just getting old and have nothing to testify about I don't believe God called you for that I believe God called you to show this world that God is real amen yes [Applause] sir Hebrews 11 shows us from where we come from he speaks to us about Abraham he talks to us about Moses he talk it talks to us about all the the heroes of Fai Hebrews 11:32 says and what shall I more say for the time will fail me to tell you of Gideon and of of Samson of Jeff of David and also also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms righteousness obtain promises the of Li the vience of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong W Valiant in fights turn the flights that arm the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had Trials of cruel mockery and scoring yet moreover of bonding and imprisonment they were stoned they were s son were were slain with a sword they were wondered about in sheep they wondered about in sheep skins and gold skin being distilled and Afflicted but I love verse 38 of whom the world was not worthy of whom the world was not worthy the world is not wor to have Heroes like them children of God like them from where do we come from from a bunch of cowards what is our spiritual descendant what is our spiritual descendant Church come on Church what is our spiritual descendant we don't come from a bunch of coward Paul says to Timothy you don't come from cowards you come from people with faith children of God I told you the truth and sold that Faith within you amen yes sir Paul Contin saying to Timothy in verse six where I put thee in verse six reme that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee and in verse seven says for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind that's right yes sir the Apostle Paul in another place says in 1 Timothy verse uh 4: 7 he tells them what he should attend to what should take advantage of put refuse Prof and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness for verse 10 says for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the Living God who is the savior of all men and then verse 12 says let no man despise thy youth verse 13 till I come give attendance to the reading to exhortation and to Doctrine he says take give attention to these things verse 14 neglect not the gift that is in thee he tells them again neglect not the gift that is in thee verse 15 meditate upon these things give them give thyself holy to them that thy profit may be appear to all people can see let me tell you people can experience of someone that's taking Well of Time people know when you've been under the presence of God when you've been giving it all to people can feel it but Paul says notice neglect not the gift that is in don't neglect the gift that is in thee Church don't neglect the gift that is in youth he could have neglected his gift he could have done it he had many reasons to do so according to the story he was a very timid man living in a dangerous time in the time of Timothy to be a Christian it was like a death sentence there was persecution for they could kill your family they could kill your beloved ones he lived in the time of great danger for the Christians but Paul says to God has not given us a spirit of coward God has not given us a spirit of cowardness church God did not make you a coward don't be scared if they mock of you don't be scared of what they're going to say today we live in a time well we're scared to raise our hands we're scared to raise our hands no one's going to do nothing to you in the house of the Lord give it all that you want to Him Praise Him Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah yes sir Timothy was a young man he was a young man like you and I timid fearful says to Timothy remember where you come from God has not given us a a spirit of fear oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah people present the truth like it's a lie we present this great truth sometimes like if it was a lie talk to me about [Music] god let's talk about sports let's I'm gonna tell you what I saw in Tik Tok did he see this viral video it looks like YouTube encourages us more than the word of God we get so excited with YouTube we get excited with Tik Tok the and Instagram and all the rest and the truth of it is what truly is real we present it like it's a lie Brothers God did not us God did not call us to be half Christians God gave us a Spirit of Courage Timothy could have neglected of his gift because of fear of what they would say fear of what would happen maybe because of his sickness Paul says that Timothy suffered of stomach pains he was very he was a person that got sick very easily because he was very nervous maybe I don't know but he suffered of his stomachs and Paul would tell him drink this for your stomach Paul wouldn't tell Timothy oh poor Timothy rest rest oh we have a headache and we don't want to come to church Paul knew what it was to serve God while you were sick Paul knew what it meant go to the most dangerous places even when he couldn't see even when he was sick hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Brothers why do we neglect what God has given us oh I don't feel well brotherto oh that's where more we can see the glory of God in the problems when there's difficult you worship him no matter what he could have neglected his gift because he was young you know when you're young you feel like you have a bunch of time a lot of time it looks like no one it seems like no one's going to listen to you no one's going to pay attention to you I speak to the youth sometimes with this young one here and he I tell him at your age I was already Pastor I was already pastor what are you doing amen glory I I tell the youth we have no EXC us the best of the best of the best Hallelujah I to hear what he speak of now or spoking about when I was young but God has given us the best [Music] amen I love I love this poem in poem in which I just barely read it it's called do not love half lovers and the writer the poet goes like this says do not love half lovers do not entertain half friends do not indulge in works of the half talented to not live half a life and do not die a half death if you choose silence then be silence when you speak do so until you are finished do not Silence Yourself to say something and do not speak to be silent if you accept then express it in Blunt it bluntly do not mask it if you refuse then be clear about it for an ambiguous refusal is but a weak acceptance my my Hallelujah no do not accept half a solution do not believe half truths do not dream half a dream do not fantasize about half hopes half a drink will not quench your thirst half a me will not sat your hunger half the way will go will get you nowhere half an idea will bear you no results he says your other half is not the one you love no yeah yeah they say is it is you in another time yet in the same space it is you when you are not half a life is a life you didn't live a word you have not said a smile you postponed a love you have you have not had a friendship you did not know to reach and not arrive work and not work attend only to be absent ain't that like how we come to church we attend but we're absent come back come make yourself make yourself present in this time attend only to be absent what makes you a stranger to them closest to you how much truly do you know your brother we're so we're such we're so strangers or Str another we truly don't know one another that's what makes you a stranger to them that that are closest to you and they strangers to you the half is a mere moment of inability but you are but you are able for you are not a half you're not a half a being you are a whole that exists to live a life not a half a life we come to this Earth for a little while we don't too much time to dedicated to many other God made us with the purpose to serve him God made us with the purpose of giving it all to him char spon Charles Spurgeon said be half a Christian he says you shall have enough religion to make you miserable that's why there's so many miserable here in church that's what Revelation says 3:14 says that's how it be in these days there would be half lived people verse 14 says oh better yet verse 15 says I Know Thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot come on Church many of us if we're one thing completely we're not that completely are we something else completely we're half and half and then he continu saying the musicians can come forward now he says and he says this how would thou W cold or hot but because thou are look warm and neither cold nor Hearts I will spew thee out of my mouth and then it says because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and I have need of nothing and know it's not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and naked here it is Brothers why are we so [Music] miserable because we're halfway with God that's what God is saying to Le that's what God is saying to you what's the point of coming to church what's the point of a church if he's not present here what's the point of calling ourselves Christians if he's not present in our lives what's the point of preaching this message if we don't see it in our own lives they what's the point of a service if he doesn't do anything for us what's the point we just become miserable everything becomes a routine that's what God is saying to you're miserable because you're lukewarm you're blind because you're look war god reveal it to us tonight you may say Lord I'm not everything I'm supposed to I'm so miserable where are you God where are you and God said because you you can't see because
