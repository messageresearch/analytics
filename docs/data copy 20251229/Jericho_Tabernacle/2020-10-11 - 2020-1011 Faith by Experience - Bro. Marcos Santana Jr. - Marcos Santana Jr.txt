sunday [Music] [Music] to just carry along a bit of those words like that which was spoken last sunday continue if you remember the title from last sunday faith is the foundation fundamental we're going to just carry a bot carry upon that and this morning titled the message faith by experience while you're standing you can please open your scriptures and we're going to turn to the book of mark chapter 11. amen mark 11 22 reads and jesus answering sayeth unto them have faith in god responding we can give it a backup scripture we'll turn to first john chapter 5. we're going to reverse four eleven [Music] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world our faith [Music] [Music] lord heavenly father thank you lord jesus for another precious morning to be able to come into your house and worship lord jesus father a place where we can sing unto you and give praises unto you [Music] and as the atmosphere gets created father atmosphere is created that you would speak to us this morning father we put you before all things this morning and we ask that you take full control of this service lord calm my nerves and may it be you speaking this morning the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated once again i greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ it was uh of a surprise and a pleasure to see brother osorio and the youth from tucson as i pulled in just when i thought my nerves couldn't get any stronger then i saw the brother and then the pressure got on her but let's trust in the lord this morning uh as i had mentioned we're going to be continuing on from brother what brother luis brought us last week and i i sound like a broken record sometimes but i just like to remind myself that i i don't too much get into these deep things or these deep revelations but i like to share or speak upon but upon what god has done for me of the grace that he's given unto me of the small portion he's given unto me that i might be able to share that unto another parque la poda and therefore we have the title this morning the simple message that our prophet preached faith by experience and in listening to this message yeah things just came kept coming out to me and out to me and i just followed along that sequence as brother branham was preaching and i believe for the most part we all know the story of david and goliath if anyone doesn't you might learn a little to this morning we know how the armies of israel israel were ready and out at war versus the armies of the philistines now the army or the soldiers of israel israel these weren't pagans these weren't heathens these weren't unbelievers incredulous these were believers like you and i could say us as well we are soldiers we are of the army of the lord and and thus these were the same believers soldiers in the army of israel and i believe here this morning that everyone in here is a believer of this end-time message and the hour of our day now in this message brother branham says and it is that there's a difference between an intellectual faith intellectual and a god and he expresses sternly that's nothing but the intellectuals intellectual so in thinking of that and then looking upon the soldiers of israel miranda they were just trusting on that intellectual faith that they had solamento intellectuals sometimes unfortunately some of us have trusted on that intellectual faith we have even the man-made weapons that had helped them defeat armies before las armas problems but nothing that they had on the exterior or on the outside what was good enough or strong enough to defeat this goliath those goliaths like brother louis spoke on last week the goliaths you might be battling in your life today you don't have that god sent faith he said all these things that i thought that i knew i didn't know anything until he had that faith by experience and now this man has been on fire day after day because it takes an experience a genuine experience of god an experience one that will bring about that faith and produce a miracle like this produce a produce a miracle like you this morning amen amen going back to david and goliath from the king on down to the very last soldier collectively all of them collectively probably looking around they saw that no one was worthy or capable of defeating this goliath from the strongest to the smartest ah but what a difference what a huge difference it is when the person has that faith when that person has that faith it gives them the confidence that they've already won the battle yeah and this was the case with david yesterday i want to read from the message of the power of god brother branham says what are eyes of faith what a power that faith has it goes so far beyond the devil's power the devil takes you to death el senor perdura we too one day will die on this earth so the devil's just showing us something we already know but listen to what brother branham says so faith is much more powerful than anything the devil has listen that's the way it is today it doesn't take an education it doesn't take a lot of thinking it takes a humble heart who's been dedicated to the power of the resurrection of christ and filled with the holy ghost that's the key right there and filled with the holy ghost that's something each and every one of us need to look in that mirror is now that's what they're talking about the one that knows what they're talking about speaking of david your servant will go fight him now this wasn't king david someone who had no business on the battlefield and he had that experience and now that conviction is a conviction to know that god was on his side of what real faith is of a real faith in god then maybe they might open up and wake up and obtain of that same faith like you all know the intellectual shield intellectual the theological sword that intellectual helmet intellectual and common sense tells me and i think if you read it you know with common sense that if that intellectual faith didn't help those soldiers what made them think that it was going to do anything for david pence he said no no i don't want that i don't need that no necessity it's going to hold me down okay it's going to set [Applause] that is why we need of that holy ghost yes brother branham says in the same message faith by experience for a little bit of encouragement speaking about moses now when he was 80 years old he knowed more about god in five minutes in the presence of that bush then he learned in 80 years in the schools of egypt what moses lacked the bush hat what our educated conception lacks the holy ghost hasanto and i was listening to this message yes and as i was in the broom and brother branham has said something that it brought me to a chuckle or laughter so if we can bring that a little closer to us and i don't want to hurt any feelings nor do i want to be too religious but we don't need a messageology but you know i've shared my testimony here but doing all those things within that time frame that i was out in the world i had gone to church maybe a handful of times five or six verses and don't think that it was a church of the message because i was trying to get as far away as i could but i'd get invited to a baptist church in an apostolic church i went to a catholic church a couple of times and i had so much of that messageology in me the woman preacher goes up and i'm already criticizing critic one thing is out of order and i was already criticized and what good did it do me to sit in church if i didn't have a new birth experience in me all this doctrine all this theology but nothing on the inside there was no fire on the inside fuego i repeat again for my brother emmanuel manuel all the things that he knew but he didn't know nothing until he had his own experience of faith i'd rather have the right spirit in the wrong doctrine than the right doctrine and the wrong spirit incorrect and what is that spirit that is god's own spirit the holy spirit that spirit of love is the spirit that with no experience of faith scene experience what i needed in my life was some hardcore neology extrema i needed to be born again i needed i was reading the story of paul on the road to damascus on the road of damascus and as i was going through the scriptures uh once again you all know the story one of his masters how he was struck down by that light and i was followed by a voice and if you read paul addresses that voice by using the term lord that paul knew that that was a supernatural quest paul knew that that was the pillar of fire like sometimes it might happen to you like it happens to the young people like it happened to me to know god intellectually like paul did intellectually but he didn't know but that the father son and holy ghost what he didn't know was the revelation of jesus christ for himself but he too had to have a faith by experience and i don't know why sometimes that's young people why we get so stubborn because if you read for yourselves and go back to that story of paul pablo when the voice spoke to him there wasn't much that was said there wasn't no bible study given about from that i am jesus whom thou persecutes jos jesus and that's all it took for paul he surrendered everything at that moment what should i do lord senor que devo said where should i go lord i don't know what do you want from me lord do what you will with my life lord i look at me take me i'm yours he got a revelation at that moment it is the titles of that voice of god are enough preaching to us faith by experience faith is the substance faith wisdom oh i could just read those titles and it speaks to my heart so loudly going back in my life nine years ago as i read the story of paula it says that there were men that were with paul and in the midst of what was taking place the bible says that these men they heard a voice but it says that they heard the voice and going back nine years ago in my life i go back to that sunday morning when my wife received her new birthday and when i seen the first miracle right in living color before my eyes in a building just like this everyone in the building they heard the voice they heard the preaching oh yeah they heard god's word but there was only one of all those that heard the voice this morning then god's word is not in vain that pillar of fire wasn't for all those on the road to damascus that pillar of fire wasn't for everyone that morning nine years ago because it's here for you and you're hearing that voice the voice of god amen in the message faith by experience going back it was somewhere along the middle of the message that it almost seems like brother branham says something a little random this parenthesis but uh nothing is a coincidence with god god knows what he's saying when he says it and to who he's saying and it once more took me back to my memory it says that afternoon at a holiness church and now let's emphasize whether random says a holiness church so i'm assuming back then that was probably the holiest that there was at the time he says he wanted to introduce me to his wife and this was a young man from the church and i tell you i'm not making fun of anybody and great big long earrings i said well she looks like a hate to me foreign she looks like a hint to me diablo well brother branham says i don't say that for a joke i mean that's the truth now i'm just telling you the conditions of the church and what we need so as i heard this uh in the privacy of just me and my wife i believe we were driving in the car one day uh we've got a long road ahead [Music] are you going to turn into them sisters that instead of getting older and it seems like they're getting younger but she kind of got a little startled i said you know those dresses start getting a little tighter that hair color starts getting a little brighter those lips are getting a lot more shinier and those heels keep getting a little taller and all that makeup on your face just makes them look so young where it seems like the older they get and pares the sexier they want to look sexy and so she answered me said oh no no that's ridiculous if you ever see me get in that state you can go ahead and slap me back into my senses i believe with all my heart she'll fight for that to be true a long journey where many have fallen muchosan where many have gone astray the ones that we love but we need to continue on that road and my dad uses the expression expression when he talks to me when he advises me he tells me careful son the bigger they are the harder they fall so in other words in other words holy ghost or not you still need to feed your spirit more than the flesh el espiritu it's a daily fight sometimes it's not easy this is fussy but we've got to keep on fighting so i don't mean to attack the sisters or the women no it's that's why i use myself and my wife as an example because i'm not the exception she's not the exception none of us are the exception we all can fall but we need to make sure that we have received that holy ghost start with that and build upon it like brother louis said last week faith is the foundation la fey is the fundamental and to build upon that difficult uh i believe it comes down to one of two things number one el somewhere along the road uh in album el camino you let sin into the camp you let sin into your home and therefore those are the fruits or the results of that sin that you let in fruit male or female ombre husband or wife now number two there was never a new birth experience to begin with without that experience you can hold on for five years you can act right for 10 years how many do we know that have acted right for 20 30 years but sooner or later like i said none of us are the exception so we need to look at ourselves in the mirror and if you need that this morning you can obtain that faith by experience now if there was never a new birth experience to begin with he or she they've just been convinced of the gospels they've been convinced of the message they have not been converted to the gospel they haven't been converted onto the message because convinced and converted they look alike just like faith and hope look alike but they're very different but different you've got to be sure of what you've got us you've had an experience you got the new bird and you know you get a little relaxed you say you get a little comfortable and then you let your guard down and the enemy comes in vienna and then sin has gotten into your life has gotten into your home it's going to be very very hard to get that sin back out [Music] we need to be careful but we're all christians here but we know there's nothing impossible for god just as easy as god can do a miracle [Music] but then there's also progressive healing that is progressive sometimes we don't like that healing because it's just a little too progressive it's not coming fast enough for our wants but if we have faith if we've asked of god then it's already done yeah like brother johnny said last week to stop stop confessing that you're sick the the heart confess stop confessing that this is wrong with you and that's wrong with me i'm already it's already been done consumado fue my stripes i've been here let us use that foundation of faith and just build upon that but you're going to feel the pain of fighting for each and every inch so like a boxer in a 12th round victory you see them in the interview sweating from head to toe bruised cut i was in a service one morning and the brother started his preaching and he says the words we want to have a revival today i'm going to ask you all do you want to have a revival today and he says so we're going to have a revival today the brother said now a revival is to revive something that we've already got is to make it stronger to make it greater hasselhoma like the bible says to quicken commodities and what got me me the brother says but if you don't have that something to revive then you better worry about getting that something today i don't know about you those are some powerful words to me because that should open up the eyes of the sinner that should open up the eyes of the hypocrites that should open up the eyes of the make-believers why can't i get into a revival because you don't have that something to revive specifically but jesus christ is here this morning and he can give you that something to revive he can give you that experience it don't matter if you're a mother or father if you've got children or not or you're one of the young people this morning that pillar of fire is here to give you that holy ghost all you've got to do is claim it open your heart be honest and let him in brother caleb once told me one time el mono que la buena vez medico uh as we were driving in his car and these words i hold dear to my heart no once that fire is lit inside of you this is and it's burning inside of you everything's all good but the problem is but the problem is to keep it alive montenerlo vivo in sendido it's going to cost you so much work to get it back up and burning so what is it that you're asking for this morning by faith you can have it was there anything you're fighting for this morning we're going to be closing now yeah i wanted the holy ghost in my life i wanted that new birth in my life and by the grace of god i was able to get it that now i'm fighting even harder every single day just to keep that fire lit and if you ask any one of these believers here this morning if it got harder after that fire's been lit they're adding wood to that fire to keep it burning day and night and there's many examples of elderly warriors here this morning that if you want a testimonial you need a testimonial it with you but i'll tell the person that doesn't have that fire but there's no better feeling than coming into the warmth of that word where it's so dark and gloomy and now you have a fire to keep you warm and light the way out so let's invite god into you please stand the struggles are just too great and his name is the lord jesus christ if you bow your heads close your eyes like i said you just need a witness you have witnesses all around you i see testimony after testimony after testimony testimonial but you can be a testimony this morning you accepted faith is your foundation your nature as the sacrifices i don't care if it was of drugs i don't care if it was of theology i don't care if you've been in church for 50 years i'm let us get in connection with god in connection let us add more wood to the fire charles fuego give him praise this morning give him glory this morning but brother i i don't dance and shout but hermano you know then just close your eyes he cries and give him thanks what he has done in your life for how he's transformed you transform how he's taking oh samson he was called of god for yamado he was used by god he had the mighty power of god in him but he didn't protect that fire he didn't take care of that fire and samson was restored is samson but it came at the ultimate price [Music] as it's touching hearts both young and old lord as it's giving revival to those that know you in their life and as it's changing lives for those that don't know you lord las vegas we give you the honor and glory this morning thanking you for everything father father we put this people in your hands your sons and daughters [Music] we give you all honor and glory lord jesus christ gloria the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Applause]

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] a [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] in which we are grateful for this opportunity we're passing by here with a major part of oh we're going to the north up north and all of the congregation here is honoring the resurrection with you guys it truly is good to be in the house of the lord when i was hearing brother marco speak about faith by experience i was recalling some experiences god has allowed me to experience throughout my life [Music] and one of them that came to my memory [Music] is isaac the one that's here he was around two or three months or three three months and as as it happened he had uh he he died in his crib and at that moment i couldn't see that it was the grace of god she realized that he had passed away he wasn't breathing and so in that desperation [Music] she cried out said the baby and she she literally put him and tossed him into my arms so i cried out to god and god answered today he is serving the lord and he was around six years old and we had gone to pray and to attend to a family and they had said i was going to be praying for a sick person but in reality i was going to go pray for a dog that was sick so we got there i prayed for the dog that was sick but something was happening in my home my son the same child [Music] he had his his he had a hemorrhage or his nose was bleeding and the blood wasn't stopping and he was he was choking on his own blood and he's choking he's he's he's drowning in his own blood what do i do do i call the paramedics the prophet tells us when someone is sick anybody in their right mind would go to the doctor so that they could help them this year i said well call the call the paramedics and while the paramedics were on their way i was on the phone with her yes and i was praying for this my son and in my mind how was it that i came here to pray for a dog and my son is over here lord and through the phone i could hear the siren that was approaching the house and the thing that was so surprising that the blood stopped instantly uh my wife told the paramedics it was no longer needed there's many experiences and that just confirms and affirms your faith with god while i was sitting there thinking the the weakest soldier of the philistines was still a threat i i myself i don't think i would approach them with a sword uh maybe there was soldiers in israel that didn't fear any of the soldiers in the philistines [Music] the most frail one didn't come out to intimidate the god's people they sent the biggest one this giant philistine wasn't the only giant philistine that was among them that giant himself had brothers but they were all a threat and i see any philistine soldier as a sickness [Music] and in this last day they sent the biggest one that looks like a king because he has a crown yeah and he's threatened the world the whole entire world and the people are afraid [Music] the unbelievers there's churches that have closed the sicknesses is he's bluffing the believers it's something sad the world over uh but we're not gonna
