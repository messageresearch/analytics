we won't need it after a while amen so we thank God for the opportunity and we thank our brother pastor of this church for inviting us here uh this is a great privilege for us to be in the house of God and we thank God for this opportunity tonight anytime that we get to speak about Christ it's always a privilege I believe we are the most privileged people there is God gave us the best of what he had and that's the message of this hour aren't you glad for that tonight amen we've been asking God just take control tonight of the service Lord you know there's nothing that I could say that would help you but I've always believed this I could say a thousand words and it wouldn't help you but if he comes and speaks one word that will change our lives amen so we thank God this morning this evening amen and it's good to see some of my brothers here aen what I believe we're here to have Fellowship amen so if you have your Bibles tonight we would like to go over to Ephesians chapter 1 [Music] Ephesians 1 and verse 11 epes and when you have it say Amen in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will let us pray Heavenly Father tonight father We Believe Lord that truly you are the same yesterday today and forever and father your Prophet said you know the motives of our hearts you know the reason that we're here and the only purpose Lord is to help your people that something would be said that would help someone tonight father we just pray that you would take control lord of the speaker The Interpreter and of the hearer of your word father we we we believe Lord that you can set our Our Hearts on Fire I believe that we've come tonight and trust you with all that's in our hearts we believe that you can still speak to our hearts father let this not be just another service but when we leave here tonight oh Lord may we truly say did not my heart burn within me as he spoke to me along the way Lord come and visit us tonight and at the end of the service may we feel a little different may we walk a little different help us we pray tonight father for all these things we ask as we commit ourselves to you in the precious name of Jesus Christ thy beloved Son and forgive our sins we pray amen amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen amen now tonight if the Lord would help us I would like to take a little thought I would like to speak predestinated for a purpose and my only hope tonight is that we've come here to help someone you know we all need help in one way or another but I believe that the only one that can help us is the one that we've trusted in and so I pray tonight that if God only speaks to one heart I believe then we've done the will of God you know Jesus one time crossed the sea to get to someone that was in need and I believe to tonight if God before the foundations of the world Brothers I believe this meeting here tonight wasn't thought of it the day I was invited but I believe that this meeting here [Applause] tonight was in the mind of God before the foundations of the world I believe that with all that's in my heart I believe that we have a god tonight that is so real that if you would only believe with all that's in your heart you would truly understand that me and you have been predestinated for a purpose as long as we are on this Earth and that's what we want to speak on tonight and I believe that God will help us in every prayer line that brother brandom had and when those people would come up he would say Do you believe with all that's in your heart and the same thing tonight we've got to believe with all that's in our hearts that God is in his word and brother brandom said God is revealed through his word I believe that now I want to take another scripture over in second Peter chapter 1 and verse 12 now that first scripture is what we titled it predestinated for a purpose remember that this purpose does not depend on anything that's already been predestinated now notice and here in second Peter in verse 12 notice what the Apostle Peter is telling the church in that day notice that all these things are types all these things are shadows in verse 12 Peter tells us wherefore I was not negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things am amen amen brothers and sisters if it wasn't important there's no need to remember it but if it was important for Peter is important for us many times when you remember something it's because something that you've left in the past Brothers maybe there are some things that we have forgotten but may God bring those things to our remembrance and the Bible tells us always in remembrance of these things notice though you know them and being established in present truth in other words he wasn't speaking just to anyone he was speaking to a people that had been established in the message of that hour these were the people that need to be brought back into remembrance and tonight I'm here to tell you this message is for a people is for a people as Peter said that has been established in present truth and I don't know about you but I believe we have been established in present truth God sent an angel Revelations 107 amen he sent an angel to reveal all the Mysteries and I believe that that angel was given this great book of redemption to call out the names of those that God had predestinated to be in present truth tonight but remember we've got to remember these things we can't let them forget let's not forget these things these can I take my coat off I'm feeling a little bit of Pentecost now notice now notice here so I just want you to see what kind of people Peter was talking about amen people established in present truth now in verse 13 I want you to notice yeah I think it meet that as long as I am in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance brothers and sisters when Peter uses the word stir that means that something has settled amen amen something that used to move something that was flexible something has happened to it now has settled but Peter came to stir that a time that me and you need stiring this now could be brothers and sisters that our lives have settled we become good church members oh Brothers now we have a custom of coming to church on Sundays come on brother Frank preach it amen amen now now we got a routine Brothers but Peter wanted to break that routine to get to a place when we come to church that we want to hear from God Amen not just to come and hear a good sermon but say God send me a Revival tonight if you don't send anybody El send the to me to stir these things that we have forgotten to bring us back Brothers I'll tell you what for the last several days the wife and I have been sitting hearing the every message that brother Brandon prayed in the Chicago meetings you know how I long to see those things back in our churches amen amen to hear a prophet that these things can be done if we were only believe all that's in our hearts now notice I hope I'm not hurting anybody but it's Peter that says I need to stir you don't forget these things when we come to church when we worship God Brothers Let's do what all that's in our hearts if we're going to come to church you don't for brothers don't get mad don't get mad cuz I'm Frank because the word Frank means just to be honest and I'm here to tell you Brothers honesty brothers and sisters that we can't let these things settle in our lives amen amen the reason that we need to come to church every day every time we have service is to come and meet God amen amen brothers and sisters not just to have a good time I can have a good time not basketball I can have a good time doing things that don't pertain to God oh brothers that's not the way we come to church when we come to church let's get ready to receive something and you excuse me if I ain't going to be ready to receive something I ain't coming to church if I'm going to the doctor I'm going there so he can help me amen because if I can't believe he's going to help me then why go over if I'm coming to church I've got to know something's going to help me amen amen that's that that's all right ain't it Brothers I heard somebody say I hope you feel at home amen you can tell I feel at home and I watch this now notice this Brothers I'm not doing this cuz I'm here this is the why I preach everywhere now watch this you know why cuz if I can get excited when the devil used to get me excited how much more and I going to get excited you know brother sister the devil used to get you excited and you weren't embarrassed you weren't embarrassed why should I be embarrassed to get excited to now now watch this so Peter tells us he tells us in in verse 13 to stir you up by putting you in remembrance amen amen now verse 14 watch here Brothers knowing that shortly I must put off this my Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me we understand that Peter knew that he was at the end of his journey and Peter wanted to make sure that those people truly understood and to never forget the teachings that were taught to them now watch here in verse 15 moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance when I was reading this it was almost like my mind was going back into the very words of our Prophet always telling us just say what I said do you still believe that tonight Brothers I'm not saying something different I'm saying what he said and now remember brother Peter says After I'm Gone Amen to have these things always in your remembrance brother Brandon put it this way he said long after I am gone these Tes will be played do you know why so we would not forget our position our purpose here in this life and brothers and sisters sometimes I wonder whether we have forgotten who we are brothers we are not part of a church we are not part of brick wood we are part of the kingdom of God amen Amen brother our beginning was not here you may love your church and you may also say I remember the anniversary when I gave my life to God brother Brom said that's the day you recognized it but as for you your birth way before the foundations of the world of God these are the things that brother random taught us and these are the things that need be stirred not only in the old but also in the new and many times the reason that we're having trouble with the young people is because they need the same experience that the old people had amen amen but you know what has happened you know what has happened brothers and sisters I can only tell you what's in my heart you know what has happened our young people are bound by rules and regulations at home this is what you're going to do this is what you're going to do this is what you're going to do we as parents might not like to hear but somebody better tell us you will not this you will not do this you will not do that we've got a bunch of rules and regulations even though they're good it's not going to change them let me tell you something you can get a man you can lock him up in prison he he when he was out here he was a drug addict he's in there he's clean he lives right but there's nothing in there to change him the only thing that's changing him is the rules and regulations of that prison but as soon as he gets out in a matter of months he's back in jail again and as long Brothers our children under rules and regulations once they get old they're going to leave so you know what you need to do and I need to do and this might hurt you but you say we got to get them to the message no you got to get them to Christ before you bring him to the message get him to Jesus Christ he'll change your heart to believe this message that's what we need talk to them about the love of God is that right that's the truth Brothers amen amen I want you to notice something we've got to a place I've used this example many times but I know many of you have not heard it but Brothers we have been predestinated with a purpose we have to truly understand who we are amen remember we are the sons of the Living God but you know what has happened over time we have forgotten about these things but Brothers as there was ever a time we know when we know who we are it's now without a shadow of doubt we know who we are years ago when a man wanted to recognize who he was there was no way you know what he would do he would kneel down and he would look at the water and he could see a reflection but it wasn't clear who he was they had an excuse and then over time they invented the metal you could polish it now you could see yourself a little clear amen you could see yourself but you couldn't see all your defects amen and then what somebody did they invented glass and you could see yourself amen you could see the defects on the outside but not on the inside is that right but then the greatest thing came the Bible says the mirror of God's word in the mirror of God's word just didn't look on the outside it looked on the inside truly would know who we are that's why this word tonight can penetrate deep down inside your heart it will stir you to ask God what you're telling me tonight that is the truth I need a Revival in my heart I'm not the one that said it but I believe it brother random said we're dying in our [Music] church that's true it's because we have been predestinated with a purpose but the devil has made sure that you forget what that purpose was he'll he'll put all kinds of things in your life he he'll make things happen in your life to try to discourage you he'll he he he'll he'll permit something that will come into your life that will tear your heart apart he he he'll he'll He he'll make something happened to a place where you start you start denying and get to a place brothers that you almost say I don't believe this message brother brandham said don't Ender don't never underestimate the devil he'll get you one way or he'll get you another way don't never underestimate you and brother randam also said if the devil cannot get you to disbelief what you believe he'll take you to one extreme or the other brothers that Devil's been around here a long time and he's caused many of us to lose focus we just don't say anything none of us want to say anything Brothers none of want nobody wants to come to the altar because we're embarrassed that mama's going to say well I thought you were serving God I'm telling you something I have preached a lot of funerals I tell you one thing there's nothing as glorious as to preach a funeral for a Son of God that make things right was ashame of who saw him Amen brother I'm only trying to help you now notice on a message gowake Jesus preacher 1963 paragraph 8 Brothers brother bam says now I've always thought the church wasn't halfhazard you know what that means when something is halfhazard it's disorganized It's Always by chance and this is where that word comes is just chance no brothers we're not here by chance we're here because we have a purpose and brother brandom tells us amen that the church isn't halfhazard amen you have to know who you are and where you stand now notice here Jesus never came to Earth have Hazard he never died in a halfhazard way he come for a purpose and that purpose was to fulfill the Commandment of God that he might purchase to himself a church without spot or wrinkle so Jesus had a purpose he just didn't come for you to feel sorry for him that's what brother brandham said amen he just didn't come to see if it would work no when God does things he doesn't perfect and I'm here to tell you it doesn't even depend on you it depends on God's choosing and I'm going to prove to you tonight you still believe the message right right so I'm not going to take what a man says I'm going to take what God Said through this prophet he said it like brother Billy Paul used to say he said it I believe it and that sett and walk out of here tonight with a different step in my I don't want to come in and leave the same way you don't have to this Friday night can be the turning point in your life notice here we have to believe that we've got to preach a message it's got power power enough to change me and you say again power enough to change me and you now are you ready for the rest of it when you leave here when you leave here Brothers you can repeat these things to the devil amen Amen on the message I know my redeemer liveth brother brandom said in in this message preaching 58 paragraph 27 now pay very close attention because these things will help us I'm just here to help you Amen to walk a little closer amen now watch this watch what he says and God did not make you and I just to see if he could do it God just didn't say Okay I want to see if this will work God is not like me and you that take chances amen you know you take a pill say I'm going to see if this is works we go through life I hope it works I'm praying that it works when God does something it will work watch what he said he made us for a purpose did you hear that you're not here just to be here he made you for a purpose therefore there is a purpose of us all being here I believe that tonight every one of us here you didn't come by coincidence amen God brought you you here for a purpose do you know if God didn't want you here he could have made something happen so you wouldn't come let me say this also there's people from this church that ain't here tonight but you're here you're here why because God ordained you to be here and ordained them not to be here that's the truth that's why we're now watch what he says he says he said you're not just here to be another human being oh my in other words we're not here just because we're another number you know just part of humanity I'm not here just part of humanity I'm here because I have a purpose I'm not I'm not like any other human being God didn't make us that way he made us for a purpose now watch what he says he says you are here because that God made you for some purpose now watch how simple brother brandom blaz uh says these things you're not here just to eat food you're not here just to live in that house but doesn't it seem that that the routine of everyday life kind of puts us in that situation from home to work to go buy groceries to come home isn't that right and that seems to be all our purpose no brother brandham said no that's not true he said that main made he goes to wear the clothing that someone fashioned now pay attention church he says you're here for a specific purpose amen not just for any purpose for a specific purp narrows it down from something in general to something that's specific so that you know brothers who you are and what God has called you for now watch what he says he tells us this he said no matter how little you are no matter how big you are brother you may feel like you're nothing oh how big you are or you think you got all these diplomas and you can really preach how important you are or how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose from the greatest to the smallest from the poorest to the richest nobody determine who you are except God amen Amen on paragraph 29 brother Bram says and if we were here if we were put here for a purpose I don't know about you Brothers I'm slobbering for some reason amen it's those Graves from Canaan [Applause] brother amen it's that stimulation of Revelation these things are real brother let me tell you something that clock makes me nervous you know why brother because we're creatures of Eternity amen but you know I respect him now watch this brother I remember a long time ago just to show you how real these things are remember a long time ago my my son my oldest son you know he wanted to do what he wanted do he wanted to leave house amen so he left the house amen the very next day me and my wife we we go to bed and I started thinking well how come I ain't worried and you know the first thing that the devil told me because you don't care and your heart is cold your heart has gotten so cold that you don't love him amen he kept telling me all these things and you know what he almost had me convinced but at my darkest hour he came on the scene Jesus came on the scene said your heart isn't hardened but what you are experiencing it's a piece that passes all understand that was real that day on God it's all real or it's nothing amen amen either this message becomes real or I want nothing that's that's what I told God when I was a young man brothers and sisters and maybe I was out of my mind but I was so I knew that if I didn't change things that weren't good were going to get a hold of me amen amen and you know what happened I told God I said Lord I didn't know much about God I said Change Me or Leave Me This Way you never talk to God that way cuz he changed me amen now watch what he says brother brandom says that we're here for a purpose and then he goes on to tell us this and I hope you believe it with all in your heart brother brandom says that if we are here for a purpose then there is nothing you know what nothing is nothing can destroy us until God's purpose is fulfilled so we can walk out there and know that we're here for a purpose there ain't no cancer going to take me there ain't no car accident going to take me there ain't no sickness going to take me until his purpose is fulfilled me say Amen Church am if we can take that with us tonight close our Bible and go home and thank God for this Pur amen amen watch what he says so brother brandom says amen amen until that purpose of God has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartaches Sorrows we go through all of these are reasons and there is a reason for it don't ever let the devil tell you that because he tells you you're not living right and that is why something is happening in your home that's a lie that's a lie cuz I'm going to prove to you that it's the contrary Brothers I'm taking what this prophet of God said amen amen remember what he told us there's a reason for all these things amen if sickness has fa in your family there's a reason for it and let me tell you something I'm not going going to pray and say God amen amen make a way and may this go away that I will never feel it again no but you need to ask God change me to meet the circumstances that I'm in that was placed in your in your life for a for a for a reason don't ask God to take it away if he put it there tell him help me mold me to overcoming this situation we always want God open the door Lord open the door Lord he puts you in that situation cuz you need it and from this day on ask God to help you overcome in that situation now watch this in the message the L book of I'm going as fast as I can amen amen you know I'm like an old car it takes me a while to warm up but when I but but when I warm up it's going to take me a long time to stop you know I I I told the church a while back I said if God could do this to a 65y old man what can he do to you that's 20 years old that's 30 years old amen oh 30 years old oh I'm want to preach again tomorrow amen when's the last time you preached no brothers God can give an old man like me a message after a message after a message he can give it to you too on the message the Lamb's Book of Life preached in 1956 paragraph 153 I hope you're believing this not because I'm saying it but because brother brandom said it and I don't care what the what the people on YouTube say I want to stay with this Prophet till the day I die I'm too old to change and there's one thing that that God has proven in my life it's not you that got a hold of God it's God got a hold of you because many times God honors your sincerity don't ever tell me whether you're a preacher you're a deacon amen you're just a church member don't ever tell me that at one time of your life you wanted to give up because you're looking at somebody that has wanted to give up many times amen but you know he said you're not a holding you're you're not holding on to yourself he said I'm holding on to you and you ain't going to let go I say you ain't going to let go amen amen you know you know you know you know you know sometimes sometimes you know I'm thinking but I don't say anything I don't even say these things to my wife but God is real and so and so you know I'm trying to make an excuse I'm getting older my knees are getting wore out and I start figuring out this in my mind say you know what I'm going to retire I want to retire you know I came into the message almost 40 years ago I try to justify myself I've been in this message a long time and I'm getting older so I'm want to retire so you know what amen I step up to the pulit and before I go to the pit you know I feel like a balloon and then God goes brother random says says ministers don't retire he said ministers don't retire you know what I did I said scrap that plant amen now watch this brother Brom says on this message he says he makes no mistakes you might think that you're a mistake but God makes no mistakes I believe this Prophet was a voice of God to me and you it was God telling you he never made a mistake when he chose you watch brothers are you ready are you ready for this he makes no mistakes so next time the devil tells you something God makes no mistakes God didn't make a mistake watch what he says he he wouldn't bring you in are you ready if you wasn't worthy sometimes we we walk with our head down like this oh Lord I'm not worthy he just told you you were worthy from now on I am worthy that this is my purpose to recognize that I am a Son of God and he told me I am [Music] worthy and the prophet of God says and he knows your heart that's right he knows what you are he knows all about you still calls you worthy he still calls you worthy he knows your motives amen and you're still worthy my there are traps all along the road sure the devil will cause you to stumble and you say I didn't mean to do that God you know it brother brandom said but you're still perfect the human mind cannot understand that but you know it's not you it's him it's him tonight when you leave Brothers don't look in the in in the mirror in the natural mirror look at God's word this message was revealed to us by a prophet that came to tell a people that you are perfect and you are worthy and that God would have never called you if you weren't worthy amen amen notice here he says because there's a perfect blood offered for you every day and a bleeding sacrifice hanging Before the Throne of Almighty God that's right now how did you get in there God by forn knowledge you didn't get in this church because somebody called you you got in here because it was the will of God it was the will of God amen amen amen on the message Victory Day preacher 1963 paragraph 177 don't you just love the message we're supposed to identify with it so along went Abraham and he finally come he said then you see being so loyal he said Abraham was so loyal he says more loyal more testings so if you don't want testing stay home but the more loyal you are the more testing you're going get see the devil won't tell you that he'll always tell you that you're doing something wrong but God through this Prophet told us the more loyal you are the more testings you're going to get we're here for a purpose that you may know who you are tonight you're here for a specific reason but until you know what God thinks about you you never come to realize who you are brother amen amen paragraph 178 brother R says remember when God has counted you worthy when you have a test how many of us have had tests come on brothers amen there's only there's only half of you listen there's only half of you that raise your hand so you are the ones that are loyal those of you that didn't raise your hand you ain't loyal that's what brother said I've had a now who's had a who's had a test everybody raises their hand because we're loyal brothers and that's why problems and testings come and brother and brother Bram said when you have a test now don't fail this don't fail to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God has found you favor with God you have found favor with God when you're going through a test when's the last time the devil told you that oh Brothers he he he points all the fingers at you you didn't you didn't hear a tape yesterday oh you didn't read your Bible Brothers don't you remember that the Bible says that he died for you while you were a sinner amen amen he says and God believes God believes that you can stand the test it's you that don't believe it but God believes in you I hope we're learning a little bit of watch what he says you remember he did that same thing to job Brothers you know the sad thing can I have five minutes I I'll tell the church the other day brother I give him a secret said you said five minutes you half an hour I said because it's 5 minutes like in football time you know every time there's a foul they stop the clock and they stopped the clock and they I thought you said it was 5 minutes it was half an hour ago so brother get ready to stop the clock so we so we understand so so we understand that sometimes we forget what we were called for we're here not only with a purpose but for a purpose you remember brother brand mentioned several characters in The Bible and one of my favorite was always been shamgar and brother brandham says you know that shamgar he had the right to everything yet yet he had got scared so every season Once he he picked up his Harvest you remember man said you know what would happen now he became afraid see and it's usually your fear that's going to destroy the things that you are more afraid of are the things that are going to come upon you and you know what happened brother says those Philistines would come year after year after year Shamar had had all everything ready then the Philistines would come and take everything he'd go back in there brother M say he'd go back to his house and his wife his her dress was all tore the little babies didn't have no shoes on but brother ain't God ain't never going to change your situation until you find your purpose and know who you who you are and when you start claiming your god-given rights amen amen and now the next Harvest came but this time something had happened to Shamar I remember Brothers why I can see that he gets up that night he goes in the morning the Philistines are going to come same situation every but I can see him he's going through the Bible he's going through the message amen amen and then he finds out I'm an Israelite amen amen I've been circumcised now all the rights all his god-given rights were there all he had to do was take those things and put them in action amen when the devil came and said amen he's going to take it away from you no shamgar said now it's different now I read the quotes now I know who I am now I know that I'm worthy now I know he didn't make a mistake when he called me problem isn't with God it's with me I need to take him at his word brothers and sisters he grabbed that stick first Philistine they got there said who wants to die first so you don't see the others die amen what was the difference he realized he was predestinated for a [Applause] [Music] purpose notice here notice here I'm going to close cuz I got to close amen amen you know it's like when you go to somebody's house and you feel very welcome the brother saying brother Frank still ain't gone well you bringing the coffee and that's right you want me to go hey man it's the same thing brother you make me so feel but we can preach at 12:00 amen when you make somebody feel at home you make God feel at home this is what you're going to get you just don't want to leave amen amen now I'll find a place to close now the Bible tells us in Matthew 4 which which you don't just to save time the Bible tells us that again the devil taken Jesus up into a high exceedingly Mountain High mountain and he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them I I want you to hear me out the devil is not ever going to show you the bad side of town he showed Jesus all the glory amen amen he won't he won't take he take you to Scot but he won't take you to South chel on Amen is that right amen amen he'll take you where you see all the nice things but he'll never take you where the drug addicts are and the prostitutes are and the broken homes are he'll never take you there brothers and sisters I'm here to tell you he'll only show you the Glorious part of these things brothers and sisters but I'll tell you one thing tonight I believe God has done something in our hearts I believe that even though it's for a few minutes I believe you've understood what God thinks of you there's no mistakes God never made a mistake with you Brothers God never made a mistake I will tell you something you tell and stick that in the devil's face God did not make a mistake brother brandham said says one day there was a man that was in desperation he went out in the field and there he prayed and there he prayed until God changed his life and you know what he did he went and took a a steak and he stuck it in the ground as a memorial where he had died and God had changed him and brother brandham said next time that that devil tells you that you are not worthy that you are a sinner that he tried to put all these complexes on you you bring him back to that steak and you tell that devil you see that steak there was with God changed me it settled it by one sacrifice he has perfected me forever come on church it's time that you draw a steak and put it in the ground and tell the devil that is a memorial that God God that day God Has Changed me bring him back to that amen amen Brothers there was a little saying that I wanted you to listen to tonight if the musicians would come take this home with you it's not who you are that holds you back it's who you think you're not it's who you think you're not that is what holds you back you go through life oh this is not what I am this is not what I am no no this evening evening you know exactly who you are and you know exactly what God thinks of you don't take the devil's lie anymore Brothers brother brandham said if you'll stand with me as I read this quote hallelu tonight I hope that this you know I just I I I'm just not used to on watch here brother said there's something within us it's a fire that's burning a light that's been lit by God and no Breeze can blow it out there's no cold spells in the church there's no indifference among people no persecution of the world that can blow out a flame that God has lit amen [Music] if somebody can talk you into this message somebody someday will talk you out of the message but if God has lit your fire there ain't no devil in hell is going to put it out no persecution of the world can blow out of flame that God has lit for is God's purpose that he torch the light of Freedom the light of Freedom will burn until the coming of the Lord if there was ever a time that we should give God the glory is now if there was ever a time that we should say God know talk to me tonight I know those quotes were for me tonight this is a time that you are to tell god Set Me On [Music] Fire no one or nothing or no circumstances will be able to blow that light out [Music] I love brother brandom said it's the light of the freedom the light of freedom and that's what we need to do is God give God the freedom come to church and give God the Freedom Express to him that you love him don't come as a church come as individuals worship God in your own way and tell God Open My Heart Lord Heart Lord change it can be done tonight if you'll let [Music] him and all powers can blow it out they will only make it burn brighter as they blow it's been proven Through the Ages that persecution strengthen the church everything that the devil has told you it's a lie take these quotes and shove them in his [Music] face I'm going to make your life miserable do whatever you want do whatever you want God has spoke to me tonight he told me I was worthy maybe some of you tonight didn't feel worthy before you came maybe one of you maybe had some words with your wife or with your sons maybe you even were had a little bad bad attitude maybe maybe some of you have said God why doesn't this circumstance of my life change you know what I want to do ask God what do you want me to do for you no no amen amen

God has permitted in your life there's no need to run as God to show you why he put you in that situation Brothers it it's happened to me before brother when I've cried out to God I said God I can't take this I can't take what's going on I've served you I try to be as faithful I'm not the perfect one but why have you permitted this in my life and I've cried brother I've cried my grace is sufficient I've sent that purpose into your life cuz I know that you'll overcome that purpose is in your life because it's going to make you a better man it's going to show you things it's going to show you things that you've never known before that's why God does these things brothers and sisters I don't know about you but don't you love God and my prayer tonight is don't ever forget you have
