all once again uh I know when Wednesday I spoke and I explained a little of how I was on a bit of a vacation just being humorous and to be humorous again when you get off of vacation it's time to worken so we're we're happy to be here this evening uh God bless you all each and every one of you uh we want to thank the Lord for this opportunity and also our pastor for the opportunity to speak to all this evening you may be seated I just want to speak for a few moments and I don't know if this will obstruct the message tonight or not but uh I I witnessed a funeral this morning of our precious brother Ruben I believe the majority of us if not all of us know him and and you know did it did something in me uh when when you when you can identify with somebody when you've been through similar struggles with somebody and and and you just see how people's lives turn out this is a youth service and I just got to thinking as I was watching the funeral how important each and every one of us are and the things that the Lord lets us go through you know sometimes you go through things and on one end of the line when you see someone else going through what you went through you tend to feel for them you want to pray for them your heart goes out to the person and then on the other end the person that's going through it you know there's examples throughout the church people that have had marital problems people that have had drug addiction problems all kinds of problems and then you say Lord I've seen you did something in her I've seen you did something in that brother Lord can you do something in me so are our testimonies are so valuable in the eyes of the Lord and it was it just touched my heart this morning and it's also good to hear from my brother Mendoza uh that his father got out I'm sure we were all praying for his father you know we we went to see his father uh after service last week uh brother Jose S Michael and myself uh just a friendly visit of love and we had a good time a lot of laughs and and we had the opportunity to pray for the brother that God would restore his health and something interesting happened while we were at the hospital I remember as we were going in we were in the elevator and we seen a lady that was in there and I think Michael myself and brother josea we're we're pretty social guys we we tried to kind of talk and make conversation with this woman there and and person she seemed kind of rude on the phone ignoring us but something said I don't know maybe she's going through something intense well we went to see our brother the Mendoza family and then as we left we're going down the down the hallway this uh this woman stops US and I said I think that's that woman that was in the elevator and I just said that inside of myself and and she stopped us I believe her words were are you guys Christians we didn't I don't think we were too dressed up to look like Christians but if we're the light of the world There's Something That We're reflecting there's something we should be reflecting that's why even in the way our young sisters and our young Brothers dress though you might want to look like the newest trends and Fashions it's just so important to uphold that Christian uh uh that Christianity about yourself but she asked are you guys Christians caught me off guard and and said yes and she started asking us for our favorite scripture and as we started answering and having a conversation with her you could tell something was wrong till she opened up and she was there or she finally confessed the reason why she was there she was on her way back home to Utah and she said the last step before boarding the plane her daughter had a I believe it was a seizure and they couldn't take her so they rushed her to the hospital and she showed us the video of this young girl 11-year-old 11year old baby all caged up because now she was mumbling and grumbling launching herself on the walls andc ing up and down like insane this sister she hadn't slept for I think over 24 hours you could tell she would just go in and out of her thoughts and I believe it was Brother s that that asked her sister well would you like for us to pray for your daughter and he would ask her I think two or three times to to to to get what is it that she wanted from her heart she agreed and we went ahead and prayed right there at that moment you know one never knows what God has in line for you know it it becomes more of a reality to me how we should always be prepared at every moment I can't imagine veterans like brother Sal and brother brother Tanis always at the disposition to pray for somebody to to speak to somebody to evangelize to somebody it was such a lesson for me me to always be ready you never know what the world is going through you never know how the Satan's tormenting them and this woman she wasn't just any woman she knew her word so that's why she knew there was something in these three men and I'd like to add her to my prayers this evening that God would restore her daughter and just as we prayed for her that night that with that Miracle she can get closer to God so before we begin if You' please stand and bow your heads as we pray Lord heavely father we thank you Lord for another day Lord I just at this moment want to place our sister saf and her daughter Shila sh just once again Lord ask you that you would do the miracle in that sweet baby that that torturous devil from hell would be cast out of her father I I come before you with joining the faith of all our Saints tonight father if if our brother Ramiro's father healed I know this little Shila could heal so father though we don't don't know them as Christians we love them so we place her in her daughter in your hands that your Holy Ghost can perform the miracle in her and also for tonight Lord I ask you to just help me speak a few words to the youth tonight a few words of encouragement for for them this evening for they are the future generation Lord that will carry this baton carry this word and carry this message Lord for we know this is the realest thing there is the testimonies are endless father and though the world will point and mock though they'll make fun of these youth though they'll talk bad about these youth if your holy ghost power can give them a personal experience an unexplainable experience that that that they just know that they know that it comes from God and God Alone it doesn't matter what demon would come against them what story of Lies would come against them what power an enemy would try to come in their minds and make them disbelieve they'll say get away from me Satan I've had an experience I've seen my Jesus I've met my Lord and though my eyes tell me one thing my body tells me another thing and my mind wants to tell me another thing my heart and my spirit tell me another thing father I just pray for these youth in this evening and we put them in your hands Lord along with everyone else this evening we give you the honor and glory and bless the reading of your word tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen forgive me for taking so long if you could turn to Matthew 24 and uh for a title this evening uh endurance and as a subtitle restore my joy Matthew 2413 reads but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved you may be seated thank you to all the musicians but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved what a promise I I looked up the synonyms for the word endure and I found the word to remain to Bear trials and to persevere and and and taking this scripture it it talks to us of a timeline a timeline of life and it gives us a responsibility or a job that we must do and lastly it gives us a reward at the end in that timeline it says make it to the end because your responsibility as a Christian young man and young lady is to endure to the end to to to fight until the end because the reward is eternal salvation anybody ever heard of the following Expressions you know just hold on stay stay strong hang in there keep on fighting you know when would somebody tell you that when you think about it when would somebody tell you just keep on fighting when you're in times of difficulty when you're in times of struggle want to say just hang on in there you're in times of anxiety just stay strong just hold on they're telling you so you can keep on fighting because they know they see that there's a prize at the end of the road there's a reward at the end of the fight you know I think there's a a quote out there that that if there's there's something if anything worth uh whatever you want anything worth fighting for whatever you want anything is worth fighting for I believe the brother said it better if it's worth it it's worth fighting for anything that you that you need you desire there's a battle behind it there's a sacrifice behind it there's a fight to get to that end of the road I don't know what greater thing there is than Eternal Salvation And if we fight for all these other things we struggle and sacrifice for our career if we do all we move mountains so we can get married why would we not struggle to the very end for eternal salvation that's the greatest thing God can give you young people you might have seen your parents go through difficult Financial Times difficult personal times and those are part of the sacrifices they're making because they see the end of the road they're willing to fight to the end for that salvation they're setting an example for us of what it is to be an overcomer in the end now Revelation 3:21 says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame you know I I see that I say wow that's that's so awesome I'm not the only one that's overcome but I come from a genealogy it's in my genes in my bloodline of Overcomer after Overcomer that's a Christian trait to be an overcomer to overcome the enemy to overcome all of his darts that he throws at us to know that the Lord is on my side and no matter what weapon is formed against me it will not be successful Jesus was an overcomer Abraham was an overcomer Jacob was an overcomer young person you are an overcomer the blood that's flowing through your veins is the blood of Jesus Christ it's the blood of an overcomer if he didn't lose there in heaven he's not going to lose here on this Earth and if he's living in you you're not going to lose either you're going to be an overcomer but if only we could sit back and overcome without doing anything that's why we said it wouldn't be worth it if it was that way I want to fight for what I earn I want to fight for my seat at the throne I want to feel the satisfaction action of knowing this belongs to me in the message God's provided way for this day brother Brown says they had to fight for every inch of it so we fight for every inch of it it isn't something to be baby and petted around like that young people you're GNA fight so get ready for the battle he says come with the determination come that you're going to stay there until it's over stay there till God answers and he vindicates you know we're not saying you have to come to the Altar and you've got to pray here for 5 8 10 hours straight when you come to the altar with an honest heart and you're praying from the deepest part of your heart you're praying here at the altar you're praying until Faith inside of you is making the answer to what you're asking for make it so real to you that's what faith is it it makes it real to you to where if you open your eyes you can see it and touch it right there in front of you and because your faith is so high so high it it you open your eyes you're not healed at that moment you weren't given what you're asking for at that moment but faith has already told you that it's real that it's already in your hands Faith already seen it down the line in the future Faith already knows that it's there waiting for you that's why it's just as real for you at that moment at the altar when you fight for it there at the altar coming with a determination staying until it's over so that your own faith can vindicate the answer Brown says a man that believes in God can see the presence of God can feel the presence of God sense the presence of God knows he's here he's here to answer everything that he made a promise for in that day then you'll cry till you get it and hold on to it don't leave if you have to stay all day and night he wants you to cry out to it till the promise is Vindicated cry out to him until it's so real until you know that you know that you know that nobody can take that from you when you open your eyes and the devil's saying you see what healing your stomach still hurts he died for me already on the cross your your your your your healing is not there yet your son's not there yet your husband's not there yet he don't got to be here right now my faith already told me he's going to be here get away from me Satan in the message the marriage of the Lamb the same way it is about Divine Healing God's got the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it if you young people have the courage to accept it but you'll have to fight for every inch of it God's got Amazing Grace to save you and he will do it but you'll have to fight for every inch of the way brother Brown says I've been behind the pulpit going on 31 years and every inch of that has been a fight I'm sure our brother Juanito's been behind the pulpit for more than 31 years our brother tiis has been the same for more than 31 years and if you want to explain your struggles to one of these Elders they'll feel for you they'll have compassion for you but then turn around and ask them some of the fights they've been in so you can see that a Christian is a soldier and it's a constant fight against the enemy brother Brown says but we must fight if we must reign but we find out that the bride has to make herself ready the bride has to make herself ready we all believe we're part of that bride you know I used to think of the Bride when when when I let my imagination just wander and when they say and she gets herself ready and it would look so pretty picking out a dress in the store The Young Bride having these sweet amazing dreams of the husband and the life they're going to live and like almost like a movie running through the flowers in the valley patiently waiting like it says to wear that dress and marry the bridegroom yes there is a bride we are the bride yes there is a dress yes there is a wedding but now I realize that this bride has got to fight is going through battles shedding blood Blood Sweat and Tears getting dirty fighting every step of the way that is getting yourself ready a mental Warfare the spiritual warfare physical Warfare family Warfare all to get in shape to get in condition for the marriage with our King so we can be ready to wear that dress to walk down that aisle but brandham says in the message stand still if God calls you if God calls you young people he intends for you to have he intends for you to have it if he's called you he intends to give you the Holy Ghost if he's called you he intends to give you the new birth there's no doubt about it otherwise he wouldn't have called you but brother Brown says but you'll have to fight for every inch of the way to get it so we won't be strolling down that Valley of roses but we're going to fight battle after battle trial after trial because we're going to earn every step of the way second Timothy 4:7 says Paul speaking here says I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness Apostle Paul says I've fought a good fight he's saying that those fights weren't No Mediocre fights these are strong battles that the Christian goes through to stand for your convictions stand for the word stand for Jesus Christ he says and he finished the race and you know there there goes that fight word again we've been saying fight and fight and fight I looked it up in the Greek to see what it tells me there and it says to literally struggle to compete for a prize there's a prize that I want to contend with an adversary to Endeavor to accomplish something to fight to labor and to fervently strive so young people if you don't get it by now it's time to fight everyone in here seas in Christians has been fighting every step of the way and so it's time for us to fight as young people and you know above all in this scripture Paul says most importantly that he has kept the faith that Faith once delivered to the saints that Faith handed down generation after generation that faith is Satan's been trying so hard to destroy and he's got so many weapons to destroy that faith for the Youth education is getting better video games and movies are getting better ideologies and spiritualities are getting more tremendous even the attack on the message is getting more powerful and who is it attacking not the seasoned veterans that we have in here but the young people that are starting that have just had an experience and I was reading brother brandham and how many times he says even after receiving the Holy Ghost how you struggle and struggle and struggle and I think of the young people you know even after they've been baptized even after receiving the new birth they're so fresh and so tender the devil is just like a roaring line waiting to attack but be strong young people we've come to fight you know that faith is the whole Foundation of Christianity if not for that Faith this Bible might as well be like a a Harry Potter book Harry Pot it might as well be a fairy tale but it's faith that makes it real to the Christian it's the Holy Ghost ghost that gives it life when we open the pages it's the holy ghost that gives it a Vindication in our lives it's the holy ghost that can make this ancient book relevant today how many times do our brother Emanuel preached to us and he can take something so old and so insignificant that God shows them how we're living that right here right now because this is a book that will that has lasted throughout the ages it's lasted throughout eternity because it's the word of God and we need Faith young people you need Faith to believe it you need simple Faith just to even open and read it and we're going to need Faith to fight we're going to need Faith to reach the end of the journey I I want some of that Pentecostal faith not that denominational false Pentecostal Faith but I want some of that book of Acts Pentecostal faith where I can cry out to the Lord father I want a Pentecostal Faith experience I want to be able to cry I want to shout unto you I want to dance I want to speak in tongues however God will manifest himself to you however he'll show himself in you you're going to need that Holy Ghost experience you're going to need that experience of Faith young person because you're going to have to build upon that and build upon that trial after trial adding to that faith and adding to that faith I'm going to need that Faith to fight every step of the way know we see many things with these carnal eyes and and there's such a stumbling block for us you know we we suffer afflictions In the Flesh some of which they even get us doubting and it's going to happen over and over and over again and and when I see know young people people like my brother Reuben and then it makes me look in the mirror of my life how many times did I fall over and over and over again but you know the Lord was always there to pick me up and you know sometimes it's a difference how you fall sometimes you fall from a three-step stair like this right here and you just sprain your ankle a little bit but sometimes you fall from a 20 foot ladder and you break your hip and there's the enemy getting at you once again you see you see what you were doing you see the condition you're in now you shouldn't have been playing Church you shouldn't have been messing around with those things you shouldn't have been getting into those websites now you've crossed the line now you've gone too far there's no more hope you've lost your salvation lies of the devil brother brandom says in the message questions and answers he's trying to make you feel like because you're backsliding that you're lost there's no hope that this is it for you brother BR says backsliding is not lost I want somebody to tell me where backsliding is lost prove it in the Bible backslider is is not lost he's just out of Fellowship that's so tremendous to me Israel backslid but they were never they never lost their Covenant they just lost their praises and their Joy David lost the joy of his salvation but he never lost his salvation he never said restore unto me my salvation but restore unto me the joy of my salvation you know we've all heard that word backslider and we've said and we've heard oh yeah that sister unfortunately she's a backslider though the brother he's kind of backsliding right now you know that we we've all heard that that no but that that that it's just the brother's gotten out of Fellowship not out of fellowship with the church no not that no fellow out of fellowship with Christ maybe there's a young person here today might be saying in their mind or in their heart probably their brains already starting to work they're thinking well brother Marcos I'm I'm always in Fellowship I've never I don't never miss service I don't never miss a tape night I haven't missed a single Jericho Camp since we started I'm always in Fellowship the question is but are you in fellowship with God that is the difference you can come to tape night you can come to Friday night and fulfill your posted duty but when you're at home all alone when it's just you and God are you in fellowship with God are you having a a relationship with God do you have a prayer life with God you know I've made the mistake many times to describe a backslider so negatively to where I might as well call them and label them lost but brother Bram said they're not lost that's still my brother brother and my sister he's just backsliding young person maybe you're backsliding tonight maybe you're just going through the motions tonight but you're still a son and daughter of God there's still Grace there's still Mercy you are still a son and daughter of God get get back in connection with God get back in fellowship with god brother brand says in questions and answers yes you've not sinned my friend you've not sinned so far in God to where you could not be restored whatever sins you haven't told Mama and Daddy you have not sinned so far where you cannot be restored if you sinned so far that you could not be restored here's the key you'd never want to be restored says see you see but as long as there's something dealing with your heart you're still in the line of restoration I'm reminded of our sister Flo when she got baptized I don't know the timeline of her life but from looking at her I thought you know she was right with the Lord and I don't know how many young people might be in that condition maybe you know you were backsliding right now but if something's pulling at your heart even though you don't say it with your mouth even though you don't raise your hand in church even though you never say Amen but something's tugging at your heart then you're still in line for restoration it's in our heart you don't want to be the way that you you don't want to be that way or you wouldn't ask this question because this was a question that was asked if she could still be saved because of the backsliding condition that she was in so you wouldn't ask this question that itself is a proof that God is still dealing with you if you care if if something is just tugging at you that's proof that God is still dealing with you you've probably gotten nervous probably Satan telling you that you can't be restored he's lying and he certainly is we want to take the mask off the devil tonight tell them stop lying to these young people they've been dedicated to the lord they're here serving you in their post of Duty and if they feel that pole father restore them tonight don't let don't let your let the enemy build a callous around your heart build this big brick wall around your heart remember Jesus is at the door knocking and he's just not knocking at everybody's door he's knocking at the doors of those that will open the door he came for the whole world but the whole world will not accept him so he's not going to waste his time on those that won't open the door he's been knocking at your door patiently waiting that you'll open the door to him you know sometimes you might get more obsessed for your career than Jesus more obsessed for your boyfriend and a girlfriend than Jesus but he's still knocking he's going to keep on knocking because he knows that one day you're going to open that door he knocked before and that's when you opened it that's why you got baptized he knocked before and that's why you received the new birth he's knocked before and that's why you received the Holy Ghost but maybe your backlit in maybe I've fallen maybe I did something I'm not supposed to do and it's slowly putting me in a hole getting me out of Fellowship maybe even making me bitter maybe making me scared but Jesus Christ don't care about that he's going to keep on knocking and keep on knocking because if you're a Son of God if you're a daughter of God he knows sooner or later you're going to open that door and invite him back in if You' all please stand we're going to be Clos in the message the Ephesians Church age brother BR says but where's that first love you once had he says uhhuh where's that Joy you used to have you know when I first got baptized and I first had my experience I was early to church every Sunday I had this joy and this glow about me every day I couldn't wait to be asked to be used in the church you know that first love joy brother Brown says where's that Joy you used to have as David once cried oh Lord restore to me the joy of my salvation where's them all night prayer meetings young person when's the last time you've come to the altar just to pray when's the last time you came early to service just to come here and pray brother BR said where's all them all night prayer meetings and the tears on your cheek how long has it been since he's touched you and you can't control yourself and you just let the tears flow from you let his holy spirit just bathe you says my goodness even the Bible's got Dusty and cobwebs on it he said we need to get back to our first love back to Pentecost like David says in Psalms create in me a clean heart oh God renew a spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation Revelation 2 nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love maybe that's you tonight who's left your first love he says remember therefore from whence Thou Art Fallen we're from Heavenly places we're from a Heavenly Kingdom maybe we got a rocked and knocked us down real quick but it says repent and do those first Works go find where you left Jesus go find where you stopped serving him like you used to serve him I'm hurt because someone did this or that to me I'm hurt because I didn't end up with this person or end up dating that person I'm hurt because I got embarrassed whatever it might be young person go back to that point in time recognize that it was Satan trying to knock you down go back to those first works of love you used to have brother brandham says in condemnation by representation you might have left him at [Music] baptism you might have left him at the Holy Ghost you might have left him somewhere else wherever you left him don't take this Hy breing Church stuff there's one to represent you represent you for salvation you don't have to be a sinner you don't have to be that you are if you are God don't hold you responsible for being a sinner he won't hold you responsible from now on but he's going to hold you responsible if you reject this he's not going to hold you responsible because that may be in the past that you didn't know any different from water baptism or from receiving the holy ghost or the power of God might not hold you responsible for that you might not have heard of it before but from here on you know better so come back to the word come back to God so you close your eyes brother come back to the word come back to God you might have left him at baptism you left him at the Holy Ghost you left him a year ago or 10 years ago but he's right there waiting he's waiting for you to come back and he's going to take you forward
