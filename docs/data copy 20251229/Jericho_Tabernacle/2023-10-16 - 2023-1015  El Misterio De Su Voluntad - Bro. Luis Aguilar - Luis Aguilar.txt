get up in the morning and you say we're going to church it's something beautiful when you wake up on a Sunday morning it feels good that when you get up when as soon as you rest when you come from work but when it's a Sunday morning you dress the best way that you can you try to come as early as you [Music] can because one can feel that God will pour out himself in and that Sunday morning you love the Lord amen be so kind to open your Bibles to the book of Ephesians chapter 1 and I would like to thank our pastor for always having that trust than us am may God continue to bless our pastor in Fort Collins uh last Sunday last week we were in Fort Collins [Music] Colorado me and our our pastor went to go support the dedicational service of our uh brother Tito Mora and we would like to congratulate them and the church as well for that accomplishment that they were able to have on behalf of the Lord I believe that we're able to understand what they now feel so we hope that God continues to bless them and their Pastor amen before we read the the scripture let's bow our heads let's draw close to the author of the word our Lord Heavenly Father this morning we come before your presence father we have a thought that you've given us so help us to express that thought and the way that you gave it help us to bring it in the way so the people can understand and when we leave this place we are able to love each other we pray that you break every chain that is binding your people and we rebuke every spirit that is contrary to your word and may your angels encamp around this place because your word will be voiced this morning Lord we come before you with all of our trust not by our merits but by the revelation of your beloved Son our Lord Jesus Christ that he died for us and now we're worthy we ask for all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen epes Ephesians 1:4 according as he has chosen according he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his well amen you may be seated Brothers this morning if we can give a title to our thought I would like to call it the mystery of his will now that word mystery is something that is very out understanding and I believe that the people uh they really pay close attention to the Mysteries and I think that's something that's very good but I also believe that the simpleness of the word will bring us the revelation of those Mysteries if we go to that very same chapter chap if you can have your Bibles open we'll be reading several scriptures once again we'll be reading verse five having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to to the good pleasure of his well so the word is now telling us that he predestinated us the word predestinate uh the prophet says it in a very simple way it's not that he chooses this one and this one and not this one and not this one but he sent his only begotten son to the entire world so that who whoever believeth in him shall not perish but will be saved but predestination is that he chose us but then we chose him back amen we chose him when did where did we choose him did we choose him here on the earth we chose him back then when thought about us and then he shaped us and and then he said you're going to choose me do you want to choose me because I will choose you and did you choose you did then it says unto the adoption of his children so what is adoption is to be placed as a child in other words it's God giving you the entire load in other words your signature is just as good as the father's amen amen when I have my son and I believe that you know my son right imagine I go to my house and I say Lucas me and the pastor are going to color I want you to take take care of this entire house make sure that all the lights are turned off give water the plants imagine what what is Lucas gon to say he's going to say no no no he doesn't understand yet but he will grow and then he's going to learn amen so the father will see that his son that he's ready amen that is is being adopted it says according to the good pleasure of his will so the Lord in his good will he chose us so he has a will what is a will it's a desire a heart's desire amen amen Brothers verse seven now in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace verse n having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself now I see two very important things in this one verse I see the mystery of his will and then the last phrase says which he ha purposed in himself so he himself before the foundation of the world he chose us in him self he chose us in himself the mystery of his well it said but it also says having made known unto us so there is a mystery to his will okay so a will means the desire of the heart but then it says the mystery there's a mystery in that desire there's a mystery in what the Lord is Desiring but here the scripture says that he will make known unto us that mystery of his will okay let's go to verse 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together into one all things in Christ both both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him now listen of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will so in him we have an inheritance being predestinated it says according after the counsel of his own will so we're seeing out the mystery of his will and then the counsel of his will amen one is the mystery the other one is the counsel or the plan I have some slides if the sisters can help uh show it I'm a I'm a person that doesn't really speak good in English nor in Spanish so I have to go look up the words so the word uh in Spanish that it uses is design plan or purpose which means and the definition is is purpose intention or plan to make something come to pass so the synonyms for the word design is plan is thought plan or a final outcome so when I read the word uh design or counsel I can substitute them I can put there the thought of his will the purpose of his will the plan of his will and then in English it doesn't use the word plan or design it says the word counsel and I said that's really tremendous so the definition of the word counsel which is a advice given a consultation and then here's something tremendous uh a lawyer that represents someone else or a group at a court setting and then here are the synonyms recommendations ideas attorney or a Defender so when I read that it says the plan of his will the counil of his will and in English the word that he uses in that translation says the counsel of his will so the Lord had counsel in his his own will in himself he had a thought and he thought in each and every one of us every one of us after the counsel of his will now remember what is that word uh design mean it's a plan it's a thought so his will had a had a thinking and thought about us to choose us and then it also says that it's an attorney he's a an advocate a Defender and I think that's very tremendous because that's exactly what I need I need an advocate because we uh make mistakes every day we think we're doing a service to God when we're not doing a service for God but in first John it says it says my little children these things write I unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father who is it it's Jesus Christ he's our Advocate we cannot advocate for ourselves David Henry or John Henry I don't remember the name of the man David or John Henry quickly when he dreamt that he went into God's presence and the Lord asked him did you ever lie there here in in our conscience of our own testimony he answered yes Lord I did did you ever steal yeah yes Lord I did did you ever do this or that well yes Lord I did well I was an evangelist I was such and such in the church I had this position in the church that won't help you here God answered with that great voice so then his face fell and then brother Adam says he was expecting for God to send him to hell but then the advocate came the defender came the Lord Jesus Christ came he said yes Lord he did all these things he failed in every point but he stood for me so I'll stand for him he's our Advocate he's our Defender but you have to stand for him today not tomorrow not the next week but today you have to make your stand for him amen Brothers he's our Advocate these words are very tremendous the counsel of his will the mystery of his will I believe that every mystery propeta William Mar Bram that has been reveal has been revealed by the prophet William Mar and Bram the word councel in Greek which is U it means to call to one side it's a decision and so Council in Greek means called to one side so the Lord in his councel called you to be on his side the word counsel in Hebrew it's a confidential discussion it's a secret or a plan it's a circle of confidants or counsel so it's a secret his will is a secret I want you to follow me because I'm heading somewhere so what is his plan what is his counsel his thinking what is it that he wants what is his mystery let's go to the book of Isaiah verse 46 forgive me chapter 46 verse 9 it says remember the former things of old so here the scripture is telling us one thing it says remember the former things of old so now in Deuteronomy 327 that's what the exactly the Bible says it says remember the days days of old consider the years of many generations ask thy father and he will show thee thy elders and they will tell thee so the word here in Isaiah it says remember the former things of old and in Deuteronomy it says it says go ask your father and he will show you what the Lord Has Done ask your elders and they will tell you how the Lord brought us through the Red Sea how the water came out of the rock they will tell you but remember those times because sometimes we begin to forget where God brought us out of that's why we have our parents that's why we have the elders so they can remind us remember where God brought us out of how God showed this how there was a pillar of fire and he brought us out of the Wilderness we thank God for the fathers the spiritual fathers the elders am and then it keeps saying here it gets more tremendous it says I am God not that I was God or I will be God it says I am God and there is none else and there is none like me so uh your job can be your God your money can be your God everything else can be your God but God is telling us that I am God and there is no none else and there is none like me verse 10 now declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done now notice this saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure so God is tremendous amen it says my counsel my plan my thinking shall endure and I will be or I will do all my pleasure because he's God he can do whatever he wants amen let him do whatever he wants with us the counsel of his will the mystery of his will my counsel shall endure and I will do all my pleasure says calling a ravenous bird from the East the man that executed my counsel from a far country so now the Lord in his thinking he called the man from a far contr he called because it was the purpose of his will he called every one of you some from from Chihuahua from wherever you were but he called you from a far country because he had a counsel he had a thought there is a mystery in his will and no one knows the mystery of his will how God called this person and now this person doesn't want anything to do but the word says and says the man that executed my counsel from a far country yay I have spoken it and also will also bring it to pass I have purposed it I will also do [Music] it God's word is so beautiful amen his counsel says yay I have spoken he spoke to us because none comes onto the father but first the the the father calls you first you never saw God is God seeking you our nature runs away from God from the word from the right things and when God calls us he spoke to us and then it says and I will bring it to pass sometimes we don't want to come but God will make us come because we're his children you don't want to be here by our own nature we don't want to be here but our soul wants to be here says y I have purposed it I will also do it God's counsel is so beautiful amen let's go to the Book of Daniel chter 4 verse 35 here we can see that there's a tremendous story A King by the name of Nebuchadnezzar a tremendous man and he had a prophet with him by the name of Daniel so one morning this King he rose was up in the morning he went to get his cup of coffee he brushed his teeth so opening the big doors of his bedroom he saw his entire Kingdom he had his black coffee in his hand he says he says what what a great king I am what a great Kingdom I have he took a sip of coffee and then a curse came he became like a beast of the field he was there eating off of the off of the field like a beast amen brothers and then time passed to that spirit of the Beast or that cursed came off of him so now he came back to his right mind he got up now let's read what this King said verse 35 and all the inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what do thou doest thou so now this King had a revelation he says I'm barely recognizing that the Lord is the Lord over over everyone no one no one can stay his hand he does and undo he moves and then removes he places he heals he does everything he God he sends the plagues he removes the plagues he does everything this King realized that he was not King he real that he was a worm he thought he was the greatest King in all the Earth but God humiliated him such a humble way he made him as a beast of the field and God said I am King you're not King I am King and then he realized Sayes none can say his hands and say unto God what what doest thou have you have you ever asked God one time what are you doing why is this happening why is this happening to me what are you doing what are you doing it's the mystery of his will the counsel of his will am amen brothers let's go to the book of Acts you love the Lord we can see in the book of Acts chapter 10 that there was a man whose name was Cornelius this man was a centurion a Godly Man fearful of God the tremendous thing it wasn't just him but it was all of his household that's what we desire is that right I don't want to be the only one that's Godly and fearful of God I want my entire household now this man we can preach series of messages about this subject with that same phrase Godly and fearful of God with all of his household amen brothers that did gave a lot of arms to his people and would always pray to God so we saw that this man was always praying if we can say like this this man had his house in order then we see that he had a vision an angel came and spoke to him how we also want that God speaks to us we want God to speak to us but we must pray always and to be right with God so that God then can speak to us he had a vision an angel spoke to him says go have Peter come to you not only did the angel tell him who he was the angel also said where he lived he says he loded just with one Simon a Tanner he says whose house is by the seaside because God never messes up he never fails he always hits the target that's why brother brandom when the uh anointing would come upon him the angel right next to him it it would say you live in such a place your address is this and this is that true and now this Angel gave Peter's address he says he lives with this by in a house by the seaside and then Peter in that same time frame he had an ecstasy that's what the Bible says so the Bible says that he he was in a trance and he he was uh fasting so he saw a curtain or a sheet with the four points that were hanging how do you say that word quadros he saw uh four-footed Beast reptiles and birds of the of the sky what a strange Vision he had he saw a curtain the Four Corners were hanging imagine when we grab a credit and then I have two sides brother Lis has the other two sides so in that curtain there was animals there was lions tigers a little kitten there was reptiles there was iguanas is that right there was everything there was Birds there and and the voice said unto Peter it says arise says Peter kill and eat but Peter said Lord no not so no one can tell him what to what to do he said no brother Ram says that Peter being a Jew he had such a a strict lifestyle and Peter said not so Lord for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean and the voice spake unto him again the second time says what God hath cleansed that can not call thou uncommon it's the Myster of his will no one can say to the Lord what are you doing so then the voice spoke to him a third time because every Vision has to be perfect so when those men came and took Peter to Cornelius because Peter had the germ just like Philip had the germ the angel couldn't be the one that went to Cornelius oh the the angel couldn't go to the Ethiopian man it had to be Phillip it had to be a man so when Peter knocked at cornelius's house I hope that you're following me Peter's a Jew Cornelius was a gentile the Jews and Gentiles would not intermingle there was no kind of discussion there was racism that's when when Jesus went with the Samaritan woman and Jesus said to the Samaritan give me to drink and the Samaritan woman was shocked he says because you and I we don't speak there's difference there's racism between Jews Gentiles and Samaritans it's the mystery of his will and when Jesus commissioned his disciples he sent them first to the Jews not to the Gentiles not to the Samaritan only to the Jews because Jesus came to his own he came to the Jews and the Jews rejected him and they crucified him and said that his blood let it be upon us and our children imagine when you kill someone the blood is on your hands and now those Jews let's said that let his blood be upon us and the tremendous thing they said is and also upon our children they didn't know what they said they they rejected and crucified him so so then he got up and now we're here at this setting and now Cornelius looking at Peter he fell down at Peter's feet and began to worship Him and Peter says arise I am also a man now the scripture says that there was many there in the household there was many Gentiles in Acts 10:28 Peter says this unto the Gentiles to cornelius's house says you know how that it is an an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or come onto one of another Nation so here he says in Spanish uh that's something that is an Abomination it's not something that's pretty it's something horrible that a Jew would uh have keep company or to draw close to one that is of another Nation a gentile now notice what the Bible says but God has showed me that that I should call not any man common or unclean so when he saw that vision with that sheet that had a lot of beasts in that sheet he says uh kill and eat he said Lord I can't kill I can't eat something that is unclean whatever God is clean don't call it common because when he died and was crucified at calvary's Cross it was not only for the Jews it was for the entire world because when the temple was there and the curtain was there the Bible and the prophet says that the veil was rent from up to down from top to bottom not from bottom to top but from top to bottom the Gentiles we [Music] had no parts with this had nothing to do with it that's why Peter said it's an unlawful thing a Jew like me to keep company with this house of Gentiles but he said but God has showed me that no man or is common or unclean every man has the chance to get the Holy Ghost Every Man Has the chance to draw close to God not only the Jews it was the Revelation that came to Peter and Peter said how tremendous is this because I saw the father reject a serici women do you remember that scripture he called called her a dog and now I'm at the house of the Gentiles and God said to me whatever God has cleansed don't call it common so now every one of us are cleansed it's us that we call ourselves filthy but God us 10:34 then Peter opened his mouth he now started preaching and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons it doesn't matter then if your father's a pastor or not it doesn't matter if you come from a line of drunks if you come from the line of the message or not God is no respector of persons it doesn't matter what your last name is who you are where you came from what you've done or what you have not done God is no respector person I can imagine then Peter there with his eyes being open shocked then he began to preach the Holy Ghost fell on the Gentiles because when he was there on the day of Pentecost he said go and until you're ued with power he didn't say until when but when they were there in the upper room the Virgin Mary was there she was also there but brother Bram says when they got into one Accord when they got in one Accord they put the doctrinal points to one side and they got in one Accord then they began to make things right then the Holy Ghost fell upon the Jews they were as drunkards because Peter had the keys to the kingdom and he preached he Christ whom ye have crucified is God has made him Christ and Lord now what can we do repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that was a promise for the Jews because Peter had the keys to the kingdom but for the Gentiles it wasn't still set in motion yet because the Jews were still thinking it's only it's only for us but it's not for the Gentiles so when then Peter started to preach and the and the Gentiles began to worship God the spirit began to come in the spirit fell on Cornelius and upon everyone that was in the household they got baptized were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ not in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost because there Peter the prophet says he had the Keys of the Kingdom and he only used it for the Jews and he used it for the Gentiles he opened the kingdom he removed the lock for the Gentiles so that the Gentiles could access the kingdom of God that's what the prophet says we're going to read it amen amen Brothers and then we see so when Peter had ended that Revival and then he left and then the Jews got close to Peter they were hoping to have a meeting with him and in 10:45 it says and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished and many as came with Peter because they still believed that they had to circumcise the flesh but then Paul then came he says it's of the heart it's a change of dispensation so those in the ancient times they it says they came unto Peter and were astonished because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost the Jews were unable to understand because they had no parts it was only the Jews and Peter said just take it up with him no one can say to God what doest thou it's the mystery of his will why did God send Peter because Peter held the keys to the kingdom brother Bram says this is just can put it he says now did you notice Jesus never done that to a gentile nor in presence of a gentile because he forbid his disciples to go to the Gentiles and when the serici woman said to him come have mercy on my daughter he said it's not mean for me to take the children's bread and cast it unto the dogs so then the Lord called her a dog that's very strong but the Gentiles because the bread was not for the Gentiles it was for the Jews so then she understood she said yes Lord yeah I know that's true but the dogs eat the crumbs she uh he said that's great faith if you believed it that way go find it the same way that's all he said to her now notice no vision for her he let her own faith do it okay the son doeth nothing until the fir until he first sees the father do it is that true so in other words he first has to see a vision and then it happens because he won't do anything if first the father tells him what he must do when it was with Lazarus why did Lazarus ra because the prophet said he had a vision that Lazarus would rais then he had the authority he said Lazarus come forth but this woman there was no vision that was for her it was merely her faith that reached Jesus Christ The Vision was not for her but her faith got in either way in other words she said Lord she said I know that I'm not worthy I know that you're not coming for me but either way I'm coming in because I have faith that you will heal my daughter there was the vision and she got in them by her faith when Jesus was going to the house of gyrus why was he going to the house of gyrus because his daughter was dead but Jesus had the vision that she was going to raise that's why he went but the woman with the blood issue there was no vision for her she was not in the plan but her with her faith with her knees she started crawling on her knees she said I know there's no vision for me I know that I'm not in the plan but I have a problem and I need healing and her with her knees she started crawling and she touched the Hem of the Garment of the Lord and she was healed he said virtue has left me she was not in the plan but with her faith she came in in Galatians 3:26 says by all are children of God by faith in Christ Jesus there is no more Jew nor Greek neither Bor or free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus Colossians 1:26 even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made man to his Saints a a mystery that has been hid the mystery of his will now verse 27 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen R Romans 9 Romans 9:14 what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God what if I [Music] say that God answered her prayer but not yours is there any unrighteousness with God let's say that God blessed your brother but not you is God unfair the Apostle Paul answerers says God forbid what I understand with God forbid that neither this way or this way or no way God is Not unfair he's perfect says for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runthe Mercy for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up so who raised up Pharaoh God did God raised Pharaoh from the womb of his mother he raised up Pharaoh just like he raised up Moses and took care of him when he was in the river with all the crocodiles that were there he took also care of pharaoh just like that little fish that swallowed the prophet Jon the Bible says that God prepared that that fish that's very tremendous God spent his time in thinking in a little fish he shaped him he designed him in a very special way we're talking about a little fish and when this little fish was born his little siblings his little cousins it says you're so tiny you're H you're not going to amount to anything you're the slowest of all of us here but God it says that God prepared this little fish for a very special work he began to feed the fish he began to grow and he began to grow he went from being the tiniest he became a big whale and he swallowed the prophet Jonah and if God could think could prepare a little fish what about you them God thinks about you God prepares you for a very special work so that you can have the Holy Ghost in your hearts God prepared you maybe for the entire world you're nothing special for but for God God thought about you he had you in the thinking of his will he had the mystery of his will and that mystery of his will it was you because no one knows whom God chooses that's why it's the mystery of his will No One Ever Knows who is and who isn't that's why it's the mystery of his will but you God thought on you God prepared you for today for you to have the Holy Ghost verse 18 therefore he had mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will harden it so we see that God does whatever he pleases thou will say then unto me why sometimes we reply to God and say why Lord why this and this and this says who are thou oh man for who haveth resisted god let's read it again verse 20 says why says why do you say it on me why Lord why am I sick why this my children my daughter this and that why Lord who art thou that repliest against God shall the thing form say to him that formed it why H has Thou made me thus why did you make me this way Lord can can the clay say to the Potter change me I don't want to be like this have not the Potter power over the clay of the same LP to make now notice the same lump to make one vessel onto honor and another onto dishonor now notice what verse 22 says what if it's more tremendous in Spanish it says and it says what what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with long suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction now notice if you can please stand and that he make known The Riches of his glory how it's the mystery of his will it says we read in Colossians where it says to whom God wanted to make known The Riches of his glory this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory okay now notice now verse 23 and that he might make known the riches of his glory he says he showed them on the vessels of Mercy which he had aord prepared unto Glory vessels of Mercy who are his vessels of Mercy that's you he showed his Mercy there was no chance that we had there was that woman there she said Son of David my daughter is demon possessed he said it's not good to give the children's me bread to the to the dogs and now he changed her title she said oh Lord because for us he is Lord he is our Lord he showed Mercy to that young woman Mercy he's rich in Mercy because God who is rich in Mercy where with his great love that he loved us even while we were yet dead in sin dead in sin he had given us Life along with Christ you're saved by works you're saved because you know the message you're saved because you sing very nice you're saved because your your father was a pastor you're saved by grace it's the mystery of his will his will none knows it because none can say he's saved and this one isn't he is saved and this one isn't it's a mystery it's a mystery that's why Peter came he had the keys to the kingdom he went with the Gentiles and he opened the door he said come on in the Holy Ghost is here so that you can say now close your eyes be very reverent this morning be fearful of God because God is here it doesn't matter what you need God knows exactly
