lord once more i greet you all in the precious name of our lord jesus christ i pray that each and every one of you as well we we all go through trials and tribulations but he is the one that holds us up every day ese amen i would like to go straight to the scriptures before we pray if you would like to turn with me to first peter chapter 1 verse 6 and 7. [Music] and the bible says wherein ye gracely rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations [Music] necessary that the trial of your faith being more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire it may be found unto the praise and the honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ heads heavenly father father celestial lord we're here to give ourselves to you lord father you heard the precious worship that this morning lord and you have come down to hear your children cry and rejoice father yes indeed lord we just ask that you come on the scene and speak to us father to give us what we need lord necessity lord if we need correction give it to us father lord if we need an uplifting give it to us lord if we need a revelation in our daily walk father we ask that you just give it to each and every person here in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen yemen amen you may be seated my title this morning is tried by fire or a trial by fire yes it's a very simple message but i believe it's something so needed for each and every one of us each and every one of us we go through our different trials and our different temptations and we go through them for different reasons there's people that have to go through trials uh so that they can grow stronger in the lord there's trials that we have gone through because we had did something wrong and we made that path for ourselves there's different trials for each and every person and each and every reason and it's our trial it's our personal trial i can never say that my trial is greater than somebody else's persona i can never truly understand what another person is going through [Music] just like each and every person is going through their own trials and god knows why you have to go through those temptations those trials and tribulations but every christian christian every person that confessed jesus christ every person that says i am a christian this morning cristiano who's a christian this morning who's brave enough to say i am a christian this morning every christian christian will have to go through a trial that's similar to each and every person and that's the trial of our faith we all go through different trials for different reasons but every christian that confessed jesus christ has to go through a trial of faith and in the eyes of the person that's going through the trial they might think that they're just getting beat down by it's a tribulation of de la life and most times we cannot see past the trials or the fire la mayor de vega we cannot see that it's something that is for our own benefits verde and it's a test of faith it's something that we have to go through to see if we pass or we don't pass yes in court the the ones that are um are suspected to be guilty they have to go through a trial and they go through certain evidences and tests to see if they are convicted or they are the the person that is suspected to do the crime i believe jesus christ and every day they that question will come to you every single day can you live for christ what can you suffer for christ can you go through this trial by fire especially in isaiah 48 10. i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction i have chosen you in the furnace of affliction of the affliction the bible says that we are our faith is being tried being more precious than gold your trial and your faith not your faith but your trial of your faith no no is more precious than gold it's more precious than gold the most greatest thing on earth is gold today what people are looking for is gold that's what makes these great cities thrive because of the goals but yet our little trial bro all the things that we have to go through that nobody knows and nobody cares your trial of faith is more precious than gold if you would like to turn with me to daniel chapter 3 say a little story this this morning the story of meshech shattered the message in daniel 3 1 it says daniel 3 nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits and breath thereof six cubits and he set set it up in a plane of dura in the province of babylon now uh you know we truly don't understand what uh three score cubits is if you know we don't read our bible you don't know how much money that truly is i don't know how much gold cost today it might be 1600 an ounce okay uh this is meal uh a thousand an ounce or a meal but imagine a 90-foot tall pure gold image how much value that was how much it must have shined in the sun whenever the sun would would hit that image and when he made this great statue this great image is he said when music is played and if you don't bow down to the image you are cast into the fiery furnace so then we see their first test test the first test is am i going to bow down to this image am i going to succumb to the things of the world if i could only find um [Music] americano we found that he would worship the sun in contrary he believed that there was a happy hunting ground when one died they put corn and so forth his bow and arrow and he set him across the sea somewhere in his canoe that he would find a happy hunting ground where he would have provisions to carry him over there's something in the human heart that calls out for worship so this statement makes me understand things very simply declaration that [Music] man was made to worship oh well you know i don't worship god but i i don't do all those things of the world i've heard that many times muchas versus oh well i don't drink tomorrow i don't smoke it's just me and my family namaste uh is yo my family but yet they're worshiping something worshiping something else and put that before god in exodus it says you shall not have any gods before me you shall not have anything whether it's an object or a person or persona you cannot put it before god us i'm a witness to that where somebody puts their person or that thing before god persona god has to show them every man will fall and every man will fail everything we put before god will fall and we'll see the demise of it whether it's a house or whatever it might be so we know that we know that anything we put before god is an idol so what does it mean to bow down they all had to bow down before this image they all had to submit themselves it means to bow down means to submit themselves to whatever they bow to er in the conflict between god and satan this is conflict you know you have to ignore before us in order to believe the devil's lie you have to deny the truth first before you could believe a lie right have to deny it is he said in order to believe satan's lie la mentira del diablo you have to deny god's truth first he put satan's word before god's word anything you put before so even the word of god even the doubt that we when you see the circumstance with your family tells you to bow down whenever you think oh the word didn't really mean that it's telling you to bow down to that word had people pray for me but yet this trial is just too great we put the devil's lie in front of god and made it our it's just as simple as that it's haciency it's as simple as just uh bowing down to your sickness bowing down to your problems and say well that's just the way it's going to be no not for god god's word says this that he is a healer but by his stripes i am healed it says that he is a very present help in the time of trouble for the problems then i throw every other thing out of the picture knowing that it's just the devil trying to make me bow down to his words to have that uncompromising face to stand on what you believe in every single person bowed down and there was three men that stood there faithful to the words they might have looked um just they might have looked weird just standing there where every single person thousands of people bowed down faith goes beyond your problems goes beyond the glamour of the world when you can consider the world in all its riches in all its glory considered and look at the trials that you would have to go through as a christian cristiano and you compare them it doesn't seem right uh it doesn't seem easy to to turn away from the glamour and live that beautiful life but faith doesn't see the problems faith looks beyond all trials and tribulations there was one time when moses moses and pharaoh were standing side by side and pharaoh looked at all the slaves there there working but when moses stepped out and he looked at those people pueblo he said that's jacob this is jacob that's god's chosen people those are the people that are supposed to be in the promised land when the world sees the worst in in god's people god sees goals god sees the greatest thing on earth people that are struggling and trying to be to uh to overcome believing in the word of god to believe and to stand even though the world uh offers them something different god wants christians with integrity how many people bowed down how many people bowed down that were true devout jews quantos personas to go through the furnace they said well i just have to bow to this image i just have to compromise that work just a little bit i just have to compromise with this and that just a little bit okay i just have to do this and that yes and then i could get up and just continue to serve the lord god wants somebody to stand for what's right whether you receive something or you don't god wants somebody to stand for him so people could say that person is different that person didn't bow when everybody else bowed even though it was something so simple for algo even though they could have just got up and went by their days yet they stood with the word and did not bow or compromise machine this faith is going to lead you to the fire estafe your integrity for god so integrity your faithfulness to god will lead you to the fires see god the devil didn't go up to god at the time of job and el tiempo de job and he didn't say oh look at joe you know oh i i bet you i can make him fall you they're going to the biggest baddest person hey you don't want to mess with eli you don't want to mess with him all right be quiet i you've given him everything he has a product and he says here try it for 30 days try it you can break it you can beat it you can try anything you want to do i have confidence in my product confidence poor little job didn't know he couldn't see past the fire home he said why lord because all just there in a hash heap even his wife said you should just curse god and die and he couldn't see past the fire he couldn't see past the trials yet it was god trying his child my son wishy-washy christians i have a quality product that's what miss shack shadow wreck in the bendigo world i don't care if all i have to do is bow whenever everything goes well yeah but just one time don't compromise with the word one time you stand on the word of god and all the bible says that nebuchadnezzar got angry even his face chained he was just so angry with these young men and he goes and he says all you have to do is bow it back on we are not careful to answer in this matter is necessary okay that means we don't have to think about it i don't have to weigh out my decisions and say well let me see okay he said we don't we don't even have another thought of it we will not bow respect if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the fiery burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand our god is able not he unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up wow what kind of faith is this he is able el puede but if not you know when i was a uh first gave my heart to the lord this scripture would would i would struggle with the scripture i thought that this scripture almost gave me an excuse to say god might or might not ok the children of the hebrew children did not say well he might and he might not well i don't know but i'll still serve him this is unadulterated faith this is the same faith abraham has islamism this is just a story that shows us a different perspective of faith most people's faith is based on their deliverance i believe in the lord i serve him because i know he'll get me this is and faith is based on that prize or that deliverance or that salvation premium but that's not how true faith works faith is based on their love for the lord true faith is based upon the devotion to him it's not going oh i guess the lord didn't want me to get this so i have this thing if i could do it i will love the lord with all my heart his love wasn't based on the gifts god gave him so mora his love wasn't based on the deliverances that god gave him his faith was based on the lord and the relationship with the lord job says though he slay me yet i will trust him so what he said was turn the fiery furnace seven times harder he was angry he was ready to throw him in the fiery furnace know what seven means it means completion or fullness it was the fullness of their trial it was the maximum of the trial for the maximum we are in the last days where that that uh pale horse rider will come and he will come with death [Music] not [Music] you have to be the living word of god not just the tablets but it's me i am the word now all right you are the walking word now that's what's going to defeat everything that satan throws begin have you fasted to the lord are you guys ready to go into this fiery furnace are you ready to go through this tribulation they said amen the bible says beloved thinking not strange they say amal's it's not something strange nebuchadnezzar had this great image and it was probably the most expensive thing in all the world [Music] that the trial of your faith being more precious than of gold that perishes the gold of god is a christ-like character produced by the fiery furnace of affliction that's the right kind of gold but what kind of gold does the church have today it has a worldly gold that will perish it is rich it is complacent agusta it is made affluence uh the major criterion of spirituality the evidence of god's blessing and correctness of doctrine etc etc is now based upon how many rich folks you are involved in you had better come before it's too late saith the lord and buy of me gold tribe [Music] it's that christ-like character this is a character how do we produce that character through the fiery furnace of trials and tribulations thinking not strange that you go through those things we go through many things every single day but it's because you made a stand that i am a you know a little kid 10 12 years old gets pains come on come in and say mama my arm hurts my legs are hurting so forth it's growing pains it shows that he's has got some good vitamins moisturized and when somebody begins to make fun of you and say oh she's old-fashioned look at him oh i tell you he used to be all right just a member growing up all right but just remember it's growing pains that's that persecution is good for oh yes he permits crosses and crossroads and junctions he always does that in order to perfect us for his service and uh can't you understand that he does that so you can be perfect for your calling that he has called you for it and paragraph 183 it says sometimes it takes trials to break the bands of the world off of us just like a man drowning in the river you have to take him out of the river before you can take the river out of him that's about the way god does it sometimes yeah this is a siesta throw you out one time and they get the world out of you you they went in with with bands and they were tied in there we think we're going into the fiery furnace to die [Music] as all that was going on on earth brother branham says it was a dark time this is a dark picture these children of god that stood for the word of the lord we're about to give their life established and there was no god to help people there was no god to respond he said have you noticed your children it's the darkest hour for them they can't get the victory send me down there and i'll flood the whole thing i'll make sure that fire is out god said no it's all right he said it's okay then michael comes up to him [Music] this is a job for me brother burnham says that he bowed down the heavens and he called the east wind and the west winds and he rode upon a lightning bolt and brother brown says that it was god himself in that fire with him it is no angel no i don't know it was nobody else but god himself in your trials and your problems it's your child of faith it's not going to be this great teaching it's not going to be this great thing it's just going to be a man-sized job where god himself comes to you remember god is revealed in your affliction all right is i'm a present helper from the time of trouble what does that mean that he's present every time you're in trouble every time you're they were there thinking they were going to die but the reason they were delivered because their faith wasn't based on their deliverance [Music] [Music] amen hallelujah heavenly father father celestial lord you are a very present help in the time of trouble many of your children are bedridden right now many of your children are struggling with their children lord many of your people are struggling with a health issue lord many of your children are going through that trial of faith because they had courage enough to stand for your word lord [Music] we thank you we claim you in the name of the lord jesus christ we believe in you in health or in sickness in death or in life in good times we thank you father we give you the glory glory the name of jesus christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] he lives [Music] i can face to myself [Music] all fear is gone because i know [Music] the is just because it is [Music] to love [Music]
