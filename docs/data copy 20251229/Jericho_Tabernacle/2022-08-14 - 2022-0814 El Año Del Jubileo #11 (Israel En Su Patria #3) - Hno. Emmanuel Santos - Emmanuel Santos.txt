[Music] just like you said in your prayers give us our daily bread and that is what we need today we ask lord for these favors just like we're standing when i read the two scriptures in the bible the first one is going to be fine in revelations the third chapter the seventh verse we can please say amen once you have it [Music] the word says and to the angels the church in philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openness i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for that has little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name now in leviticus the 25th chapter [Music] then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the on the tenth day of the seventh month and the day of the atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land is shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land onto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man onto his possession and you shall return every man onto his family a jubilee shall that 50th year be unto you you shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of divine undressed for it is a jubilee it shall be holy on to you you should eat the increase there out of the field in the year of the jubilee you should return every man on to his position may the lord bless turn over his word you may take your seats we thank the musicians as well for the atmosphere that they have created i forget where brother brown says that determines if god wants to reveal his word or not so the type of atmosphere that you're forming is i will determine if god's going to reveal to you something this morning a portion to fulfill this morning you have an atmosphere that you have to create so the holy spirit can feel well enough to reveal himself to you continue and this morning i'd like to speak on the year of the jubilee it is this is the 11th part ireland israel in their homeland israel has their homeland yes has different and the scripture that we read in revelations the third chapter it says he that has the key of david now that he represents something very important elise says but the law required a kinsmen redeemer the law required a kinsmen redeemer you want to mark it down kinsman redeemer leviticus 25. that's the scripture that we finished reading it speaks of the year of jubilee now the day of the atonement is the expression what is in atonement in atonement is the offering for sin when the sacrifice is dead entonces [Music] the priest therefore gets a trumpet he begins to play the trumpet that everyone who hears the trumpet he can know that he's free us now you've heard the gospel you have heard that you can be free tomorrow but that is a decision that everyone must make if you accept your jubilee entonces then you can return to your family you can return back to your homeland and return back to your position you can return back of what adam had antis before the fall the bible declares that even our own selves we're kings and priests the bible also declares that the millenniums and the manilla will be kings and priests what is the king a king is someone who has dominion over something and the way that brother branham says we're now kings that we have dominion over the earth we have dominion over the evil spirits with our lord jesus christ we are our kings and priests just like and back when adam he was literally that dominion he had the meaning over the the animals and the animals over the earth but every day of in the evening time we can return back to our family we can return back to our homeland and to our position everything that adam had antis de la caida before the fall puerto rico i'm not sure if anybody's here i've heard when he makes reference to that boss there's a lot of redemption of the bride of the 144 000 and of the land that's why if you study the story of ruth you find that boaz he redeemed ruth and the property that was lost what in the beginning he's returning us back to what was lost in the beginning that's what jubilee is to return back to return back to what belonged to you originally i would like to read this quote first the message water from the rock it was the bread of life that sustained them all the way through the journey and the day that they entered into the type el mileno the millennium over in the other promised land and on the airs podia nosotros where they could like we are vivid to live for a thousand years without death when they entered into the land heaven the day that we enter the millennium christo christ because christ will be there himself in forma and body form as king is going to beat their plowshares also of their crowning espadas and regards or swords into plowshares and war is over then going to have some rest around here the world is going to rejoice and he wants to take us out of the world and wants to take us to the baptism of the holy ghost but there is a land that he does want to share with us which is called the millennium millennial and the millennium is the year of jubilee because in the jubilee you can go back too the land of what they originally possessed now the quote that we just read in case if you don't know the scriptures is quoting a scripture at the very end it's talking about their plowshares they're crowning swords into plowshares and then the bible says and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears enter pounding hooks nations shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war anymore what does that mean before entering to the millennium in fact there's a war that the bible speaks about it's called armageddon so you have to see the story having control over the promised land he first had to be war after war to have a complete possession of that land foreign and that is jesus christ who is fighting he's going to fight to win over that land he's going to win the earth and it's going to return it back to its original condition which adam and eve had primed because the first adam had possession and he lost it but the second atom that position that satan took away from us that's why it says in isaiah 2 4. he says that the spears espada swords swords are something you to work because in the millennium there'll be no wars instruments so those those things that the instruments are used for war in he was the one who labored the earth convert those swords uh here's what brother bram says questions and answers number one this is a question that somebody asked for the branham it is not isaiah's meaning of the beating of the swords and the plowshares to come to pastor in the 1000 reign of christ rather than something that a man can bring as so many modern religiousness tells us ever who you are my brother who wrote it mia madormano hermana my dear brother or sister looks like a man's handwriting but anyhow whoever it may be you are exactly right that's when the plowshares well rather when the swords will beat into plowshares the story repeats itself if you see the bible you see how the bible runs in cycles because the word of god is eternal not in a principle it has no beginning nor end solo it just repeats itself once and once again it and god told them you could eat of any fruit the toddlers of all the trees except of one tree and we already know that millennium now the millennium there'll be no wars but we have to we're going to labor the earth we're going to eat the fruit of the earth like they didn't enter the promised land they had a manna fallen from heaven and the bible says and i believe it's in spanish of angels but we have received the seventh angel message we want to go back to the promised land they can feed the part of god that's within us but now in the millennium will have a different body you don't have to be fed from heaven will be fed from the same earth and isaiah 65. the 19th verse of millennium says this speaks of the millennium and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard than her they say there'll be something in the earth that's going to be able to feed us just like jesus christ when he resurrected he had the ability to travel any part of the earth yeah now the takes you to the baptism of the holy ghost takes you to the revelations of jesus christ takes you to the rapture takes you to the future and it takes you to the millennium what is the key of david philadelphia and the message the philadelphian church age organization not through any church any organization any bishop pope just through jesus christ he has the key he's the only one that can the keys of what david david el futuro millennium the future coming millennium he'll stand on the throne of david i have the keys of david i'll open this door and nobody can shut it nobody can open it but me and nobody can shut it to me the keys of david represent represents the throne that christ would have in the millennial in the millennium as son of david because david had a son in the natural salomon and it was solomon usted [Music] it was only but peace isaiah 22 22. it speaks about the same key and the key of the house of david lay upon his shoulder he shall open and none shall shut she shall shut and no one shall open that's very strange an exposition of the seven churches the philadelphian church age here david signified at that time as a mere shadow while sombra is completed in jesus which is now fulfilled in jesus christ earthly pilgrimage but what does this key signify the answer lies in the position of the king the key is and no man has the right but jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key is it is on his shoulder but what does that shoulder have to do with it he says isaiah 9 6. he says the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is she under his dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head we have seen in wedding ceremonies when they get married that the bride places the veil upon the groom's shoulders that represents the responsibility the man is carrying foreign representing the responsibility of jesus christ that he's going to have in the millennium but also that he bears the responsibility has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the key of david the key of david was not david the king of israel all of israel and it's not jesus the son of david according to the fact that he'll be set upon the throne of david in the millennium [Music] that they may share in his reign of righteousness upon the earth now i want to take that scripture that my brother brandon mentioned and he said isaiah 9 6 for unto us a child is born and unto us unto us as son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counselor of the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace is but in spanish it says this principality now a principality is a territory it's a territory or a place that is given onto a prince because he has the key to that place of the increase of his government in the peace shall there be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even to forever it says the seal of the lord of hosts will will perform this decay because before the the prince will reign his principality a peace there will be war but after the war is done milan there will be he won't be he said he will be tied down for those thousand years foreign that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of david and on to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanliness [Music] there's a fountain open the house of david berlin bethlehem it's bethlehem is the house of god's bread who warrior that can see the millennium coming what warrior can see this great holy spirit coming in to christ come in the form of jesus christ the literal talks about a fountain there in the house of david in the millennium which is christ in the millennials is going to purify the sin upon the earth and it says it's the warrior el espiritu the holy spirit informa del cuerpo de jesus christ in the form of the body of jesus christ doing this remember when joshua sent forth the spies and they returned back with the with the grapes with evidence of the promised land and then milk and honey flute uh flow through the day of pentecost and it shall come to pass in the day in the mountains thus drop down new wine and the hills shall flow with milk and the rivers of judah shall flow with waters and the fountains shall come forth out of the house of the lord and in the water of the valley asythm a system because in isaiah 65 vineyards vineyards where they they grow or they have grapes in order to make wine they say they're going to have wine and milk is going to flow itamina there's going to be a fountain in the house of david if you noticed everything that we studied the scripture speaks about the millennium commons i will have wine and milk there vamos a comparable we're going to eat there's going to be something upon the earth that's going to be able to feed us we're not going to be able to feed us from heaven anymore now the earth itself will have the ability to feed the body that god gave us like we mentioned times past antis between lucifer and miguel and michael miguel there has been many signposts that pointed to that day muchos grandest many great foreshadows has been foreshadowed by the lamb by the bullock by the turtle lucifer came to the earth that he walked upon the earth that he left his footprints he says in ezekiel 28. in verse 13. that has been in the garden of eden of god every precious stone was thy covering esmeralda the sardis topaz the diamond the barrel the onyx and the jasper in the sapphire the emerald and the carbonicle and gold the workmanship of thy tablets of thy pipes were prepared to envy in the day that i was created thou art anointed covereth i have said and i have said the soul that was upon the holy mountain of god thou has walked up and down the midst of the stones of fire so satan in some manner was able to walk over the volcanic ash marco la position and he murked the position in the future that's why it says here and malachi 4. what the ram the heavens and earth will be on fire and burned with bourbon heat and the righteous shall walk upon the ashes volcanicas de los mars the volcanic ashes of the wicked in millennia in the millennium which is lomismo with the same with the same coin the same thing the devil does to the children of god god does it to the devil and lucifer over the volcanic ashes represents possession now footprints means position or possessions remember god told them where your where your feet shall trod and don't that he will take over [Music] it won't be just with footprints of faith now that's our the theme of our camp walk with god now we're walking by faith now literally even and wherever your feet shall trod marking the promise that belongs to you now malachi 4 says and here brother branham says in the message a true sign that's overlooked unto shall the sun of righteousness rise with healing in his wings vosotros you shall go forth and you shall grow up as call calves in the stall that's the millennium they're having a jubilee they're very happy communion it says that's the millennium aura i would like to read in the message questions and answers paragraph 172 now watch malachi 4. destruction that's of the tribulation and destruction see that's coming but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness rise you should go forth go go forth and grow up as cows of the stall como de la that brother branham gives you and in my mind i thought he was able to explain it a bit more he was very brief but that's all that you need then jesus said unto him again verily verily i say unto you i am the door to the sheep i am the door bye if any man enter in that's the interpretation that brother branham gave the exposition of the seven church ages affiliate of the philadelphian church age in san juan door and that is the shepherd to the sheep he is actually their door when i was over in the east i he will lie down in the open door of the fold and literally became the door of the fold no one could get in or out except by him he was the door jesus sound distinction and this trumpet would make the the distinction or the trumpet was the 50th year sound every slave for he was too poor to redeem himself that's why jesus christ is our kinsmen redeemer because we don't have the ability to redeem our own selves but our kinsmen redeemer he is the king of kings he is the the owner of the horse we don't have the ability because we're poor but rico but he is rich and he does have the ability to take us to that but god said remember therefore at the sounding of the trumpet today every slave no importa no matter how long he's been in poco oh how short of a time he has a liberty to return to his family and to return to his people and be free of every depth for the time of jubilee inclusive and even you wasn't to plant any corn produce what the field produced you was to live on it you shouldn't trim your vineyard or anything sin you can go home and be free with us you don't owe any depths at all the whole emancipation of proclamation is done it's signed and you are free and today when a man hears the good news christ died in your stead only the bread that falls from heaven we have the bread of the seventh messenger to feed us but one day that bread is going to take us to the next place tonight that would teach you like this that wouldn't make any difference my brother or sister whatever it is i may be wrong in my theories of it but i couldn't i i could never could liken the promised land onto like being on to heaven because they had wars in the promised land of the millennium i'm a believer in the millennium millennium i believe that there will be a millennium milan a thousand years on earth and i believe that the promised land represented the millennium los milanos and if you notice as soon as they cross jordan significa which means separation from this earthly journey and they eat of the old corn and the bible said we will build houses plant vineyards plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them when we come into the millennium as sicknesses and death flee from the world where we're we're waiting for a future jubilee make sure you have your jubilee now we give you thanks lord for your revealed that is our
