[Music] you know we do have powerpoints but it's always it's always good to bring your bible the eighth verse either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece does not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she had found it she called the friends and her neighbors together saying rejoice with me for i found the peace which i had lost likewise i say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repented los angeles amen you may take your seats brethren once again we greet you in the name of jesus christ and i hope you're all doing well this morning the feeling or hearing the word will make you feel better you and uh and i'd like to put a subtitle the harlot um brother brown says this is a church across the nation he says we're following jesus christ the word now here brother ram says to be in the bride okay this is to be in the bride but i started you have to be remarried to the word of god which is christ now we understand in order to use that phrase or that word remarried and i don't want you to misunderstand me i'm speaking in the spiritual hablo in the spiritual but i know the natural typifies the spiritual natural spiritual to use the word remarried uh and i hope that uh he's still not your husband yes but the ramp says it's your flesh it's your nature is your first husband is a supreme response yeah nothing to do with it we can't disobey the law i can't go speeding a hundred miles an hour in a fifty five fifteen fifty five fifty five mile lane really obedient when it comes to that right real beating for that when the fl when your husband said go drink tomorrow don't drink just one no no no go and submerge yourself [Music] there is no writing of divorcement already the divorce i can't say flesh nope here's this letter i divorce you a question of the maricopa valley i divorce you maricopa divorce ah you're no longer my husband brother says nope no no riding of divorcement noi carter the divorce he dies he has to die in order for you to be remarried again well brother you say well brother i there's i always struggle with my flesh i'm not in my theory my uh my body of theophany yes correct that's what the apostle paul says amen amen now in our scripture we find here jesus giving a parable a woman who is married brother ram says she's a good honest clean woman this is but she lost one of her coins what does that mean question if you guys let's let's see what brother bram says i want him to explain it says jesus christ this is her husband was gone and she lost one of her coins out of her tablet now i will try to explain that today if a woman is married she would wear a wedding ring as a sign that she is married that's to keep other man from having anything to do with her es para impedience and that was a sign that they were a married woman no man was to fool with him no boys was to flirt with them they were married uh but i haven't i'm trying i'm going to try to keep my word as close as possible i could tell you what each one of those coins meant it was placed there and each coin meant a certain virtue of that woman a certain virtue sierta virtude uh the first el primero meaning her love to her husband represents second second her pledge to avert you to live live clean for him promesa if you want to look it up look in galatians five you find it out that a woman has represented the church and the church is a spouse wife to christ she is supposed to have these these ten coins and the church is supposed to be wearing it right now because she doesn't have one of them she's not she's she's supposing that she's not married to her husband is the church should be wearing that coin david said restore to me the joy of my salvation god doesn't give happiness he gives joy but it doesn't matter what goes on in our lives there's a great pleasure inside of me we don't have uh you know so many things going on here and there but yeah we should have peace of mind suffering how many have long sufferings means patiently enduring lasting offense or hardships offenses or difficulties will you suffer for a long time you carry the sufferment of the people we are patiently doing these these offenses and these hardships you're gonna see if you're missing one of these coins you gotta be honest with yourself marvelous your wife's going to say brother no put your hand down put your hand down luis you're not gentle you know who's going to tell me if i'm wrong my wife same thing for all of you brothers goodness the quality of being morally good or virtuous faith and i i got this and and galatians five lo obtuse are you faithful are you faithful to god's word doesn't matter what happens are you faithful to god's word the quality or state of being meat moderate moderato or a submissive quality it says mild they say i i i'm very my mind works really awesome or tremendous when i think of mild i think about hot sauce we mild i like how he fills in the blanks for me don't be spicy no enchiladas be humble that's equality is a qualitative but maybe she's missing temperance uh templars it says self-restraint auto control self-control el dominion wow wow you self-control oh i can't talk that brother though right now i'm going to give a piece of my mind right now once it gets off the pulpit temperance domino self-control control yourself control it i'm going to give a piece of my mind right now wow how many like to have fellowship oh brother i mean i mean fellowship because fellowship sanctifies the bride but do you have groups groups you have to fellowship with a certain amount of people a caso de gusta brother brown never closed way bigger than yours you're in my circle you're in my group brother are we are we in the same page these are the ten coins that she's probably missing brother ram says and if she if she had defiled herself in any way it was seen by the people and they brought her before the priest witnesses that she had been found as such and the priest seen that she was a married woman uh if she had marred her virtue casa whatever and he would divorce her immediately ila divorciava immediately it was getting dark it was getting dark already yes you realize wait a minute i'm losing one i lost one of my coins she says it's it's time for her husband to come it's getting late yes same message brother brian says elements the church like better i'm not going to examine my interpreter you know examination i'm not going to examine my neighbor by the word of god there was a lady that came came up to brother branham um these are the coins that you're missing the christian church christiana is associating in those things today so you can't hardly tell who's which hasta que no puedes you can't even tell the difference anymore because all the women in the church wear makeup now all the men are doing this now when you're at work you can't even tell if he's a christian or not if there was ever a need of a time of lighting of a candle the sending forth of the gospel of life the holy ghost back into the church el espirito santos discriminating candle she got a broom consider las covas she went house cleaning brother and says we're at the end time this is amazing she lit a candle novella to give her light but [Music] you should have she had a real house cleaning for her husband was about to come today she started cleaning her house she started cleaning your spiritual house brother even though i've kept the rest faithfully kept all of them thought for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all if you offended one point offended so who here what is a harlot bother brahms says this is a woman that lives untrue to her marriage vowel in any church that claims to be the church of christ step upon that shall be yourself that's what it says just had a nasty history no she was a real believer she didn't say now i hear that joshua can do these things [Music] he didn't absolutely have to show those signs many times we have to see things to believe it we have to see this and we have to see that he went down and performed those signs but the sign isn't the thing that took him to the promised land again him faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of god we've heard what you did to those people over there two kings over there had the red sea dried up for you guys everyone here in jericho is trembling because we know that you're coming for us i don't need to see a sign i don't need to the sign i like how [Music] 15 miles to phoenix imagine me worshipping the sign oh hallelujah it's mine miles away says seven amen amen the sign is to help you believe it's the help you believe did ray have to get a sign let's
