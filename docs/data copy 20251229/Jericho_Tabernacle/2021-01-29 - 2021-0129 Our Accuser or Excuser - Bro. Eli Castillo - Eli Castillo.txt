amen and amen amen amen let us go straight to our scriptures if you'd like to turn with me to romans chapter 2 verses 14 and verse 15. my title tonight is called our accuser or excuse excusa the bible says for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another testimonials lord we have read your word we ask that you just speak to us this evening we thank you lord the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated um in on fridays los biernes it's a youth service is it dedicated to the youth yes of course you know those of all ages we can rejoice in it and listen to the word this word of god is for all ages elderly can receive something from it and i thought of of the young people today you know i didn't want to bring something too much just something that we can receive and we can take to our daily lives you know the the young people brother branham says that young people uh this is he was talking to the young people in a message called come follow me and these young people they were graduating and he told them he said you are in a changing spot in your lives you make yourself when you're young you set your ambitions to do what you want to do as you think of course your mind it's presented into your mind by an they're in a changing spot whatever they do in their life whatever you think now okay it could drive you to do something great later on it says remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth remember him now remember when when you're 20 years and younger uh when when you're still a young branch while the evil days come not ants nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them brother branham says that you know 86 percent uh of conversions is done before you're 20 years old the young green branch it it's not able to mold itself anymore that's why you remember the creator in the days of your youth when brother branham went to to the the uh sixth dimension when and he saw all these young men and women brother branham said that they were around 18 to 20 years old this is that's your greatest years whenever you're you're young maybe you're 10 9 or or maybe you're 12 and up you have time to grow with but that word will never depart from your amen i just wanted to say that before we get into the message now um speaking on the conscience as the conscience that dwells with and something in their heart begin to hurt they they begin to fail feel something that they never felt before god already instilled something inside of them so that whenever they sinned a guilt came over them and and they ran and hid themselves with fig leaves their eyes were were covered before they couldn't see their nakedness but whenever their eyes were opened every person is born with a conscience every single person is given this gift because of the fall a causa de la queira we have a fall in nature we lie something you know brother uh billy graham once said uh billy graham he said our conscience is one of the greatest proofs that there is a god okay exists because the the scripture that we just read it showed that the gentiles not having the law only the jews had the law it was only the hebrew children that received the ten commandments but gentiles that have never knew the word of the lord the bible said the law was written in their hearts by their conscience they knew right from wrong without even reading the old testament without even reading the bible once somebody cheated or lied yeah is so that showed that god is in existence amen amen you know a man is a seed brother branham says and he has faculties and one of them is your conscience brother branham says that god usually uses those avenues to want the comforter he'll use your conscience so that you can get closer to the lord but see brother branham says this your conscience will shun you from hell um it would show you from hell would try to make you live a good uh try to make you live good and right a good citizen will do that not necessarily be a christian necessarily i've seen many men who've denied the name of the lord jesus jesus they were fine people that means humanely significant so so your conscience will make you live a good life but but it will not take you to heaven you cannot live a good life and go to heaven you cannot try to live a good life because you have a good conscience your conscience is not a perfect guy if i could describe what our conscience is and it depends it depends on who you let speak and can if you indulge yourself in the things of the lord your heart will be more tender to god's voice but it's how you educate this conscience is whenever whenever you you indulge yourself in the things of the lord then this conscience that listens to the word of the lord [Music] then you don't go there and doesn't know what camino but you'll go somewhere else why because you're listening to the word of the lord but it has to be in that any man or woman that ever meets god face to face and can walk away and take you to light things to see people on the streets because their conscience doesn't like those things brother branham says the more i fast the more i pray andre the more i'm in his presence the more uglier the world gets mass fails and it begins to kill you to where you don't want to be around any of that stuff a godly conscience hurts but it's one of the biggest blessings that we have medicines it's like a faithful friend proverbs 26 as 27 6 says faithful are the wounds of a friend it hurts you know when you do something wrong when you think something wrong but when you have a guilt inside you lost nobody likes that feeling but it's a faithful friend it's telling you something it's telling you that there's danger it's telling you that there's something wrong and you need to fix it it's important to the human being it's important it's important it's important because it tells you to get away from something you know when you have the pain and you go and you touch a hot oven pain begins to to shout out in your body and it goes to your brain and says something is wrong here it says do not touch that again pain is so that it could preserve your body so that you could stay away from the danger and that's what our conscience does yes it keeps you away from danger alejado del peligro it keeps you away from things that can kill you and destroy you amen amen there was one time where king herod rey erodes you know king herod was the king in the time of john the baptist and jesus jesus and because of his sin he was caught up in a castle he was made to kill john the baptist now john the baptist he respected the position of john the baptist he was afraid of him but because of the sin that he indulged in it caused him to to behead john the baptist then jesus comes on the scene and when jesus is on the scene and in and herod begins to hear the reports of jesus jesus the bible says that he begin to be terrified he began to fear this because he said john the baptist has come from the dead what was it his conscience speaking to him knowing that he killed a righteous man that's what our conscience does amen amen but the bible says beloved uh and first john 3 21 it says premade that's beautiful to have a clear conscience to to have a good conscience you know a bad day with a good conscience and you can have one of the best days of your life he began to he they asked a man once what is a conscience what's your conscience and this man begin to explain explain what he thought your conscience was yes and brother branham uh quotes him he said it's a little thing that's got four points on it and they're sharp and it sits right in your heart and when they do something wrong it starts turning you let it keep turning us in there's two people in this world that can sleep good at night a man with a clear conscience and a person without a conscience at all brother branham says it's a little thing that's got four points on it and you allow that to continue to the very thing that will point us to christ can become defiled can become desensitized insensibly and can become evil in titus 1 15 and 16 it says unto all pure and to the pure all things are pure today but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving there is nothing pure mas para los cormpidos incredulos nada le espuro but even their mind and conscience they profess that they know god but in their works they deny them being abominable and disobedient and unto every good word reprobate man that hits hard to them that are defiled and unbelieving a chaos incredulous those that have a mind and conscience that are defiled there is nothing pure their mind is always on on evil things you know the most sacred things that are the sacred most sacred thing on this world in this world it is the word of god but but to and somebody that's defiled and unbelievable and their conscience is defiled it says nothing is pure this is puro first timothy four one two 1-2 says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrine of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared within hot iron spirit conscience it comes from an exposure or too much of an exposure to sin you've exposed yourself to sin until it becomes seared without hot iron why because we stopped listening to the still small voice your conscience is important telling you to serve the lord with all your heart but if we continue to deny that calling come follow me benny seeking man come follow me benny seegan man there'll be one time we don't hear it anymore and frankly we won't care anymore it doesn't matter because it doesn't hurt inside anymore we have no more feelings brother branham says uh branham and uh from that time you pass by the church and you hear the people singing the gospel songs you said you really want to go in you said but oh my you light up another cigarette and shake your head what are you trying to do you're fighting your way through every barricade just run every you'll walk away and shun god to keep receiving the holy ghost and some of your friends outside lafayette you say if that's the new birth i don't want nothing to do with it a person will break every barrier run through every warning sign until those barricades obstacles and those warning signs yeah the bible talks about an evil conscience we can run over the spirit of the lord so many times that those barricades and those warning signs is preachings you've got to break through the holy spirit and fight your way into that white gate in broadway i say brother branham says this is in fellowship but when men and women let their hearts become seer because it's a beautiful thing god given us he's given us something to point us to christ he says they become seared it looks like a bunch of prehistoric animals historically [Music] the bible said they have their conscience seared with a hot iron he's not talking of the one that doesn't care el no hablas he's talking about church members we go to church but then we do what we want to do that's that's not christianity christianism christianity is not what church you go to christianism christianity is is not doing a bunch of rules it's a relationship with the lord jesus christ it's being a friend of jesus christ that's true christianity is christianized throw all that other garbage away because you don't need it all them religious acts and all those things they're no good if you don't have jesus christ we have to have jesus christ it's necessary as a friend come on amigo then then you don't want to hurt your friends in revelations 3 we know these scriptures jesus is talking to the lady osea church age jesus and he said i will spew you out of my mouth because you say i'm rich and increased with goods i don't have i saw that and i saw the negative of the garden of eden god covered adam and eve's eyes and they saw del pueblo and they don't know that they're they're naked miserable it takes the holy spirit it takes the holy spirit to take away all that blindness so that they can realize that they're naked and their conscience and their their guilt will flood over them and their real lives that they're wrong amen amen now there's this story of this woman that brother branham talked about i don't believe that he mentioned her name but he talked and i'm gonna give you a short version of it he talked about her as a church member she was going to the methodist church and she got married with a a fine young man and brother brown said that that man was filled with the holy spirit but brother beram said that this little lady was just not right and there was one time where the the young men had to go um i had a state to start working inclusive mentioning and this little lady she was the pianist of the church and she started to see the other sisters differently she started to see them that they were smoking cigarettes that they would cut their hair that they would wear tight skirts and she said well if they could do it that's where she messed up where she began to reason she said if they could do so she began to to be just like the other women brother branham says listen to man of branham that uh he says that notice she began to wear little clothes her husband said dear i don't believe now she said look if lucy and ella and all of them can wear it why can i carry on success see right down here in her soul it said that's wrong and she began to act like all these women and as the the husband would go out and work brother branham said a little slicker began to live right next to them and they would go next to the fence and begin to talk to one another and every time her soul but she would reason and say well no um my husband's never here buenos and the one that was filled with the holy ghost the soul that sinneth that soul shall die death means separate significance she kept getting um getting away from it farther and farther and farther wow that that's amazing that she started her her soul begin to separate from her quest reasoning said but the rest of them um can do it why can't i but you know when she puts on those little ungodly clothes nature itself will tell her that's wrong but she said the rest of them do it why can't i die she got herself in a pitiful condition brother branham says that she got sick and she ended up in the hospital so but she didn't want brother branham to pray for her i don't want that little old holy roller to pray for me and brother neville used to be her pastor never anticipate to go over there and pray for her well she thought she was fine she shut off the little voice that told her she was wrong she felt justified but she wasn't but so when brother neville came does he go neville she thought he was going to give her a little nice pretty little prayer pen eva but he says you need to get right with the lord and she said what yeah get my life right with the lord she said i belong to this church and i did it and i do this and that yo she actually believed in reasoning she said i'm just as good as you are they all those cigarettes and all those things and all those things that she was doing she said i'm just as good as you are and brother branham says when all your intellects and your your reasoning begins to fade away your intellect begins to break up and uh it begins to break up this is intellectual and begin and so she turned to her pastor and she said you liar you snake in the grass well you told me i was okay you told me i was all right to steal that voice and while she was crying out i'm lost i'm lost he shot the needle in her arm they wow that's something that that's something to open our eyes that what i cannot play church the quiz and my soul in all my actions my conscience will come back to me and then and tell me all the things that i should have done he was a good child but still inside of him he was seeking for eternal life and he asked the lord jesus how do i receive eternal life jesus says come and follow me drop all those things that you're holding on to and follow me and it grieved that young man yes you so he rejected the voice of the lord why because they don't have some voice speaking to them he said i say to my soul me alma what what does that soul do when we reject it it separates he says i say to my soul that i'm satisfied he comes with gifts he comes with power el viene con poder he comes with a position when he calls you when he tells you to come follow him quesudon came back to him brother jesus was going to call him to be an evangelist brother branham said this and he began to act as he said just let somebody raise up and go preach to them but it was too late it was too late because he didn't important it doesn't matter how old you are it doesn't matter how set in your ways you are okay if you want the lord jesus jesus if you hear [Music] he wanted to he he was dreaming about how rich he could be and and he would go out and look for gold in mine for gold and he would think oh one day i'm going to be so rich yes brother branham said this story happened here in arizona arizona and one day he struck the goal and it was so much gold he he couldn't all take it at once and he was happy but but he had a faithful dog that he loved but whenever he got so excited because he had all this gold he got drunk that night he said i'm going to celebrate one more time before i go to the city before i buy this and i buy that ante before i show all my friends how rich i am but not knowing there was that whole time he was mining for gold there was someone there waiting in the bushes waiting for him to strike goals so that he could attack him and take all his goals he didn't know that so while he was getting drunk and happy and wasted began to cry out begin to bark and the drunk prospector said shut up i'm i'm trying to celebrate here i don't want to hear you no more but that faithful dog was crying out because there was danger nearby but he got to the point where he felt like he didn't need that dog anymore his worldly ambitions went farther than his faithful friend so he got the shotgun and he shot the dog and that night that man that was creeping in the darkness took him and killed him and took all his goals that's the holy spirit today make it right with the lord come to the fountain bengal come to jesus christ so that he can wipe away all your guilt he could take away all your sins [Music] my to the very point i i couldn't even think of anything wrong if i felt like i offended a brother my conscience would beam me up my conscience he'll regenerate he created you you're ashamed of something you've done tell your faithful friend and he'll take it all and put it in the sea of forgetfulness he won't think evil of you hey he will think bad of you it's impossible for him to remember the sin
