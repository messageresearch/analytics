met him outside speaking with a brother and I was like you are speaking my language so let us speak namaste and he was very happy and the different ones that are coming in from different places I was surprised to see this I didn't expect but uh the also the p7 have completed but now the senior six are beginning so but shame and also brother Samuel maganda Fisher will be beginning their exams this month so uh we should someone should remind me we should hold a prayer for them I'm also happy to see my sister hiding someone she left oh she's praying okay so Mama Isaac Mama Isaac she was supposed to come in a bit earlier but she's coming late Sister Sister God bless you you're welcome amen and with her daughter back there home sometime back we share the message and she was very pleased to receive Vietnam so we directed the heart because they live around area I met a while ago and she told me it's it's uh it's a wonderful thing that she had never imagined ever since and also the little one where are you talking right here she just finished computer p7 yeah and we pray that uh God bless them so I'd like you to stand at this time we'll just go straight away into the world um this subject means so much to me um been praying and waiting upon the Lord and I believe that the Lord will speak to you we never arranged any of this but you know the sister where's the sister that sang Here is one of the leader when I got married one of the very first ones that I I fathered but now I noticed she's 19 years so I told that oh that means I'm getting old so she's on her way to Nairobi again the Nairobi on Monday the Lord willing last Sunday sister when he sang a song I think such love that God would save us and this morning Jesus love can make the violence and then God LED Brother Martin to sing such love God Was preparing us for the message so this is really to confirm to me that the Lord is in this and on the Outreach we did on Sunday but and this morning I'm happy to see him here [Applause] and I know there are many people who are asking about women preachers go ahead and many other subjects that we touched on many events so this Sunday I'm coming to I'm coming back to congruent very well have some time to spare today at 5 PM please come out in balwa center and I believe that the Lord will bless you as you bless those who need God have you prayed for the service this morning those who prayed God bless you I'd like you to take your Bible and let us go to the Book of Luke chapter 7. that's this is the most important part of the service we can sing we can pray we can do everything but while we are here on Earth we need the word more than anything foreign [Music] the son of man verse 34 the son of man is come eating and drinking and he say Behold a gluttonous man and a wine Bieber a friend of publicans and sinners foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign but some have actually even thought there is no longer Grace for Sinners dried up even their hunger and thirst for to pray for the Sinners is no longer there is no longer go out to do Outreach on the on the road they no longer give our tracks to somebody they no longer tell their friends about what God has done for them because some believe that the door for Grace is close and even in their churches the moment someone does something wrong or bad they will kick them out as if it were that we actually were a Catholic priest joining defects but we find that such things are nowhere in the Bible and that you know people have taken Traditions when something is done over and over and over again it becomes gospel truth and it replaces the word of God for the message with the mess that you can never go wrong because the message is the word of God and it corrects the errorism so we praise the name of the Lord and so you know we have read the scripture in First Corinthians chapter 5 and I'd like you to turn to that I wrote unto you verse 9 in an episode not to company with fornicators yet not all together with the fornicators of this world or with the Covetous or extrusionals or with idolaters for then machine needs to go out of the world but now I have written unto you not to keep Company If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator okovacious or an idolater or a real or drunk or an extortioner with search and want not to eat foreign [Music] but now here we see the people who have maybe not yet heard the word the people who are doing all these works of the flesh Apostle Paul say do not run away from them but if somebody is called a brother if someone is a believers they have heard the word they have continued in the works of the flesh such as drunkenness foreign [Music] by the word of [Music] all of us here each of us are at a different level or stage of Grace we have received the same message foreign [Music] you know one thing that I know I believe I can never sin um the Bible says help me finish it cannot cannot so if you're born of God you can't be overtaken in a fall or someone [Music] kick him out of the church is that right is that what the Bible says if a brother or a sister ye who are spiritual you that are still standing foreign [Music] if you do that foreign [Music] you are going to be their God take me what do you see there oh I don't see Moses I see Jesus hallelujah amen hallelujah amen when man had sinned so far away from God came down the form of a human body Jesus yes he thrown himself between man and God before you take them again because I love them they are my friends oh my praise the name of the Lord no matter what they had done since song I teach that is who I am sent to he sends a light a lot to shine where there is light where there is darkness that is where the light belongs Hallelujah Amina foreign original in their room you have got to stand with the people God did not come for Rocks come for uh for great and mountains this gospel came for people too I don't care how people are
