come and minister to us this morning Lord we have young and old here [Music] we have females and males we all need you this morning may you come and speak to us this morning we surrender ourselves [Music] I'd like to invite you to your Bible now [Music] foreign and we are going to read from one to seven I trust that you have your Bible and that you're opening it is because we don't have Bibles please buy bibles if you need the Bible says [Music] I'm speaking to you this morning on a very important subject is second Kings chapter 20 from verse 1 to 7. in those days was Hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet Isaiah the son of Moses came to him and said unto him thus saith the Lord sit down house in order for Thou shalt die and not leave then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the Lord saying I beseech thee O Lord remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with the perfect with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah whip so and it came to pass before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the Lord came unto him saying son again until Hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the Lord the god of David thy father I have had thy prayer I have seen the tears behold I will heal thee on the third day Thou shalt go up into unto the house of the Lord and I will add unto thy days 15 years and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Prayer and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David is sake and Isaiah said take alarm or fix and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered is um foreign foreign amen Lord Jesus we object and a portion of scripture we have read it as men but we ask for inspiration from Europe not come here to see one another I have not even come here to talk to these people of my own language I need you Lord to give me utterance Use Me Lord because the sun will come up and may you put bind us all together in the same spirit this morning in Jesus name give us the way as usual I want to request for your undivided attention and try to limit movement as much as you can yeah and plus that your phone is in silence so that you can be here a hundred percent praise the Lord I want you to look at that you know how many I've ever read this portion of scriptures okay what about those who have never heard of this portion of life and so I want to believe that we are all Christians and so um here was a man a man who whose days had come to an end and God now sent a prophet to him and you know God is always in the business of sending prophets Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he never changes so if he did send prophets once you will always send foreign [Music] man believe in prayer great women have been women of prayer and if you want to be great in this life you must be a man a woman of prayer if you are not a prayerful man or woman you are not great but if you are a prayerful man or woman right you are a great man or a great woman and so this was a king and with all that he had done for the Lord suffering and affliction and I want to say that suffering and afflictions are a part of our Christian journey and many times many times [Music] it might sound strange but it is not strange one point in your life you know once always for us to keep focused on those things the devil's plan is to allow you to focus on those things and God will not take them away he will not take away those things a Christian suffers Affliction and we went through that sometime back and you're driving that every Christian in this world at one point will suffer Affliction how men have ever been in need I'm not speaking something strange I'm talking about our everyday life yes how many have ever wanted to have something how many have ever been desperate you know in every continent there is a problem that is the Western World you find a lot of natural disasters and a lot of sickness well now you you find that you will they will get Wildfire back to normal and people will lose their property foreign foreign [Music] [Music] physical problem is lack of that's why people become you know they become hard-hearted you know people don't go to churches anymore even when they do they have a form of godliness you have also seen many fresh pastors of us is to try and make some money for themselves they just go there and do some comedy back again people usually are calling for I don't know why over there you know they just deceive woman in people are and oh they just can't take the money I want you you know I I want to show you something here you know they play their games many times it is whenever you see a Ministry settled on a man it is already a false Ministry true Ministry is usually zeroed on Christ I'm wearing double two full is strong our emphasis is not a man a man our emphasis is not our Bishops our emphasis is on the word of God Jesus Christ that's the purpose why we are Christians because they want money and they will get this money and they will try to go marry second wife and they will go abroad by Mansions they will drive cars which look like people never foreign [Music] [Music] but you know when Jesus came in I think it was Simon's house you know they never washed his feet they never they never cleaned him up he never gave him a good seat and they simply told him they just looked at him okay and he walked in and went to a park a seat and nobody attended to him let me tell you that is the uh the the the condition of the churches of Our Generation they have invited Jesus to come in their churches yes they have not attended to him how have they not attended to him by not hearing the word I'm not preaching the word what makes them accepted is not the word play it with foreign foreign foreign praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen I am not standing here to entertain you sir I'm standing here in the name of the Lord give you the word of God give you the mind of God I have waited upon goddess of seeds I am not giving you the word of God they can now say foreign right in our Amina everything can failure there are two things which can never pray anybody what is the word of God they are never fails anyway these are your weapons bear is a weapon but any believer can use and praise God it works how many can shout and say it works you can never be spiritual not to pray because you can't say I'm so spiritual and Beyond prayer you can never be Beyond prayer if you don't pray you are not a Christian foreign prayer is the only communication medium between God and Men amen I want you to see this in a message Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever said well I believe some places the some place the Bible says when the weakest of saints God to their needs Titania Khan Kana but what a woman not a powerful one who is weak here when you go to your knees never begins why why because they know the outcome of that is what a powerful and a privilege had been given to the church I mean when you fall to your knees in a prayer Masala even the devil's tremble name is Simone to the weakest of Christians you don't have to be powerful you don't have to know how to speak in tongues you only need to believe in God you believe in Jesus [Applause] trouble and suffering baby [Music] God answers praying always with all prayer and you need to be very fast right so he says praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching the country with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints we are reading Ephesians 6 18. this is sometimes foreign [Applause] [Music] you know you've grown within you no Cinder you know you know you you know when you you are in trouble and then you've got yeah you think about what you're going through knowing that this is the solution then you you know you go into supplications foreign if you you if you cannot shut tears in prayer you have not prayed buttons [Music] am I speaking to someone here if you think you're a prayer warriors God is calling for prayer and I'll prove everything I'm saying by the Bible in James 4 7 it says resist the devil and he will flee from here how do you resistance Hallelujah when you take your knee watches you that's why the devil always fight serious he doesn't want you to go to your needs when you're about to go there bring something by the way I need to do this actually and now after you've done everything then the baby cries I have to go to work I have to do this you may never find time to pray that is where our solution is no matter how big our problems is no matter how big the devil is the solution yes sir I mean praise the name of the Lord believe in God 1953 he says that is the reason the prayer of faith shall serve the sick your father and prayer overages Christ gave us The Authority with his name by being Christians the most powerful weapon is the most powerful weapon is [Applause] it even changes everything my goodness it will change the mind of God oh Christ it did do it after death was pronounced foreign [Applause] so if is that powerful that is my we do not realize how great it is we don't really realize how great prayer is foreign foreign my mother would go to the bedroom and pray for night prayers because hallelujah amen God answers prayer I'll I'll show you an example here let us go to the book of Acts chapter 12. it's a little long reading but it's very powerful for us and I wanted to go through it you can open there open there with me and let us read slowly your brother put the cross on the screen was kept in prison had brother Solomon brother Force kept in prison I prepared this before but Solomon was in prisoners kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church God for him and when he wrote a Herod would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with the two chains and they keep us before the door kept the prison listen when he says and behold the angel of the Lord came upon him foreign and raised him up saying hallelujah hallelujah Peter was just there brother can you come up here it's just down kneeling down together is this magic this is greater than magic is greater than magic is greater than witchcraft oh my goodness because prayer involves the greatest power in heaven on Earth and his chains fell off from his hands to him God thyself and bind on my sons and he went out and followed him and who is not that it was true which was done by the angel but bro thought he was saw a vision and the second word they came up and I get the leaders unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and went out and passed on on through one street and forth with the angel departed from him I don't care who has crossed the cats must open and it is things like that let me tell you the name of the Lord will be disappointed she will not marry him Hallelujah listen and when he had to considered the thing he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was back we have many gathered together everybody right now yes and as Peter not at the tower of the gate Adams came to her he can named Rhoda and when Road knew Peter's voice she did not open the gate because of joy and gladness and so she read and told how Peter stood before the gate and they said unto her uh oh my goodness but she constantly affirmed that it was even so then they say that it is the it is when they had opened the door and they saw him they were astonished Hallelujah Hallelujah I said I said Hallelujah Peter was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceiling by believer who believed in prayer they come together they say let us pray for them now that we're together it was not a one person we are now together imagine if the weakest of Christians what about if they're more weak Christians uh say what what year um you are weak I understand I am weak I know my brother come together let us be together you may be weak no problems oh my goodness another sister it was supplication oh my God I don't know oh my God oh my God it is go away somebody thank you foreign [Music] but thank you so um foreign don't know [Music] the same one um what do you think is impossible captain things are going to happen it will happen in such a way that you will not believe so they worked with with the angels I believe it was even working carefully yeah oh my goodness come on get in the description and he went out and followed him and wished not that it was true which was done by the angel that thought that but thought he was he saw a vision foreign [Music] Hallelujah my goodness I just feel like speaking in tongues that she was anointed because he was crazy think about it what are your iron again rather even what are your iron again my sister back there what is your iron gets bringing us out original reaction you know in every area of your life that's where to open he said we have to bow down of his voice of prayer is the voice of God hallelujah I mean and the iron gets open on their own Insidious and they went out foreign [Applause] that man was left outside with when you when they get is closed my brother continue on proceed press on don't give up black secretary what do you think he was doing they called they said he had a witchcraft [Music] and you know what happened the gate said okay it gets open and I believe the gods were surprised they said this man is the witch how can he come in just like that who even opened for him so when we reach the throne room [Music] come on so the man of God continue to pray come here immediately and the man who was facing the other side hey what are you saying whoever you want to talk to you will talk to them I say hallelujah stop and quit fearing you have a powerful weapon or the natural Quran use it everywhere because of everyone you go and submit your application against the ceremony after that don't just go there I did it very well I'll be giving the job Hallelujah they would think you are crazy but brother prayer answers hit them so it is [Music] Amina research the Angels appears were never there is a prayer family angels are ministering Spirits from Before the Throne of God and whenever you pray God is constrained I don't understand don't ask all Angels where are you trust your prayers who don't believe that we have access to God speak to God you are not as you are sinner you cannot speak to God the final name of someone who died and is rotten in hell yeah foreign foreign [Music] the ones who go to heaven die when they are saying and here the Bible says Peter was in prison the Saints we are praying that's what the Bible says the ones who are praying we are saying I have say it's here today if you believe jealous if you believe Jesus as your personal savior baptizing water in his name is you accept this serving Grace foreign foreign are you foreign and Mary Maryam is in heaven now never talking in time what makes you think that Mary can be your mother if you can speak Chinese what makes you think you'll be with her church yes if you want angels to appear and it's an angel sent down from heaven and if you don't believe in angels and if you don't believe Angels administering spirits sent from the presence of God then you don't know the Bible angels and Ministries have you ever seen engines the financials never appeared to me then you need to do this if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on God in the world are off the things of the world go about your business go to your church what you're watching the dishes keep your mind on him all day and all night long the words foreign foreign [Music] foreign hmm foreign you know such words right here it's like I'm here in Kansas

rest of the big families America [Applause] while Peter was in prison Angels appear today and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and foreign and she went back and told them because when God did what they had prayed foreign [Music] [Music] Peter thought he saw a vision if you pray God will say I have had thy prayer foreign who [Music] to the extent you will think that you are seeing a vision that Visions began to pass foreign foreign [Music] with him they are not ashamed they must swallow old and yeah when it comes to prayer Supernatural to the extent you think is a vision he will do things for you that you will be too shocked to believe they are true [Music] how many however God did something for you am I dreaming prayer is talking to a real God who does real things it's all in

Isaiah had spoken he left because the man of God Hezekiah prayed immediately yeah but if you pray they pray you pray now God May answer tomorrow but if you pray tomorrow God will answer the next day he said and that's done again the unity until Hezekiah the captain of my people who can make as a human language the god of David thy father I have heard thy prayer that is the sweetest sound on Earth foreign but this now you know is greater than Visa exception Visa this you know rather than a job acceptance this you know it's good at a proposal acceptance this is answer that for me I have seen
