greet you all once again in the precious name of Allah amen it was a marvelous time I don't know how many of you really caught the concept I was just speaking with brother Isaac and both of us agreed that the morning service had way too much content to all the young people need it and I might also encourage you to go back after you've left here when you've got your dormitory and listen to that again and you can after leaving these meetings you can choose to go and listen to them again and so I believe it will it will be a blessing not only to you later on that we'll be able to hear them so this uh this afternoon um by uh by show of hands let me see those who know or had I've had brother Isaac and general minister okay just just those from Nairobi anymore from Uganda okay two all right so I can see we don't have any expectation that's good and bad yeah oh oh okay pastor Emma is correcting me saying the expectation must not be very high brother Isaac and uh brother Isaac and and I uh go back um I don't want to say many years because myself I'm not many years ago and uh his uh he ministers at uh Pastor Wycliffe kabel was church in Nairobi awareness in Nairobi and I have I I the first time I I got an opportunity to sit under his ministry was when we visited there we were on Uninvited and we just showed up with my wife and so I sat and it happened that he was the one ministering communities thoroughly enjoyed this ministry life was really very much impacted and as I sat there I said to myself many young people need to listen to this ministry I don't know how many years ago was that maybe like I said this was not a plan or an arrangement which was made ahead of time I did not plan for him to be here he did not plan to be here I've also had an opportunity to travel with him to Nigeria once I was invited over there to preach some convention and then he came right um God gave us wonderful time many young people were filled with the Holy Ghost in those meetings and we have we have also had some quite uh light memories when we were you know it was like a camp meeting and writing in Nigeria they told us now in the morning we are going for a morning cry so we did not know myself and brother Isaac looked at each other what is a morning Cry he's an organization so this Brethren what they do they get um I don't know how to call it but just maybe bottles like metallic bottles [Music] some some Stone to some things and then they just begin [Applause] they said evangelism we went but we stopped on the way and we went back because brother Isaac can die our evangelism that we are used to do ranga brothers that's what we do and I think that's also another connection I have with him so we've got a moment someplace we went to a Township uh one of the villages and he spoke together and that was wonderful so this afternoon speak to us amen amen and uh he will be speaking two meetings in these meetings and also one tomorrow so let us be expected the Lord has already given us although some people think I look older than both of them actually his last born is 12 years and I know there are many of you who thought he was not even married yet so brother Michael is not young he's about to be a grandpa how old is your first one 18 18 is his first born he has three children he didn't tell us all that the word amen Amina amen so let us stand and we'll sing A Chorus and uh we Brothers think he's here he's here and then we will invite brother Isaac to come the Japan is a brother I mean I can just give him that microphone he's easy

that has ministered to us since yesterday and as I step in father I'm asking for your grace may it be at the end of this meeting that all together we can say it was worth to come for these meetings thank you for our precious brother for finding it better that we could assemble together foreign [Music] praise the Lord do we love the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah no no that is not enough praise the Lord hallelujah [Applause] this afternoon [Music] amen Amina I invite you to read the Bible I always feel like we go to the world the other things we say later on together I've already tried to campaign that I don't stand but I could not be listened to now amen Amina I want us to open our Bibles in the Book of Genesis chapter 32. and I believe that we are all happy to be in the house of the Lord foreign foreign the Bible says and he arose up that night and took his two wives and two women servants and his 11 Sons and passed over and passed over the fort jabok and he took them and send them over they broke and sent over that he had and Jacob was left alone and there is so the man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's die was out of joints and he wrestled with as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the daybreaker and he said I will not let thee except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be no more Jacob but Israel for as a prince has thou power with God and with men and has prevailed verse 29 and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pretty thy name and he said wherefore he said that thou Dost ask after my name and he blessed blessed him fair and Jacob came called is the name of the place peniel for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved and as he passed over penual this the sun rose up upon him and he halted upon his die therefore the children of Israel eat not this new witch trunk which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in in the snail that shrunks is zombie amen we may be seated and may the Lord bless them if I would say I want to talk about the junction of the name change and if we can go back a bit singer today okay before this experience of course we know the history of uh ESO at Jacob [Music] the fight started when they were in the womb and God had already said the Jacob have is and therefore there is nothing that that Jacob could do neither is Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 from us eight I think Romans 8 verses where Paul spoke about these two children yes verse 9 Romans 8 Romans 9 9 is for This Is The Word of Promise at this time I as at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son but not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even our father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of what but of him it was said unto her that the Elder Shall Serve young as it is written Jacob have I loved and air so have I hate it from where my brother left [Music] something in USA praise the Lord that was deposited by God and it is not your liking I don't see sorry this happened all the time in Nairobi that there is nothing that Elsa or Jacob could have done because these things were ordained of God and me and you we could not help that being where we are today you may have loved to be somebody else you would have loved to have another color complexion but before the foundation of the world even before there was words amen one thing you can never afford is to keep quiet when I'm preaching City Kenya amen at this

a long time that you want for one you know and and just spending more time in the presence otherwise you would have had also six or seven Services I think it's a good thing for the bride to gather

not going to have young people together we are not going to have young people doing this again foreign [Applause] [Music] well I think we're having different preachers brother Mike was a different

for supporting us sending us your young people confidence in us as you clearly can see we are only interested in one thing here the presence of God nothing else and um as I know that in most of the youth meetings we usually have youth uh questions and answer sessions I'm sorry to disappoint you we are not going to have it in this evening do you have questions and answers going to have it because it was already hard yeah we did one one or two weeks ago one or two weeks ago so if you really want if you have a question go on stream the service that life bought hard on questions and answers good
