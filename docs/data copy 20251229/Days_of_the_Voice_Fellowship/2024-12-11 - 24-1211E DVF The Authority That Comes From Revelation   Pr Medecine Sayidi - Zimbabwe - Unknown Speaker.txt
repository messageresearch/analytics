for the for this weekday service I know there are more here online than is here uh but we are so grateful to see uh Brothers also who have joined us from different fellowships amen we we appreciate the fellowship um today is a blessed day for us uh initially we did not know that our visitors will be with us today uh I had thought that we shall just be traveling actually today morning to PA but pastor Pastor Nur just told me a few days ago he told me that no the arrival is on Friday so uh that means we shall be traveling very early in the morning tomorrow for the meetings in paa um it's a big meeting I was told about 2,000 people or more we coate your prayers uh that the Lord will you know move people coming from Sudan and all over West so we trust that the Lord will just help us amen so when I knew that the arrival is is Friday I told Pastor medicine so we are also going to Ina we are going to get a do before before we go but the enemy has not been happy Pastor s arrived um yesterday initially you know he he realized he had an 8 hour layover that that time he was supposed to be with the Believers in Addis but uh something happened and you know they told him at the airport um you know 8 hours is very little for you to get a visa to you know enter so he stayed at the airport for eight hours so it was like a big punishment and uh then after 8 hours of waiting he took the connecting flight to so when he arrived at he couldn't find his luggage you know where all his clothes are and all the other things so I mean I waited for him almost two hours until I asked him what is happening in there and he said well I can't find my BS so that's another frustration again so from from where he we left the airport without it so I told him that we have a service this evening and U brother our brother Ken also arrived today from Nairobi and and so brother brother brother Ken and I were talking with Pastor side and we agreed with him I don't know how brother k put it but in his own words it was there's a way he put it that uh you know he would use my suits today it sounds like a joke but the reality is he did not know whether he would get his clothes for this evening service until just a few minutes ago so I called in at the airport several times until the lady then says oh it has arrived amen picking it was another hustle I I I called brother sham and I told him just h a fly you have get in there because he was in get in there and pick and so he tried his best took about an hour or so and then more than an hour to drive here what I'm trying to say the devil has hindered the man of God to speak to us today but he did not Prevail amen and that certainly means God has something as we were driving home from the airport with Pastor side this part I had not told you um you know we found I don't know what happened yesterday just some terrific traffic we spent almost more than two hours I think it was very terrific so um but the Lord has been gracious I always say when the when the devil fights something so much that means that God is going to do something so I want you to be under great expectation these men have sacrificed a lot to be with us today um I always say you know feel like we're not worthy even we are so thankful that we can be here that you can be here and even those streaming online I just pray that the Lord will speak to you so Pastor side brother K and I we will be taking meetings in paa this weekend Pastor n invited us for a convention there remember us in prayers just remember us in prayers I would like to invite Pastor side but before we do that let me invite brother Ken to come and greet you [Applause] amen uh God bless you church I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ God bless you are you happy to be in the house of I'm happy to be here tonight and I believe you're under great expectation I don't know if you're chared up like I am but I know something is going to happen and I want to come out of this place with the testimony that something has happened to me I want to personalize this testimony as we turn to our Bibles very quickly in the book of Second Kings and know I just have about five minutes to greet you and I couldn't think of any other better way to greet the saints of God rather than encouraging them with the word of God in the book of second Kings chapter 4 now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the Creditor has come to take unto him my two sons to be bondman and Elisha said unto what shall I do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house [Music] what hast thou in the house and I want to POS the same question to you tonight what thou in the house now I know some of you if I ask you tonight you tell me I have some little portion in the house I have some little I have some unruly children what I'm talking about tonight I am talking about this house what hast thou in this house see a woman here that things are so bad for her the husband has died and the Creditor came just after the husband died he didn't come when the husband was alive he came when the husband had died because he thought that maybe this Widow is going powerless but thanks be to God there was a prophet in the land your husband may have died but there's a prophet in the land now the prophet according to his own condition was asking the Widow what do you want me to do for you as a matter of fact I'm poor like you as a matter of fact I have seventh grade education as a matter of fact I do not know the difference between pull pit and Paul P but one thing I want to ask you what hast thou in the house and I want to tell you the question of the Prophet revived the woman completely and this message has come to revive you and I it has come to Quicken you and I realize what is in this house of God because there's something in the Widow's house there was a pot of oil who left the pot of oil I imagine it was the husband you have some oil tonight who left you with a of behold you shall receive power when the Holy Ghost has come upon you receive the Holy Ghost so here was this widow she realizes ah my husband may not be here but I have something from my husband I want to tell you tonight I have some good news mamed is in the grave

good to be back in Uganda my first time coming here it was by invitation by Pastor Joseph and I think it was 2019 and he certainly enjoyed he had never seen me but he met a brother at church was a senior Authority at the University where he was lecturing he happened to be his student doctorate program so he said you must come and preach so the brother said I can't preach but my pastor immediately I saw the invitation come and I said you don't know me and I've never been to Uganda so he says no come something me must come so I came and behold it was good amen it was love at first

I'll be very quick short but there's one thing I know God is here amen there are two things I know God cannot lie God cannot fail amen the devil is alive but God cannot fail keeps his word he comes to church to fulfill his word where he says where two or three are GED in my name there I am in their so I believe he's here not tomorrow now amen and when he's here the miraculous will happen God is super natural whatever condition that you came in there is a power right here now to transform you I believe something is changing you never go back the same way you because he is the same yesterday today and forever thank you Jesus amen let's stand for the reading of the word amen certainly appreciate the exaltation that was given and I knew something amen from that just little exaltation it's a confirmation of the things I wanted to say and I knew he is here God bless you brother Ken so from the portion of scripture that he read amen there was something I wanted to preach just reading the same scripture amen but something said not tonight amen and I wondered why amen and just 15 minutes before I came you know that thing came down and said this is it whatever if I don't preach on something God raise somebody to say it anyhow you ra somebody else to say it any and there's no vain reputation amen there's no vain reputation amen let's open our Bibles to the Book of Mark chapter one we are going to read one verse there Mark chapter 1 we're going to read uh verse 22 the Bible says and they were astonished at his Doctrine for he taught them as one that had Authority not as the [Music] scribes may God add blessings to the reading of his word shall we pray dear heavly father we have open your word read it oh God May the same spirit that wrote this scripture come down tonight Lord anoint our faith may it bring the power of transformation may you hide me that I may not be seen and speak Spirits F spoken words I pray tonight that we may not only be hearers of the word but that we be the doers of the word thank you we bless your name everything into your hands Jesus name we pray amen amen amen richly bless you you may from the portion of the scripture that we have read the Bible says Jesus Christ when he went there and he was preaching in K the Bible says as he was preaching they were astonished at his Doctrine he says he taught as the one that had Authority not as the Scribe this is the difference between Jesus Christ and the scribes when the scribes are teaching it's just intellectual it's just Creeds and do but when Christ is teaching there is Authority there's some power there is a command Hallelujah the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so when he's speaking Hallelujah he's speaking with authority at one point in time they wonder what manner of men is this that even the winds obay his he can come in angry W he can speak to the TR daers he can say peace be still creation will obey him what manner of man is because he spoke with authority and I believe tonight the same power all that God was was P into Jesus Christ and all that Christ was was ped into us so tonight when we are here we are going to speak not as the scribes we are going to speak with authority let me tell you tonight this mountain shall be moved not by Mighty not by power but by my spirit says the Lord hallelujah we are not describing a mountain of problem Hallelujah he was looking Mount Hallelujah the Mount of Olives he was overlooking it and he says if you say to This Not That Mountain ah this he was looking over and say if you say to this mountain moved and be thou cast into the sea the Sea of Galilee was by the sight you would say if you can say to this mountain be thou moved and be cast into the sea not a mountain of problem but a physical Mountain do you believe that tonight when he said it he spoke with with authority and if you say it tonight from the depth of your heart if you speak with authority it's going to happen I've got good news for you tonight you are going to speak with authority Jesus taught with authority thank you Jesus brother Bram says in a message presuming preed 1962 on the 8th of March of paragraph 21 he says now I'm going to teach you on the subject presuming the Webster says to presume is to venture without Authority to take it for granted that's the word presume without Authority just taking it for granted now there's so many people that does that they take it for granted that's all right it's all right to do just take it for granted that's to presume now Israel made a mistake when they did this not only Israel but everybody that does it it will be a fatal mistake when you presume to walk with God when God has not called you to with him when you presume to venture upon that's not scriptural think it will be all right not all right Hallelujah so tonight don't presume don't walk without Authority don't take things for granted your Gathering is not in vain God called you to church and when he called you to church don't take it for granted it's an authority that God has given you and don't take me for GR granted I'm not here on my own I'm an ambassador I'm on a mission God sent me down here I'm not here to play I'm here to make declarations the captives will go free the captives will go free the blind will see the sick will be heal those without the Holy Ghost will receive it I'm not presuming I know why I'm here I know what God gave me and I know what I'm doing Hallelujah I know what I'm doing and I know God will his word hallelujah I'm not presuming I'm not guessing Hallelujah if you are in a wheelchair at the end of the service to walk out [Applause] Hallelujah hallu you're going to walk out of that that headache will leave you now that fibroid that female trouble before you if you know it has left you now I'm not presuming I'm speaking with authority hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's a FAL mistake to come to church presuming amen what time did the song service start no song service does not start when the song leader is on the Serv before the song because you come with expectation you come under expectation and when the song leader stays you start to hear the song that you Desiring you are not venturing without Authority Hallelujah that's why you respond you are under great expectation thank you Jesus don't make a fat mistake don't come to preach if you are not called to preach don't presume no man is a right stand on the except he has met God of the desert and has told you to go preach amen don't presume amen amen so my title tonight Authority that comes from Revelation Authority that comes from revelation there's an authority that comes from a scripture brother Bram because it scriptural Authority amen so it's very dangerous to move without Authority the seven sons of saw one person that was attacked the demon they wanted to Chas that you know what that demon say it says Paul I know Jesus I know who are you an unidentified praying object venturing without know but who are you and you know what those demons did said let's sort this one demon hit seven men they went back to the city naked it unstripped that's a fatal mistake you are not living right then you come to say to a demon in the name of Jesus don't presume that demon will speak back to you I know I know who are you it will reduce you to means don't presume amen the first authority to the book of Acts chapter 19 ver 11 the Bible says God wrote special Miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick and kiefs and apron and diseases departed from them and evil spirits went out of them so Paul would do healing separately there are many ways that God can heal you heals by love God heals by music David would play the the demon that was upon would leave God used by medication God he by hand K God heals by aons different methods God has invested so that you get healed if you are sick tonight you get healed by the preaching of the scriptural Authority when the word is spoken diseases will leave your hallelujah hallelujah God will grant you new internal organs will give you new blood without diabetic without high blood pressure without HIV if a mechanic can service a car give L of oil even tonight God can do a blood transmission he can give you new blood without malaria without the sickness in your body Hallelujah you in that blood from your father you inherited that blood from your father but there's a blood that speaks better what is the blood that speaks better tonight it is the blood of Jesus Hallelujah if you are sieker and speaking a scriptural Authority you are free now you are free now and Earth Heaven and Earth pass away but this word manifest in your life Hallelujah it is enough just to read the Scripture it is enough just to hear the scripture being read over your life the world that we see now was created by Things Not Seen created by that are not available God spoke those things they became a reality the word we have spoken tonight is able to create another world and you can go and live that well what is that scriptural Authority here you take his hand you take his upo the people that were sick be healed Hallelujah he knew whatsoever he touches it was blessed where did he get it from Brother BR said where did he get it from he had read the book of second king 4: 929 when Elijah say to G get up my loins and take my stuff in your go thy way and if you meet any man don't greet him if you meet anyone don't answer him just lay my stuff upon that little bo you will raise up Paul never heard that says the Lord Paul never saw a vision read a scripture and he know Jesus is the same yesterday today and it is enough tonight after scripture has just been to move in the power scriptural Authority and say it is enough that's why Paul take a hand catch when somebody touches it sickness will depart God brought special Miracles by the of even tonight you are not going to experience and Miracle a special Miracle just a scriptural Authority Hallelujah just a scriptural Authority when the scriptural Authority has been given Hallelujah it is enough they did not go to preach until they were T wa you are filled with the power when there to wait for 10 days so that they re re the baptism of the ho ghost when they received that power they knew they the scriptural Authority Hallelujah to call and preach the gospel Hallelujah so even tonight because I receive the Holy Ghost I have a scriptural authority to preach to you tonight amen there is power that comes from scriptural Authority you is aie you have the scriptural Authority the Bible says ask anything there are no limitations Hallelujah ask anything I will give it to you Hallelujah ask anything what do you want what do you want anything not something anything the Bible says if any two of you shall agree touching anything let me tell you tonight whatever you need I'm agreeing with you Hallelujah that makes two of us it says if any two shall agree imagine husband and wife wanting a male child and the scripture says there's no in Israel I can say there's no bar in if you need a child there's a scriptural author anything in my name I will do it the president has got limitations May has got liit but the creator of Heaven there no limitation am I breaking barriers of limitations in your life anything not tomorrow now ask anything in my name God will come down fulfill it not tomorrow am I hearing you tonight brother Bram was preaching at one point in time there was a sister in church amen that sister had a boy who back and he was a soldier boy and brother Bram says I me in church soldier boy you're not going to commit suicide soldier boy you're not going to commit suicide that soldier boy was not in service but who was in service the mother you are in service your situation is not in service but the pit can address your amen it's not going to happen it's not going to happen whatever the enemy wanted to do I render it powerless I'm declaring tonight it's not invoid the situation you left back at home is not going to happen Hallelujah Heaven and Earth will pass away forever scriptural Authority when Sam with but when he was sh of that head Lost That Power amen you have power if you believe the word power if you live life but the moment the devil shaves you takes that power you lose that power some the Philistines are P you go like other times but you realize something has G amen but if you stay in scripture as long as they are Philistines they always be under your feet tonight cancer cancer is under my even tonight whatever it is it is under my feet because I've have read the Bible I read the word God keeps his word there power there's a scripture Authority Hallelujah scriptural Authority that we can apply to over your situation amen it wasn't God that lost the battle it was the servant that he sent that lost the batt what did he do he sh his but I than God Amen when he was grinding the me hair begin to grow I feel your faith muscles are your faith you feel something it's not sensation that's the presence of

also bless them we thank you Lord and even we are seeing a successful Mission the W for the glory of your name in Jesus name amen amen amen uh we we will give a offering shortly but before I just have two announcements uh one those of you who are here and maybe those also from different fellowships I know there many also been streaming and you have not yet registered please register for the Youth meetings in janary you know registration is very important because it gives an estimate to the people arranging to us who are arranging the meeting I was talking with Pastor side and he was giving me report of the youth convention which just concluded they were expecting is it 2,500 something like that convention in and they received 4,500 people so you can imagine you have to accommodate them you have to feed them and you've not been expecting them so it's really Unbecoming when we can encourage when we can encourage our young people and ourselves as well to just register it helps us if you can register then we know how many to expect and also we know how to plan for it and also our youth camp has been fought a lot this year we've had several venues canceled on the last last minute and our current venue has been lanzi insute and uh about a week ago we received news we can they cannot hold our convention but as our pastor was preaching I tapped into that to receive our own place for the meeting I believe the Lord will do it me I received it I don't care how long it takes I believe God will do it but um this is a little premature but because I know there are others streaming and those of you from other churches I thought it is appropriate to let you know um we will confirm it in in the next week I believe uh we might be holding our meetings at U Cham University and also we will be having accommodations around chambo College we shall make announcements on on that change next week so but just pray for us that the will of God will stand and also help us and register so it
