uh greet you each and every one of you in the name of our lord jesus christ and i believe that the lord will bless you today as we uh do this fellowship as we have our fellowship this evening i i believe that whatever it is that is in your heart will be granted now i'm sorry we were left because we have to have an echo i don't know where it is oh what was it there yeah okay now um i would like to apologize for being late uh we never thought that we'd be late because we left quite early but as you know we went into the hospital we were delayed uh you know last night my wife there is left because you know the child was having a high fever she was running a high fever so all through the night so i decided to go into speed and do some checkups cause we prayed we lived for his healing so we said let's go to the hospital and find out if that demon is still there so when we reach there the doctor told us the demon is not all diseases are demons all sickness is demons so the doctor checked and they say that the child is and whichever say that you should just keep giving the child bananas to try to put down the fevers if they come so we believe that the others heal the child and uh amen so uh without wasting more time i know time has been one hour has been taken so we'd like to take time right away and i saw sister peace she came so i'd like to first of all give your testimony these books i'm not even open them yet uh these books i've just come from south africa uh you know i i have a set of these books but i i gave one of the books to uh to one person i gave them this this one and they never returned it so it's book one book two and book three of the supernatural books uh so i i wrote a brother a pastor a friend in south africa and uh the writer will save this one i think this is the third business i wrote him i told him i would like to buy if i have to play but he instead just sent me so i don't know i don't know who would be blessed to read first hallelujah hey i know that many people have read one and they are waiting for book two so well be blessed whether you praise me i will give the read book too fast it is right here waiting i don't know who is going to be fast it is right here then i also have uh several booklets here i don't know who wants to read them first these are all messages this one is called uh this one is called goddess wrapped gift this is called wash wash the top of cotton i think he's taking this uh from the saturn church edge so it's an except for the charge this one then also there's another one uh why it had to be shepherds there's another one if it's very clear by prophets there's another one they're falling apart of the world so i don't know who is going to be fast reading these books amen okay i don't want to keep these books these are the this white happy bishop was reading fast okay one person here doesn't have appetite if you don't have appetite it's up to you [Music] you have to behave as if you have other life right away even clear by prophecy okay that book i need it because we are we are reading the church edge book i'll give you some time i need it in four weeks in four weeks bring it back and don't bring it back until you're finished reading it and you must give it to me by information i hope i made myself clear so if you you thought you were having an appetite for taking a book to make it happen way unto you so i believe you take it serious and read it you have enough time for which is really a long time because really these summon books are uh are preaching you know it's like a preaching of one service it sits down connect can you put that just to minimize it he just uh uh sits down and he preaches he preaches the service it reaches someone for maybe one hour two hours actually if you read it you can read it maximum four hours you'll be done with it don't read it as if you are uh yamaha you know as if you're eating reference and again you eat them even when you're listening never listen to the message like that you should listen to finish it because it's the preaching which people are sitting there so me when i'm saying i behave as if i'm sitting there with those brands i'm saying i mean with them until the summer is finished then i i say oh today i was blessed you see i don't just say ah let me listen to two minutes okay i'll now cause i'm listening no don't do that are you reading now are you listening to your message don't listen to the message like that you enter into the inspiration then you will get the appetite praise the name of the lord now we are happy the church ended with us and uh and as usual i'm going to begin with a a few people uh first of all i would say if those uh some are picked up and they have something they read that they want to share with us i will give each of you two to five minutes whoever wants to share first whatever it is that they have read on the on the chat book yes move first oh no i thought you were going to come running [Music] who first [Music] no one first should i choose myself yes [Music] oh our sister fast all right this is unfortunate us what what was it that was so you know uh that was so touching to you and and something that you really read i know i have a few questions that came from you some of you i'm going to deal with those but i will uh i will handle them after i usually want to hear from you first especially john jesus wrote through john and the revelation the singles prophecies happened jesus wrote this book himself like a prophecy just like for the next years what is going to happen we are seeing exactly what is happening and the end is near and one thing is that god respects his word and he fulfills his word so if you say this it sure has to come yes he doesn't promise and does it so whatever he said if it is not yet first it's going to pass [Music] [Applause] and it talks about uh she talked about something the book it's the book of prophecy can we have some other volunteer i would like you to follow that if you don't know i'll pick you anyway so it would be better for you before i pick you and then you yes [Music] [Music] so i also blessed that and it became so exciting [Music] i've been thinking but yesterday like sunday but when i read it well i took my time i was alone i took my time to read it i read the bible this [Music] so it's really not that day but it's only that when you give him you give yourself to him then you rest from like controlling yourself you rest from making opinions for yourself you know the rest are then given you sit and then someone takes over yes so actually that was the meaning of the servant and i was so blessed by that friends of course what's [Applause] amen so you see uh when someone shares something that they read even when you might have read the place you might not even understand when someone comes up says something about the same thing that you have read and then it kind of enlightens you so that's quite good uh god bless you brother okay now uh let us have someone else yes from the first chapter what's what was the light i was explaining about jesus jesus was just an empty name given by people so we passed our own time when speaking about how god and jesus are one i understood that jesus is just an ugly name what that's actually a question okay god bless you now which what area are you differently can you refresh that portion that which made you realize that you don't have your jacket it's a big okay you have it so you want to read it for us okay are you there you want to read for us brother what does it say okay right for unto you he's born to stay in the city for unto you he's born we stay in the city of david and savior which is christ alone he was born the christ and eight days later he was circumcised and he was named jesus even as the dictator told him i was born abraham when i was born he gave me the name william he was christ that was given a name down here among men the outline men could see us both jesus he was the lord so glory the almighty manifested in flesh is god the father son and holy ghost is over go ahead father son and holy holy ghost other status they are not names that is why we baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for that is a name not attached it is the name of those titles just like you take a number who is a son and name him baby is what it is son is the title then you name him but amen but there is only one of them born the christ and he says lord who is that there's only one born the christ and that is our lord jesus christ okay now uh the this portion that you read was really uh you want you you want to add on what you just read you want to say something which patterns yes i made a mistake very nice okay that's good i'm glad you said it go ahead uh that's what in the name of the lord jesus christ for that is a name it is the name of those titles just like take anyone baby and then [Music] jesus was not a title of god jesus was a name he was born the christ okay just like you you are born and abu you are you are born me i'm born you know my father's name you you're born academic you're you're born you understand so you are bor you're born in your family where was jesus before he was born he was in god you know in the beginning was there one and the one was with god and the one was god and the one put on flesh so before he put on flesh he was with god he was ill god he was with god with what means he was together with god you see the spirit and christ means spirit the anointed one so jesus christ was born the christ he was not born a man he was born the christ he was god who has put on flesh but the name that he was given hallelujah that name was given to uh a son who was born that name was given to a child who was born and that flesh and blood all right and that name was jesus but jesus has a big symbolism jesus means uh jesus means jehovah our salvation jehovah has saved us amen amen and so he was born ah the christ was born the christ that's who he was okay he was god but he was but as a as a human being he was then given a name as a human being that's why that name was not given to anybody before jesus was born you see but the team did preach a very good summon on this and he titled it jesus the name about all names i'm going to put that a booklet for you and i will give you to read me i'll do my part it is upon you also to do your part to make sure you read this thing that we give to you so but he really explained it very well in rwanda and in english we are going to have those booklets and i will give it out to you jesus the name of our audience god had been called millionaires okay of course jehovah said is his name but jehovah was in many forms all right he went on revealing his his his characteristics he wasn't revealing his attributes and he had never revealed himself as a savior as a redeemer as a savior he wasn't to die for human beings only in jesus did he reveal that that's why it says there is no name whereby we can be saved it's only through the name of jesus because the name of jesus is the name about all names even the names of god it's the name about all names god that god has ever had the name of jesus but you see it's not jesus only you know we have a nation uh of jesus only people you know the denomination of the uh uh it's called upc in the united states and others they call themselves apostolic church and they baptize in jesus name but you see we in the message have been made to understand is not only jesus it's not all that jesus only you know that name has been magnified and and then and in in acts chapter 2 he says that this jesus that you are crucified god has made him what both lord [Music] so accepted by saturday at six really yes go ahead say that all the householders where they are from you know assuredly that yoga has made him both lord and christ this jesus this jesus whom he crucified god has made him who both lord father and christ christ that's why balaam says in there he says that he was the lord of glory the almighty manifested in flesh the almighty manifested here he is god the father he is god the son he is not there holy ghost you see he's all of it hallelujah why because god was made manifest in flesh and god is all those titles these are just titles but his saving name you know there's a national record of overweightness and they their major teaching is but jesus is god his name is jehovah and they are for everybody calling god by another name they are wrong but you say we know that his name was jehovah and his name is steve jehovah you know but you see that is not the saving name of god because there's only one name whereby he has died there is only one name whether he has given himself to die and that name is called jesus christ amen that name is jesus and that name has revealed you see father son and one of us are just titles they are not names that is why we baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ for that is a name not a title it is the name of those titles just like you take a new one okay right now of course father is lord son is jesus holy spirit is christ and the name is lord jesus christ so it is wrong to bypass in jesus name and it is wrong also to be our place in father and holy spirit but it is right to baptize in the name of the lord jesus because that is the name hallelujah about your name and you were reading that part what did it say god has made him both christ lord and christ that was wonderful amen the father mentioned something about the sabbath do you mind giving us an exposition on that where did you read it how many have reached reached the apartment's vision raised up your hand by the lord jesus have one brother has reached the path most vision oh and yours you are finished oh good everybody else yeah you're playing that's not play let's wake up maybe i should stop these things of sampling we should go one by one and then we see what you have covered and what you want to say about what you have covered but i think we should keep the face because if you don't keep the best we shall not be able to finish this quickly because now we are still in the first chapter of the revelation of jesus christ okay brother you want to i do not know if it would be wise to go to the party must vision when nobody has reached there so can we push the partner's vision to the next uh tuesday meeting do you promise that all of you will be will have to finish the past must be do we have a unanimous vote on this so all of you should be done on tuesday with your partner's vision tuesday we are not going to go back in the revelation of jesus christ so now today i want us to discuss anything in any part of the revelation of jesus christ whatever it is that is going on and maybe to inform you some of the questions that you send me uh please keep sending them keep sending them i uh i have uh informed a friend of mine a brother he's a very very good teacher bible teacher in this message i really appreciate him and his ministry when i was when i have just become a minister in this message i used to listen to all of his teachings and to read a lot of his notes and it really helped me to understand the message he's a brother he for them you remember the youth meeting we had yes so in uk so i'll be invited to him and i'll give him some of these questions and i'll ask him to deal with them directly with you so you give us a zoom on a day like this so uh keep those questions kind of those are tough i feel that we should be with directly those that i feel that you should deal with not that i cannot deal with them but i thought it would be good for you to hear from another voice usually it is very very beneficial so uh i need those questions to keep coming but don't don't stop bring them home bring them but don't ask anything ask things that matter ask substance amen okay sister peace if you're having problems with network that would mean that it is your network not our network and maybe you i would suggest to you that uh you stream via youtube we have a link if you don't have the link on youtube uh who is in contact with sister peace okay can you send her the youtube link you said it right okay you i think you have the youtube link in case this keeps going on and off just uh connect on youtube and if you have any questions you can as well send it to uh somewhere or just post it here as well we shall do now uh okay so uh for the question of uh the issue on the sabbath that's a very good subject but i think everybody should first read it and then we shall deal with it next tuesday the wrong way and now uh can we now proceed how many here and i want to be honest because you are not in a courtroom how many have not finished the revelation of jesus christ okay so you finished the pattern's vision but not the written jesus christ how possible is that you should read it to refresh your mind when we are discussing it now some of things you'll miss it now the things that they have been discussing you know all of them yeah okay okay who else i saw another hand there which i learned oh you you've not also finished it why what happened you just did not read you were doing a lot of sleeping oh you were slow you decided to pause a bit you started with fire then you are going in house room [Music] how far have you born at 34. how okay so i'd like you to discuss all those things that you have great for us i'm giving you something to do right now of course you don't have to discuss everything but some things that start with you and of course these are your brothers there's no one here so don't i know he said that sister shouldn't preach but i'm not asking you to preach i'm asking you to share with us your testimony for what pastor are you ready [Music] yeah and and uh who was that one to them okay do you remember do you remember the portion of the book where it is can you share with us and so that we can read together anybody remember that that portion of uh yes okay but you remember the place so can you open the place now uh-huh brother that's smiley what is your boyfriend can you just the best no one can show that place so if you're speaking of pita coming to the house of cornelius there's a point that i want you to get there all of you okay can you read sister you got it okay go ahead and read it for us [Music] be any holocaust and they said unto them unto what we baptized and they said until andrew jones baptism then say for which should come after him that's that is on christmas when they had this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and then and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them john [Music] [Music] move back to jesus praise the lord that's uh accident one to six okay that's the purpose of the bible study you know we must be able you as a believer you must be able to highlight these scriptures in your bible i remember when i believed this message whatever i was reading was new to me so i had my bible it got old this is like the third bible since then this is my bible so whenever i see something that was so attaching to me or that i would use to witness to others i would say you know all these first pages and the last pages of my bible were full of scriptures here here all these pages were full of scriptures including the first pages here so what i would know some of the scriptures i know but even my hands are going to use that i guess because i'm witnessing to someone i will open it then i get there i read now sometimes i would forget because i do not know how to memorize those bible verses but i would know my handy would you know where to find it from i know that i would go like this just because i know i had marked it yellow already that's what i did in my head i quickly got there and then i said listen and then i read it for them and i tell you they would believe this message simply because i was marking my bible and knowing where the scriptures are and then also if i don't know where it is i would go i knew i had put my own reference back here and i put the bible verse that's why it is good to have a bible may i never god ashamed to walk with that bible if you're a christian and you are shocked with a bible then you are ashamed of christ sincerely you are ashamed of christ you do not deserve to be called a christian because this bible is our identification as christians can you get a shared recovery day you gotta fly no no one here unless you're not a ugandan you cannot be ashamed to call it you've got to fly you know not you can get ashamed to carry the jewish israelite flag no you know you but you you find the arabs burning the jewish flag because they don't identify themselves with them it's not their answer so our enzyme as christians one of those is the bible we should not be ashamed of carrying a bible some of you don't have my bibles not because you can't afford it because you're ashamed of carrying it how would they see me now in the bible those things ah if you're like that even as i'm speaking may god pull that spirit out of you and make he set you free so that you can be able to write the bible you know so i would market those things so now like this scripture that you have done your birth sister i would mark it mark it acts 19 i would know even now i know some of the scriptures because of those times when i just believe it stuck with me some of this will you can just speak and i'll just tell you it is right here i can even open that rookie because i know you see it is stuck with me in my heart even if you take the bible i know it is already i can't even recite it yeah paul was passing you know and then i tell you everything i i might not read it one by one to be accurate but i know the poor a discussion that did not be certain even many other verses there are some verses that you don't have to ask anybody to remind you where they are i can maybe challenge some of you now okay what is uh what does almost 37 say no if you don't reserve your hand no you know okay i must receive it you are not sure what does it say okay you are paraphrased why paraphrasing say it one for one okay can someone kind of sister prefer me now sisters you always will not allow you to preach but even here you can talk what is happening huh you why are you why are you putting it before they get it yeah can you now all of you read it one please let go the lord god will do nothing but your ability to sacrifice andrew's servants the prophets amen that one shows you that god must set a prophet when it is a mystery okay to be revealed okay that one you should know because you're going to tell the people that god has set a prophet in this generation amen you remember the scripture we read last time was it uh on when on when some of you would attend wednesday you missed by the way if you miss wellesley go back and listen to that youtube it will be a blessing to you excuse me now uh also uh we talked about okay anybody knows what it says these are the main scriptures that we must know give us the quarterback okay how what happened in those days [Music] what days are we talking about here the days of noah what are the days the days of sutton the days of now the days of sudden montgomery what happened they aired they married they drunk they gave me money they you know until you know i entered into the ark and the front came and likewise also as it was in the days of lord they did eat they drank they bought they saw they planted they built it verse 29 you see but the same day that lord amen went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all so we're looking at two end times yes so even though it would be another end time and the things which were there at that time will also be there at that end time during that time then the son of man will be revealed and who is the son of man as yes you really missed if you did not get it it was jesus as a prophet he was revealed he he he came rather as a son of man a prophet but again he says he will be revealed again as a son of man in any time during a time like that and when is that time going to come for the hands from now on two years from now when is that end time oh jesus christ we're talking about the revealing of the son of man jesus already came on as a son of mine and that ministry finished now he's in the ministry of son of son of god son of god which is a goddess ghost dispensation we are waiting for him to come as a son of david as a judge now even the miranda is going to be sent them to judge to rule over but remember before he goes back to son of david before he reveals himself as son of deity before he does that the scripture tells us very clearly that he is praying what we have seen there you can actually predict again he is going to reveal himself again as son of man so he's the son of man then son of god then before he goes back to son of david he he again reveals himself as a man son of man remember he is not saying jesus is coming back again in flesh you understand me yes but son of man always means prophets so it means that that as he was on earth and he revealed himself in a prophetic ministry he will reveal himself again through a prophetic ministry before the millennium and the rapture all those things you understand and why did he reveal himself through our prophetic ministry when was that which prophetic ministry was that which ministry come on oh my my are you not sure about it by william branham his ministry was a prophetic minister according to almost 3 7 and revelation 10 revelation 10 what does it say but in the days he has yeah so the the prophet the prophet he says that he's going to oh well please please here now the mystery of god was or is supposed to be finished by the ministry of the seventh angel the ministry of course after this of course we have the church book we are going to learn about the child ages and how they were going so we are still now talking about the revelation of jesus christ so the ministry hallelujah the ministry of the seventh angel is the ministry of the last day prophet can you all repeat those words exactly when i said the last day i mean the early times why when what are the end times when you do the world will be in the southern condition when the one who reject the prophets like they detected noah when the world was so much concerned about building marrying doing this and that kind of thing and during that time the end time god will raise a prophetic ministry and that prophetic ministry the member is always a minister of son of man son of man is a prophet like god was telling a second son a man prophesied to these bones you understand so that the ministry of son of man comes in the end time to reveal the mystery of god but remember the mystery of god is god himself the mystery of god is the word the mystery of god is jesus christ are you following it yes so when he says even it does in other words it will be in the early time it will be in the end of days when the son of man will be revealed again [Music] are we not at that time have you not arrived yes now who is the son of man not a son of man the son of man this son of man is who jesus jesus christ and he has revealed his mystery which means he has revealed himself and hearing it he has revealed himself through that is a a very big statement to make he has it if you because when you speak that way it is as if that was jesus was incarnate revealed where you understand but somebody someone else doesn't understand you see he was because there are some people say oh but i'm gonna come because there has been review to us you are jesus christ no that's not true okay no man is jesus christ okay but we are christ because christ is in us all right but we are not jesus christ there are many christs that shall come in the end which means false and holy ones we are christ because we are anointed but brother was like us but he was a prophet and and jesus christ revealed his himself through the ministry of the entire prophet of the end time era how through healing the sick through raising the dead and especially through the opening of my life through the disaster you see those things now by because at one point he said that this message is christ this message is christ if you don't fine-tune that and you don't take that through the spiritual mind you'll be like what does it mean the message being christ he is talking about the someone was asking me what is adoption that's a good question but i think i'll fall into the bath you see but adultery is a teaching right but then here we notice that the teachings that the the apostles taught the foundations of the gospel they said this which we have told to you this which will preach to you this is the foundation and no man can do that and they say this foundation which we have reg we'll say it is jesus christ that's what they say so in other words jesus christ is the word so the revealing the opening of the word is jesus christ when you receive this word when you believe this one you are receiving jesus christ how can you say you haven't said that just as my second has just come like a wind and enter you know you are receiving and accepting the word and opening your heart for him to come and dwell we even sing that song this is your house this is your house come you have the song there oh you're typing so many ones by the time you get it you shall be done okay yes yes can you project for us on on the on the zoom as well yeah this is a very good song one of the songs that i really really love so much and i i want you to try and read those ones we've set aside istanbul for you lord let your glory feel the sanctuary [Music] of your people lord we unity this is your house [Music] where the this is your heart [Music] [Music] now you say that the the the holy spirit jesus christ through his word he has visited this generation again but you see his word is a revelation of himself so that's why the bottom table is this and the first chapter of the book of revelation the revelation of jesus christ it's all about the revelation of the oh my who took us through all that was it sister this is a rachel oh my what your body was so annoyed okay yeah remember we are here to start we're here to start we will start still trying to learn what each of you have done so you see when you tell us what you have learned much more is coming out of that sister sister please i'll go to you and i want you to tell us what how much you've read what has touched you and any questions you might be having still out of what you have read and anything that you might want to share with us if you don't have a book you can just speak and i don't know what is your book you forgot it what is this doing outside we are you should do read when we are reading okay should we wait while she's getting ready can someone else say yes you're here where am i looking come on go ahead and somebody who is moving that camera what are you doing huh chapter 5. reading in can you read that box system children okay yeah it begins at 21. okay you can read and then tell us what you do not understand now there is a very favorite version of scripture that the trinitarians think pro think proof they put their point of more than one actual person in the good okay it's it is revelation 5 chapter 6 to 8 and behave and look in the in the midst of the throne and of the forests and in the midst of the elders stood alone acids as it had been slain i've been having seven ones and seven eggs which are in seven spirits of god sent forth into all the hearts and he came and he came and took them and took and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon that one and when he had taken the book the four beasts and and four and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them have and golden and golden veins fall off full of others which are the prayers of saints indeed these verses indeed in these verses if if isolated we would would seem to prove their point you you notice i said this isolated isolated verses however relation 4 2 3 and 9 to 11 and immediately i was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one set on the throne and he and he that sat was to look upon like they just and they and the sudden sedan stone and there was a rainbow from round about the throne inside inside like and two and two emerald and when this beast give glory and honor and chance to him stream that sight on the sun who lives with oliver's with with ever and heaven the four and 20 elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worshipped him that leave it forever and even and cast their crew and pass their throne before the throne saying thou had worthy or lord to receive glory and honest and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they have and we are created carefully not in not in verse two it says one not two or three but one sat on the throne in verse 3 it says he not they was to look upon as like as a justice as a dispersal in verse 9 it says that the beast gave honor to him but not them in verse 10 it says that the elders fell down before him today in verse 11 it says they they cried thou had to worry all lord not all lords also in verse 11 it says this one on the on the throne was on the throne was the creator which is jesus john [Music] 1 john 1 verse 3 which is jehovah spirit god of the old testament genesis 1 okay so what is the point of configuring audience the confusion is in that relationship six to eight what is it that is confusing you in revelation five six to eight i think he was talking about i think you want to look at that can you give us a quote therefore bc notice but according to jesus himself who wrote the revelation he sat down with the father the spirit in paul which is the spirit of christ which is the spirit of christ for that is the spirit of prophets whereby words comes says he is set down at the right hand of god but when john looked he saw only one upon the throne and it was not until revelation five six to eight which you're not talking about which follows revelation 4 2-3 in sequence of time but there that we see the lamb taking the book from him that sat on the throne as indicated in revelation 4 2 3 9 2 10. what is it it is the mystery of one god he jesus came out from god that's what he means he jesus came out from god became manifested in the flesh died and rose again and returned to the blossom of the father as john said the only begotten son which is in the bosom of their father we talked about because at the other time he has declared him john 1 18 says it was not now time for god the messiah to come back to claim his bride and then present himself to make himself known to israel that's receivable against stepping forward to assume a physical relationship to a man as the son of david king of kings and lord of lords the bridegroom praise the lord amen see it says uh the the the the okay the bridegroom of the gentile bride it is not two gods but simply one god manifesting is mighty listen to that he is mighty to ruin true offices and titles does anyone understand that question yes he's almighty god the god mighty god manifesting his mighty train offices and idols you see the people knew he was a prophet they knew the sign of the messiah which could only come through the prophet and blah blah blah so he's trying to compare revelation 5 and revelation 4 saying revelation 5 only follows revelation 4. and as you have seen here revelation 4 is speaking of the hymn that was on the throne and then the lamb and then the airless around the throne and then and uh you know he was sitting on the throne and then the elders were around the throne and then the beasts and giving glory and honor to him that some of the throne and then he talks about revelation 5 where is the version 5 yes revelation 5 which also says in the midst of the throne of the forbis and the revelation 5 is a continuity is a continuation of revelation chapter 4. he's not talking about two gods here he's talking about one god but manifesting his offices at different times look at it this way uh do you know what other one you've seen what did god do [Music] when adam and eve sinned everyone is free to talk [Music] okay now you know these are some of the things you're not going to read in the bible but it is there okay if you are the reader but if you are you gotta very good question without revelation you can't understand anything in the bible make sure you remind me when i forget where we were headed i wanted to talk about what god did when he came down right okay so we are reading that in genesis yes and adam verse 20 call his wife's name eve but i don't know what it means which means what [Music] because she was the mother of all you know what matter of all living means that's other meaningful of all living father of all living and and if he's man of all living what does it mean get ready you know when we said that eve means man of origin but adam doesn't mean father of all liberty because eve mattered more than the sons of adam even under the shooting of the suffering also that is king kenya was not the son of adam i hope all of you know that already by now but uh but uh but but adam was only father of of so he wasn't the father did the lord make the call make courts of skin and clothed them hallelujah now the question is brother somewhere what did the bible say is is there's a difference between making and creating he's not saying cut some skill appear no but it meant how do you make a court of skin for you to dress yourself up by killing a cow or by getting a sheep or a goat okay so you make a skin out of a living animal which you you have to keep first are you following me so now have you seen the scripture oh no now saints please follow me here we have to be in one account hey this brother stupid i never knew it was there now you have seen it all right now friends after god makes them this one is symbolic also because my just feel nice whenever i i come to scriptures like this which i have a lot of revelation upon them jesus was represented within this course of scheme the course of skill addressed them was symbolizing jesus christ because it's our court of skills he is the one that dresses us he's the one that clothes us he says the other sense they came up in white white in what's relevant in what clauses it's in the book of revelation and he says this means the righteousness of the saints but when we get our righteousness we do not have our own righteousness our righteousness is not ours it is god's righteousness that he places upon us so you can now see that the righteousness of god comes by what the righteousness of god comes by the shading of the blood and the bible says without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin so if your sins are still on you how can you sell your righteousness you now see that the righteousness of that we have of the saints is really the righteousness of the lamb of god and who is the lamb of god he is symbolized in islam which god came down and they and squeezed and killed and the cross that came out of it was the righteousness that came out of the land are you following me now we see a lamb here and we see the cross of skin that came out of it so we see jesus christ being the lamb and we see the righteousness that comes comes out of him when he died on the cross of calgary which we now receive which we are now beneficial is all but at this time it was adam physically a beneficiary of those gods of skins but who died god or the lamb the lamb now you may say but the lamb and god are different if he's gonna kill you but you know the battle says that you you don't know how it must have failed when he was on the cross crying my father my father why are you forsaking me he said the father looked the other side why madam says that their father looked the other side as jesus died on the cross no angel came back to help him because he is the father and there is now jesus there are two gods no remember jesus was white the one and the one was with god but now here the word was man it was an attribute of god manifested it doesn't mean that god is not quenched in heaven now look at it this way who created islam in genesis how was it formulated was it murdered out of mind how was it made she was a spoken word of god now this lamb was a spoken word of god and in the same way god spoke that lamb where was it before it was spoken it was with god so it was a path of god so by god killing it he was killing himself he was killing it was his creation that's why the bible hallelujah because jesus christ the beginning of the new creation of god because he was created the flesh as in speaking the flesh the lamb was greeted the flesh was created it was created the flesh was but the spirit in him was not created that's why he is called the priest of the most high god medicated who had no beginning of days and who had no end of days with him there is no beginning and no ending of days he is god himself a channel but remember the sun had a beginning and the sun will happen so we are not we whenever talking about god you must see through jesus don't look at the man see through jesus and be able to know that the father was he reconciling the world back to himself praise the name of the lord so the lamb and god at the same time i hope that answers your questions or are you still confused and if you if you do not understand it means i answered another question so you need to tell me exactly which area is completed you are still going to eat but you went so far i went so far and you left what you are going to okay you are asking me do you know how what happened to adam and eve when they were in the garden of eden yes you were going to that answer but you weren't so funny left yes okay can i come back why do you want me to come back now what had happened to adam and eve i wanted to show you is that they sing and when they sing god killed a lamb and the course of skin of the lamb saved them from seed the point is cover them yes all right the lamb acids as it had been slain having seven uns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into the house so your point is the seven spirits of god that is what is confusing you the seven spirits of god is not seven speakers you hear each seven spirits god is a spirit one spirit but you see these are seven spirits meaning one spirit in each age one spirit in each eight for seven edges the same holy spirit divided in seven ages that's why i said it said that doesn't mean certain spirit as in god has one spirit to speak to the spirit's prosperity no it's just like when you say seven church ages or seven churches yeah the bible says seven churches in asia he mentions them ephesians so it doesn't mean that there are several churches does he have seven churches no he has one church but that one church is represented in every age for seven agents that's why we call it seven churches seven church edges because there are seven edges of the same church seven edges where the same holy spirit he's working maybe we can get something about this about the seven spirits yes [Music] okay tell me what part you think i left because since most of you know that i did not finish that point oh yes unless there's something you thought i had left out but i think i did finish what i wanted to say okay there's a quote i'm looking for and i'll read it later but while i'm looking for it i think we're waiting for sister to say something then i'm coming to you brother uh uh brother but first okay before you you you say you're going to speak i wanted to start this quote for me quickly it is a decent church age but not in the church in the [Music] uh are we rich um okay yes in that message such in this message now the seven spirits the seven spirits uh the seven spirits and the seven stars the spirits was the angels that went to the stars which were messengers seven spirits seven different times the holy spirit would anoint a messenger okay seven different times there was another message which was a star in his day a spirit is a tunnel and the star was made for a purpose to reflect right in the dark of the church ages when candles and stars represented the angel of the spirit was the one that went to the star and reflected the star of the holy spirit through the star to that church age you see when you talk about the star we're talking about a messenger but these stars did not work or by themselves they had spirit a spirit that was driving them and that spirit is the spirit of jesus christ the holy spirit so when it talks about the seven species you might wonder who the seven spirits are it is the seven messengers of the seven church ages uh now each time that the star came on the scene the holy spirit came down and anointed that star and he kept it just exactly like the first one was now before we even continue this line sister i want you to understand that the book of revelation is the book of symbols you read something it's not exactly the way you picture it in your mind it means completely something else for instance i'll give you an example of the churches i will also give you the example of a woman the bible said a woman and i saw a woman sitting on many waters and talks about the horns and everything so you are like ah this woman is this a woman means church so that's why we need a prophet because a prophet comes with the holy spirit by the holy spirit by the power of the holy spirit to interpret the scripture the scripture it's not the prophet in the preaching now it is because by the man and preacher and he says god interprets his own word so god by the holy spirit in the priests that work through a prophet because he will not speak to everyone in the sky you know many people come say that god has spoken to them but yet god never spoke so in every generation you will have to send one man with the message of that generation and he will anoint him with a necessary anointing and revelation for that generation praise the lord all that these things make sense to you okay now sister you all ready yeah you already have been waiting i've been waiting okay go for it if you answer something not right now not right now okay oh no yes and what you would like to teach us actually now yeah this is drawing first the flow is yours please can you put the camera on rather these these pictures using their instrument saying that each of these ages such english and they come with an angel of different things [Music] [Music] [Music] in his mother's womb and backwards because he was an angel he also came to us [Music] so him also he had to now uh what was your conclusion and where do you find that conclusion in the book which you have do you have you have a question you want to leave for us no question you want to read and was your question answered not yet yes so you just told me so you just told me that when you get the message you get the holy ghost no that's what that's what that's what you thought because okay so right now do you know how to receive the holy spirit oh okay i do not know who explained this to you but let me try to make some things clear here please go and listen to the wednesday service i answered this question in detail i i i cannot see a mistake i answered it in detail you can go for one for what until you get to that question i think about that we live with it in detail obviously yes also ocala has been a even fostering some summaries of what we covered i love that especially for those of you who didn't attend how many readers whatsapp chats one day what's up with the group how many one two okay now you see that one shows me not you but it shows me what is in your mindset what captures your attention what takes your time ah yes okay okay [Music] uh i didn't see this thing what are they saying so really you people you cannot tell that oh you know we're so busy and we pray and we're really and we do not even you say god has placed us here to be a witness me and the rest of the brothers who have abandoned we are going to do all that we can do anyone who will not be saved which will be out to them but they will not say we never right we never had we never had anyone to encourage us whenever god has lead us here to encourage you to encourage one another amen so you have a phone you have i'm sure most of you have more than one whatsapp group some of them even have to personally believe them because it is just wasting time and wasting your internet message coming through me i had even to remove my uh you see even when you send me a message and whatsapp and i don't answer you quickly this is because i don't get notifications anymore i told you don't send me any notification i will read what's up when i have the time to so when i i i i receive a message i don't even know it came until i get my phone i have a time to read and then respond so because it was getting too much you never do anything that you say let me read this scripture what did he say you you just you get the bible and i just like it the words of almost okay wait by the time you say who was a manga they admitted you see that's how you are hey this thing is going to get ahold of me i decided to do what remove these notifications but now with you and you are young you see your younger people what are you doing with your whatsapp honestly speaking yeah if it is not uh the the things of god and someone was like ah you're spiritualizing everything now if everything about you is not about christ and then what what what is the purpose of your life what is the purpose of your life huh i told you you know i told you to watch that video i don't know if you also shared it with others did you share with them a video of the father who is a millionaire he's a billionaire not a millionaire billionaire one of the richest man in africa here but when he begins to preach this message he swears he's speaking thanks he jumps and shouts i don't hear what he say he even goes and preaches it on the street without a speaker even with the speaker think you're talking with the speaker speaking this is like us here takes it there begins talking and shouting and preaching his message sweating like this and you know it was very hard but he doesn't okay and yes money money just records that into answers and yet he is not there saying ah i have a gift for god and these things and you you are saying i want to really be rich i want to be that i want to be that but you have no time for god and someone who has all those things has more than god than you who does who doesn't have anything that is the key to give this do you think you are busy there are people who are busy this the kind of man i'm talking about the men who make appointments with the leaders of the world i'm told that yeah even a place that you will come and uh one day that i think they made an appointment with the president or someone was i think that the prime minister was making an appointment with his uh with his comfort i think to buy some cars because it sells brand new cars and um and uh you know that was the time when he was supposed to be at church he wrote him back and he said i am sorry i have enough another appointment that same time so i cannot miss it he never he missed the other appointment because what he gave me more important was the appointment with god so young people i'm wondering if we have not reached that level how do we expect god to bless us in the realms of those people that god has blessed i'm talking about blessings of the world if you want the blessings of the world might go faster in your life give you the first period and uh i i told you also of the meetings that i went in a nigerian this place i don't know i went to a place called oshogo in nigeria and i found this you know in the chat you know i found this great king you know is the king she comes with a million of cars and then and that is so far then you know like that you know he believed the message he believed the message but this man i told you what's kings even i think here in uganda i don't know if it is also customary and the kings are not supposed to be moving nigeria their hearts they're not supposed to look at their on the top of their head it is a taboo even when the kid goes to the church because with some of these chiefs you know the nigerian ships and they don't allow him to do anything that would have shaped the kingdom and or anything but the man of god one mother was saying i said one mother you're not having these big drums so he said bye when the morning comes you know how the nigerians say oh when [Music] and you know how they can do it you know they don't have to dance you know so he removed the top and there and he also removed the hat you now know dancing is about to get started the man in dust and sweating i'm sure he must have contained it with the chiefs when he went back but he had i had an interview with him he told me i had to dance for god god is priority number one in my life number one we must respect god i said what this is a king a king i'm talking about a king who owns a domain but yeah he can handle himself and give good time number one he came to church number two he can dance so i'm talking about what if you want god embrace you with your life make good number one first period so surely you have a phone and you have a whatsapp and they have i have not even been seeing anyone personally i'm not saying you should post today you'll notice that no what i'm saying is you know god watches your heart what is it that really steals your heart if you are going into other groups and they're chatting with them it shows you that the people you are working with the people you are relating with are not the right people you what proves you what attracts you is the world and not the things of god because the things of god you are like you give it up you can wait but god you think can wait and then the rest of the things cannot wait i feel i'm here for you my friends use these platforms use these platforms to preach their goods use your status you know what your sentence is what is your status look like this one what is your status somebody tell me what's god bless you thank [Music] your cravings you want people to know you are a holocaust filled son of god tango talking and demonetizing do you understand how you're living you understand these are the things you want people to know about you you get the point my brother so now you come on your status it is yours you say you are the masters listen your status is what people should know and indeed they did what you possibly said is what you shall do then you go there they call them what selfies with these girls and shoes and with this you know you know disabled looking kind of stuff and then then you also put students so this is your status you're showing us your strengths that's your status so if your status is like that i i'm imploring you i'm encouraging you to do recharge your status let your status be a written letter of all men a little letter and a christian manifest christ out there how are you going to do it with everything you have is god sees it he will bless you i tell you he will bless you there is no way god can stop to bless you you know me i told you i would give you like this one even though my ipad was there my ipad was there did i did you see it yet it was broken broken some of you may be sorry i don't want to keep going through that because i will now kill our time here and i have we have about 20 minutes to finish if we have to go back home so look i tell you i i yeah everything broke and whatever but god has a god knew that whatever i get i use it for his name whether it is a house a car or whatever or whatever you understand a phone even a dress even a bible whatever you get in your life you must use it for the glory of the name of god so that's how god give me this if you give me this thing god if you give me this thing i'm going to because already god knows your heart if he gives you not what you will not serve him but let me tell you there is nothing i've ever prayed before the lord i told him god gave me this if you give it to my music and he never gave me until now i challenge you there is nothing so you ask whether you ask for an airplane i've never asked for it because i don't have faith for it but whatever i have asked you for what has given it god has given it to me and i mean whatever brother whatever whatever you ask for the lord he will give it to you if your motive is right if you you say now some of you are saying give us examples of some of those things can i give you some examples the very first example is my wife we were not married and so i learned that i went to prayer i said you know where i am you know how old i was i think i was 80 yeah i was 18 but i saw i loved that at 18 do you think i had money to mine i didn't have money tomorrow i didn't have anything i get out of my house i didn't have it you understand i didn't even have money to free that up so i had nothing but god said he will give his beloved you know whatever it is a desire whatsoever that you desire so i wrote a prayer i said oh god give her to me amen to check my application god had gone before me god had already submitted the application before i even what before i even you understand so when you take god fasting everything god makes you sure whatever and are you telling me if you are taking this in this meeting like taking whatever you asked for god gives it to you if your motive is right if whatever you're going to use in your life whatever you want the lord to give if you want god to give you a bachelor's degree or a master's degree or a phd if he knows you are going to use it for his glory and i'm talking about if you are his child but those who are not his children he doesn't care whatever they want they get no problem their heaven is here but but if you're a child of god hey if your child will go and you are and your mother you will ask for things you never get because you're a child of god he loves he doesn't want you to be spoiled if i find out elizabeth here and she says that he said yes yeah and that praise can you buy me a brand new car i'll just look at her because it's all right dear i need it now it's all right dear just reports can i get by for her i'll just waste her how can i some parents do shell is excuse nine years and you buy them a cat you are spoiling the child they will never have a future of their own you understand so if you like your child you will not do certain things for them because you know their motive is not right okay so if you have ever asked for something and god never gave it to you check your motives it is your motives always so whatever it is that you desire god must give it to you if your motive is right what are we talking about in these 15 minutes what was it that you read about yes yes so what what what started us off in this direction yes go and listen to that video we already answered that question and this issue of saying that when you receive the message you receive the holy ghost is not right it is not right never believe it because if you believe it you are born you will be called forever and i think i should support the scripture give us acts chapter 19. uh-huh are you there last night max chapter 19 from verse one uh uh-huh acts 19 from verse one we are reading uh can you pull it from me on the screen here as well oh you are off okay let me try to get one just try to get back and do it later okay ah no no the meeting is gone i can see you're on oh okay right there now he says that it came to pass that where aparos was at curry poor having passed through the upper costs came to ephesus and finding seven disciples first two he said unto them have he received the holy ghost sincerely belief and they said unto him we have not so much as hard as whether they have been in our universe can you ask can you read from us to what does it mean since you believe not before you believe after you believed after you believed did you receive the holy spirit is that not the question okay then here is a uh what they answer what does we go as they say so these people were even believers but they have never even heard of the holy spirit what are you talking about is there anything called the word sport is it even and these people are baptized by who by john the baptist so they were baptized but they did not know whether there is existence of the holy ghost why because johnny's baptism was the baptism of the painters telling them to believe in him who was going to come after him okay all right oh you're watching come on and so all right he said unto them i'll be okay go down go on down one down one down same time and he said unto them unto what they were about praise and they said unto john is baptism then paul said john verily baptized you with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him we should come after him that is christ jesus so when they had this what happened they were so before we even talk about the holy spirit first of all can you believe the one of the day that's what i'm saying when you receive the message when you receive the word of the hour you are entitled to receive the holy ghost you are entitled to the token if you receive the word of the day the one of the year they are the believers but they have not received the message of the house because the message of the hour at that time was that jesus christ is coming the flesh you understand it's no longer the message of john that he will come but he has come so they had believed he will come but now they have to believe he had come and when they had this and they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus okay he have us my brother here and and when they were baptized okay you need to first open it okay yeah right there bus six he says they spoke in times and those words always go together oh he says they spoke in tongues and glorified god you cannot verify god unless you're going to glorify you in the language that you understand not so so prophecy but the venom says it's uh a time interpreted if times are spoken and and interpreted it becomes a process it becomes a prophecy so what it says and they speak with the tongues and prophesy it means they interpret their own times okay so these people they think they just speak tanks no the times have many and uh and paul are laid upon our eyes upon them so now they lay their hands upon them in order to receive their holy spirit that's what we do but please you will lay our hands upon you but the holy spirit you can receive it at any time as long as you believe that's why even these people they they are they not yet believe the message of the hour that's why they didn't know the holy ghost so when you believe the message of the hour then you are on the right channel to forgot to give you the holy spirit and the holy spirit does not come to you because you are believed the holy spirit comes to you i mean the holy spirit does not come to you on believing at believing but the holy spirit comes to you because you believe him you you want to receive him you desire him the holy spirit is jesus christ himself coming in your life taking over your life you seek him okay you must be aware it's not something that happens even if i said this by the way we don't know but i you must know where where and how you must know the day you see the holy spirit say that from that time that that must be the time when you wherever you guys say since that time i've never been a sex since that time something changed in my life since that time you understand when you have been touched like like jacob would say since that time something changed my name was no longer jacob i am now he's right meaning i am no longer a thief i am now a prince you understand so when you are you say the holy spirit changes okay now um i will show you one more password about it also on wednesday look it up there uh peter and john i think i read on wednesday they came to the disciples who were baptized already in the name of jesus christ these ones again because they will not perfect in the name of jesus christ and we found out if you are baptized but not by your own free will or not by your decision it means you are not a believer yet you have to first believe and you you hear the gospel and the belief okay let us look at acts chapter h 14. acts chapter 8 verse 14. can you guess that now when the apostles which were at jerusalem that samaria had received the word of god they sent out to them peter and john this one's i believe the word right they are doing the rest of them for them that they might receive the holy ghost for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only there we are you see so these ones are believed but they are not they have been baptized even in the name of the lord jesus christ they had believed they had never praised the name of jesus christ but they have not received the holy spirit read it again from verse 17 read it again okay okay wait go back up verse 14 [Music] okay let us read together one two three go now so wait do you have a southern versus 14. there are uh there are some people in samaria somebody is another city and usually it is another one right so the ones in samaria that jerusalem there people who have received the wife they have believed the message yeah but when they had that that these people had received the message they sent to them peter and john they said brother peter john one visit those believers and other believers of course believing also means baptism hey you cannot believe and you say i will not be baptized since then i believe which means they were already baptized okay so who when do i come down who peter and who john what continue so they never took them again in the water because they already been baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ if you are baptized in the name of all of jesus christ according i mean if you have believed and you are baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ then you don't need to be replaced again but if you baptize in the name of jesus christ before believing it's not even baptism you were washed let us say you swam you went to you were swimming and you were washed but nothing happened you understand so you need to really be baptized properly okay so baptism before believing is not baptism do you agree with that we saw that on wednesday so who whenever i come down pray for them why did they pray because these ones were already believers and they were already baptized that they might receive there for yet he was fallen upon none of them only only they were in the name of the lord so these people have oppressed even in the right name but the holy spirit has not come upon them so buddy baptism in the name of jesus christ does not give you the holy spirit what gives you the holy spirit is the condition of your heart whether you are ready to receive you god is more willing to give you the holy spirit than you are willing okay but if you are baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ and then you begin going to movies you begin going to watch these bad things going to the body games going to their body friends going to these things you know the people of the world and then you mix up with them and then you're like yeah yeah yeah man you do the things that do you you play the things that they play that you respect the way they talk you know you read the things they read you watch the things they watch you you are living in films how can you expect the word spirit to come in he will never come he will never show up well you have to make your house ready for him to come in you have to be ready for him to come in you have to wash your brothers do you remember when he was going to come down the other day in the old testament what did he tell moses to tell the children of israel because the children of israel were like ah we want god to speak to us directly you all the time here all the time are we not also people can't talk to us also directly tell him to come and talk to us directly why are you all the time god told them okay that's what they say not properly myself i will go to them but tell them before i go they should make themselves clean they should wash their clothes hey even glory so some of you don't shower he said let them be green let them wash their bodies let them wash their crust so if you are coming with the prince of god if you want the holy ghost to come down to you you must be clean both physically and spiritually so some of you if you do not want to decrease pleasure and physically how can the holy spirit come you have to make an atmosphere for the holy spirit to come it's quite an honorary spirit you remember when that guy was was a naked and they attacked it with the theater clothes this is unfortunate and he was where he was in the tombs why because he had another spirit in him and against spirit is the spirit of darkness of the devil which will take people in the tombs you know to live there like mad people you know they cannot shower they cannot you know wash their clothes they cannot brush their teeth they cannot you understand this is normal thing it's the spirit of any cleanliness it was on this man and and this man was in the drums and while he was in the trunks and this piece they saw jesus coming by the way even before he just arrived there they had already not known they never really know jesus is going there so the devil started to block jesus while he was in the sea they wanted to see the sheep you know so that's why god when he's going to visit you like the devil makes possible you don't go to the fellowship we don't even say you know you say i'm a resume and say you just lose me you know they never know when you got there yeah you will meet jesus and you'll be delivered you understand them so now you see that when jesus the devil first brought jesus overcomes the devil and he eventually arrives of course he came they said please be saved he's the one who created me the devil did not know that my my mind they don't know what they don't know that this god who created the cease he just had to say peace be still and when he already there you remember what happened this guy saw him not even this year but the demons in him and he clean his face just tell us to go in this one and some people said oh you see us i wouldn't eat pork because pork the demons it but i was like okay that's why you also should not eat fish because also when the the the the pigs when the animals had at the beach the pigs ran into the water and they died they died there so where did the demons go let's bring the leg so why why do you eat the fish okay maybe it's a fish outside i don't eat why do you drink the water please can you stop drinking water because there's still sweating in the demons please in any disturbance you are allowed to eat anything as long as you pray for it that's right you're looking at me as if you don't eat breakfast you can eat anything you can eat anything the bible says so and as long as you have what pray for me i'm covering many points here but i'm coming up to a conclusion so then this jesus christ uh when he comes to jesus now that demonic lives and the money became glee so here is my point when you come to the lord friends when you come to jesus christ you must be clean you must prepare atmosphere for him to come and this man when jesus first came he made him clean he gave him another cloth he dressed to him and he told him what to go and clean up so listen now when you talk about uh the the other people the ones that were in the old testament they waited they killed themselves they did not decrease the atmosphere anybody came down because they are hard to wear not right too even if you clean yourself outside but when your heart is very content you know when your evil when your imaginations are evil continuously before god he will not show up still he will not feel you you understand these are conditions of preparing yourself for him to feel so eventually then when he came down he had not even calmed down this by the way it was just the thunders that were coming before him you know hey hey please kindly kindly be a good brother be a good pastor go and deal with you for us we shall hear from you they even told him we don't want to go to speak to us anymore you understand because their hearts their minds were not right they were not they will not you know deal with it so not everybody will deal with the word of us if you want the holy ghost make an atmosphere for him to come and he will always come he will always come never allow anyone to deceive to you that when you receive the message you have received the holy ghost no the holy spirit is the holy ghost but the holy ghost also is the message you understand so when you receive the message you are built the first condition the first way for him to come now prepare yourself the condition around you everything around you what you do what you say what you think what even for himself i mean uh even paul actually said that we should watch our conversations also wonders and many other things the things we do okay so friends you can receive the holocaust even before baptism you know you listen to that what is this you'll be blessed you can receive the holy ghost as long as your heart is being picked and of course anyone will receive the word cannot reject baptism in the name of our lord jesus christ if they reject it is a clear sign that you are not free amen yes and even you can be baptized in water and not receive the holy ghost if you had a lot of light until it is right and if it is right then he will come how can he come in a place let me give you the story brother before you say this man uh was told by his mama please go go where go with jesus he said mama i go with jesus let jesus be in the trunk meaning in a boot and he had he had a crate of eggs there do you know what happened the guy had an accident he died everybody was in the car diet but the car trunks the main intake the eggs the main intake not even one egg broke and that solar product is a true story what does it mean where you put jesus where you would be so if you get healed in the church you will be here when you come here you will feel it but when you go he's not there you won't be there but if you put him in your life every any of your life you will be there you'll be welcome you understand why you will come here he comes if you will come him in your hand he will he comes we had a very wonderful session here prayer god beat a lot of things here and i tell you what if you you create an atmosphere for the holy spirit to come he will always come that's what i do he will always come and praise the lord yes you want to say something um um yes brother of joseph that set his soul on fire and when our joseph and when our children even jesus will come to the people who have kept the commandments of god and who have gone back to palestine he is so released for fire little basically finds that 144 000 israelites from all over the earth who have gone back to palestine for their redemption they will be standing there and receive him whom to know his life yes i wanted to know what romanian yeah because they say that that style it should be as in the end time the other time of joseph it is okay that's time that's how the time will be okay so now um if you want to get to know the full this is a big subject and i've appreciated it before uh you know have you ever gone to on this channel the message site youtube and search for the someone second someone reminds me that i do some of you were here when these things were being pushed were you not yeah we have not come here okay there is someone's that i pushed on on there and uh you you just type in in youtube the message site without leaving spaces to come i preach on the the depth of prophecy the depth of prophecy in there there is a place where i speak on the making that right now the paramount decision now uh in here we need to speak about the the the 144000 jews i think i've spoken about it here the reason but uh to answer your question in a very brief way the 100 for what god deals with the jews and the gentiles at this are at different times so the jews are the ones that are dealt with also but in a group way god is with them as a nation but with us gentiles they're using us as individuals so with the jews we even know the number from a manga that's going to be saved excuse me like you see from among the gentiles we have two major groups where you can set three major groups we have the first group is the believers the ones who are going to win the rapture the bride then you have the the right is the iraqis okay then you have another group which is the fruits virgins then the ones who are christians they want to work christians but they will not be the enemy so they will remain okay they're going through the tribulation right now then you have the unbelievers so even among the jews is the same thing it's the same thing so you you have the same groups but then the 144 thousand is the elect of the jewish rest for them they get this same message that you preach this is a message but through their own message that's why we talk about the five comings of the right the fifth one will go to them and they will preach to them the same message because how do we notice the same message these people they receive the testimony of christ so they believe jesus has their savior so they have baptized in jesus name so they steal the holy ghost and they received by the time they received their message it will be during the time when the world is uh is a tribulation the great tribulation at the time that they will receive the message the bride will be at the marriage supper of the round during it's gonna be a space of three and a half years we are in heaven with the bright group the first vision is the tribulation and the jewish the jews the 144th are receiving their message through moses and in egypt so those ones are the ones that he's talking about there the 100 and the father you remember that that was a story of uh of joseph and the story of joseph is the type of the story the end of the story the type of jesus you know everything about joseph happened with jesus can we start what happened to jesus number one but before he's being hated he was loved by his father for some god love the one that he gave his own all his only begotten son god loved you right uh-huh go ahead number one number two he was headed by his brethren the jews themselves they were his brother they hated him with the accent they told the what was the name of this guy he said crucify him crucify himself can i let barabbas go oh jesus they gave him up they never loved him they hated him what happened to jesus he was sold he was beaten they beat jesus and then they threw him out of the jewish whatever they sold him to the jedi through the the gentiles the romans is there king of jesus not not the jews the jews with the romans they understand so the same price which judas betrayed you with that's a all right like jesus christ came among kings and among the genders right he meant was restored another one was cute just like when jesus was on the cross one prisoner another one huh so he was lifted because of his gift because of his wisdom because of his knowledge he was uplifted above everyone else he became a priest among the egyptians jesus became a priest among the gentiles yes so jesus to us has become god he's become a priest he's become actually not even second this guy had he joseph was was the only hope that he did did you know that jesus is the only hope that we have there's not many nothing else but jesus and then eventually he was he he became a prince blah blah blah then now what's the next point he married the gentile god like jesus will marry a gentile so now the jews must return back to the same god they rejected because of anger because of you know they will realize that they need food but without knowing that they have turned to the one that rejected when they realize it is him what does joseph say i will not say i will give you food but i will not give you all that you need i will keep one of your brothers i want you first to go and bring the bring my what my little brother named until his little brother benjamin came he never revealed himself to them as joseph but when they came and his father came and everybody came then he unveiled himself and told him i am jesus you understand so the jews the other 45 other jews they they usually remember they have already turned to them to their homeland they are already homeless but why is god not returning to them why is jesus not revealing himself to them because he's waiting for the elect he's waiting for them his friends he's waiting for his brother he's waiting for the little benjamin to come back again there are those jews that have not yet returned to israel until today there are those elites that have not yet maybe born or something but they must be in israel they must be trying to do that the very last of them when they go back to israel meanwhile also when the jew the agenda is their cup of belief which is becoming full so together christ is not coming because the last one has not come from our side but also question not going to them because the last one there has got to come when the last comes in they also the jews will gather back in jerusalem in israel then they will receive their message through mozart which means the rapture will happen also so what happens here also happens concurrently with what is happening to israel it is very important to look at israel israel is going to stay peace whatever happens to israel is it is it's shaping the world event it is shaping it israel is not a nation like any other israel is in god's hands that's why anybody who is casting israel even today is under a cast anybody who is against israel they will be contending with god even when god has cast away the israelites by half blindness but the bible says has god cast them away completely no don't deceive yourself god has not cast away his people wishing for you so in other words god still loves israel versus defends israel god still is with israel even today in current day israel god has done many phenomenas things that the world will not ever do so you see that they are in scripture they shape the world events wild events and now when they they receive when they all of them are back to their homeland and they also believe when they've got all their hands then indeed they will also view the template many things will happen but also we know that now they will receive their message by the time they are receiving their message who are the ones receiving their message those ones who would believe the message of this day not from the bottom but from there elijah and when they receive this message when they receive this message i mean those who receive this message will be the legal danger and uh it's not like it is there's going to be one tribe of benjamin it's from all the tribes the elect from every tribe of israel can you imagine god even knows them one of them [Music] we may be one here i don't know [Laughter] strength let me tell you the way of the cross is narrow it is narrow it is narrow it is narrow now it's not white it is now and you have to press yourself in it you have to press yourself you have to fight it out until you overcome each of us is fighting but are you fighting to overcome all right then then we will receive the rapture they will receive the messiah brother they answer your question yes yes isaac you wanted to speak all along um we are ready for it everything is in order as the jews broke the message even so the gentiles take [Music] yes are they going to be gentiles that's for what he said but that does not necessarily mean that elijah and mothers are going to be gentiles because we have had many people bring the gospel to us not only for thee with the only problem to us no the others also brought the message at that time but in every generation there has been a major message and that messenger is god who chooses uh but also it does not mean because mozart the one who's going to preach to them it does not mean that strictly them alone no one else will get their message even now i speak to you i have a friend of mine a brother from the u.s he's the other church he's a he's a he might have given a jewish sister and she's also believed this message and they they they have a church in i don't know the name of it but i was asking him the other day oh how did they contact you i don't want to remember i was asking the other day uh how it is and he told me he even sent me a report he was telling me to there well during the last war that they had so he told me everything is well with them but they are pushing this message there also i was trying to give you something back but those brothers are going there in the name of this world okay that they even as they use abroad the generals will take but i always say we got adversaries but i sent them there god bless you yeah god sends god blessings so yes the gentiles will take the message there and like the jews brought them he spoke to his brother in another town did you know that the first day and age which is the head of the the head of god went out to the message [Music] his age yes that's it says what it means it means what it says do you see times everywhere but you see uh it happened as it happened yesterday they wrote on on our uh you know god has always been used in times even joseph spoke to them in times so these times many of them are not wrong others are correct by them not all times are wrong i was watching one of the questions the other day the oneness met apostles and then two people three different people gave times with another one preaching in the church and it was just matters so it happens it happens even the message churches even in our churches god still uses those times the abundance of time is another clear sign that our age is finishing and indeed you people who have been playing around i tell you we don't have much time we don't know when the rapture is coming but but the banana told us to continue our potatoes but also we should leave as if it comes the next minute should be ready that is coming anytime but we should continue doing what is that we have been doing to for our life does that answer your question and then also in phase 39 okay [Music] so he said that he crossed he gave the blessings of the elder to the younger and the blessings of the younger to the elderly because they've prayed not so far yes i mean the blessings come through because like the blessings are coming across yes ah i love that that psyche you touched a very good area i kind of preached a very wonderful someone here you see jack will be like this the blessing of the younger went to the eola the blessing of the yeah or everybody went to the younger meaning that the jews they were they weren't supposed to receive the messiah right but incidentally and god is still god is over the foreign to ask the gentiles the gender does not come to christ but by the way all the cross of calvary so it is by the cross that we are able to receive christ so the gender is right like you read romans 11 that's why i was telling you romans 11. romans 11 he tells us that they they jews they are blinded can you take it down there wait talks about the blinding of the jews they are blinded so that um oh but i don't have that scripture here go down where is that is not obtained that which is secret for but the election has obtained it and the rest we are blinded over there on down down according as it is written god has given them the spirit of slammer eyes that they should not see here they should not hear after this until today they don't believe jesus they don't believe him as a savior they believe him like they're muslims and then he says let their table be made okay go down go down let their eyes be darker that they may not see and burn down their back always ah i said they are very somber that they should fall wait for peace but rather through therefore salvation is coming unto the gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy go down down down down now if the folding of them be the richest of the world and the diminishing of the jews be the richest of the gentiles how much more their fullness but i speak to you gentiles and as much as i am the apostles i magnify my office if by any means i may provoke to impression them which among my flesh i may save some of them for if they're casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life of the day for if the first fruit be all in the lab all is also holding if the root be already saw the branches the root is priced on the branches we have where israel but they were cut off and we were grafted in the details yeah and if some of the branches be broken off and now being a wildly olive tree what grafted inner manga then and we then protect us to the root and the fatness of the olive tree boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bear is not the fruit by the fruit but the root deep the root okay okay okay okay so they were cut off they were broken off but we might be grafted you know grafted yes yeah we have been grafted into the olive tree which is jesus christ we are the wildly tree we are the branch from the 103. you see those you you sometimes hear those worldly feelings that are in your heart and in your flesh that are detecting the world the why because you have been from a while literally you know so you have to reject and fight it out that you will accept to be grafted in order so that you can grow and mix together with christ and let his life give you life so is there any question in chapter one okay how many i'm gonna finish chapter one again one two three four five this is i'm going to request that all of all those that have not finished chapter one you give me a promise that you're going to finish it tonight before you see i'm gonna give you that promise okay okay uh-huh i'm gonna have given the promise you gotta say don't be a fool you better not promise that you don't fulfill you so this night you have already given the promise before this is the people and before god finish that chapter then when we meet again please don't don't procrastinate don't push it you know someone who died just now was thinking was having plans for tomorrow morning so read it now if the rule was checked it would take you after you have finished it yes yes what's the question what was the question [Music] [Music] okay that's a good good question number one you you ask that uh the people who are going to believe it's like some people are like okay now unless you receive the message of the day you don't receive the holy ghost no the like you said the message of the day yes the message of that day but there are people also who uh receive the holy ghost by the message of their time the message of their time god is provided way for every generation is the message of their time they must be the hour we of the hour because the hours keep changing that was the hour of ludha i mean iranians the hour of martin the hour of rutherford you understand now we are in the our house our time we have received the message so now the people i think are answered concerning our generation the people who come in this generation some of them they will not be accounted this generation others for example uh these people in acts chapter 19 they were from the generation before the generation of john the baptist they are the heart of the message but the message of john and that's why they didn't know about what baptism in the name of our lord jesus christ even the holy spirit so if they had died would they have gone to heaven yes because they were believers that's all they knew i always tell people this message is the best i'm afraid i'm feeling words are failing but what i can say it is the only truth that i know in this generation if you find another that is higher than we should give it to me or believe it but until then i am sticking with this message because it's the only truth that i talk about is that the way this the message checks them talk about the moments they must suggest talk about the the the catholics the message talk about the angry messages all those groups why because all those groups are not really higher than the message of this day they are lower than revelation so but if believers come to another generation some of them like those people they have to receive the message understand like those people have to be baptized again in the name of our lord jesus christ and be filled with the holy spirit you understand but are you still with me yes but we find out that these people uh if they had died they would go but now that they are hard and they do not reject they go also okay but if they are rejected would they go as safe as that so the simple answer to that anybody because there are some people that cared about that brother and said but we are trying to get our parents about this message they can't see but there was yeah genuine christians from the other reformations the other movements before but i'm talking about one that your father will come for will come will be counted from among the saves of the other generation so who knows who will become the other generations okay so don't say i i'm going to preach to that one but you're going to account for them on the other generation don't start doing that okay god knows your work is telling people about this the message of this day of this house if what i'm saying ah this one's like god will come them on during this generation you have to tell them and they believe okay so if you receive the message of your day you are entitled to receive the holy spirit your question yes remind me the holy spirit yes if someone gets it the moment you receive the holy spirit you are sealed until you win until the moment you get to the right next to the body what about it and here you are until you sin and then you assume that you win until well the bible says until when until the rapture you see the reason why you keep answering and then with the doings because you're not sure what you're saying the bible says you are saved until the day of your redemption and what is your redemption are you redeemed now are you ready now yes of course you are a day i am redeemed but you're in a price you understand yes of course you're redeemed but you are yet to be redeemed you understand like jesus is here you see now yes you understand so jesus came right he is here and he is coming the same yesterday today and forever so in the same way i have the holy ghost now i am redeemed now i was redeemed before the fathers of the world and i will be redeemed by a good option you understand so it's a season different seasons of the same redemption so you are redeemed once so you can also set before the foundation of the world so the question is when does the holy spirit leave the holy spirit is always there it's the amnesty the moment you receive him it is the is the endless of the price which you're gonna keep beginning once is it your full redemption full redemption and you receive that when you go the rapture all right then you will see the fullness of it christ himself but for now when you receive the holy spirit you are saved and the bible says now to him that has the holy spirit that is you cannot even see if you are god of god because why [Music] because he said oh god you understand so to a child of god [Music] you cannot see what is sin sin is unbelief the bible never said you'll not do mistakes you're not really because remember that you are living in the flesh in this house of clay it's gonna break it's gonna do things it's gonna you understand but whenever you go straight you will run back [Music] why because the blood is there to cover and wash but you're not gonna say oh praise god let me do whatever i wanna do the blood is the clear sign that you don't even have the blood covering disease okay because when you receive your other blood is there you are always going to be in fear god's grace has told my heart to fear [Music] uh [Music] amazing grace [Music] oh is is is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] one more time [Music] [Music] is [Music] it was grace that told me you fear because of grace the grace that called you out you know when you come when you first come to the lord and you hear this message and you hear the word and you realize the moment you realize that your sins are counted no more and and when you repent of your sins and you give yourself even for the baptism do not take it as if you are still a sinner no god never remembers those sins anymore he says that my heart is told to fear and grace my fears relieve grace relieves your fears are you hearing me [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] within myself i cannot overcome within yourself you can't overcome the body the flames [Music] you feel like oh i can't go back into those things anymore the things i used to do i don't like it you kind of love it it is grace grace is a free gift of god by your way amen and grace my fears really how precious it was yes [Music] me is oh is oh [Applause] me oh is praise god is i am [Music]
