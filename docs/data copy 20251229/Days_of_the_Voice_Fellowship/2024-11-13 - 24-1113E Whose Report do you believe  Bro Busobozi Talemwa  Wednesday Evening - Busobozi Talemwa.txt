blessing to us we shall be with him throughout the weekend I believe it will be a time of a blessing for us amen so shall we go to numbers 13 ver 25 to vers uh 33 and I'm reading in the name of the Lord and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel andto the Wilderness of Paran to Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of their land and they told him and and and they said we came unto the land with thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and there is the fruit of it sorry and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are W and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there the aites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jeites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and calb stealed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the the people for they are stronger than we and and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that as that we saw in it are men of a great stature and there were and there we saw the Giant the son of anak which come of the Giants and were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and we were in our own sight as gr hopers and so we were in their sight [Music] for for fore [Music] amen you may be seated may the Lord bless them I I usually on Wednesday evenings since we are not covering the whole place I always appreciate Brethren if we could use these two rows uh so that we can be able to um see each other properly thank you uh receive greetings from sister uh brother there's there's a chair over over here I don't know some of these single Brothers they fear to sit in front you should always I don't know why people always fear front seats and they take their back seats where do you want to be in heaven in the back or in the front I think you should begin practicing When Praise the Lord please receive greetings from sister uh uh Dina many times I forget to bring her greetings I know she probably is online as well so we send her our greetings as well amen this Sunday this past Sunday we had two baptisms and the first um the one is a sister sister that lives with the the theondes she's her parents are Muslims she was afraid um initially she decided and then later on she came and said uh mother has threatened me and said I cannot leave Islam gave a few threats and uh so she came Pastor said pastor what can I do I said well this is a personal decision and if you still want to make a decision no amount of [Music] threats be accomplished in your life because once you have received Jesus Christ he is there to protect you and um so she said it's all right I'm going to make up my mind so this Sunday she again said now I'm feeling a lot of fear so I said I told her we're going to baptize another sister so you just come and be a witness through throughout the whole process if you gather enough strength now and boldness you will make up your mind and I told I told sister M please make sure you bring us changing clothes and so we came and you know this other sister uh is she here today oh God bless you amen you know she's been in our home sale here neighbor to our sister Martha and so I'm telling you those of you who are having home sales in your areas don't abandon them go there and go with your friends take your neighbor hear the word let us that's how I think we can easily do evangelism around our [Music] neighborhood do we say Amen to that so please don't give up on your home sales it is a must for every believer to go and please go with a friend if you really are convincing your heart that this is the truth which we are preaching you are going to be convinced Al and concerned about taking someone else can I hear an Amen on that amen and so um our sister then was baptized after a little sharing there water and then this young lady when this sister came out this young lady also said I'm also ready I've gathered enough strength and boldness and she was also baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and we say glory to God Amen and so uh this evening by the grace of God I'd like to speak to you on a question whose report do you believe ask your neighbor whose report do you believe whose report do you believe that I have started my business and it's not um according to what everybody is saying it is not going to work out whose report do you believe that we are collecting our land fund and it's going to be impossible for us to buy the land whose report do you believe that these days it is impossible to find a job whose report do you believe that I am sick and the doctor is saying my situation is impossible the question is still the same whose report do you believe so that's the question I want us to talk about tonight no matter what situation we are going through you know they are saying that you know inflation and the economy and things are difficult things can't work out whose report do we believe I want to say I want to believe the report of the Lord and um so this evening I'd like to take it as of we've read out of the book of numbers and um here this this is when the the the the spies have come back to to Israel to uh back to the desert back to the camp of Israelites and they they searched they had searched the land for 40 days because as you know God had promised them a land flowing with milk and honey and you know when God gives a promise his promise is always something that will come to pass the promises of God cannot change time changes seasons change people change but the promises of God do not change but many times we get discouraged and disappointed when things change and we think because things have changed there also God is promises have changed God's promises concerning our life now I believe that this word of God is for an individual it is for everyone but it is supposed to be received for by an individual and it's supposed to be applied to each life [Music] individually and if God is in heaven then every promise has given in his word concerning my situation concerning my life must be accomplished whether it is by word of Prophecy whether it is by scripture whether it is by you know the spoken word every promise of God is true and he says his word is forever settled in heaven let me tell you a little thing about God when God thinks something and he says it that thing is already done no matter how long it will take no matter how difficult it will seem you know seasons will change times will change word of God it was fulfilled the moment it was spoken even before we have seen it if God says if you are baren and God says you will have a child you know it is as good as done you know if God says I'll give you a job it is as good as done the moment he promises it you should begin rejoicing not when it has been accom but the moment he says it that is why when we come to church we Rejoice at the hearing of the word because as we are hearing the word and it becomes the r words to us it becomes personal it is revealed to you yes you know you get excited and it becomes personal it hits you hard you know that's why sometimes people fall down by hearing the word why because it has become personal to you know that moment it has become personal to you it is fulfilled that's why you should always receive it and excuse me punctuate it with an amen the moment it is spoken and so tonight we are going to hear the word of God not my words the word of God I want to hear the word of the Lord for me amen and so when you hear it don't hear it as some pre money hear it as a personal word from God to you and when it comes it comes to it comes to do a work it cannot return unto him void it it fulfills the purpose it has been sent to do now I believe those things with all my heart and so now we see the word of God is the perfect report and that is what a Believer believes who are we we are believers Believers of what Believers of God's report how many to hear his report we are now set we want to hear the report of the Holy Spirit concerning our lives praise the name of the Lord amen amen imagine if someone told you that here is a letter God has sent you some words how do you feel even before you open it you already smiling so I don't want to see any gloomy face tonight I want to see you happy I don't want to see you sitting and relaxing I want you to sit on the edge of your seat be ready to hear the report concerning your life from the Lord I already feel happy hallelujah amen amen hallelujah and so God spoke to Israel as we will see later on and he gives them um a promise and he says I'll give you a land and this land will flow with will be is Flowing with milk and and so Moses sends them out these people to go and spy on the land and um you know these men go out and spy the land and after spying the land for 40 days they came back to Moses and to Aaron and to the congregation of the children of Israel and they found them in the wilderness or par and so they brought back the word they brought back report concerning the land who promised the land God promised now I want you to I want to say to you tonight be aware of false prees be aware of those who bring a FAL report of the land we want to hear men who are reporting good things about the land good things about the promises you know this word is filled with good things that God is going to do for us this is not a set of rules and don't of dos and don'ts this is a book of The Chronicles listen of The Chronicles about the land of the promises of God concerning what he said he will do for us and so beware of men who bring a false report but tonight we want to see to hear a good report and the children of Israel they were ready and waiting to hear the word that these people brought and these men they saw the land and they even brought the fruit of the land and they told him to Moses we came to the land where you sent us surely surely it is Flowing with milk and honey it is Flowing with milk and honey the word of God says I know the plans I have for you I know the I have for to do you evil give you an expected end and I'm here to encourage you tonight say God has a plan for you you are not some isolated person who is just you know waiting on F to lead you wherever it will take you you need to understand brother you need to understand sister that you have a purpose and God has brought you here for a purpose when I say here I mean into the world for a purpose before you find the purpose let me tell you the purpose amen the land is Flowing with milk and honey the purpose of God is to take you to that land the promises of God are good God has no Grievous promise for any of his children they us to to snakes and all Scorpion and such there is nothing like that we say scorpions will eat you by the day and the snakes will eat you by the night no there is no promise like that but those things will come in the process but when they come do not look on them and forget the promise do not look on your situation and judge yourself on the basis of your situ there is no permanent situation every situation must change but it will change according to your faith and we will see here two groups of people you know if you have no faith even if you are in the middle of God's promises you will fail to receive it rather it is very sad for you to be in the middle of the promises and you fail to receive it because of lack of faith these men went the Bible says they even PL the fruits I am sure they ate some of it and They Carried some of these fruits back again to the people so they said the land where you sent us to sure it is there sure it is Flowing with milk and honey and here is the fruit nevertheless I don't want to hear that part tell your neighbor I don't want to hear that part praise the Lord amen I don't want to hear the the part of nevertheless all I want to hear is the land is strong amen there's a lot of Echoes and he's shouting so I don't know if you can be able to control the sound listen it says that the land is good all I want to hear is the land is Flowing with milk and honey God is land for me my land my Promised Land what is my Promised Land my promised land is the phase where I am hated my promised land is a place where I am appointed my promised land is the promises of the word for me my promised land is the holy spirit is my children is my money is my business are you following me my promised land is every claim every good thing that the word of God promised me my Promise Land may be education my Promised Land may be a job yours may be a job who tells you that to get a good job you need to go to Arab countries no our promised land is in the word of God is in the promises of the world Amen you read in the in the promis in autonomy which we read in the beginning of the year he promises blessings after blessings he didn't say if you will move to another place if you are in the word blessings after blessings where whever you are it's even if you are here you don't need to change a church to get the blessings you don't need to change a city to get the blessings you don't need to change anything to get the blessing you are at the right place to get the blessings as long as you are in the word hallelujah and he promisees says the land is good it is Flowing with milk and honey oh my I feel like prophesying over myself right now my land is good my land is Flowing with milk Andy amen and and and and but these men said nevertheless the people there are strong those that dwell in the land the cities are world the cities are very great who cares about the city who cares about their strong and and and the children of anak who has Giants and great men and the americat dwell in the land of the South and the he and the jeites and amorites dwell in the the mountains the canites dwell by the Sea and calb I love this part which we shall shall come to at the end and calb steal the people hallelujah hallelujah we shall come to that but let us first look at the promise God gives the promise in Exodus 3:8 I want you to follow me closely because this will be a blessing to you tonight it says verse eight and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey the place of the canites and you know I've always been wondering why did God was he just wanted to displace these people let me tell you oh my there is something that God takes care of and I tell you what it takes care of God takes care of his seed are you the seed of God God takes care of his seed hold that we shall come back to you to the place of the I've given you the place of the canites the place of the Hittites the amorites the parites the hites the jebusites you know God has given you a certain land God has given you a certain land please don't hear the words I'm saying hear the words of the holy spirit that to you God has given you a certain land but on that Land There is a site there is aite there is a perite there is an Amorite there is a are you hearing the place the land that God has given you is already occupied they is still needing some battle battling to do that's why we battle as Believers we are not going to receive our breakthrough without fighting you have to fight to win whatever God has promised to you will surely come to you but you need to hold your ground you need to have a back bone to say God said it I believe it it must happen nothing can stop it let me tell you that Believers have no backone many times to stand for what the word of God says stand for what the word of God says God is somebody that fulfills his word we have not come to him to check whether or not he will fail us he says in his word I will never fail you I will never forsake you his word cannot fail just like there is a heaven just like it is you that's how God's word is whatever he has said he will accomplish it it will not come easy you have to fight for what belongs amen Israel was promised alar by the Lord the creator of Heaven and Earth amen as I speak of Israel I wanted to be thinking of yourself they did not fully possess that land I want you to imagine until today that land they don't geographically cover it all they only have fractions of it that's how you are many times you are living under privileged to to be able for them to occupy all the land they cannot do it without War they need to fight in order to possess every inch even if they went not to Lebanon and they said we want one kilm there will be a huge wall but you see Israel has always fought for their plan but even until now they don't have the whole land they don't control the whole land oh it is so sad many Believers also don't have all the promises that God promised in his word in the time of Joshua they possessed a big chunk of it in the time of David and Solomon they controlled all the land but for a small time and then soon they were exiled and and you know they've been exiled I wanted to get you some maps but I didn't have the enough time to gather those Maps since they have been exiled multiple times and and each time they have been exiled they always came back to their land they claimed their land they never let their land go permanently Israel is the only country on Earth they the only people on Earth who sees to be a nation and they were dispers from their land and they reappeared because of what God promised God said I've given you this life it will be yours forever and ever and ever and ever no one will ever take it from you in 1903 the Jews rejected a proposal which was given by Joseph chamberline chamberline a British you know this proposal was given and it was told them that they should actually make Uganda Homeland they were given Uganda and you know Uganda is beautiful I would say it is Flowing with milk and honey it is in the great region this is where you have rivers and lakes and it's green all through the year actually when you drive out the other time I was in h and I was driving throughout I was like my Uganda is really beautiful you go to the north you go to the east to the South Uganda is beautiful honestly speaking I have personally not seen in all the countries of been around the world and I'm saying this truthfully I've not seen a country as beautiful as Uganda fuits everywhere you know the temperature here is not very hot not very cold so it's really moderate it's acceptable so you find that um you don't need to you don't need to you can live without SC some countries you can't leave if you have no air conditioning you die in China you can basically you cannot you will faint they have all these air conditioning in because it can really beot them but you see Uganda in in in Germany and all these European countries they have to insulate when you are building a house you have to insulate it on the on the ground in the walls heat because when it's cold it's really cold and you can't live in the house without that woman and even you need to have those jackets but in Uganda you just go and get your reads and you get you you just get your water and soil and mix and you put it you get all banana fibers you tie on the and you get that mixed you know soil and clay and whatever you make a house and you sleep Uganda is beautiful tell your neighbor Uganda is beautiful praise the Lord that's the truth that's the truth and so you notice that you know chamberline wanted to give the Jewish um State the land of Uganda you know these people they had colonized us and so they they they thought they can always give this land to the other one because they colonized us but the Jews refused they said we want our Liv in 1948 Israel returned again to their homeland in Palestine and they have had many wars but each of them has been a war for survival Israel has never waged a war on any country just without uh uh any reason and the reason has always been for their surviv it has been a war for their land you talk about land Grabbers and people who fight for land and kill each other the real for our land is in Israel even now as I'm speaking the war for their land is going on now now now their war with Iran and H leanon the in and all it is all because of their land to them the promise of God for their land is n debatable they believe only one report they believe only God is report hallelujah amen many times their fought Wars on many fronts at the same time imagine Uganda being attacked by Sudan and Kenya con and Randa Bui and all at the same time if we were attack I don't know whether we would survive but Israel has been at even now as I speak on seven fronts here they sending InterContinental sending these the S but you see Israel has breast for all of them and they saying we are not leaving this ground we die we die but we are not going to debate with anyone as long as it about our life we shall not be moved we are going to stay here and we shall win all these battles and their claim is one because God promised that's their only claim that's their only report they holding on to they saying because God promised Our Land Title is in the Bible that is what they saying title is with God he gave it to Abraham our and here we stay here we die but we shall not be moved oh I love that kind of thing believing the report of God is better than anything in the world Israel natural types Israel spiritual we are Israel spiritual we will take the report of God concerning our lives no matter our situation we will not be moved we shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water we shall not moov we shall stay here we die we live we stay in the word every promise of God for our life must come to pass the devil can't stop it at one time Israel said even if all of you are not with us do you know even America told them don't go to Gaza don't go to whatever some in Gaza they said to hair with [Music] America we will go to Gaza and they went there Hallelujah they were ready and they are ready to risk everything for the report of God are you ready Church to risk everything for the report of God many times we are so fearful when things begin to happen always check in with the word what does saying about that situation take the word of God believe the report of God because that cannot F amen hallelujah in the Book of Joshua CH 1: 3 he describes the boundaries of the land of Israel and he says every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon my God every place every place tell your neighbor every place that your s the sword of your feet upon that have I given unto you that have I given unto you every place not some places every place wherever your fet shall trade that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river ephus I wish I had a map to show you that all the land of the and the great sea to where the going down of the sun shall be your cost have you heard of these people in America and Europe and everywhere they've been chanting the Palestinians they've been like singing chanting those words that saying Palestine Palestine is is our something like that from the river to the sea from The River To The Sea have you heard those words before they're trying to say and theyve been you know going around the streets by millions by tens of thousands and you know they're trying to say we are standing with Gaza Gaza should be free should be free from the river to the sea but did you see what I just read to you God say to Israel I'm giving you from the river to the Sea it is all yours Hallelujah you need to understand what is going on in the world today Israel is God is time P let me tell the end is very soon the World War 3 is boiling is boiling we thank God that Kamal Harris did not become a president because if she had become one she would have fastened all these prophecies so we have a little more time to do evangelism don't sleep tell someone about the Rapture tell someone about the Lord about this message we have a short time and he gave them the boundaries wherever your feet shall tread that land is yours from the river ephus Amen to the sea that is your cost I want you to hear the words that president nanyu or prime minister Netanyahu spoke to the US Congress on July 24 this year listen to these words and I'll read it to you he was speaking about these protesters and he said these protesters chant from The River To The Sea and then he he pauses and then he tells the people the lawmakers in America and all those government people he tells them this but many don't have a clue what river and what sea they talking about they not only get an F in geography they also get an F in history they call Israel a colonialist state and listen to these words they struck my heart he said don't they know that the land of Israel is where Abraham Isaac and Jacob pray where Isaiah and Jeremiah pre where David and Solomon rulle for nearly th000 years the land of Israel has been in the home has been the homeland of the Jewish people it has always been our home it will always be our home I say amen I love that a man who knows amen what belongs to them a man who knows which report to take you said this is politics I said this is more than politics this is amen God confirming his word in the 21st century standing with a nation God gave them the land and here is a modern day filthy leader coming up and he is able to you know he may be political and filth and all that but he is able to stand up and quote the word of God and say this is our life this is where Abraham was Isaac jaob isah Jeremiah davom the man is quoting the Bible the man is pointing to the word and the man is saying this has always been our home that's why they rejected Uganda because they knew their home and by the way the brother of n is the one who died here at airport during the reign of ID how many remember that you can go and watch that um that little movie how do they call it someone remind me h no no no no not that one yes no there's another one yes is it seven days in an speak of The Escape of the of of the Jewish people from an going back to uh to to Palestine and you see it's just amazing when you see that you can sincerely say God is with this Jewish people and this is a a promise God has kept from the days of ab and to you people who have been with Palestine be careful we are Christians and that means we stand with Israel all the way because the God will serve is's the god of Israel just in case you did not know therefore that's the God and that's the nation we stand with those are the people we stand with and we pray for Israel whenever you are praying pray for Israel I nearly brought the Jewish flag today pray for Israel pray for the Peace of Jerusalem your Bible tells you to do so praise the name of the Lord but here they are the church natural we are the church spiritual it is they he said it's been our home it has been the homeland of the Jewish people it's always been our home and it will always be our and I also say Amen every promise of the world has always been our homeland it shall always be our homeland no one can take it away from us take this whole world but leave me with the word and the 10 spies came and they brought an evil report numbers 13:32 and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land though which the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eth up its inhab and um and all the people that we saw in it are men of great sture pay attention there's something there's a con I'm going to take and you'll be amazed listen and there we saw the Giants did you hear that what Giants the sons of anak which come of the Giants and we were in in their our own site as grasshoppers so we were in their sight I want you to imagine this is a natural physical church God deals with them as a nation and everything about them is physical okay and so here their enemy was a physical enemy but the enemy were giants Giants and the Israelites remember these were spies they had sent if you are sending a spy you don't send the weing they must have sent the the strong ones like the brother emuel there strong like big man Mar tall you know so they must have sent the best you know not small people like no they didn't do that and you see when they reached there these people the best of the Jews before them they were like grasshoppers I want you to now imagine standing like a man like Brother Martin standing before these sons of anak and he's like [Music] here and he's there is like this looks like te like a grasshopper grasshopper that is how they appeared and these men they saw the fuits they saw everything it is as what God Said but when they saw the Giants they were disappointed they were disappointed with God so when they came back they came with an evil report because of their of the of the of the way their enemy looked like brother sister it is the same thing today we have our enemy but you see don't look at your enemy until you forget your promise you are seeing poverty as a huge giant before you and when the word of God says you a head not a tail then you begin to look down surely this is impossible you will Lear to the Nations it is a good scripture sounds good the fruits are here some people have tested it but for me it looks impossible let me tell you brother whatever looks impossible to you is impossible to God whose report do you believe hallelujah amen hallelujah amen to you brother you may be seeing all the say sincerely will I be able to do this wedding who among our people will be able to give me the [Music] money I don't know whether it will be possible stop professing like that people we should begin to trust God we should begin to look to God we should put good God to a test because when you put it to a test amen he comes down and he says who is that believes me who is that believes me do you dare to believe God when you dare him he shows up he shows up there was one once a woman amen and this woman was called Hana she was Buren she didn't have a baby but you know she became desperate she went before God and she said surely no where is my baby God I want my baby I don't know where she learned that maybe maybe the priest preach that I don't but this woman became desperate she believed there was a God in heaven a God who was beyond her barness and she approached that God that God came down Hallelujah is the same today he can do the impossible he does impossible mathematics he does not need a degree to give you a powerful job are you hearing me he does not need experience to take you in good places he does not need connection to take you to areas where you are not supposed to be he will take you where he wants you to be he will make you move in a swift way more than you expected you don't need a visa no I will tell you what you need you need God you need to believe his report because his report is true his report has been proved over and over and over again Hallelujah when you start a business believe amen when you say my business is going down my things are dying then the devil begins to come more don't be discouraged when something happens begin to prophesy right there and say devil you have done this but because because of this you have made a big mistake because of this that you have stolen from me God is going to give me thousands more you know these are people who believe the report of God Amen if you are a TI payer you cannot suffer loss if you suffer loss the devil has tampered with somebody he was not supposed to tamper with are you hearing me he will try but when he tries tell him devil you have made AIG a very big mistake we need to own our life by believing the report of God hallelujah and the devil would say huh you've made a big mistake watch me sudden because of what you have done God is going to raise much more out of this by the way those things are not Idol prophesy God will give you an inspiration you know sometimes you need to be angered by those demons for inspiration that woman kept on following Paul you are the man of God that gives us the you are the man of God and Paul was suffering long with this demon and you see one time he was angered from that moment the demons left and the people we are making money out of they became angry they made a big mistake to make that Spirit Fall upon hallu if those evil spirits follow you the devil is making a big mistake you need to begin Amen in your prayer get anointed and begin to prophesy over yourself over your situation and then you begin to see change why because if you believe the report of God it shall be done even as it said and so these Giants the sons of anak they were there and these people were fearful of them and I'll tell you this who are these Giants can you now go back to Genesis because now remember here in the Book of Numbers we are looking at a time after the flood are you following me but now when you go before the flag Genesis 64 the Bible says these there were giants in the earth in those days and also so after that when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became Mighty Men which were of old men of rown giants how which which which which men are these the theologians say that these were out of angels but we have a prophet who has come and told us exactly what it was these were the out of the mixture of the daughters of men and the sons of God and the prophet says it was from the lineage of Cain and the lineage of because we know the we know Cain was a seed of the serpent in plain language Kan was a son of Satan but we see these two just mixed and brought forth Giants so now this is going to blow your mind here in the Book of Numbers we see Giants again remember these Giants in the old times they all died in the in the flag so then how come that we have Giants after the flag you know someone will debate with you and say well these were all children they were Canan which means they were really coming out of Noah because they came out of the son of Noah called H and so then you wonder you say well how come that you have serpent SE through the but one thing I want to say I love this message hallelujah amen listen to what the prophet says in the message the serpent seat now and his sons which come out H shame and Jeff they come out in the rightous line how did the seed ever get over the seed of the serpent the seed come over in the ark just like it did in the beginning through the woman their wife They Carried the seed of Satan through the ark just as Eve packed the seed of Satan to give birth to Cain through the woman okay okay I say Amen to that now that is not written anywhere in the Bible but if you can't read this quote if you can't read this if you can't read this quot then you can't understand why God gave Israelites the land of Canan and he kicked them out mercilessly I'm giving you the land of the hites of the jeites of the god possess what and he says questions and answers so the Giants never come from pressing themselves in these Giants were the sons of K we are now talking about the Giants that were in the promised land and jumps over and he takes it back again in the beginning he skips Noah he skips H he goes all the way to Cain and he says these were sons of Cain whose father was the serpent who looked in every respect exactly like a man but was a great huge fellow bigger than a man and that's where those Sons came from because they were the sons of Cain because they were Canaanites in the land of Canaan where they come from and that's where Cain went to and that also proves the serpent SE it was a different R of people all together that was serpent seed now that serpent seed question in in there so we are going to get to eat and I want you to bear this in your mind now just to give this backround they were canites these Giants they were the sons of Cain which was the son of The Serpent and the serpent was a giant man great monstrous sort of a fellow not a reptile at all beautiful he was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field the jeans from an animal into a woman will not breed at [Music] all they tried it over and over unfertile to the woman's seed and now they can't find it it's the closest thing they can find to man or the or some of these close up to the man as God in his great Evolution begins to make fish then he made Birds listen now and then he made other things animals and they kept on coming up till one out of till one come out a chimpanzee a monkey a and then into a form of The Serpent and then from the serpent to a man serpent was not a snake it was a beast like creature Giant and Mankind has tried to search science tries to find bondes what this animal was that was next to the human being and and human is an animal the man the flesh part is an animal flesh we know that we are M which is warm blood animal we know that but what makes the difference the animal does not have the inward [Music] soul but the human being does he don't Beast the animal doesn't know right from wrong but the animal does the human being does now with that mindblowing revelation the children of Israel the children of the promise my good Lord they stood before the physical seed of Satan have you ever heard itally they stood before the seed of Satan they had the upper hand why because they had a bigger go they had to overcome because they had a promise amen hallu I want you to imagine these children of Israel stood before physical children of sat but yet they were not overcome they were like grasshoppers but yet they overcame the Giants they drove them one by one out of the land of you're land of promise you have to fight for it God has promised you Holiness it is not going to come easy you have to fight if the devil brings you this no I have to leave right I have to be a real son realter it's a fight you God the of imal no brother enough time to cry enough you have to put your foot to the ground and say I don't care how giant they look I am going to live right I am going to live like a Son of God and you know it's a choice said the devil tempted me the devil can't tempt you the devil has no right to tempt you if you're a Son of God why you step your ground and say Satan you know what pack up and go reject deny the devil and he will flee from me you reject him you deny him you fire fired you you have to fire him if he brings you fear fear I fire you if he brings you poverty oh come on now Sister Juliet we need to learn to do that and we say poverty I fire you fear I fire you try it tonight if it is God speaking to you try it tonight Hallelujah because we have the right if but we want if you want to be like the 10 spies we are like grassers many Believers are like
