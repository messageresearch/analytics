Fellowship uh and uh so they'll be with us on Zoom as as usual so that means I'll be preaching for an hour and so I also greet all the saints uh following the service online God bless you we're always happy to be with you amen can we turn to our Bibles in the Book of Romans chapter 11 Romans chapter 11 we are uh we are reading from verses 33 remember to pray for brother Wanga he mentioned to me that he's not well in the body and he needs go to touch him we are reading from verses 33 to vers 36 I I thought that we will not need interpretation today is that okay yeah I see everybody here can be able to follow in English so we are reading Romans 11: 33 he says all the depth of Rich all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how uncatchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who has known the mind of the Lord or who has been his counselor or who has first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him andto him are all things to whom be glory forever amen let me read that verse again verse 36 and I want you to also notice uh that verse very closely for of him and through him andto him are all things to whom be glory forever amen let us ask uh the blessing of the Lord upon the word father we would like to ask you tonight to come and be with us father Lord whoever is under the sound of my voice today those present here on those on YouTube and the saints that will stream this on their on their Zoom service in tonight Lord we commit all these Souls wherever they might be located father into your hands for you know what they need exactly what they need and I know you have the ability to take me out of the way as I take myself out of the way this evening that you will use me father to speak exactly what you know the people need to hear Lord what they do not need to hear may you block my mouth that I will not say it but whatever it is that you have designed and desired that I would say tonight Lord for I am your servant and and and reporting to duty tonight that you will use me as you have purposed in your own will that your purpose shall be accomplished in this service tonight we commit it into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated so this evening I am speaking on the subject of who is on the Lord's Side it's it's in a form of a question who is on the Lord's Side and I ask I ask I ask who is on the Lord's Side here tonight who is on the Lord's Side now I I I've started with the book of Romans I'll later on read in the Old Testament a few ver verses there but first I want uh this's a little thought I have this evening as I was studying it and um I trust that uh it will be a blessing to to the listeners today and and maybe this is for those who have been you know wondering which side they are on and sometimes in life you get to a place where you are what what the Bible would call a rock and a hard place and sometimes you need to make decisions sometimes uh you are confused and being pulled by this and that but time at times you really need to make up your mind on which side you are and I trust that by the end of the service we will all know whether we are on the Lord's Side or not praise the Lord so the reason why we sng that song you are God from beginning to the end I want I want to begin with a little uh going through that song a little bit he says you are God from beginning to the end that means you are the alpha and you're the Omega there is no place for argument there's not nothing no one we cannot argue about him being God from beginning to the end so you cannot argue about it there's no argument about it do we all say Amen to that you are God all by yourself you are God from beginning to the end and he says you've got times and seasons in your hands you you called for light out of Darkness you don't need a man to be the god you are but you have chosen to call me your own so we do not he does not need us to be God he was actually God before he even made us but he has chosen to call us his own and out of him we have come and the scripture we have read here in the Book of Romans he says for of him and through him andto him are all things so in other words everything has been made for him and everything is through him and everything is to him and everything and and all things are his and there is nothing made that is made without him in the Book of John chapter one he speaks a little bit about that all things were made by him praise the name of the Lord and so we see here he says uh all the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God so God has more knowledge than any of us God has wisdom wisdom um he he says how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out on I don't know was it on Sunday when I spoke on on um on things to do with the will of God many times things happen in our life and we ask ourself uh that why did God let this happen I don't know how many have ever asked that question why did God let this happen why did he allow it to happen in other words you asking your yourself that question because you do not understand how God who is all knowing can let something like that happen because in your definition in your wisdom that thing was bad but I want to show you tonight that in the wisdom of God nothing is bad in the wisdom of God whatever he allows to be he allows it to be so that his name can be glorified and we as mortors as human beings we need to understand that God is wise God is knowledgeable God knows is all knowing and you know his judgments are unsearchable his ways are past finding and we have to trust him we have to come to a place where we have full confidence in him we have to come to a place where we we we are not coming with questions in our mind God will you be able to do this if I do this will you fulfill your promises whatever he has promised he's able to do whatever he has said that he will do he's able to do that is why we have this book called The Bible because if imagine if we did not have a Bible imagine I want you to imagine it in your mind if we didn't have a Bible we are going to be relying on preachers and people who each of them saying I'm speaking on behalf of God and whatever they would be speaking will be maybe sometimes contradicting each other and then we do not know should we take what pastor bosi preached to us or should we take what Pastor Joseph or Pastor whoever preached to us we we will be confused but God is God and and his ways are past finding you know because of his Sovereign wisdom and knowledge he decided to to give us his word hallelujah he inspired Men He inspired them amen to come up with with words and with words of wisdom this is let me put it this way it is the wisdom of God downloaded you remember when Moses went into the into the mountain and he came back with a with the Ten Commandments you know where did that come from it came where where was it it was on tablets it was on tablets now in in in in this Century we have what we call tablets iPad and we think we all oh wisdom has increased but God wrote we wrote words on a tablet ways away in the days of Moses he was the first one to formulate the first tablet and he wrote his word there on tablets of stones and and when he he he brought it you know where did it come from it came from the cloud praise the name of the Lord you know we have these days some of you who understand what I'm talking about we have what they call the cloud the cloud is like you know some these days when your tablet or when your iPad or when your whatever phone gets full you can buy space on the cloud you don't need to buy a memory card or you don't want you you don't need to buy those things you simply need to pay money and they will give you an allotment of space Maybe 5 GB or 10 GB on the cloud and then you will be able to store your data there so but we notice that Moses Moses before I mean like many many years ago he went to the clowd downloaded from the cloud the wisdom of God and he put He put it on tablets of stone the wisdom of God God is wise there is nothing that can bypass him and there is nothing there is nothing that we he needs to know to increase his knowledge or he knowing there is nothing that we need to add on him there is nothing that we can take away from him you know our existence does not improve him do you understand what what I'm saying our existence does not improve him and our exist our nonexistence does not does not reduce on who he is and what he is God is God and he is seeking for a people who will believe in him amen that's where I'm I'm headed I want us to see that when God gives his word he does not give his word subject for debate he does not give his word subject for you know for people to think or to doubt and then ask questions you know if you want to ask a question you should be asking a question to know his mind to know his will but not to question his will or to question his mind or to question what he has said to you and that's why Believers why are we called Believers we are called Believers because we are are the people that have decided to believe everything God has said whether we whether we understand it or not he never told us to understand it but he simply told us to do what to believe it so we are believers not because we understand everything in the Bible we are believers but because we believe everything in the Bible now now when someone reads you something and it you know it plays with your mind and you can't understand it and then he asks you do you also believe that say yes I believe it I believe it I believe everything as long as it is in the Bible I believe it because the word of God is the absolute and it's the absolute because it's the word of God and God's side is the word praise the name of the Lord now i' would like us also to take First Peter chapter 1: 13 uh we read verses um 13 to 19 listen he says where guard up your loyon the loons of your mind okay there is also something that I would want us to uh to zero in a little bit on on that on the mind he says guard up the loyons of your mind last time we talked about the mind and we found out that the mind is the spirit and the spirit you know man is Body Soul and Spirit now your body is the one on the outside your spirit next and then your soul your soul is the real you and now the mind is we we we looked at the gats of the mind and it has five gats conscious imaginations memory and others and he says guard up the loyons of your mind be sober and hope to the end of the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former LS of in your ignorance now before we knew God in other words before we knew God our mind was clouded with the things that were completely anti- good and anything anti- word is anti- God that means Antichrist now before we came to God before we came to him we had things in our mind we had things in our spirit but you see the Bible calls it our ignorance and I I'll explain many of those things just follow me here and he says so we had lust our former lust our initial lust the moment you were born you had certain lust within you because of your ignorance because your mind was not yet cleansed by the word of God but he says but as he which has called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation and he says because it is written be you holy for I am Holy are you following me are you following me amen and if you if it says and if you call on the father who without respect of person judges according to Every Man's work pass the time of your souring here in fear for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your VIN conversations received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without sport now here we need to understand that God is Holy and God is God now when when we approach him we should be ready and willing to submit to his will his will is revealed to us by his word I want to ask you a question why is it that our mind or our spirit our will is naturally against his word because many people come and you know I've talked to many people and they always tell me are you telling me that I should lose my mind that I should not use my brains that I should not use my spirit meaning my brains if someone says are you telling me that I should not use my brains to think that I should forget what my brain is telling me and then I I think what God is telling me to think listen your brain is your spirit are you following me well you need to say amen for me to say to to keep preaching to you or else I'll not preach your spirit your brain is your spirit and your spirit has a lot of things of course all of us were born with a spirit the moment you were born you had a spirit but your spirit had a lot of things that actually all most all the things in your spirit were against what is written here the moment you came to Christ you realized everything you have been preached to is against what you thought how many can relate everything they are preaching is against what you thought every and you're like what are they is this preure trying to say that I should leave what I know or what I think or what I've been taught to to to take something new yes but now listen our mind or our will is naturally against the word of God and for you to be able to receive a new or to receive or to to rather to be on the Lord's Side for you to be able to please God you need to do one thing you need to forsake your mind but how can you forsake your mind the Bible says you will receive a new heart and then you receive a new spirit when you you receive a new spirit then you have a new thinking then you have a new desire then you have a new thought then you have a new will then you have a new spirit so in other words the Bible says old Things become you know old Things become new the old is passed away now I want you to follow me here in Romans chapter 8 verse 7 tonight I'm teaching a concept of the word here and I'll show you the repercussion of those that do not follow this concept Romans 8:7 it says because the caral mind is enemity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be now I want you to imagine your mind to people who think it is not important to receive the Holy Spirit you have your mind and the Bible says your mind is caral now you don't need to do anything to have a caral mind all you need to do is to be born by your mother so all of us we are born with a caral mind but the Bible is telling us our caral mind is enemity against God our caral mind now remember your mind is your spirit now we are born with a mind that is against you know the the word of God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be now where is the law of God to the child of God the word of God is the law of God this is the law of God all of it in its entir not just one verse all of it Old Testament and New Testament this is the law of God now when we come to God and we we the word of God is preached naturally your kind of mind cannot receive this word that is why we have too many people in churches or even in the message who are believers but they have not received the life they have not received a new mind they have the other kind of mind many people who are called Christians but they do the same things that the people in the world do because they have never come to a place of of an experience with God to receive a new mind they still have the caral mind and with the caral mind you can never be subject to the law of God maybe what you will be is a hypocrite and do you know what who a hypocrite is a hypocrite is someone who claims to believe the word but does not actually practice it he has no power within him to practice the word he will still lie you will still tell lies you will still steal you will still fornicate you will still last after the things of the world even when you come to church you come to church and do the things of God and you go in the world and do the things of the world because you have a can of mind and the Bible says a can of mind is enemity against God and then it says in verse 6 uh this is a little bit up it says for to be kindly minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace may God help me never to be kindly minded you know a can of man let me tell you I will show you here an example before we finish a can man will see things canally will see things what in what we call reality things that you see that everybody is seeing and everybody can see they even say even a child can see it why can't you see it but listen that's a can of Mind a a can of mind will see what everybody will see what every human being will see but the mind of God will see only what the word of God says regardless of what everybody else is seeing praise the name of the Lord verse 8 we're still in Romans chapter 8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his when I read this I first paused a bit to understand it listen do you realize that the Bible actually is saying if you do not have the spirit of Jesus Christ you are not his child simple so now if you've never received the Holy Spirit you are he has rejected you he has denied you he has denounced you you remember the other scripture which says that many of them will come to me and they will say Lord Lord you know open for us you know we we did many things in your name we preached the gospel in your name we healed the sick in your name we we we raise the dead in your name he will not say you never did those things he actually admits yes you did those things in my name because his name has power anyone can take the name of Jesus and use it and he will receive results but here he says go away from me doers of iniquity now who is a doer of iniquity he says I never knew you how how do you get known by God or how does God know you God only knows you when you are in him and he's in you and he can only know you when his holy spirit is in your soul amen when you have been filled with the Holy Ghost then you can say you are known of God and is known of you you are known of God he knows you and you know him you are you are in him and he's in you that's the only way you can be known of God and the only way you can have the spirit of Jesus CHR in you but here he says if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and we have very many Believers without the spirit of Christ in them how do you know that you don't have the spirit of Christ is when to fulfill the law of God to you it is a struggle if it is a struggle for you to fulfill the law of God you do not have the Holy Spirit if it is a struggle for you to believe what the Bible says and practice it believing it is one thing but practicing it if it is a struggle for you to practice what is in the word of God then to you you don't have the Holy Spirit and how can you receive the Holy Spirit simply ask the Bible says ask and you shall receive if you ask believing then God will give you the Holy Spirit and when he gives you the Holy Spirit and to fulfill the word of God will not be a struggle it will be a natural thing it will come out of your spirit it will come out out of your soul it will be just you living your life in Romans 11 verse 6 it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so if you seek Him you uh he re he rewards you he gives you the Holy Spirit but without faith it is impossible to please God now I want us to differentiate two things here that is Faith and wisdom and these are the two things that are ruling the world today I don't know where you you which side you are on faith if you have faith you believe without seeing how many are how many how many believe in the Rapture you believe in the rupture can you prove it can you prove it can anyone prove the Rapture here you cannot prove the Rapture that is Faith how many Believers saved and are Washed by the blood of Jesus Christ that is Faith you cannot see it you can't even feel it you can't say that I feel like 100 kilogram of Salvation in my heart you don't feel it but you simply believe it you you you you you you you had and how do you receive Faith by hearing the word of God the law of God then you submit yourself under that word then you have faith so Faith you believe without seeing but in your heart you're convinced that that is the truth and nothing can tell you otherwise but wisdom you would have to prove it first you would have to be realistic everybody would have to first you would have to first show everybody and and prove to everybody or somebody to prove to you then you say oh then I accept it now we cannot please God if our mind is not submitted for Renewal we have to submit our mind or else we can never you know uh please God we are born with a kind of mind all of us here are born with a c mind so let God give us a brand new mind every one of us needs to receive a brand new mind Hallelujah a brand new mind a brand new mind a brand new mind our old mind represents or you know each time whenever the word of God is preached the the old mind the old Spirit resents the word I don't know about you but when I first came into the message and they would preach things I would sit back there and I would begin to resent it in my mind now when you are when you ever get at that place just to know you still have a can of mind and your can of mind is resenting the word but if you have a new mind whatever is preaching you say amen amen whether you believe it whether your mind accepts it or not you your heart will receive it whether you feel like it or not your heart will accept it whether you are listen even if your life is not yet living that word are you hearing me even if you are not able to live that word yet you are struggling but your body is not accepting your spirit is not accepting each time you keep you know falling short of it but you know what in your heart you just believe it as the word of God and whenever it is preached you just say amen and until one day you will realize you are able to live the life of that word in your life and we see that our old mind will always resent the word but the new mind will always receive the word amen you reach a moment when he his word overwhelms and possesses you I don't know how many have reached at that point in their life but I tell you what I have reached that point in my life whereby the word of God Amen has completely overwhelmed me and possessed me Hallelujah if you want to be my friend tell me things that in the word of God but if you want to Amen to go against this word hallelujah I will tell you I will make you my enemy because this word is my life this word is my everything this word has made me who I am this word is God and I believe it because I'm on God's side Hallelujah and whatever this word of God says then we should believe it because this word works you see you reach that moment when the word of God overwhelms you and that word of God possesses you you know that is the moment you believe every word every word it says and you know how do you believe it by Faith by Faith by faith you know by faith you come to church you came here today how by faith believing that you're going to receive something from the Lord hallelujah when you come to church you you you you may you may see you know oh there are only 20 people there only 30 people my faith is not on how many people came to church my faith is on me I have gone there I'm my my my past of and God is going to speak to me and therefore when the word of God Is Spoken I would say Amen Lord I believe it by faith we say Amen to the word of God by faith you pray amen by faith you go to Prayer by faith you know you go to work and you get a job and you go to work by faith you marry to those of you planning marriage and and working on marriage by faith you marry you see I want to show you something I want to show you a new realm of the children of God a caral mind will want to organize everything and make sure everything is in place and I mean everything realistically you have to make sure that you you have everything in place you have 20 million on the account for your wedding you you you you you you you have you know this and you have that you have a big house you have this you have that you have a car you have everything so you now say now I'm ready for marriage and that's how the world functions but the children of God don't function like that the children of God function by faith and the Bible says without faith it is impossible to please God so even you marry by what by faith amen you know even children I've seen even those who even H you know go to the next level of marriage and they say well I'm married now but I'm not ready to have children why because they're fearing H will I be able to take my children to school will I be able to feed them will I be able to pay you know this for that will I be able to buy Dias will I be able to do that will I be able to do this why because they have a can mind and the says a can mind is enity with God and let me tell you Saints amen we should always have the spiritual mind not the can of mind because a can of mind will never agree with the word of God but a spiritual mind will always be pliable will always believe in the Unseen will always believe in what God can do will always see what others are not seeing amen so when God gives you a wife you'll say well I'm going to have children and I'm going to have as many as the Lord will give me Hallelujah because he says the children are the heritage of the Lord and he says happy is a man whose quiver is full of them but do you know that has changed by the mar that has changed Even in our churches they say sad is the man whose quer is full of them sad when they ask you how many children you have me I now have five and I'm praying and believing for more if the Lord teres and by his grace but when I tell you I have five some of you you see because the way the world has done it the way the world has fashioned the whole thing it has made you have fear fear about the whole subject you see but you see when you tell the world today that you have five children everybody will be shocked everybody will say what ah within how long within no brother go slow you know this is very difficult what what what you are you happy are you I said yes the Bible says happy is a man whose quiver is full of them the Bible does not sad is the man whose quer is full of them so but the opposite is true sad is the man whose quiver is empty so if you are married and you're failing failing or fearing rather to have children then you are a sad person but you should be you should know that if if if if God God's word says happy is the man who keep is full of them you are going to have a spiritual mind not a kind of mind you're going to say Amen Lord amen Lord and you are the moment you Mar you're going to begin praying for children oh God give us children hallelujah oh brother Isaac you should cut out that and give it to the people who who just got married so they can hear it praise God Amen so by faith you have children by faith you give you don't give to say now let me give to get no you don't give to get but you give by faith believing that God will will will give you much more amen you give by faith amen whatever you give you give yourself by faith you give of your substance by faith you give give your life to the Lord amen to for service by faith amen even by living you live by faith everything we do as sons of God as Daughters of God we do it by faith not by sight or by reasoning or by ability to explain let me tell you I cannot explain to you how I live but I live by faith I live by faith everything about me is by faith everything about a child of God a Son of God Is by faith people can even ask how did you pay your tution how did you how do you pay your rent how do you do that how do you do that let me tell you it is all by Faith by faith Hallelujah you cannot please God if you're using your reasoning if you're using your wisdom you have to use Faith because Faith amen is the currency of Heaven Hallelujah we need men and women of Faith amen who will go and say I'm going to start a company H I am going to start a company now I will know you are on God's side Hallelujah yes brother you start a company sister you start it and watch it watch God come behind it and you know you know what God does our God watches and waits for people and men who have faith if you if you have nothing you cannot add on you anything but he says to him that has more shall be added so God Amen is pleased with men and women of Faith so if you have faith start something if you have faith do something don't see sit there and relax and say I'm praying for a miracle the miracle will never come if you are on God's side you're going to do whatever you are doing by faith and that will please God everything to a Son of God Is by faith not by sight not by explanation or by wisdom but by faith and here in the message faith is a substance it says you are here tonight by faith many of you told your employer you would be back tomorrow to work how do you know you will you told your wife I'll be home after service how do you know your wife will you told a person maybe to come a cab a cab or a taxi or a border border or whatever to pick you up at 11:00 how do you know you will be here you may be in eternity before 11:00 tonight see but it's all by faith everything is by faith tell your neighbor it's by faith you don't have to struggle about anything it is by faith and let me tell you the problem that we have with Christianity is many people do not have faith and even Abraham is called the father of uh of the faith because Abraham believed God and it was counted for unto him for righteousness so in other words if you have faith you potentially are righteous You Are Holy simply because you have faith can you imagine that simply because you have faith you are righteous it was counted unto him for righteousness because he had Faith he believed god without seeing without getting any shity I I i' would like to show you this example here in the Book of Numbers if you can open the Book of Numbers Chapter 3: 5 uh we begin from verse 5 yes it's a long story but we'll break break it as as we go along amen and the Lord spake unto Moses saying bring the tribe of Levi near uh brother Dixon if you can work on my monitor uh bring excuse me bring the tribe of Levi near and present them before Aaron the priest that they may Minister unto him and they shall keep his charge and the charge of the whole congregation before the Tabernacle of the congregation to do the service of the Tabernacle and they shall keep all the instruments of the Tabernacle of the congregation and the charge of the children of Israel to do the service of the Tabernacle and thou shalt give the Levites unto Aon and to his sons and they are holy given unto him out of the children of Israel and thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons and they shall wait on their priests office and the stranger that cometh now shall be put to death now I read this portion in the book of numbers because it is speaking on uh God's instruction to Moses about the priesthood Ood and specifically about what Aaron's responsibility would be because Aaron was supposed to be the high priest and then his sons would be also the uh the priests but then the other Tri the other members of the tribe of Levy would be Ministers of Aaron and so he set everything in order and so that's how it was and and this we can now say was the word of God like you see that this is our Bible this was now their Bible what they had to refer to but I want us to go in number chap 16 much later on and we see what happened in numbers 16 verse1 now Kora the son of isah the son of Kath the son of Levi all right so now we are seeing here one of the sons of of of Levi who were not in the priesthood K and Daran and Abraham these were sons of reben and they rose up verse two and they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation Are Holy uhhuh every one of them and the Lord is among them wherefor then lift up ye yourselves above the congregation of the Lord now I want you to see there is a definition of God for holiness and there is a definition of man out of their his wisdom for Holiness now God had given his definition here even as we have already seen to be holy to be righteous to be accepted by the Lord is to be on his side and his side is his word the moment you believe his word how do you receive his word by what by faith you believe it you don't doubt you don't question it you just simply believe it now when you do that you are considered to be holy all right so now this man Abraham Daran and then Kora came to Moses and they said you are taking too much on you huh we are also holy all the Believers in the church Are Holy we are all holy every one of them is Holy why are you the one taking all these responsibilities you and Aaron why and Moses heard it he fell upon his face why did Moses do that Moses knew the mistake these people had done let me tell you brother sister do anything and everything but never doubt the word God is never pleased with doubters or people who play around with his word because his word is the absolute his word is the core of our heart of our souls without his word we we we are dead we have perished that's why in the in the message let me tell you in the there are some churches that just take this Bible lightly they're Christians but they do not value this Bible they take it lightly but let me tell you this Bible is not just a book like any other book this is the thoughts of God the mind of God is the absolute our life should be guided by the word of God and anyone who preaches anything that is not based on the Bible is only having fables Creeds and dogmas and those shall pass away but the Bible says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but what shall never pass away the word my word shall never pass away and that's why here we believe the word because we believe the word to be the absolute and we believe the word shall never pass away our churches will pass away our building will pass away people shall die but the word of God can never pass away and how do you know a preacher who's preaching the truth everything he's saying must be backed up by the word or else is only bringing his favors and his ideas and so we see here Moses knew the mistake these people had done the moment they began murmuring and questioning the word it is God I just read it for you there in in in in numbers chapter 3 it is God who said now you Moses you are God you Moses you are God uhuh and then he said now Aaron is going to be the high priest and his sons uhuh and now the the rest of the tribe of uh of the Levites those ones they shall be ministers to to Aaron they will be ministers in the in the Tabernacle to Aaron so that was the hierarchy that God said Moses a and and then come all the other Levites and the ministers and then come the congregation now K was among the people who were in The in from the tribe of realan they were just from the congregation and others so they now came they teamed up here is one from the tribe of Levy and one they now gathered themselves together and they came to fight against the hierarchy that God had set you see God had set Moses Aaron his sons and then then the rest of the tribe of Levy come after Minister but now these people saw Moses up there like God giving around Commandments and telling people to do this and this and then they saw Aaron there as a high priest everything is saying he saying he's doing it on behalf of God is's the only one who who enters the the holy of holies and now they I'm sure when they they they made they met together they must have begun reasoning but what is the difference between us and Moses and Aaron we are all the same we are all human beings we all have blood we are all called of God we all holy actually said we are all holy because we are all children of Israel why are they the only ones having these important responsibilities why are they not allowing us also to go and do this why are they also not allowing us to go and do that they no no no no this is not good it's not gender maybe also medium because remember also medium was part of it maybe it's not gender gender balance it's not equality it's not you know what is the other words that they use to always involve include others yeah diversity yeah this the leadership is not diverse it's not diverse they should put someone from our tribe they should put from also now also should put someone from the tribe of of Lev when I see in the leadership when I see Pastor is I don't know which his tribe he is Brother Martin his tribe on his tribe our tribe is not represented I'm sure they were right because when they saw Aon and Moses and others there was none from the tribe of Rin and they must have felt bad they must have felt like we want our tribe to be there and this is the problem we have in many many churches they do God and let me tell you no man can call a pastor or a preacher it is God who calls them and when God calls somebody God stands behind someone to prove that I'm with that person and if you fight that person you're not fighting that person but you're fighting God himself and you see this is the problem that people have always had from from time IM Memorial they have always fought god without realizing they fighting God the moment Moses heard what they said what Moses fell down flat he fell down and he covered his face and and when he covered his face this is what he began praying listen he said and and he spake unto Kor he fell upon his face he didn't even say these things looking at Kor he he K must have been the ring reader because K was from the tribe of Levy they must have got somebody from the tribe of Le and now you you are among the leaders let us you come and you support our cause yes yes let us go and and do the Ken mandano let's go and quaka and so now as they came he spake unto K and unto his company saying even tomorrow the Lord will show who are his and who is Holy and will cause him to come near unto him even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near unto him praise the name of the Lord that's why you should never stand behind the pull pit until you are called by God and when you do let me tell you never fight your battles God will always fight your battles that's why you should never do anything before you are called by God Amen and when you do anything knowing I am in the will of God Amen the will of God is the word of God it is not written in here it is on the back side of the book how many I getting it the moment you know the will of God for your life it is the word of God and if anyone comes no matter where they're coming from no matter what Authority they have if they fight against that they are fighting against the very God who has revealed his will to you and here they began fighting Moses and and trying to do that and Moses said all right if you are a royal priesthood you will always be challenged hallelujah hallelujah amen in the same way Aon was a priesthood was a high priest but for us we don't even need to be born from the tribe of Levy or Levi to be high priests or to be priests yes sir you you didn't hear me did you hear me we don't need to be naturally born out of the tribe of Levi to be priests the Bible says amen by the convenant of of blood which was shed on the cross the Bible says we have also been made priests so we are also priests with God hallelujah we are also priests amen and and and the moment you become priests let me tell you many people are going to feel that you are lifting yourself higher than them and they'll begin to fight you but let me tell you brother sister never fight your own battles are you hearing me never try to defend yourself me I have you know I have a a way I do things when people fight me or when somebody fights me or say something against me usually I leave them alone because I know I it's not my battle to fight it is God to fight that battle amen hallelujah and I'm telling you never fight your battles maybe some of you last Sund I told you love your enemies your enemies are very important in your life and tonight I'm saying to you amen never fight your battle because the moment you fight your battle God will leave you to fight for yourself but if God sent you God is going to be right there fighting for you if God gave you that woman in your life or that man in your life amen let me tell you God will fight for you if God placed you in that job God will fight for you amen no man can take you out no man can take you in because it is God who placed you there wherever you are in your life amen that place that position take it because it is yours by faith oh my God glory to God let me tell you which whatever place or position in your life that God bles you he places you there by faith to you mother or father if God has even given you children those children are yours by faith they are yours by faith so when the Devil comes at you Amen to try and and challenge you Amen to take your children away from you you stand your ground and say these children are mine and devil you not have them and by faith I'm claiming every one of them amen hallelujah so watch God fight for you when you do that praise the name of the Lord verse verse 8 number 16:8 and Moses said unto Kor here I pray you ye sons of Levi uhhuh seeth it but a small thing unto you that the god of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the Tabernacle of the Lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them you children of Levi that's and and um and the others rather cor on others did it is it a small thing to you you felt like you are so small you know the are this a problem people who even in the house of God they do not appreciate what God has made them if God has made you a singer or a song leader media Department you know musician or just somebody to say h Allelujah amen Somebody To You Know sweep or clean the church or somebody to do whatever you are doing sound whatever you are doing you know appreciate it and do it with all your heart amen do it with all your heart amen always be found at your post of Duty don't miss charch be there it is your post of Duty and and you see he says that U to those he asked them he says what God gave you did it seem so small so small unto you and he has brought thee near to him and all thy Brethren the sons of Levi with thee and seek ye the priesthood also you also want to be now into the priesthood and yet God has made you a minister you are not satisfied with that oh I don't know about you but friend I'm going to be satisfied God has made me for which for which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the Lord and what is Aon that he M against him Hallelujah did you see he says why are you now Gathering against the Lord in other words anybody that amen will come against you is not coming against you he coming against the Lord himself oh my you should shout amen for that Hallelujah whoever is coming against me is not coming against me he's coming against the Lord he's coming against the Lord when he comes against you because you are standing there because God has placed you there that's why whatever you do do it by faith believing Hallelujah we will not if we we believe these things we will not we will have very few musicians uh who get offended when someone speaks something negative when someone speaks something negative about you when you're at your post of Duty simply say you are you don't know what you're doing you are fighting against God because you at your post of Duty if you're a deacon and someone says something you know negative about you stay right there and say you don't know what you're doing this office has the anointing of the lord we would have few quitters let me tell you don't quit your place remain in your place Hallelujah as long as God has called you as long as you're doing it by faith stay right there God will fight for you Hallelujah glory to God praise God and he said you're fighting against God and you don't even know it you see and who is Aon Aon is just a man you're mming against him he's just a man he's just there to fulfill the purpose of God so these men that God uses could be a pastor could be a deacon could be a music leader or Sunday school superintendent or whatever it is they're just men used by God and in verse 19 he says and K gathered all the congregation against them even when Moses preached his sermon I'm imagining such sermon that a pastor or a minister would preach when he has been hurt Moses preached his sermon and finished it and after he had he had finished it then the congregation you know it says Kora Kora did not desist from his action he went and gathered all the congregation unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the Lord appeared unto the all the congregation I love that that that sight you know God always comes down to defend his word hallelujah oh my I feel so good about this whenever amen God is his word is put to the test God always shows up that's why friend always let us remain within the word whatever you do let your conscience be clear let your mind be clear that I am standing right in the place where I am supposed to be if you are in the place where you are supposed to be God will fight for you and you will hold your peace see here numbers 16: 20 oh all right let us read from verse 20 and we go down and we see now when the Lord came down what happened and the Lord spake unto Moses and and unto Aaron saying separate yourselves from among this congregation uhhuh that I may consume them in a moment he was angry God was angry he wanted to consume everyone and kill all the Israelites those ones who did bad and those ones who did not do bad that's why it is very I'm not going to finish my sermon again but you see I wanted to go into the the part of Separation that's why we have to separate ourselves from unbelief when someone is not believing the cause that you are believing always distance yourself from them because if you do not when God comes down he will not you know jump you he will he will consume him and consume you at the same time that's why you have to be very distinct with unbelief God does not love unbelief when you believe the word of God do not listen to stories that of of unbelievers and do not entertain in it stay with your word and desist from you know making unions and communions with unbelievers we will see it right here when God came down he he only told Moses and Aaron his servants he said separate yourself let me consume all of them everybody but listen and they fell upon their faces and they said oh God the god of the spirits of All Flesh shall one man sin and will thou be RO with all the congregation the old church has not done this oh God you see the importance of a man of God of a pastor of a Preacher that's why the Bible says that give them respects that's why the Bible says that honor them as they that watch for your souls listen if it wasn't for Moses and Aaron God was going to kill all of them and I'm not only preaching to dvf I'm also preaching to evening light that's why it is very important for you to respect your pastor and look up to him and and and and because he's a man of God God has placed him there he has an anointing upon his office and as long as he is the man God will only respect him because he's in that place you see and and um and when Moses died God placed another one there you see and the anointing shifted to another man but as long as Moses and Aaron were alive the anointing were upon them and and and it yeah you know it was not that's why someone said Can someone tithe to an individual brother bam said yes it depends on who the individual is tithe is not for building the church or for for buying land of the church tithe is for the pastor to for for for for his cost and his expenses right did we believe that do we do we believe that here and he says yes you can tithe to a man but it depends on who the man is he has to be your pastor not just an evangelist traveling around here and there he has to be your pastor you know someone that is feeding you the word someone that you look up to to to to to uh um to watch for your soul and so we see here that now the the moment they do that that the God says I'm going to destroy everybody step aside that that moment you know they fell on their faces and they began shouting said oh God will everybody will one person sin and you kill everybody oh no and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the congregation saying get you up up from about the Tabernacle of Kora Daran and Abram and Moses rose up and went unto Daran and Abram and the Elders of Israel followed him and he spake unto the congregation saying ah this is the part love and this is why I got my subject who is on the Lord's Side Hallelujah because right at this moment you know Moses came up you know he was so fast because he was so happy he was feeling for those Souls who were not part of the sin which was committed amen let me tell you A God Called preacher will always have a heart for Souls will not be out for the money of the people but will be out there for the souls of the people and you know the moment God told him now you can go and separate them he r quickly and he went with the Elders of the church and they quickly went there and Moses rose up and went to D and Kora and Abraham and the ERS followed him and he spake unto the congregation saying to the church depart I pray you from the tents of the wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be consumed in all their sins H Hallelujah and I'm speaking to the church tonight I have the same same message to you today amen praise the name of the Lord he says depart I pray you depart from the tents of the wicked men the tents of the wicked men maybe the wicked women as well depart from them and touch nothing of theirs L he be consumed in all their sins I believe that's the cry we have in our generation depart be ye separate depart from the Sinners depart from the doubters depart from men who have no faith depart from them or else you be consumed with them it was a heartfelt someone that day he preached like a dying man to a dying generation that moment so they got up from the Tabernacle of K and that and Abraham on every side and d and Abraham came out and stood on the door of the of their tents and their wives and their sons and their little children and Moses said hereby ye shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works for I have not done them of my own accord my own mind you see it's not the mind of a man or a preacher it's the mind of of Christ if these men die the common death of all men or if they be visited after their the visitation of all men then the Lord has not sent me but if the Lord make a new thing and the Lord open her mouth and swallow them the Earth open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go down quick into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord and it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking of all these words that the ground cave a that was under them and the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses and all the men that appertain unto cor and all their goods hey my God my God everything they had they and all that are pertained to them you see Hallelujah I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them not everybody in church wants to go to heaven others have their own you know ideas and ideologies and plans and things and that's why they will not fear to speak about certain things that don't even pertain unto them but when God came down he did not separate that these are young children this is just an innocent house this is an innocent friend he boundled everything together as long as they were together he said all of you you are going to be destroyed go out the earth the earth opened up oh my god when the earth opened up you needed to see it when the earth opened up everything all their goods all the men all the girls all the women everybody who was among the camp of K D abam the Earth opened up and swallowed everything they and all that pertained to them went down alive alive into the pit and the Earth closed upon them and they perished from among the congregation H there were two sides one side was separated unto the Lord it was on the Lord's Side Moses Aaron and others and then the other side was the side of Abraham danan and Kora and everybody that believed in them when when when God wanted to destroy everybody God told them Moses said no please you can't do that there are others who are innocent he said all right I'll listen to you because you are my man all right now tell me who is innocent just go and and speak to them whoever will listen to you that's why you should listen to The Preacher's voice this a sound of many Waters the preachers voice the god that man that God sends and anoints to preach to you the word of God is a sound of many Waters and do not undervalue it it's the word of God for Save salvation of your souls and when they heard him they quickly ran on the other side and so tonight I also ask who is on the Lord's Side if you're on the Lord's Side you're going to abide by his word if you're on the Lord you're going to believe everything that is in his word you will not listen to the doubters you not listen to any other you know people just giving questions but you will listen to the word because the word to you will be life the others who refuse it what did they get they got death amen but the others who accept it they got life when others will come to you and they will say to you it is not it is not it is very difficult to live a Christian Life it is very difficult to do what the pastor is saying it is very difficult okay don't worry you remain there but if you among those who are on the Lord's Side you are not going to listen to that stuff you're going to run away from such people who speak such stuff and you will go on the Lord side immediately because we see that that's why the message of Separation also comes in here I'll finish with this quotes in the message the faith of Abraham he says when you come in and receive the Holy Ghost you say well I was told to be this and I was told the days of Miracles is passed you better leave that thing behind in other words whatever oh my somebody listening to me tonight whatever you were taught before you came to the knowledge of the word whatever thing you read maybe in a book whatever thing maybe you saw on a movie Whatever thing maybe you heard from your lecturer or from your teacher that is contrary to the word leave it behind he says leave that thing behind and as long as that holds with you it would be like Abraham started out with lot and his father there is trouble in the camp and God never did bless Abraham until he separated himself and done what God told him to do and you will never receive the holy ghost in the fullness you will never walk in the spirit of God until you totally separate your things from unbelief we ought to say Amen to that get away from the world come out of the world you see we have to totally separate from unbelief those men who did not separate themselves maybe they thought the argument of D and K and and Abraham is right is founded is psychologically and emotionally and whatever correct but it was wrong according to the word in the message Jehovah J I'll finish with that quote he says another thing he told him to do to separate himself now from his Kindred and all of his people he's talking about Abraham God in order to get a man or a woman boy or girl to obey him you have to separate yourself from all unbelief that's right until you totally separate yourself from anything contrary to that word and believe it God calls for a total separation tell somebody total separation total separation total separation who knew knew that that ground was going to open up and everybody that did not separate themselves would die who knew it was God's secret but you see if you don't separate yourself from the world you will die for sure but if you on the Lord's Side you will live for sure I want to be on the Lord's Side and I ask who is on the Lord's Side tonight let us stand up on our feet father in the name of Jesus we are praying Lord for the people that have had this message from the beginning and maybe some of them had made wrong decisions and had not separated themselves from unbelief and they were at a place when they did not exactly know what Association they should have but my prayer Lord for each one tonight is that you will meet them at their point of need and help them Father because death will surely come if they do not separate themselves father Lord we want to live in the way that you want us to live because we know that our time here on Earth is soon ending and will soon end help us father to be pleasing to you and to all my listeners tonight Lord both here and online line bless each one father and bring them to that place oh God where they will be totally on your side for the glory of your holy name in Jesus name faithful one so unchanging ageless one you're my rock of Peace Lord of all I depend on
