========================================

Lord, precious father, this morning you have brought us here, Father, from different walks of life. Father, Lord Jesus, we know it has not been an easy week, Father, to some of us. But God, you have been faithful, Lord Jesus, as you told us that you'll never leave us alone. We have seen you fighting our battles. We have seen you healing, Lord, our diseases. And father, even this morning, your grace is sufficient for us, Lord. As we're approaching that throne of grace, we are entering through the door of the blood of Jesus. And we ask you this morning that may the precious blood of Jesus stand between us and Lord our sins, Lord. Release your precious blood this morning and cleanse each and every worshipper this morning. Father, may you p us this day, oh God. cleanse us and father receive us Lord. Each one of us we have come Lord with a sacrifice this morning to worship you Lord. And we pray that Father may our sacrifice be consumed this morning by the holy fire Lord Jesus. Father, where we have strayed during the course of this week in our imagination, our words, our action, we ask you this morning to forgive us, Lord. Just as you say that, come and let us reason together. Though our sins be like scarlet, you'll make them white as snow. Though they be like crimson, you wash them and they'll be white as the wool. Precious Father, this morning, may the Holy Spirit come and take full preeminence in this service. May you move in a special way, Lord. If there be those who are sick and afflicted this morning, for the Bible say that you send your word and your word heals us. Lord, may you touch each one of us this morning from the crown of our head to the sole of our feet. Lord Jesus, circumcise our lips and our hearts. Anoint the musician, anoint the congregation, anoint the preaching of the word this morning, Father, even the song leader that your grace will be sufficient, Lord. May you save all those are savable this morning. May you make us new Christian, Lord. Father, we thank you. We turn against every evil spirit in the name of Jesus. Satan, you have no right. We drive out of this place. We render you powerless in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, may that pillar of fire move this morning and you make us flexible that Lord, we shall move with a cloud this morning. Oh God, have your own way, Lord Jesus. remember even those who are still on the way. May you quicken their footstep Lord in the most precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Hallelujah.

Then this is a like a discussion between you and them. [Music] Like for example, the first says, "I saw a blind man tapping along, [Music] losing his way as he passed through the dawn. Tears filled my eyes." I said, "Friend, you can't see." Oh, but with a smile. Amen. And brother Shame, I'm trying to wait for that key cuz you know I don't know whether my voice is up for that key right now. But we'll see what go what happens.

How many will be in that Hallelujah square? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I feel thrilled in my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. To know that I'll be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, my sound is not really that perfect, but I'm so happy this morning and I'm seeing many who thought that the pastor will not be here this morning another church and I hope and I pray that this church does not really adopt that principle that I know that usually when the pastor is not around many churches you know the people that's when they will get trips that's when they will travel that's when they will go to do this It's as if like they have a holiday. But we don't really come here for the pastor. We come here for the Lord. And let us make it um you know a custom whether the pastor is around or not. Let us be at our post of view. Tell your neighbor, is that amen? [Music] All right. So, um I was not meant to be here this weekend. I was, as I told you, supposed to be ministering uh for some churches in Haral this weekend. And I'm speaking while I'm waiting for you to put up those videos and and and photos. I think you have it on the media group, Brother Isaac and Brother Marvin. So I was supposed to be uh there with them this weekend. Uh but um I felt it in my heart to cancel that appointment and be here because because we have a lot of u um unfinished business to do [Music] regarding our youth camp that is happening regarding uh the um the land that we are trying to acquire. Yeah. And um and uh so I thought it is important to be here this weekend so we can be able to handle it. &gt;&gt; So but for now I'm going to give you a little report. [Music] &gt;&gt; Okay. You do you have all the pictures? Uh it's on the media group. Y not in order. Okay, no problem. As long as you have all of them and the video as well. Okay, so uh so this is the church that we had went to attend their dedication [Music] and um personally I first visited this church when they were still renting some um some more than 10 years ago. And uh uh the reason why I went on this trip, &gt;&gt; I went to tap the anointing. I I I went to be inspired &gt;&gt; because you know if you're not inspired right sometimes you are all by yourself in your own little world and you do not know that things can be done until you see others doing them. Then you begin to believe that the same God who did it for them can do it for you. You know these brothers started also humble like all of us. I would want to tell you that the message in Zimbabwe has really progressed so much. It's not like here in Uganda. Here in Uganda we do not have uh we've not accomplished as much as they have accomplished. Um uh there's no way I can be able to overemphasize that like I will give you an example and I'm going to give you a few more pictures just in a moment but I'll tell you this in Zimbabwe &gt;&gt; during the weekend when we were there uh we they had about three main meetings conventions. one was the uh was the one we were at actually myself and pastor Gideon were at that because both of us are friends to pastor Joseph &gt;&gt; and so uh but this was about 3 4,000 people and it was not the biggest and but you see and all these people that came on that on that meeting um are a part of the ministry of brother Chikos. You know he started a church the first church in Mutar that is about 250 kilometers away then in Haral the capital city then now he's in the UK where he pastor but in all these churches well of course is um is respected as the founder and the pastor but then there are many other churches that sprung out of his ministry. &gt;&gt; Talk about brother Martin, &gt;&gt; brother Julius, brother shame somewhere whoever and they all spread out and they have also b other churches. You understand? So you find that there are several bishops [Music] in his ministry that have started under his ministry. And um that was I found it to be really a commendable thing and um so all those churches now came together [Music] at this dedication. The number I told you about 3 4 thousand are not all the people those are the ones who could come and so but then there were other meetings in was another meeting that's another friend of mine who I have ministered for pastor Dr. Also there were a few thousands there then also you in another in actually where we were in there was now the biggest meeting another biggest meeting I think I was told about 16,000 or something like that and um and um you know that's not reflecting all the believers in the country So in Uganda we are still joking there is a lot of work to do and um I tell you I told my family I said I'll not say this but I'm now going to say uh some trips you go to learn so on this trip I went in a Bible and myself and pastor Gideon were given a cottage. We're staying together and in one apartment. We talked a lot regarding ministry, regarding the work of the ministry and how how um how much is needed to be done in Uganda. I tell you what, Um those that time was a time of refreshing, a time of learning a lot of things and a time of being challenged. There's a lot more that we can do for the Lord. We need to catch the vision. We need to catch the vision. Can Can you give us more pictures? That's Pastor Chos right there. You know, he was supposed to be our come speaker for last year, but because of the accident he had. &gt;&gt; Keep playing the photos, brother. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's the Bible believers. &gt;&gt; That's the cornerstone. &gt;&gt; Just keep just keep keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Um, is it possible to remove these lights by this area so that the people can see? Brother Martin, please keep keep playing the video. The brother Marvin, I I expect you to continue. Just continue. Okay. Yeah, that's the speed I want. Yeah. Okay. Wait. So, that's outside. Um, you know, the people are so many and um, uh, they were just Okay, continue. That's part of the building. Continue. Part of the building. Continue. Continue. Yeah, that's the interior. continue. Okay. Uh we don't have a sound. It's okay. Just keep playing the video even if there is no sound. I don't know brother Isaac if you have sound online and brother Marvin if you could just throw all those videos and pictures to the church group so that everybody who is there can be able to get it on their phone so you can now try to see everything. We were gathering in that tent outside there &gt;&gt; cuz every not everybody could fit in the building. So we got packed in there as many as could enter to do the dedication. [Music] Sometimes we can't believe until we see now we have seen I'm not showing off someone someone's work their father is our father you understand so what I'm saying we are more than able If God can do it for them, he can do it for us. We need to rise in faith. Um, you know, they did all that by their by themselves. There was no sponsor. Some of you people are not giving towards the church projects because you somehow believe a sponsor will come. That's a poor man's mindset. And until that mindset is gone, we should not expect these things to happen in our lives. But that mindset We should give it up and believe that we are the ones to do the work. &gt;&gt; You when I say we, I mean me. &gt;&gt; Just say I mean me. Say say me. You you are the one supposed to do the work. So I saw so much until I said no, let me go back home. And um I I I hate to say no when I'm asked to minister but I said no let me go back home. I need to in to show these things to my people and inspire them. Tell them we have seen that the land is good and flowing with milk and honey and we can take it. Hallelujah. We are more than able to take it. We are more than able to take it. There is a sister who sent me I don't know she must have been moved. I I received these messages past midnight, almost 2 a.m. And she sent a message to me and she said, "I used to be at my mother church somewhere, some other place, but old people could do old things. I could look at myself saying I'm young." those ones contributions they are for the elder but I reached this side and I heard them talking of contributions and I was like they're speaking to the elder then I looked around and I was like I'm almost the same age like most of you are you following so she left her came here DVF and at her church she did not used to give any contribution because she thought those are for the elders for the old people the ones who have a lot of money but when she came here she heard that everybody I mean we are talking about contributions she said ah well it's for the old people so but when she looked around she saw and noticed that uh she was almost the same age like everybody else. So I could just feel good when I find church renovated. This is now back home. I could not know how I just clap my hands because I'm sitting comfortable. But God has directed me to this place here for a purposeful training. And she's saying something tells me you will now clap with a purpose. I really don't need to know anything because I found church built. But here I am learning how it is done. And I did not plan to read that sister. I felt is very appropriate. Maybe there are some who are like her. For the people, the elderly, the ones who have grown up. Look around you. Look around. Come on, take accept. Turn around. Look around. Look behind you on the left and on the right. Okay. Who are the elders you're talking about? It is actually you. Some of you when you look around, you actually the elder. So what I'm saying? No one is going to do this work. We are going to do this work by ourself. you are going to do the work and um I'm going to reserve the other comments after the word. We'll have a little session of the word and I know some others have to go out. They have other schedules. Sister Rose told me she's in the village. I think for the court issues we mentioned last time. And um so I would try to be a little brief today so that we can do the other church business when everybody is still here. So let us stand for now and go to Genesis chapter 39 uh vers um we're beginning from verses one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do I have the pianist still here? Amen. I'd like us to sing a little chorus [Music] as we going to read Genesis chapter 39. Reach out and touch the Lord as he goes by. You will find he's not too busy to hear God's cry is passing by this moment your need to supply [Music] and touch the Lord. [Music] Can we all sing it one more time in a relaxed way? Everybody just sing it out. [Music] And touch the Lord as he goes by. You will find is not too busy to hear your cry. Oh passing by this moment your to reach out and touch the Lord as he &gt;&gt; just one last time everybody lift up your voice. and judge the Lord. [Music] Jesus find well you will find is not your busy to height is passing by this moment your needs We reach out and the Lord. Oh, as he goes by, Father Lord, we want to ask you to come and help us this morning. [Music] Lord, we are helpless without you. We want to give this service to you Lord. Come and have your way. Minister to us Lord the words of life. May we hear from you. Father Lord, may you take every person bind us all together with your love, with inspiration that comes from you. May we all Lord come into the realm of the spirit and hear what the spirit says. Lord help us to yield ourselves to be able to take everything aside. Let us come to that place where we can let go of self. Let go of ourselves that we will come to that place where you will be able to speak to us where we shall be able to have fellowship. Father Lord, for however short this service might be, I just ask that you'll help us that whatever will be said will be a blessing to your people. Grant I pray &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are reading Genesis chapter 39. [Music] Uh we'll read verses 1 to 5 and then we read verses 21. Amen. And I'm reading in the name of the Lord. And Joseph was brought down to Egypt. And Portifer, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the God, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishalites, which had brought him down thther. And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was pro a prosperous man. And uh he was in the house of uh his master, the Egyptian. And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand. And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him, and he made him of a seer over his house. And all that he had, he put into his hand. And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptian his house for Joseph's sake. And the blessing of the Lord was upon all, not some, all that he had in the house. Oh my God. And in the field, not only the house, but also in the field. H praise the name of the Lord. Amen. And um if you look at verses 21, if you &gt;&gt; go to verses 21, &gt;&gt; then he says, "And Joseph uh but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison." And the and the keeper of the prison committed to J Josephan all the prisoners that were in the prison. And whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. The keeper of the prison looked to any looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him. And that which he did, the Lord made it to prosper. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; This morning by the grace of God, I want to speak to you. I want to begin speaking to you. I don't know whether I will finish today on the son or son of prosperity. Hallelujah. Tell your neighbor, prosperity. Prosperity. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think that Uganda has it perfect because in this word is from Hebrew &gt;&gt; and the word in Hebrew is uh shall shall I don't know whether I'm pronouncing it perfectly. And according to Hebrew, it means to push forward, to advance, to make progress, to succeed, to be profitable, to be profitable. Praise the Lord. So now We are taking an example of Joseph here and I want to speak to you on prosperity today. Not as in just the way of the world. My brother, the one who is working on the sound. I still am not feeling that the sound is perfect. So I'm not talking the way you would think that the way others talk about prosperity because people think that prosperity is when you have a lot of money. No. And we are going to find out today. But I'm talking about advancing, succeeding, making progress. Hallelujah. Your amens are still very weak. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So now Joseph was not loved by his brethren. &gt;&gt; Amen. And please stay in one place so we can get done with this very fast. He wasn't loved by his brethren. Do you know why he was a blessed child? He was a favored child. His father loved him. You remember how he gave him a C of many colors and it made all the brothers jealousy. He was highly favored. And because they hated him, they thought that they will push him aside. They thought they would sabotage him. They thought they would make him decline. But they did not know he was a favorite child. And so they took him and and and and and sold him and well of course you remember the story how they wanted to put him down somewhere and uh you know others had an idea. Let us just send him off but let me tell you brothers a seed of God which is actually the word of God we've been talking about. We have been talking about seed in terms of the word and we also found out seed in terms of you. Are you following me? You can never destroy the seed. Seed is meant to prosper. Seed is meant to multiply. When you a seed that seed will multiply. It is the principle. It is a law of nature. When you buy a seed, seed multiply. Praise the name of the Lord. And so they took Joseph and and and and they sold him off. And of course they thought we are done with it. And they deceived their father that he was eaten by animals. But you cannot deceive. No one can deceive. The Bible says God is not mocked. That which you saw, you shall read. Hallelujah. But Joseph could not be destroyed. There are a people on on the world today that are working in the grace and anointing of God. These are people that are indestructible. Prosperity moves with them. They cannot be destroyed. They cannot be made poor. They cannot remain behind. They are meant to be and not take. &gt;&gt; You see, it's not about what they have done. It's about who they are. Are you following me so far? So now they take Joseph and sell him off. And these people you know Joseph ends up in the house of Portifer in Egypt. Now while in the house of Portifer you might say Joseph is finished he has gone among an unbelievers. But the devil did not know that Joseph was a son of prosperity. And when he reached Egypt, we have read it here, you know, actually Portifer realized how blessed this young man is because everything he was doing was prospering. And so what he did, he put everything he had in the hand of Joseph and he told him, "Joseph, take care of my estate. No one came to Portifer but only through Joseph. It is either through Joseph or it won't happen. Talk about access. Talk about favor. That's what Joseph Joseph's position was. And Joseph prospered in everything he did. He prospered in everything in his hand. He prospered when he was with the Ishmael. He prospered when he was in the house of so much until one time. Now Portifer said, "You are going to take care of my yesterday." The Bible actually says the man did not even know what he had. Only Joseph had the knowledge of what? The wealth of the man. Sister, peace. Think about it. If you are in the position of Joseph, think about it. Forget about the history. Take yourself there brother. If you are the one in that place, you are the one who knows the wealth of your master. So who is the one who is rich? You or your master? You because he doesn't know how much he has. You might as well use it anyhow you want. But you see it wasn't that Pifer was rich. It was Joseph that everything he touched prospered. [Applause] And one day uh you know his he's the wife of Portifer finds him and he says, "Joseph, come unto me." And Joseph said, "No, I cannot do that. My master put everything to my child in his house except for you because you are his wife. Joseph was a honest man. He was a sincere man. And his wife, the wife of said, "No, you can't do that to me." And so Joseph said, "Let me run away." &gt;&gt; And then he decided to run. And as he was running, the woman caught one of his garments. She said, "Ah, you can remain with it. &gt;&gt; But let me run for myself. Do we have people in our generation? Do we have younger men in our generation who are going to have that attitude to tell Portifer's wife to remain with everything she wants to remain with? But you run for your life. You run for what you stand for. You run for what you believe in. And and and and he ran. But you see, you cannot. It is either your word orifer's wife's word. Who do you think would believe? Of course, she he would believe his wife &gt;&gt; because this was his wife. This Hebrew boy you brought here. &gt;&gt; What is it my dear? &gt;&gt; You don't want to know what you did to me. &gt;&gt; He came into me and he tried to rap me and Joseph was not there but still there was a witness. I want to try and show you what happens when you receive the word, when you take the word. When you leave the word, what happens in your life? I'm going to be brief. Much of my preaching today is quotes, but nevertheless, follow me closely. I want to show you that you are at nobody's mercies in this world. That you are not what you are because of what someone did for you. Don't allow someone to put a rope in your neck and try to control you. No one should control you. If you are in the position or in the shoes of Joseph, there is a grace that is upon your life that has been following you from the time you were born. And when you came into this message, let me tell you, it was activated. And that is what will see you through your entire life. No, you're not an enemy masses of anybody. We are the masses of only our Lord. As long as we are standing on the word, he will see to it. And he will deal with all our enemies even in our absence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Joseph was not there. And this woman began to connive and to talk and to lie and to blackmail him. But God was there. Sister, when you are standing on the word, God is always there and God fights for you and God will always fight for you. I am trying to explain to you what prosperity is. Joseph had no money but he was a prosperous man. And at that moment as as she tried to do all that the man said bring that boy here and they threw him in jail. And now Joseph is in jail. Now you would think it has finished. &gt;&gt; It was just the beginning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; If God allows me to go through what I'm going to go through today, you'll be really blessed. Amen. Amen. Joseph was still pushing forward. Joseph still was advancing. Joseph was still making progress even in prison. He was still succeeding. Amen. The Bible says when he went to prison, listen to these words. It says right here. Praise the Lord. But the Lord, well, the Bible says, "And Joseph, Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound. And he was there in the prison. But the Lord was with Joseph. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You want to understand why the Lord was with Joseph? The Lord was with Joseph and he showed him mercy and he gave him favor. Amen. When the Lord is with you, he gives you mercy. He gives you favor. Let me tell you brother, how do you know the Lord is with you? When you are standing in the water. Amen. Hallelujah. When you are Amen. When you are when you are eating the open book, then the Lord is with you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if the Lord is with you, he will always show you mercy. He will always show you favor. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The brothers think he's dead. thinks he's punishing him. But God was very busy, progressing him. And the Lord was with Joseph and he showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand. all the prisoners that were in the prison. So tell me, was Joseph a prisoner or a prison keeper? Oh, may God help us this morning to get into that realm to be able to apply this to our life. Amen. Hallelujah. You know we sing a song these bars are born about a prison but one day they going to bust. You know you are in this prison but you are not here to submit to this prison. You are in this prison of flesh full of trials and afflictions and temptation in this world of sin. Full of sin everywhere. But you are not here to submit to what is around you. You are here to prosper. You are here to succeed. You are here. Amen. Joseph was in prison not to become a prisoner. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he was only a prisoner. to his master. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And his master was the God of Israel. Paul said, "I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ." Let me tell you, brother, when you a prisoner of the world, Amen. No one in this world can make you a prisoner. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know what? When you can stay in the word, when you can stand in the word, don't go to the left. Don't go to the right. Stick with the word. If it is not in the word, it is not your portion. You understand? If you can be a believer like that, if you have the guts to accept the word, the whole world and eat it up and leave it. You are not a prisoner of anything or anyone. You're not a prisoner of your boss. It's not your boss that will hire you or fire you. You're not a prisoner. of of your of anything, of your society, whatever you want to think of. Here is a young man. He's in prison. But while in prison, when he arrived there, the prison keeper said, "Thank you for relieving me of dy." Hallelujah. His brother sold him. But the moment you arrive in Egypt, the one the greatest man in Egypt said, "Thank you for relieving me of duty. Now everything I have is yours. Take it. Manage it. Just allow me to eat something. I just want to eat. That's why everything is in your hands. And when this man thought he had power over you, remember he was the youngest. And now here, you know, his brothers despised him. But when he arrived here, as long as they cherished him, Portifer prospered. But when a moment looked down on him, you know, God said it's all right. So sometimes you do prayers, you make prayers, oh God, take this from me. Remove this from me. Oh God. But God doesn't because he knows if he removes it, you will not understand who you are. Who you are &gt;&gt; is meant to be revealed by the trials &gt;&gt; and the temptations and the suffering that you go through as an individual. That's true as a church. That's true. That's why God does not come to remove all the problems to us from us as a church. Is he the owner of heaven and earth? Why doesn't he provide all the funds for our land? Why doesn't he bless brother Shalom with 400 million and brother Andrew will say I've donated to the church all of you all of you just don't worry why doesn't he bless your pastor and I provide everything because that's not how it works that's not how it works you needed to see the testimony. You'll hear the testimony of those people. Go back. I I'll share with you the YouTube uh video when they were giving the testimony on how they made their church, how from how they bought the land, the struggles they went through, the problems they went through, the the setbacks they went through, how many times it looked like it will not work, how many loans they took. from the bank from bank. How many sacrifices he made to the extent a brother in the church who had one good beautiful car, he sold it and brought the money. When I heard that, I said, "Oh God, help us to cast it." A brother, not even a deacon, not even the pastor, a brother sold his car, brought the fun for the church project. If you hear of all those things they went through, how much their pastor sacrificed, how much of his money, you know, last year we had a deficit of 30 million in our youth meeting. And so when I I said I was I was just here saying I was beginning to feel, oh God, disciple leaving all the burden for me. Okay. When I went to Zimbabwe, I'm no longer feeling like that. I'm delivered now because I had what the pastor carried. I said, "Okay, this is how it is done." Brethren, if you are a son of prosperity, God doesn't take hindrances from your face. He leaves them there so you can appreciate he that is in you. where you can understand what you are meant to be, who you are meant to be, what you are meant to accomplish. Amen. I believe by the time Joseph was in prison, he knew this is not a coincidence. How come when I reached Portifer, he gave me everything. and I'll come when I'm here. The prison guard is giving me all the I'm the one and telling the world. By this time, Joseph had begun to understand who he is. He had be to understand is not just about anybody because everybody here is a prisoner of the king of whatever it is. But who am I? a little Hebrew, not even an Egyptian like that. But I'm here and they surrendering all the authority to me. He had abilities that no one had. No one knew. He could dream and interpret his dream. He could interpret the dreams of others. He was anointed by God. Wherever he went, everything prospered. Wherever he went, everything blossomed. There is something about Joseph that has a connection with us. And that can only be because Joseph is a type of Christ. And if you remember said this mystery which has been hidden from generations for ages now has been revealed and it actually told us the mystery when he said Christ is the hope of glory. There is something about there was a glory and moved with everywhere he went there was prosperity everywhere he went there was progression he was a type of Christ and I will tell you something the bride is a part of Christ oh wait wait wait wait oh I feel so good about it the bride is not only a type of Christ, she is a part. [Applause] The Godhead is not full without you. The Godhead is not full without you. Amen. The Bible says that the fullness of Godhead bodily is in Christ. Are you following me? Is where is in Christ. Now he said what did he do? Amen. to reveal that to reveal that the mystery of Christ has three stages, three levels to it. And I'm coming back to my subject. It's all a part of it. It has three phases to it. The first one is that God was in Christ to come and redeem back, to come and save. When Jesus walked on earth, that was not just Jesus. It was God in Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Did you get that? Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Now hear this. There was a second portion. For him he wanted to have preeminence in a body of believer the bride. Don't worry it will all come together. Just follow me. And then there he said, "Be aware lest any man spoil you through philosophy, through vain deceit, through traditions of not after Christ that they will spoil you through all traditions, through vain deceit, through philosophy, sets of beliefs that are anti not after Christ. They tell you to follow their church. They tell to follow the man, but not Christ. But you see, this message is all about Christ. It's not about a church. It's not about a denomination. It is about why because when Christ comes in you by the baptism of the Holy Spirit, there is something that happened. It is no longer you that is living. God said my life me I'm dead. It is not I that live. It is Christ that liveth in me. So what is it? He said if I have anything to boast I boast of nothing in myself but I boast in Christ. So now when a believer is in Christ and Christ is in him there is another face. Now the first phase is Christ is the mystery of godliness. The second phase now is the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed. Hallelujah. Oh, &gt;&gt; someone is missing it. The bride. You, you, you are the mystery of Christ. Hallelujah. You are the bride coming. Lugganda is confused. Don't worry. You are the bride coming of Christ. Praise the name of the Lord. That means what? Where is now having he having preeminence in you? He ruling over you. He leading you. He guiding you. You know that's how God work [Music] as a body of believers, as individuals, as family. You know what? God has a way he operates. He wants to be the leader in the family. He uses the husband, the father. The father must have vision, for his house, vision for his home. Are you following me? Fathers who are here and husband, you have to have a vision. What you want for your home, what you want for your father, what you you are envisioning for the future, what you are planning to accomplish, where you want to settle with your home. You know the kind of job you are doing, it has to reflect your ambition. the kind of woman you marry has to reflect your ambition or the kind of family you want to have. You know, the man has the vision for the home. But you see, the man not in himself, you know, if he's dying in himself, he's a dictator. &gt;&gt; I am the man of the house. I have spoken. You You are a dictator and you are not allowing Christ to have priestess in you as a husband. You as a husband, you have to pray. Find the mind of God. Hear from the Holy Spirit. And then afterwards, you come and tell your home. Sit down your wife tell her dear this is what I feel feel led to do for our home for our family for our future. If that is a good woman if you you chose well she will have the discernment to know now this is no longer my husband this is Christ &gt;&gt; she will say If God is leading you, I'm right behind you. Amen. There came a woman that I was married to brother John Shar who suffered for years and I want to finish at 12:30. So, and you know I keep time so I even if I'm not done I'll just finish. John Sheret, &gt;&gt; John Sher uh had you know they had suffered with his wife for years beating stones on the road and making money and then eventually they made some money and bought a house, renovated it and moved it and then in the night the Lord spoke to him. God is a God of order. He spoke to the man cuz it's the head of the house. You sister, you have to submit to headship. But you man, you also have to submit to headship because the headship is Christ. Not you as you in your own wisdom leading your home. That home will crumble. That home will be destroyed. But a man must hear from. A man must have a connection with the head. The head of every man is Christ. The head of every woman is the scripture. And right there, John Charity told the wife, you know, the wife, the Lord visited me the night and told me there's a preacher in town and we should give our house to him. We should carry our uh clothes and we should empty our closet and we clothes only and we leave the rest for him and we leave the rest for him. You have to always listen from the Holy Spirit. And I remember when we were leaving, when we were going to Ethiopia, you know, we we gave away everything we had, the way it was to to to a young family. Not that we had a lot, but the Lord ministered to us to do it. When we returned to Uganda, having given it all out, we had nothing. that if the Holy Spirit has led you to do something, you can never suffer and brother John Sher what he did he gave her away everything and and and he had nothing he and his wife went back to the streets follow closely after a while being on the streets a woman finds her and says I'll take you to my house and as long as you can take care of my garden, I I I'll give you a place to stay in my garage and everything. After a while, God ministers to this woman in a dream and says to her, "Give John Sheret, not charity. Charity char $5,000. as alone. God is amazing. God is a God of drama. He didn't even say give him as a donation. But as alone yet for him, he gave his house because God knew what was coming. When you give to the work of God, don't think mechanically. Don't ever give because you excited. When there is a need, listen to the Holy Spirit. What will you have me to do? Sometimes when you're excited, you will give 500,000. You will pledge it, you will never give it. But when you hear from the Holy Ghost, he can tell you 5 million. It is completely out of your mind. You can't do it. You don't have the ability. It's not from you. It is from Christ. You know what? He has a way to make it happen. We must allow the Holy Spirit to have preeminence in us. And John Sher gave and he was given this loan of $5,000. So he took this money and as they was walking down the street, they found a house, a old house. They bought it together with the wife. They renovated it and they sold I think $10,000. Made made an interest there. Got another house. Got another house. Got another house. Who was giving them those houses to make profits from? The same God who are left. Brother, let me tell you, God is not a liar. And if the Holy Spirit leads you, he will never lead you astray. In your home, as a husband, as a family, let God lead your father. Children, allow God to use your father. allow him to hear from the Holy Ghost. And as long as it is him, Christ, Christ can never lead you. Wives, let your husbands lead you. As long as you know you married a Christian, that's why you must marry Christian. If you get married to a Muslim, or someone from some denomination. They don't even know anything about Christ's leadership. How would they guide your home? She will tell you, I want you to dress in this how he's like and the word says submit your husband and then you will be coming pastor. You don't have to obey my husband. The problem was the choice you made. Do not make a choice to marry an unbeliever. Get to marry to a believer who can lead you with the mind of Christ. [Music] Let me tell you brother, sister, a family that is led by Christ can never crumble. That's like Joseph could not crumble. You can put him here. Put him there. He could not crumble because he had an unseen leader. He had one that was unseen leading him all the way. Hallelujah. If husbands are led by God, if fathers are led by God, we are going to have strong families. Amen. And it comes from the home to the church. If homes are rebellious, even churches will be rebellious. &gt;&gt; You see, that's the problem. We must have a church that is led by the Holy Ghost. But just like in the home, not everybody says, "I've heard from God. Let us do this." God comes through his godgiven channel, the head of the house. Even in the local church, he blesses a local minister, a local elder, a local pastor. That is not only in our church, in every church of Christ. Praise the name of the Lord. And that's why brother Bham says, you can never go any higher than your pastor. Meaning if your pastor has this much revelation, you cannot go higher than it. So if your pastor has a big revelation, you'll have a big re. If your pastor has a small revelation, you will have a small revelation. That's how it is. That's why you have to be careful when choosing a local church to attend. If you find a church where a pastor always brags, oh, I'm the one who did it. They cannot do it without me. I'm better than all the pastors. Sometimes they may not say directly, but they do things to imply that if you are not following them, you are lost. That oh, they are the ones who are gifted to heal or to do this. You will soon find the people have have the same spirit. They're burgatory. They feel they're the ones who have got it. You see, when you when you you have a a pastor a church that has a pastor that just does things without hearing from God, you'll find families and people, young people, everybody following the same trend. If you find a pastor that doesn't study the word, doesn't pray, doesn't, you know, you will find a church doing the same thing, good or bad, are you following? If you find a church where a pastor never worships, doesn't know how to worship, it is impossible to find the people worship. So these things are true. It is the way of God. And so what does it mean? The Bible says the choosing of a bride. So it is when you're choosing a church, you have to pray. You have to wait upon God. He has to lead you in those things. And I want to believe all of you who are at DV are led by the Holy Spirit. Sometimes we have brethren coming from other churches and you know they say, "Well, I want to make this my church. You know, it's all right. Those things are good. But sometimes there are many reasons why they maybe sometimes they kicked out of their church for living in a wrong kind of life or they were just not serious people. And so sometimes we as pastors, we we smile when someone says, "I want to make this my church." But before you know it, you experiencing a lot of trouble with that person and then that's why they left that when it is already too late. Let me tell you church, we all must be led by the Holy Spirit. We must choose our church by the Holy Spirit lead. And when God leads you, stay with his leadership. Because God can never lead you astray. And when he leads you into a local church, don't go there while he's aching all the time thinking you know how it should be done. All the pastor is doing it wrong. God will minister to that pastor to give the church spiritual food in this season but also give them direction and how they should go. You know, I remember here not long ago when we had um you know trying to you know collect funds for the church and and you know it was not working and one time I was in my office became like real to me how we should do fundraising and everything and I came and told you and now three years later looks long right three years We have a land. &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; We succeeded. We prospered. Why did that mind prosper? Because it was not my mind. It was the mind of God. It was the leadership of Christ. Let me tell you, if you want to go far with God, we should come to a place where we see beyond the people. Be a little fast, brother. Where you see beyond man, where you see beyond me, the person, you see beyond your husband, you see beyond someone and then you see Christ. If you know it is Christ speaking whatever the leadership he has given to us we are going to rally behind as long as it is leading us to stay with the word. Praise the name of the Lord. You see this is how God brings about prosperity as long as the church is following after Christ. not a man but Christ. And you know he speaks about um like I said maybe on Wednesday I'll get a little bit into details but um he speaks of on the sea in chapter 3 14 of revelation and unto the angel of the church right these things say the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God know thy works that thou had neither cold or hot, I would thou cold or hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, you say, God is saying, I didn't say you are, but you say, I am rich. I am increased with goods. and have need of nothing. But then what is the opinion of God? God says, "But I know you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked." And then he said, "But I counseled thee, and by of me God tried in the fire that you may be rich, and with Raymond, that thou may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness not appear. and anoint thy eyes with thyself that thou mayest see. Praise the Lord. Now friends, I want us to hear these words in the next few minutes here. But says in the church 8, he says, "Now anybody knows that it is a lukewarm water that makes you sick at the stomach. If you need to vomit, lukewarm is about the best thing to drink. A lukewarm church has made God sick and he has and he has declared he will spew it out. Reminds us how he felt just before the flood, doesn't it? Would the go would to go the church were cold or hot? Best of all, she should be fed. May TVF be hot, hot in vision, hot with vision, hot with mission, hot with purpose. You know, we are not building a system or an organization. We have a vision, brother. If you did not know, we have a vision. &gt;&gt; We have an assignment in this ministry. And our assignment is to reach this generation with this message of the hour to bring about a restoration returning back again to the fathers of our faith. And you see this vision, this assignment is right in the middle of the word. And I can tell you what, brother. It will prosper. I say it will prosper. It will prosper. It will succeed. It will go on. And I can prove that to you. It is going on because you are here. You are not here by accident. Because of this assignment, you are here. I am here. We are all here because there is something for us to do. When God plants you somewhere, don't just move around. Put your hands to something. Get something doing. Be a man, a woman of vision. Don't be a mediocre. Like the sister said, she's been revived. She has now understood there is a purpose. There is a cause for every woman, every man. Let me tell there is no little one among us. We all can do something. I said we all can do something. Amen. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. M &gt;&gt; you see we have to be hot but you see the church is not and s has been passed she's no longer God's voice to the world she will maintain that she is but she God says she's not and you see friends the bride is God's voice today God said she's no longer God's voice and he said the bride is you are God's voice today. The the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; So when you speak, it's not you speaking, it is Christ. Hallelujah. Now look at the first phrase of this verse because thou sayest. See they were speaking. They were talking as the mouthpiece of God. But though they say it, that does not make it right. The Catholic Church says she speaks for God. Saying she is the assured voice of the Lord. How any people can be so spiritually wicked is more than I know. [Music] But they produce according to the seed which is in them. They yes they produce their results and we know where that seed came from don't we? But we also know the seed which is in us. Amen. It is the spoken word seed of God. That seed cannot die. So when you when you talk about Joseph, you're talking about Christ, Christ was a son of prosecution. And the Bible say one day he's going to come back and the earth will blossom with prosperity. He will rule. Amen. This earth and he will be the king of prosperity. You have had America saying that oh Trump said he's going to bring forth the golden age of America. He doesn't know what he's talking about. He cannot do it. He cannot do. Why? Because that is a work of Christ. And he's going to do it in the millennium. The millennium is going to be a golden age. A golden age. Oh, glory to God. Where everything shall be perfect. No sick will be there. No blind will be there. No lamb will be there. We shall all be in Hallelujah. Hallelujah rejoicing night and day because we shall be with the son of prosperity. But even today the Bible says we are seated in the heavenly blessing with a son of prosperity. Hallelujah. Even before we get there, everything we do now, it must progress. Oh, why do we do things that do not progress? Because God never spoke to us. He didn't speak to you. You ran. &gt;&gt; He didn't tell you to do. You paid. &gt;&gt; God have mercy upon us. From me to everybody here. We must learn to hear from the spirit. Even when it comes to the house you want to rent, even the place where you want to rent, ask the Lord. You know what? You don't need to wait for a dream or a vision or something. But you know he will lead you. He has a way of leading every one of us. He will speak to you. Even the school you are going to attend. Even the man you're going to get married to. Even the woman you're going to get married to. Okay? Even if he's an unbeliever, I have something for you. Some of you who are hooked with an unbelievers, forget about the message. Do you love the Lord? If you love the Lord, go in prayer and speak to the Lord. If you love the Lord in your heart, he will tell you no or yes. If he tells you yes, go ahead. Amen. One time he told a prophet, "Yes, he married a prostitute." So many you are one of those. But if it is the mind of God, he will never forsake you. He will never leave you. But I want to be in the perfect will of God. And the perfect will never lead me away from what they watch. Amen. But when you choose the mind of God. When you choose the will of God, you will progress, you will prosper, you will go forward, everything will work out for you. [Applause] Why don't we ask the Lord? Because we are afraid. We don't think he will answer. I challenge each of you here. How many have sincerely prayed over something to wait upon the Lord before you made a major decision? You don't need to lift up your hand. But you know, if you think about it, you're like, "When was that? I don't remember. Have I ever done it?" Maybe. No. Let me tell you what it is. You don't believe, you have no faith. That's why you fear to ask the Lord. You know, I remember when I was going to get married to my wife. It was a very uh tight tight tight moment and I don't usually speak these things except in private to a few people but you know I was already looped with another sister and um I thought that she was the one. I had I will not go in the details of this testimony, but later on I got signs that showed she was she probably was not the one. and and and and and then I I I I I saw somebody that I thought that I loved. And you know, when you are young and you you just want to get married and you just want to move on with your life, you're not too sure what is the will of God. You're not too sure. And that's how I was. I wasn't too sure. And then then this other one, you know, we started talking, but I wasn't too sure also. &gt;&gt; I wasn't too sure. &gt;&gt; So I told my brother, where is my brother? &gt;&gt; Right over here. &gt;&gt; He's a witness. Cuz he was he was somebody I was taking care of in my house. And so I told him, I want you to escort me. I'm going somewhere to pray. And I told my pastor, I I I'm I'm leaving. I'm going somewhere to to pray. And we had a house there. Uh so we I packed up my bag. The way I packed was I was determined. I'll be there for a week, for two, for a month until God speaks. Because I was desperate. I did not want to break anyone's heart, but I wanted to be right with God. I wanted to be sure I have done the will of God and I didn't want to marry somebody because I'm excited either. So, I went before the Lord. But before I went, I told this girl, I said, "I'm sorry." And this is long after I had left the other one and and then now I was talking to this one who happens to be my wife today. And so I told her, I said, "Sister Rebecca, I have something to tell you." I always called her dear. So when she had Rebecca, I'm sure she must have been surprised. I have something to tell you. I would like us to call it off for now. Let us be friends, but we will not talk as we've been talking. Give me some time because I want to go and pray and be sure. &gt;&gt; That was dreadful for her. And so, but I did it anyhow because I wanted to be sure. pray something about knowing you are in the perfect will of God. So I went with with Peter. &gt;&gt; We went to the house. At that time there was nobody and uh this is very personal for me friends. And um so we went and but you know God sees your heart. The very first night God spoke to me. You can't believe it. I I took my Bible before I even I think we had just prayed the first prayer just to arrive in the consecrated place and then I I took the Bible &gt;&gt; and read in the book of Jeremiah. The Lord spoke to me so directly [Music] and gave me all the I don't have time to go through all the details. If you want my testimony, come and and spoke everything to me. And so I I began shouting Peter was crying and shouting. I told him God has spoken. Let me tell you this this written word can become a Rama. God ministered to me just like that and I knew what the will of God was. So when I came back later and told my fiance that you know let's resume she was already broken in heart. She told me I'm sorry I don't trust you anymore. Now that was another problem because God has now confirmed to me the reason why she was not trusting anymore because God had spoken to her before and she was sure but I was not be sure on your own sister be sure let God speak to you because if he doesn't and you make a wrong choice wrong decision you regret the rest of your life to walk out of his will. But anyways, I think I'm blessed with words. And so she she could not she got she got conquered. And she said, "Okay, okay, let us continue." So then I got I got engaged and and the rest is history. We've lived for together for 12 years and I can tell you I do not regret. I don't regret there are times that I have seen and I say ah she was the right brothers who are married know what I'm talking about. Men can be difficult, but the way you are, there is a woman for you who can manage you the way you are. But if you go and marry somebody, that's not the will of God. You will break up so fast faster than lightning. And may God help us to desire the will. Because if you walk in the will of God, I can tell you'll prosper. And the will of God is the word of God. The will cannot go out outside of the world. And if you are in the word, you will always prosper. Always prosper. Now, that's just one page of my sermon. And I hope I don't preach this for several services. I'll finish it on Wednesday. I don't know. So, let us stand on our feet. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Money &gt;&gt; is not what does the ministry. &gt;&gt; God moves by his spirit, not by the amount of money or talent. May that go into your heart to understand whatever you you are, whatever you have is all. by the Lord and for the Lord and you want to have him lead you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let us all bow our heads. Uh the service went in the direction that according to your needs because there are many things I said I wasn't planning to say. But God has a way to turn the preacher and make him exact say exactly what the people need. So while you you have your heads back, ask the Lord, what's your will for my life? What would you have me to do? Tell him silently in your heart. Lord, lead me. I don't know if the sisters sister patience and the others can sing that song. &gt;&gt; Lead me Lord and I'll follow. Lead me Lord, I'll call. You have called me. I will answer. Lead me Lord and I'll go. Ask him in your heart. Even regarding all the projects we have for the church and many things, a lot of needs, but I am I'm determined friends to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit. Even when it comes to the youth camp, I thought I should stop it. But the Holy Spirit ministered to me. It is his will for us to continue with it because it is our assignment. What are you going to do about it? What are you going to do about it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have called me [Music] &gt;&gt; I will answer [Music] [Applause] [Music] Lord, [Music] me.

[Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you give it a little shout? Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; As Isaac is preparing to come, &gt;&gt; he's going to have he has a slideshow and a few words. He is he's going to speak to us regarding the youth camp. He's helping us with that part of the youth camp uh to budget and fundraising and all that. But I just wanted to let you know that in case you don't know, we already have our church. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. If you have not seen it, ask anybody. Know where it is and take it. And um we will go um we will we will even go and try to &gt;&gt; how do they call it? Okay, he's interrupted me, but I'm going to give him the one minute. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; I felt I wouldn't leave without giving. I think before pastor left, I had a need and I had money but wasn't enough. So I came and prayed. I remember I knelt here and I said I have this money but cannot solve my problem. I said I'm going to give it to the land farm. And when I went to pastor because I work with him he said done are you excited I I told him pastor I know what I'm saying was the only man I was remaining but I said if God enabled the the people that were giving in their lives he will give me that grace maybe I don't know what he wants to teach me but I gave it out all I didn't know what next but from that day clients kept coming even up to now I still receive money &gt;&gt; God bless you God bless you God bless you he supplies he supplies rims of papers to schools before he was going to schools and they are telling uh him uh no But after when he came to me I said I just excited all you speak he said I'm late to do it I said it's all right you know and he gave that money towards the land fun and uh since then he's telling me oh I've got this client oh I've got this oh I've got this God is able but the Holy Spirit must lead you and I can tell you for sure if there is a need he can never lead you to give nothing he doesn't lead that way he's a supplier the provider of all that we have need of because Jehovah Gyra when he leads you he leads you when you have nothing he led Abraham that's why Abraham never spoke to Sarah Because if she spoke to Sarah, Sarah would have told him, "You are crazy. You can't do that. God, it's not even biblical asking for a human life." So he followed the leadership of God. But you see, he believed and he created. When you give something to the Lord, create. He created that lamp. You think it was God who created it? It was Abraham. If you're a good Bible reader, you will know that right down the mountain. He told the little boy said, "We have firewood. Where's the sacrifice? God will provide for you." He why didn't he say you are the sacrifice? He believed God was going to provide a sacrifice. So, brethren, let us do things by faith. Sure. Let's continue with this, brother. Let's continue with this. I figure let's just continue with this because several of our of our people are not here and it's all right. If those who want to listen to what we are doing and they want to uh spy on our liberty, that's all right. &gt;&gt; So they're asking me whether they should continue with this training. Amen. Amen. Because these things are also for a testimony. I always hear from others, oh I was encouraged. There's a brother in New Zealand who told me I was encouraged by Right now we started a church. So these things it encourages others. Um so um I wanted to let you know we now have our land and um we should give the Lord a clap of praise for that. [Music] Amen. So we can even go and put a fence around it. We can clear the ground. We can um use it for someone said cultivation. I'm not going to use it for cultivation [Music] because we want to use it to build our church. So um we have paid 100 million as of today and um we are remaining with 120 million. Give me that picture again brother. God was so gracious with us. God was so gracious with us. I went with brother Mul [Music] brother Daniel. Who else? Raise up your hand if you so are the ones who are around and they could quickly come and represent us. So we went of course as you know we were supposed to pay uh the balance in 8 months. But we had a tight negotiation with a gentleman and he agreed that we can pay it in 12 months in 12 months. And uh so that is a very very good thing. But my plan is if the Lord blesses us and we clear this in 6 months you know then we can go ahead and begin develop like moving we can plan to move in the other six months. Um of course um there have been plans and thoughts from some quarters of taking along of taking a loan. But when they gave us 12 months, we all agreed among ourselves, those who were there, that it's not even necessary to take a loan. If we work together and uh with a with with a united mind, [Music] we are more than able You don't have the money. I know. I'm your pastor. I know. Um I you you don't have the money to pay did in six months. But God is able to provide a sacrifice. We've seen this testimony. We've heard and other testimonies we've heard before. So give, it shall be given to you. Don't promise anything by excitement. You are hearing we have 120 million. How much of it can you lessen the burden? You as a concerned member of the board. Well, some of you can give 10 million, others 20, others five, others one, others three, depending on your faith. Not your ability. Your ability is not there. I know. I know. When I say I know, it means I know how much you pay in tithe. So if I look at my brother Marvin or my sister and I know she pays 5,000 tithe, I'm not saying she pays that. Therefore, I know she has only 50,000. So is the ability there? No. &gt;&gt; But you give according to your faith. Many times myself, I don't give out of the abundance of what I do. If I want to get, I always, this is what I do. I'm not saying you should do the same. If there is a need, I always close my eyes and I ask the Lord, what would you have me to do? And then many times he would, you know, I I will be impressed to give much more than I can afford. Either promise and then I begin working towards and God never fails. He provides in ways you never imagined. That's what I've seen. That's my testimony. &gt;&gt; And so, um, there is an exercise that I'd like us to do, um, to be able to raise this money in six months. Now, um, whatever you promise because we have 12 months. And the gentleman said, uh, you know, that's the gentleman there. &gt;&gt; The other brothers were at this side. Whoever took the picture did not take the other. &gt;&gt; Where are they? We didn't see them. So anyways, but um uh that is the gentleman. The lady who works with this gentleman called us and said this was it brother Joel had forgotten something there was it you come come tell tell us what cuz I don't remember very well what he had forgotten what come come in what had you forgotten there come come you had forgotten your earpods there and when you went there what did she say [Music] she said she was so amused the We convinced the boss and the boss said, "I don't know what these people can but I just had to let them." So, and and there were there was another one who was willing to pay cash more than what we were paying. But he said, "I've already committed with these people." That place as you saw it, it is in a very strategic Anything you put there a mall shop it can work. So you can see it is a high demanded place but uh God favored us and um so let us um uh use faith to now fully possess the place. So I I was trying to do some mathematics and I said to myself, if we have 50 of us here out of 120 million, if 50 of us can say me, I'm going to give 1 million only 1 million that will already be 50 million. And I know we have 50 people in this church who can do that. It's not in a day. It is within 6 to 12 months. According to your faith, you can even do it in two months. It depends on your faith. But if you can pledge and say me I'm going to give 1 million 50 of us will collect 50 million and then if 10 of us can say me I'll give 2 million that means uh that will be 20 million you then that is 70 if five of us can say me I will give 3 million that will be 15 million if another five can say me my faith is very large I can give five that will be 25 so in other words I need 50 people here &gt;&gt; to pledge 1 million and I need 10 &gt;&gt; to pledge to two five million &gt;&gt; and one I want him to pledge 10 million and the land fund will be finished now pastor you said one one 10 minutes yet me I I wanted to play 20 It's okay. You can also pledge to enter it. It will reduce on the others who can't. Now, this pledge that I'm talking about is not something that you're going to be giving at a go in two times. Experience has taught us. Those pledges never mature. So we already have a system in place um of our groups which has been running for three years now for is it four? How long have we been running this system? Someone help me correct me. Two years. So and we've raised 100 million. One and a half years. How many weeks? How many weeks were they? &gt;&gt; 70 78 million within 78 million. Sorry. within 7 to 8 weeks. We did we we raised half almost half less than two years more than No, we we we collected 100 million not more than half cuz the the the the half is 120 110. Yeah. Cuz the land is 220. You get the point. &gt;&gt; So I was saying within that period We collected almost half of the amount we need. So we can do it in six weeks. Uh now that we even see the land and we are more energized, more envisioned. Before I continue, how many feel like I feel that it is possible? God bless you. I also believe the way you believe. Now we have groups in place. There are seven groups and I want to believe that every one of us is a member. So I'm going to task not to waste time here. I'm going to ask the team leaders to speak to their group members now after when we are leaving. If you know you are part of a group, meet your team leader and pledge the amount you're going to give. The treasurers are going to to take this list from the group leaders. So that here's how it is going to be done. For example, myself, I pledged already 10 million. This one I did already. I I I I pledged it when on the day we we did because I was very excited. But I did not pledge by excitement. I was led to do that. I said me I will pledge 10 minutes not me and my wife me my wife will pledge her own from the kameza but for me I pledged this. So um now how it is going to be how am I going to pay it? &gt;&gt; Every week. &gt;&gt; Every week. So already I paid some. This is going to be so good in such a way that if you pledge for example I pay 10 million. If the Lord gives me two I don't say let me pay small I put everything there. If I get nine I put everything. I don't say now I finished. If the Lord gives me an unfinished man two months, I pledge another one and I begin putting before you know it. Who can even finish this in three months? If every one of you is like me, not in the amount, but in the faith. Faith without works is dead. If you put our faith to work. So um whatever you pledge it will be reducing every week according to what you have given in. And whatever we shall be announcing here every week will be what has been collected. Remember the treasurers will receive the details and uh they will be reducing every week from you. pledged 5 million. He has now paid 100,000. He is remaining with 4.9. You understand? So that will be much better. It will increase our faith and our blessings as well. That's what I believe. Um already some of us have started buying land and for their own families. And you see these things when you serve the Lord, he prospers you. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many think that this is going to work? So um if you I'll give you an example. If you you you pledge 1 million and say I'll pay it in it in six months. That means every month you pay 166. every week. It means you pay 41,000 4241 something like that. If you pledge 2 million every week, you pay 80. [Music] Now to the younger ones, the younger ones are the schoolgoing students. They are the only ones who are allowed to pledge less than 1 million. Yes. Because they don't have income. &gt;&gt; They are pledging from what you're giving them as well. Um and then uh I where is that document? Brother Martin, brother Joel, brother Dan, where's that document? Where's the document which you sent me? You have it as brother you're planning to you preparing to come please you can actually come I'm I'm finishing I'm getting done I'm trying to look okay I have a copy of it here but um Uh there's a document which we received from the owner. Listen listen listen from the owner of the hotel &gt;&gt; and he increased the rent to 1.2 million. This is the document. Um, I told you this would happen. And that's why I wanted us to sorry, that's why I wanted us to to to immunize it before it happened. We did not. So, it has happened. So this now you are seeing a mountain but I'm not seeing a mountain. I'm seeing God's provided way. God is telling us this plan which I've given you. We need to take it serious and quickly get out of here. You remember when God told when Moses told Pharaoh, let my people go. It was God's provided way. But Pharaoh did what? He made things tougher. It was a sign it was time to go. So friends, our time here is over. Let's take this serious. I told him this is not going to be possible. Um we will not increase even a shielding. and he said, "You giving me directives on my own property." I told him um if you insist that you're going to increase, we will stay in your place for 3 months without paying a cobo while we look for our own another place. It's the law. or you let us pay what we can pay what we have been paying for another period of time and we live in peace. Those talks are still going on. But I wanted you to know. So let's take this serious very serious. Not as don't pledge as families. Pledge as individuals. team leaders get to work after this service. Brother Dan, brother Joel, please take a list from each team leader. We would have done it now, but to save on time, let's do it that way. It is faster that way. And if you're not a member of any team, uh team leaders, please stand again. quickly stand so we can team leaders please. Sister Get over here, sister Monica. Brother Shalom, sister uh sister Adoba, um sister Esther, Sister Fibbe back there, sister Favor. So these who brother also brother Martin you resigned who is the representative you you you brother Martin also. So you don't want any member any new members. Ah okay. Okay. So so these are the are the so meet any of those and tell them if you're not belonging to any group and then I'll pay this much months. I will pay 1 million in six months. I'll pay 1 million in 12 months because 1 million if you pay it in six months you are paying 40 a month. If you're paying it in a year, you're paying 20 every week. So, it's okay according to what you your faith. Uh and so on Sunday, we will announce to you how many pledges have been made and I pray we pledge it all so that we know what we are targeting and uh we we we press toward it. If the devil wants or he doesn't want it is later than he thinks. We are going to achieve this. We are going to achieve this. I said these words when we had zero saying it when we are on the second phase. You better say a bigger amen. Brother please come. for another 20 minutes or so. Then we'll dismiss. God bless you. To me, I'm very, very excited cuz I've got the revelation. So I don't know if you are excited with me. Uh it's all up to you. So All right. Uh I hope everyone can see. Uh brother, can you see this? &gt;&gt; Okay. I thought the light was a lot. All right. So, uh God bless you all. Like I said once again, I'm very excited because uh even the word today it's not I had prepared to present this but I didn't know that the word would be this inspiring about the same revelation about what we put in the work of God. So uh I got this idea and then I shared with the pastor and uh he proposed that I should present it to everyone for them for those that will catch it they will catch it and for those that will let it go it will pass. So it's voluntarily but mostly it's going to the youth. uh what when I talk of the youth sometimes the married people also the older people they take themselves out of the way but this is this church is we are like 95% we are youth so I think that speaks it all so almost everyone here is a youth including our pastor [Music] Okay. So, um first uh &gt;&gt; this scripture in 2 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 6. &gt;&gt; But this I say, he which saw sparingly shall reap also sparingly. And he which seth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. So no need to talk anything about this. But this scripture makes me think and realize that where we are right now from what the talking about and this it's an opportunity for us because if we don't reap sorry if we don't sow we don't we won't reap so if we don't have where to sow what shall we reap so we should be happy that we have where we can we are going to sow now we have the camp meetings we have the church land fund so uh let's say we get to a point where the church has a lot of money to fund these meetings and we have our land we have our church uh our brothers and sisters it will be absurd for us because I don't know then how we shall so um I'm going to talk about uh three things uh one is the 20 last year youth camp and then I also talk of uh the this youth camp that is coming that will be mostly the budget and also I called it fundraising. I don't know if that is the the right word to use. So uh last in the last uh youth camp we have had a lot of issues. One of course we changed the venue about three times. uh like it was a lot. The amount we budgeted was a lot. The the amount we sp like everyone had a lot of questions and like a lot of issues around the budget that we had made initially it was 38.8 million. It is a lot right? So the total amount that was spent roughly it was around 58 million and uh this is uh how it came that the pastor had a lot of um had a lot of money that he had to cover on the land fund. Uh brethren like this is so absurd that our pastor went through all that. I don't know uh those who hoped uh to support him pay this money. I'm not part of them but still it's so so absurd. I feel it. I did not act but it's really so bad. We should never never allow this ever happen again. That's why this time I presented this to the pastor so that like he gets out of this. This is the camp the youth camp meetings. let us take care of this. Let him worry about the land fund. Uh like I also talked about the rent and stuff. So the youth camp let us have them in our hands. So we pledged as a church it was volunted 9 million 6660,000. Um there are a lot of absurd things to say but of these pledges only 5.5 was cleared and 4 million was not paid. We have the list of those who didn't pay some could pay a half but there are even people who didn't pay not even a single shilling of uh what they pledged. So I'm not preaching but um we really need to to check our lives like if we we pray and don't uh pay that means uh brother Polly I remember you could be the latest person who listen to the past sermons there where the pastor preached of um the principle of sewing. So it looks like that sermon most people it just passed off our ears because uh you preach that is one you don't fulfill and also some people we don't pledge no this should be of the past we are now new so let us start these youth meetings let them be a testimony for us so that was the past now we are moving to 2026 youth camp meetings Okay. So the first uh these are the dates uh to be Friday 9th. It's uh when we shall start then Sunday 11th that will be January 2026. Arrival being on Friday. Um we have not really seen if we shall have the services the whole day and then um they'll start through the weekend uh Sunday and uh we depart on Monday morning and the venue will be PDN. So uh it's also a good thing because the other time PDN we went there they had already booked but right now we have booked although we have not paid the the booking fee but once we finish here I'm sure uh the energy that I have right now we are going to book that place this week so um we went there and uh we confirmed everything weed it was a lot of bag And uh they gave us the place and uh the best part is PDN is very very cheap of the 38 million that we had planned last time. This is the the budget. We are going to do our best to make sure that the budget does not go beyond this. Uh just roughly the venue uh each day will be 1.2. It was also after thorough negotiations. So for all the time it will be 3.6. Um the other side at Chamogo we we we paid for music instruments and all that like it was a hassle but this time we are not paying for anything. They have uh the system and uh we won't be paying anything. So this will be the 200 is for the music department because u I mentioned that whosoever is having any department and is having uh expenses okay so for those who didn't come to church unfortunately we won't be able to have this online but uh you can hear so that's the good thing about the PD that's why the it has reduced the budget has reduced so much uh music uh the music department if there's anything uh a brother shame it will be on your budget you will meet it you will pay for the rest of your expenses because I never received anything and the budgeting team so 200 so uh the food um it is 10 million food the other time we had budgeted for 16 million but uh brother Andrew I think also brother Martin and then sister Rose they really did a great job they went and shopped and we saved a lot of money from the food and they used about 8 million so this time 8 million
