Lord this morning amen Amina yeah so this morning I'm going to take I'm going to preach on the message presuming amen Amina yeah and God willing or I may I'll make some several quotes amen Amina and where we are just where we have read here it says in numbers 14. that even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the Lord and Joshua the son of new son of Jeff and wishware of men that went search out the land lived still [Music] alive [Music] and Moses told his saying unto all the children of Israel and the people moaned greatly is [Music] in the morning and got them up into the top of the mountain saying love we be here and will go up and to the place which the Lord has promised for we have sinned again and mother said now listen to this and Moses said wherefore now do you trespass the Commandment of the Lord but it shall not Prosper [Music] if we trespass the Commandment of the Lord amen you're not seeing when you've seen something it's like something just covers your understanding have a prophet in the in the lamp and when they sinned against us to God the prophet spoke to them told them what to do amen mothers told them for the Lord is not among you but you may be submitted before your enemies blessed be the name of the Lord amen [Applause] if we move without the Lord we will be smitten because the Lord will not go with us that's why David says I always put the Lord before me the word of the Lord is the lamb but to my face amen we are living in the dark Edge this is [Applause] amen God has never left us without a witness and that's why that song says we have uh in that song that says by and bye that uh there is that I that we follow until we die no it is US following that eyes blessed be the name of the Lord for the amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you again and you shall fall by the sword because you are turned away from the Lord the Lord will not be with you listen but they presume to go up unto the hilltop nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant and the Lord of and the Lord and of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the campus amen Amina the Ark of the Covenant the Ark of the Covenant and the Lord and Moses departed not out of the castle you see are you seeing where a tragedy is Moses warned them and Moses knew that because they had sinned against us to go with them someone said I'm staying where God is where the word is blessed be the name of the Lord and the amalek had come down and and the Canaanite which dwelt in the hill and smote them and this and this completed them even to Homer our medicines and we all know that all this happened in the Old Testament example of what is going on now that God through a shadow of negative before a positive comes and remember the Old Testament was the shadow of New Testament foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] grumbling complaining and they came to a place called Kardashians judgment seat of God from there amen and every Christian remember we are in Third Exodus every Christian must reach that judgment seat of God where you must die blessed with the name of the Lord Brother Martin today you've come to Scorchers amen we must die if we are to live bless every name of the Lord Israel was there are many things happening sometimes the world comes then God speak to us about faith of faith is the foundation and without faith none of us will see God amen amen and sometimes God comes and rebukes sometimes it comes and remind us about our inheritance about the purpose of Our Lives [Applause] until we get used to it amen and that's the most dangerous State a Christian can be in amen we should not get used to God all used to the word of God Amen every time the Lord speaks he wants us to move forward and this morning we are speaking about presuming and the prophet says that presuming whatever is a means to act without Venture the Webster says that presume is to venture without actual Authority and takam is a Sorry by it's the dictionary inclusive to take it for granted [Music] that is the word presume means or without Authority nobody sent you where to me you send yourself amen because I'm a message believer just going to church we are the prize foreign uh scrubbing uh uh preaching now there are so many people does that what you haven't just take it for granted that is all right it's all right you do just take it for granted now Israel made of fatal mistake when they did this not only Israel since remember Israel types the church everybody else that that's it it will be a fatal mistake when you presume to walk with God when God has not called you to walk with him whatever reason when you presume to venture out upon things that is not scripture No David is and the way he is yes sir Mina that is the Fatal mistake a Christian will ever make you presume that you are working with God when God is not working again washing you washing you that is blessed be the name of the Lord foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] depending on the past experiences amen Church of God let us not presume each one of us every brother every sister every father every mother be sure amen it is the coming of the Lord is here during the course of this week weekend he said I was listening to One Pentecostal pasta and I was so ashamed of even myself he was speaking to his big congregation show me a scripture where the Bible says foreign this word this gospel if the Bible says that even the angels hold their places how about a pastor Adam the Bible says the blind leads the blind all of them will end up in that disha thank God foreign they are working within the framework of the church when the world became flesh in Jesus the other side also known that way the world became flesh in Judas and that's why it takes the Revelation blood and flesh did not reveal today so they are presuming because they have a big congregation that God is in their middies God is in his word amen God honors this word heavens and I shall pass away but God's word will never pass away all those people in that congregation in the day of judgment we are going to face God as an individuals Saints let us not pursue be sure God is working with you brother brother sister you must have your own tokens blessed be the name of the Lord do not presume because when we sing the prince of the Lord comes down yeah so God is happy with me yes God must be in you negative amen you go to namugongo the road is packed men and women assuming that God is within them it would be all right because Saturn presented something looked away from nice presumed because it wasn't the word foreign [Applause] so [Applause] blessed with the name of the Lord we talked about cutting it off destroy everything is as equivalent as old it will become a problem to you foreign blessed be the name of the Lord that's why the law was destroyed in Colorado how many armies are here amen amen soldiers operate under order and our Master the commanders destroy everything amen [Applause] do you think when the Devil comes to your homework he'll say I will just come and kill his son foreign that devil can never have pity on you if resumed yet it is because Saturn presented something nice the serpent told her if you're missing out how old are you [Music] I was 13. now you I don't even have words for you have missed out foreign the devil's word comes with super anointings [Music] Paul is anointing when that anointing was upon daily life three friends moving all over the world says not knowing was already dead foreign no matter if you stand and remember men that ever done anything for God stood alone with the Gods on the road there is only room for two that is you and God [Music] there's another there's only two rooms what are you waiting foreign [Applause] [Music] and now we find out that Israel had come to this place where God in his mercy and in his grace and mercy are forgiven their sins of all Disobedience after Miracles and after Miracles God said I have showed Mighty sign among them again and in the preceding verses I have shown my design and they have ignored all these signs they just walk right on through anyhow Bob did what they wanted to do not what God Said to do foreign we are not supposed to do what we ought to do the truth but what God wants us amen we are somebody's life we are somebody's Prisoners the Lord Jesus we eat what Jesus want us to eat we go where he want us to go we do what you want us to do we don't presumed that today there is a and those who are don't think I will call your name blessed be the name of the Lord you are presuming that you have come for service don't presume amen Amina we have to pass beyond presuming we have to be sure amen because when God is in our meetings Miracles will happen will it take place we will have Victory amen and that is what we want to so this man after God performed signs and wonders and they prayed from God they presumed that God was within them blessed be the name of the Lord no that's where the difference is we think and we ought to do and God says do it some other way fatula was must come back and do it God's way to come away if God's word says repent he baptized in the name of Jesus you must do it God's way not because sprinkling is the same um yeah presuming that is the end point of everything and that's what matters all those things are good what matters here is Walking with God that's living for God a full service blessed be the name of the Lord there are many out there presuming that they are serving God when they sit in their churches and they look behind not to America and they see a thousands yeah this is like heaven brother [Music] Hallelujah there are some people who can be comforted because they say though the way I trade is false but I know I'm not alone even even if Pastor son so is false but we are thousand in our church today at least we are not going to perish alone you better run out of that noise you will perish alone you will face God Alone amen Amina our pastor matters two wives it's okay we can also your pastor does not have heaven for you is Hellbound again amen [Applause] am I preaching to somebody amen the Bible says the way is this way everybody sees it is have you ever asked themselves foreign Young because and every time they change they twists every time they they they simplify they're spoiling it by this one it says repent that when Jesus either John was passed in prison yes amen he started preaching the gospel of God telling them repent for the kingdom of God is presumed that they had him they presume that they kept it alone but when Jesus himself God In the Flesh he told them to repent yeah oh blessed with the name of the Lord of God let us not presume the holy ghost is real that is not just an imagination it's not speaking in tongues I have seen wishes and the Wizards speaking in tongues today our Pentacles and she was telling me the experience she had during the sickness of her daughter of not speaking in tongues you see the problem with you you don't speak in tongues that's why this thing illustration is foreign they just presume but there is a one Pentecostal told me when you start speaking in tongues he does not even know the words just bypasses my friends don't be deceived that devil Satan he speaks in tongues even with one leg lifted he's a master of tongues do you want to know about the devil speaks in town all those tongues without interpretation it is the devil speaking in them and name is speaking in here and you claim that there's not here tongues amen he says [Music] when the presence of Saturn is upon somebody the Bible says they walk with tingling shoes foreign continue seeking for him up one day he met one one woman Pastor in town one of the prominent female pastors putting on tight fitting kind of t-shirt I am a decade with the bodyguards the big man walking beside this is a pastor he looked like a drug a mafia Lord when the praise of God comes if it is brother you will even you will hardly even stand on yourself sometimes it lives sometimes you're paralyzed blessed with the name of the Lord but look at them painted everywhere and even seeing they they want to preserve their paint on their lips because you don't want your lips they speak they sing as if they have no teeth that is not our God blessed be the name of the Lord that is not the god of Israel that is tumbling foreign they never announced missing a person the children never went to police have you ever read anywhere in the Bible and say that Elijah was announced as a missing person because they were spiritual father will take him in the name of the Lord and that's why the Bible tells us when that time comes amen we will see the sleeping Saints when Jesus rose from the dead yes Google amen there we are going to overcome each and every battle one after another Nina if you happen to meet a successful soldiers we went foreign for 33 years I was reading a message that I was behind that I've been in I've been behind this Prophet for 33 years I have fought for each and every inch of my promise how are you going to fight when you are not sure whether you are walking with God and his grace just kept holding for them and holding for them and then he came to and then he came to kadish and Moses shoots one man out of each trial amen and send 12 men across to spy out to the Land There was among them oh my what body they came back and said we couldn't take them why the Americans all the kind foreign [Music] amen Mina yeah of course if God would show you the promised land and even shows you where you are going to go you may give up and say Lord leave me alone but God knows how he does this God never called us to look at the situation around look at him and as long as our eyes are on the Lord we are winning because we are not supposed to look at the problem the battles we are fighting the problems we have in our homes we're supposed to look at God he take care of the rest of amen Mina when Peter looks at Jesus he walked on the water because all his focused he was in one Accord with the Lord there was connection between him and the Lord but if you are my Lord and as long as they looked at Jesus second step after another foreign maybe wanted to prove to the breathing have you seen me I've been there and when he turned against his eyes I cried to him Jesus many times even when we go astray and we let God down but when we are broken in our hearts Jesus he comes blessed be the name of the Lord amen and he says that blood just the type of the church today we just can't do it now we have become this and we have got to be like like this where yeah the street meetings are where are the street meeting anymore no there ain't very much brother foreign foreign [Music] amen wash and pray what happened to it where is sincerity and pressing on with the God always there must be some example somewhere we are men and women we are preachers we want to preach like foreign foreign what is the matter we've been cut off from it twice we just laid it sin is so enticing hey yes foreign what is that oh foreign amen so appealing is I'm going to use your account how much is your quotation 60 million now they are going to put 40 million on your account on that same job but you will take your six after never just call this account here just using my account so appealing oh foreign after a while when Joshua took the land told him actually destroy everything that everything there don't leave nothing I will yes don't leave nothing why do you want to leave something God tells us you are presuming brother sister let us destroy everything blessed be the name of the Lord why could you imagine some of them Israel women picking up little baby is a wild child abuse oh isn't it cute and it is take them Sin is Sin and the city must be killed whether it's in the life of pasta in the life of ministers amen amen amen Amina the pastor fornicate commits adultery um and the church is okay with it [Music] he says and he has not even repented if you don't hear it he will kill you [Music] it will eat you up and because God knew that Joshua commanded them yes the Holy Ghost command is everything separates with everything amen he never tells you to please you mean when you kill somebody you just presume maybe they are dead tell me that summer has ever killed someone that one is sin [Music] that is what killing means but some of us can I delete that number then you go back start checking in your books you you feel the spirit has come over you I know what I'm talking about I'm not presuming I know what I'm talking about separation has never been simple okay it takes the grace of God it takes the higher power of God Amen if you leave it when it is fainted you will look for those numbers because why why because the guy is not dead it's just slumbering but the Bible says once a sinner is badged he has no more conscious for sins even if you bring a crate of beer and put it there you will bury um because the one who used to drink is dead but today is the birthday is go on the TV screen monitoring games pretending that it is dead foreign foreign by the day the Bible tells us we must crucify this holy man he must die give us the road then Rise Again blessed with the name of the Lord even if you bring a creative and you bring a virgin again but you will remain with the smile over there because it was changed it does not presume amen amen let us not presume children of God let us move on together when God tells you don't go don't go together when Holy Ghost tell me to pray please pray you know foreign and here the prophet said that it might look cute now nothing it will grow up and be just like it is why we must seek in the world there is what we call Revenge foreign it must Revenge you killed my father he will even forget all the good things the education the services the food and everything you did foreign because it is a snake amen raising a dog in a crowd will never make that dog a cough is [Applause] amen Amina it will be a joke the cow will be more the reason will be back here that's why we must kill it destroyed and be sure that it is dead it has got to be handled with not with gloves we want to be nice everybody does we want to be nice we want to be humble what is humility we want to be full of compassion what is compassion just a man full of compassion um water head babies crippled and blind um he had compassion what did he do amen full of compassion pass through two three thousand people [Music] what a head babies what did he do walked over to where the father showed him yeah oh man that he had that had maybe prostate trouble or something but he was full of Mercy and he went and healed him and walked he healed the one man and walked away yeah he left the rest of them man full of compassion now people today our English word turns the people around that is human sympathy that's not compassion there's a lot of difference between between sympathy and compassion there are two different words all together and we use them the same now the word doesn't use any compassion NC the world it has to go to be obeyeda tell me the world no matter how bad it can never how would you think it would destroy babies all the words innocent women and things like that never didn't give you so cold you get me you see what the prophet is showing if the word is cutting you bear with it because it was directed women every solo animals it didn't have mercy on them um blessed with the name of the Lord the word is to be to be obeyed not to have my support [Applause] many people had a massive sympathy on Jesus that didn't save them oh look how they are beating many women whipped even today they watch that movie foreign there are thousands and millions of people in hell what is your hell is full of sympathize register blessed with the name of the Lord we must obey the world blessed be the name of the Lord he said one little one living living the whole language that's why God told them destroy everything there is one king whom God sent to and Destroy against enemies for the ship Our God will be happy with this mirror and when they are coming back from the battle the prophet had the bleaching of the Lamb where is and the Sheep what to say when we reach look look at them in Israel we have cows which give 20 liter but that one gives 40 liters but was that the Commandment of the Lord he presumed because they had Victory good day he thought was his efforts we can take this the Lord we love it when I bet and win 20 million I will bring ties what is that bleeding kill everything Chicago and now look reasoning said now reasoning shows that we will that well if we go over there again because the word is known with you and the prophet is not with you now remember give them the land and he had they had to fight for every inch of it and God told Joshua every everywhere the soul of your feet said that I have given you fruit print footsteps mean management positions [Music] amen I'm about to finish we lay aside every zoning and we cast down we cast them down and take the word take the word move on the word say the soul amen meaning you have got to overcome something you have got to have some obstacles and people and people that's different or Japanese that puts before you gamma it is a trial that things that he puts for itself if you haven't got that many have not even you are not even in the battle why do you join the church what did you join the Army and get training you for watching to lay around and down the street and show off hey what a nuggets this is a generation we are not saved you will be ashamed can you be in the army or somebody she said this is the age they will rejoice you even before me you are trained for the purpose you are in this Army for a reason they were here to fight battles amen we have never even called you they look at you you look like a priest in a Catholic Church [Music] you're just not your head like a mountain lizard Mina he has become stupid how can you get saved hey praise it to God you will look up to bye you are going to be looked down on all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution pick up the sword it is two millions to hell with your suit again because it is the empty things which shouted the loudest Jesus Never Shout yes amen he was very quiet because he was back with godliness the Bible says great is the mission of godliness God was in Jesus Christ Jesus Was So Silent yes yes it was so simple and when they look at him that's nothing they could run on him but Let Jesus passed precious
