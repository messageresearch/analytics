Lord I for you alone every breath that I take every moment I'm way Lord I Have Your Way in me hallelujah hallelujah amen I would like to greet each and every one of you Saints those of you online as well I greet all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus so today I have a subject that I would like to speak which will be most helpful to the youth most of what I really preach is for the Youth but but today I just have something special in my heart that I believe will help many if they pay [Music] attention by God's grace so we are going to the book of First [Music] Corinthians chapter 6 and we are reading vers 17 and uh we shall read up to vers 20 um maybe to get the whole um thing we can begin from vers 15 amen we read in the name of Jesus know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of ANH halot God forbid what know ye not that he which is joined to an harot is one body is one body for two sayith he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord I missed that last part but he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit rather that's verse 17 verse 18 flee fornication every sin that is that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinth against his own body [Music] what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price that glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are godess does it stop there yeah that is not a correct translation you correct it with this KJV for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body luganda stopped there but he continues and in your spirit which are God is amen be seated I see many are either not yet here or are not here tonight but uh first of all I want to appreciate the the brothers for giving me good sound today thank you so um I would like you to listen carefully to the things we are going to share with you tonight and if you are an adult this will help you as well because then you can be able to guide the younger ones and if you are you also you will be blessed I'm sure and if you are a young youth especially un married even if you're married I'd like you to pay attention to Bible truth now friends I I want us to understand that we are living in the end time we are living at a very difficult uh age where right is seen as wrong and wrong is seen as [Music] right brother Solomon I want you to pay attention you know it's very difficult because it's um a very Fierce age where people no longer have the fear of God where even after hear the word they do not pay attention to what they have heard as the scripture put it that they love pleasure more than they love God and so when you you you put something of pleasure if you talk about football you find that everybody's heart will be warmed up and'll be running up and down in the world and it is so sad that that those Spirits are also beginning to encroach and attack the church and um you know the movie industry the Hollywood and um uh you know the game the the game you know ball games that they do in the world you know usually that is not the fun of Believers even there are certain kind of peppers we should never read you know some kind of magazines you know you find that it has filthy spirits on them and certain things we should never watch there are certain things we should never hear because it has filthy Spirits there are many demons that are released and they have come into the world and then number one purpose is just to come and destroy a generation and take them away from God and control them and and and lead them right to the doers of hell and so but God because of his love and because of his riches in Mercy he sends his word to guide us and to help us now I want you to listen we are living in a time when all the demons put together of all other Generations they are here in our generation did you actually know that the demons which fought in the first generation I put it for you the other time in three horse riders we had the the the the white horse rider the deceiver we had the red horse rider the persecutor of the church and the one that brought death to the church and you have the pale horse rider who is actually now the combination because the p horse rider what he does he brings femine femine to the land and we find that you know the the the people we are not only cuz Dev tried to deceive them he had tried to persecute them but they kept on believing so he decided now to come and take away the word from them so if you feel that you cannot read the word and today I'm going to show you which way he is attacking us if you feel you cannot read the word you don't have love for the word you might be attacked by that P hor Rider spirit whereby it brings femine femine in your in your land fine in your heart whereby many people are in church but they're dying spiritually you find they dead spiritually because how can you know that someone is dying spiritually it's because they do not yield the fruits of the spirit they're dying they don't have life in them they have the the the they appear to to love the word but they don't love the word they don't give themselves to the word today the 20th century is a time of Christians who never read the word even in church part of the time they are not in church part of the time you know I I thank God it doesn't happen here and I pray doesn't ever happen you find people are in church but they are on phone you know actually when you coming to church you are supposed to switch off your phone you know you find people sometimes you know they are in in church but the phone is vibrating on them and then they walk out and pick the call and come back again to me I think that is a disgrace to to you brother it's a disgrace is a shame because if you come to hear from God and God is speaking to you and you pause him actually don't even pause him you just walk away and then you speak to whoever you're talking to and maybe they grieved you or whatever it is or they told you have to come back F and then you you will come back switched over I believe when we are coming before God the Bible says every man that comes before God must believe that he is and if you believe that God is you are going to rever his pres you're going to give time so you come to church your mind is made up your phone is off and you've come to consecrate yourself for the two or 3 hours and you are not willing to be distracted by anything anything else can wait but where you feed your business cannot wait I doubt if God's blessing will be in so you see it a generation that is so fast hurrying to make money Hing to go to a place Hing to talk this hurrying to do that but but you know we never wait on God anymore and the devil is also not sleeping the devil has try to make us busy and by making us busy he then takes us away from the presence of God and we become his prayer may God help us never to become the prayer of the devil praise the name of the Lord and so we see that we in a generation where we are now attacked by a combination of all those three forces of Darkness the the white horse rider or let me say the spirit of the deceiver the persecuting spirit and and and the spirit of femine both have attacked Our Generation and together and you know because those three colors when you mix them together you get black white pale and and and and black and and um red you get black and we notice that we are living in a time where it is now nothing but [Music] death the devil has come in our time and he has really come to finish our generation because he knows some place in the says he knows but he has but a short time the devil knows he has a short time but the question is do you know do you know how much time you have do we know how much time we have or we actually do not know and just for a correction there it was first the deceiver the white the white horse rider and the persecutor the red hor Rider and then the femine which is black hor Rider so when you mix black red and white you get P which is actually death and so we see that the devil is now not planning anything but death total removal of the believer total Destruction of the believer but while he's planning death for The Believer by the the spirit that is attacking Israel is the Same Spirit attacking the bride you find the in Palestine they keep shouting and even all over America and and in Europe these Palestinians and the people who are feeling for them they take their flags and they begin chanting and shouting from The River To The Sea you know it's for Palestine and what does that mean and they said death to Israel because you see from the river to to to the sea that is the whole nation of Israel and they're trying to claim the whole nation of Israel and wipe it out of the m and that's the spirit that is increasingly coming even in the political powers that anti-israel Spirit but actually did you know that even Israel as a nation has not actually claimed have full land if they were to claim the whole land you know first of all there is no Palestine forget about it because you see the Palestinians are Arabs you see that land does not belong to them that land Accord I'm speaking according to the Bible according to the Bible that land of Palestine was given to Abraham was by God himself you say who who whether there were people there or not the owner of the land the one with a title D gave it to Israel and so it belongs to them and if you if they to possess their whole land they're supposed to possess even up up to Syria leanon and a few other areas there and to possess that entire area because it belongs to them but they are still having just one little portion but you know pressure is building up you know political pressure and others to try and Destroy them but you see they do not know they cannot destroy Israel because Israel is a nation of God they are the people of God they are the people of the convenant do you understand church and that's why you always have to pray for the Peace of Israel and Jerusalem we are believers that's what we do and we find The Same Spirit The Same anti-israel Spirit that wants to kill Israel is the same spirit that wants to kill the to remove her take her to hell but the devil does not know that he cannot finish this bride it is impossible to finish this Bri because we are also under a conen praise the name of the Lord and so it's a time that is a mixture of of many demons and spirits all forces all powers that Satan has he's powering them out in our generation and is targeting the young people and today I'm speaking on flee fornication flee fornication actually I realized this is a much bigger subject and I tried to speak to some youth the other day I think yesterday on it on Monday actually but I did not get to even touch it and so I thought I should speak it again here and maybe go a little bit in more details and so where here he says that flee fornication Full Stop in other words if you want to overcome fornication the only way is to flee to flee now every sin a man doth is without the body but he that commits fornication sins against his own body his own body now you say well I've sinned against my body but remember that body is not your body that body is the Temple of the Living God he says it's the Temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own for ye are B with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit so in our body we are supposed to glorify God that body is not yours it is for the glory of the Father the spirit is not yours it is for the glory of God so you must glorify God in your body you must glorify God in your spirit now in Ephesians 5 verse1 it says Be there for followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also has loved us and has given himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God for sweet smelling ser and he says but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh sa so now listen listen please this is like more like learning on this and so now he begins by saying flee fornication and he gives you a reason and he says all other sins you do are out of the body you simply do them but when it comes to the sin of fornication which is the same as adultery when it comes to this sin it is a it becomes a part of you and he says don't you know you are the temples of God you you are not your own so then here he says walk in love as Christ also has loved us and has given himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God for sweet smelling Serv and then here he says but fornication and all uncleanness allous let it not be once named among you as becometh Saints because we are Saints who is a saint a saint is a holy person in Roman Catholicism when you die is when they make you a saint but in Christianity you become a saint by receiving the holy spirit amen the moment you believe the word you are Sanctified amen and then you filled the Holy Ghost you become a saint so we are saints of God and then he sa as Saints fornication should never be mentioned Among [Music] Us andness must not be mentioned Among Us cious must not be mentioned Among Us why because we are Saints am I speaking to Saints tonight because we are nether fness read it I want you to get those exact words verse four neither filth no foolish talking are you are you hearing this you know filthiness you know things that really are shame it is shameful for you to do them things that are filthy a Believer is not supposed to be found in a filthy activity oh foolish talking you find yourself you know talking you know foolishly talking foolish who is a foolish talker a foolish talker is the one who talks against the word a Believer will always be on the side of the word regardless of your Fe someone comes and tells you do you think really God meant that God meant everything that is in his word everything that is in the Bible the Bible is our absolute as Believers so if anyone comes and says anything that is contrary to the Bible that is contrary to the word even to the message Believers of the message that one is a foolish talker and you are not supposed to be found foolish [Music] talking no J praise the name of the Lord have you heard that how many here just what is jesting justing is joking there's another word for justing here pranking prank these days you find many people on social media doing pranks have you seen those how many have seen they do stupid things to prank others and then they say oh it was a prank and you find a believer also pranking young people about to start channels so they can also do pranks the Bible says pranking or should never be mentioned Among Us you know which are not convenient things which are not convenient we as Believers should do things that are convenient and and we should be in the giving of thanks for this you know that no no unclean person no cacious man who is an idolator has an inheritance in the kingdom of God and of of Christ and of God [Music] you a is the same as a a prostitute you know a person who who has dealings with prostitutes you know a a sexually prous [Music] man you see those are war mongers and he says no M no unclean person no cous man who is a cous man or person what is cous all right sometimes it's good to look at what the dictionary says having or showing great desire to possess something belonging to someone else you see you do not have a dress sister Joan has it and you find a sister who is surely Desiring to the you find them by the way they can almost come and I don't know whether you fed some of you but someone will come and will literally talk to you can you please give me this C I really like it I don't know how many have ever experienced that that is coting it is not yours it is theirs but you feel it should be yours and you have that great desire to possess it but the Bible says godliness with [Music] contentment is a great gain so in other words you must always as a Believer have contentment if somebody is wearing good suits and you can't afford one be contented with what God has given to you if someone is changing shoes every day don't begin blaming them or judging them that they they very proud brother you are cous it is because you feel what they have should belong to you but really you should be contented with what God has given to you yours is yours and theirs is theirs and God loves both of you if you go to God and ask him for anything you desire that same God who gave them will give you do not desire what someone else has and the Bible says you see no wers no unclean person no cous man who is an idolator has any inheritance in the Kingdom of [Music] Heaven they don't have any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of Disobedience I am so glad we are the children of Faith but in this world they are also children of Disobedience when they hear the word of God it doesn't bother them but I'm a child of faith these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of Disobedience be not ye that partakers with them for you we are sometimes in darkness for you we are sometimes Darkness but now are ye in the light in the are ye light in the Lord you you were Darkness but now you are light he did not say you were in darkness and now you are in light how many are following me here he said you were Darkness everybody say I was Darkness now say I am light so who is light I am light so we need to change some of these songs Jesus is the light of the world you are the light Hallelujah we are the light we were Darkness but now we are the light in the Lord walk as children of light because your light walk as children of light and first Thessalonians 4:3 he says for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should AB at first he said flee fornication then secondly he said that um fornication should not be once and now he's saying abstain from fornication praise the name of the Lord now if you were a fornicator if you lived and clean if you lived in filth before you had this message and then you hear the message and God delivers you and you repent and you start over from that moment these words are yours now we will see what happens to those that actually do not listen to these words having seen the light it's very dangerous and that's why I thought I should teach on this subject we should not take this thing lightly it's very important and we we find people who are taking the grace of God in vain let us continue here says for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanc and honor praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord do you have your vessels where are your vessels where are your vessels I ask you Church where are your vess no one is answering everybody's looking at me what is your vessel that is speaking about it's talking about your body your body is Your Vessel and he is saying here that you should possess your vessel in sanctification and [Music] in your body yourself actually to even when it comes to the woman bam says that they given three sacred virtues which they should never defy and which means which a man should never Define and you find that it is not only talking about the woman in there is also the man because those sacred virtues are connected to the man number one it talks about her sacred virtue a woman being a virgin if you are a virgin and you have never seen any man you've never had any man in your life a prophet says it is a sacred virtue you are given you are supposed to keep it you're not supposed to M it that if you would marri before you married when you get married or before you get married to that man that wants to marry you you must confess it to them that's how important it is and then the other sacred virtue is a is a sacred Womanhood your body as a woman you should you should keep your vessel in honor whereby no man just comes and touches you no man should actually touch you the only thing they should do is to shake your hand and that is all I did not have I only had one amen and I said that is all amen praise the name of the Lord and even to those of you who are following us online you have to say Amen to this because it is the word of God yes no man Apostle Paul literally said it no man should touch a woman but only if they married to you let every man have his own wife and every woman have her own husband to avoid he says fornication and I'm speaking on flee fornication so then he says you see that sacred virtue of Womanhood you know you find women in our generation the devil has stri them naked it's a spirit of the age it's a spirit of Hollywood it has taken over homes it has taken over the Internet when you take that smartphone you realize it is filled with with a lot of those fils naked pictures everywhere as a Believer you should not amen put your eyes on those things because the devil is trying to address the generation first by funing their brains and their minds accept that this is the new normal and you find a woman dressing the same way she saw things on the internet because the devil has convinced her it is correct you find them dressing show you find them dressing you know B show press show they they have dressed a very long dress but their breasts are outside as if they going to breast feet it's a spirit of the ede it's a of a Believer should not be found in such things your body you have sacred Womanhood your body sa you must keep it that way the Bible says a man that looks at a woman last after her has committed adultery already with her and what happened to David it was B that opened the curtain she went showering and as she was showering her curtain was open and when David saw he was tempted over to her and that's why I'm saying sisters cover your curtain Hold Your Vessel in hor in the same same way men should do the same thing your body is not a a filthy place don't hold it in this horor hold your body in h amen your hands in hor where are your hands touching you find your hands amen taking on the west of a woman who is not your wife oh you have held your body in this H you find them these days they they dress as if they powered them in some kind of trousers and a man begins to walk like a god is a spirit of the age amen I'm here speaking not my own behalf amen but it's the voice of the Holy Ghost to us and we you young people should not be overtaken in those demons yes they are demons that's what it is because they are here today on Earth but you can't see them but you see what they doing we have to have our open eyes to see what we are fighting with if we do not know what we we are fighting then we will not know how to direct weapons of our Warfare he says abstain from fornication that every one of you should know you see you should know how to possess your vessel in sanctification and not in the last of consup well I need to give you a definition here of means sexual desire not in the last of sexual desire even as the Gentiles which know not God he says the Gentiles they don't know God that's why they always last last but let me tell the only way to defeat the of last is to use the word of God upon praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord and I was telling the other young people the other day on the SK I watched and and this man was coming he was saying telling the God I'm very lustful help me and the girl told him you know I have this disease and this one and and when I go with you this and this will happen the last of the man disappeared it disappeared and R away how much more if you sisters can use the word hallelujah the word of God will defeat the Devil in any place any time in any situation someone comes with a spirit of last begin to use the word that's why stop stop stop don't stop keep using the word and you speed leaving them and I've told you even here younger people who don't who have the spirit of this last and not and intending to go into fornication they go to sisters who are also ANC expecting and they they they begin leading them into talks and conversations and they deceive them they going to Mar this is what you see in the world a man is married but he's very busy disturbing her secret his secretary and he's telling the secret the woman at work whatever wife I don't love her as a matter of fact I'm just waiting for the right time to do a divorce and this woman is deceived she's thinking that actually he doesn't love his wife and they going to marry her it's deception and find they are not even fearful to begin talking with men who are married because they're deceived I hope that Believers Never get to that level but even in the church I believe if a man or brother is serious and he really intends to marry you as a sister he cannot come to you without going to the pastor F and if you also open your doors for them then things are going to happen and you're going to be heartbroken but you see he's to blame but you are also to blame because we we here in the church we've taught you very well and I hope that you Brothers one brother told me oh Pastor now if I come to you have to be very very sure well if you're very very sure why are you coming to me begin you are coming to me because you have a thought but you are not very very sure you are seeking for guidance and that's why you come to the pastor's office to be guided to be instructed in the word of God to be prayed with for you to seek after the will and mind of God praise the name of the Lord now I want to show you something here in the book of First Corinthians if you can turn with chapter [Music] 10 now these things were our examples to the intent we should not last after evil things as they also [Music] lasted neither be ye idolators as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and Fa in one day 3 and 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents now here Apostle Paul takes uh the scripture in the Old Testament show us and emphasize how fornication is deadly and he says that um you know these people uh the things were written for our examples to the intent that we should not last after evil things as they also lasted neither be ye idolators as we some of them and it is written the people sat and by the way the spirit of immorality go with a spirit of idolatry do you know that the spirit of immorality goes with a spirit of of of idolatry you find that this man or this woman is is so or she's so intoxicated with the desire with the last after so and so that they can do literally anything for them something they don't even do for their people for their mother for their wife for but if they are intoxicated with this Spirit you will find that they are almost worshiping this person a of idol and it moves with the spirit of immorality I'm setting these things down for you here tonight you find that this person you love them more than you are willing to obey the word you love them to the extent that you are willing to break the word of God for them I can actually literally do anything for you I can I can I can just even minut to go to the moon but the word of God says this first leave that one that you were already committing idolatry and these people were idolators as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and they rose up to play and he says neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and in one day 3 and 20,000 let us go there and see what happened in the Book of Numbers this is what Apostle Paul is talking about I trust you are closely following this with me numbers 2 vers says if you we can the whole chapter is very good you can read the whole chapter when you get home but I'd like us to begin from vers six yes and behold one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his Brethren a Midian itish woman in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel who were weeping before the door the of the Tabernacle of the congregation and when finans the son of elazar the son of Aaron priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took a javeline in his hand and he went after the man of the of Israel into the tent and thrusted both of them through the man of Israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of Israel and and those that died in the plague were 2 and 4,000 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Finas the son of elazar the son of Aaron the priest has turned my WTH away from the children of Israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy you can read up to vers 11 for now uh probably sometime soon I'll speak to you on the spirit of Bal bism or the spirit of balam now we find that bism is a very interesting spirit it's a spirit that loves money and a spirit that will you know do anything for money and you find that balam was a prophet a man who was anointed rather having a gift of God and and king bar tried to bribe him with with goods and gold and silver and and clothes and told him I'm going to make you great I'm going to make your name great the only thing I want you to do for me is go and cast those people isra that's what the devil is going to do the devil is going to raise preachers these men are anointed with a right anointing by the way they are preachers they are called by God but the devil perverts them to begin speaking on his behalf and we have them in our generation these are the ones I was speaking about the other day men who crept in unaware they anointed they can talk they can convince you know because they are trying to speak what the people want to hear so that they can get what people will give them they are not Servants of God they are Servants of men of their bellies the Bible says they are servants to their own b as long as they're going to get money as long as they're going to get people to follow what they saying then they will preach whatever people want to hear and that's why by the those people they cannot rest until they have mega churches but our calling in the mage is not to have mega churches our calling in this message is to have a bride amen who is Sanctified who is prepared for the coming of the Lord this is a Rapture message friends it's not a a message to call a multitudes if the if they bride in this place is a thousand they will come and actually says that none of them will be taken out of his hands they will come the devil cannot resist any of them but that is not our calling you know what they have in their mind is they have to preach so I can get money that's why that time of giving is very sa for them very very SA they will talk million words and they will massage the people so that they can come and give they will take one hour collecting offering it's not free will offering anymore it is an offering the massage out of you but an offering is supposed to come out of your heart and out of Revelation and out of your desire to serve God praise the name of the Lord amen and we see balam was such a preacher oh my one day I'll talk about it but then we we find out that bam when he failed at his strategy he tried to cast Israel but when he failed he advised he advised balac he said I have an advice for you don't tell me again to cast these people because the uncastable aren you so glad you are uncastable we are the spiritual is hello bride we are the spiritual isra this makes me want to shout I am uncastable Glory Glory Glory am I am unable I am the of Israel but listen the devil has another strategy adise bam adise B there is another way you can weaken these people you may not cast them but you can weaken them and then you will overcome them he said which way he said send the girls send them girls from among the midianites and the moabites let them go and tempt their boys that was the doctrine of [Music] balam and and so prepared very good Jezebels with everything to attract the young people that are sincerely Jewish sin Israelites and you find that they were all going to the temple to bow down and to worship and they went to the parties of bow that is how it begins when a brother is backsliding that is how it begins you begin compromising the devil send someone to you to take you to a party is just a party it is at a home no problem but that party there is no single believer that party there is no one music of Believers one song of believer brother sister you are lost the devil is on easy way to consume you and they would go and they found themselves dancing worshiping dancing to the tune of the world I believe Believers should never be found in such parties whether it is a family party or a family gathering me in my family they know me they know me they have their beer they have their music they will never invite me because they know I can't come because if I go I will confuse them I dilize them I will tell them wait let us share the word and when I share the word they will go in their beers and me disappear so they don't have time for me to go and confuse them how can you be a believer and you say it is family thing and you sit Amen in a beer party they are playing worldly music and you are playing along you even find you're compromising on your dressing because you want to look like them it is a doctrine of it is there to make you back slide and that's why even on our weddings on our weddings we should always set the standard amen try your best in every area of your W to find a Believer who can who can work for you find a brother who will work as a DJ find a sister or brother who will do your decoration find a brother or sister who will do your cakes find a brother yes we should love because we have another another we have our own community we have another kind of life our life is not their life amen hallelujah our life is different and we should be ready Amen to Showcase what we we should be ready to show them this is what we stand for this is what we believe amen we are not of the world who told you we should be a praise God actually the Bible says anyone who will not reject mother father sister brother for my sake is not worthy of you are the kind that your mother your father your sister your brother will always say you are the best you will even be the one to select the music for them and all the music you are selecting is what you know they like how did you even know them because you you are a make believer you not a serious believer oh where are young people where are old the people that are going to stand have a backbone to stand and say here I stand this is what I believe I am not going to compromise by the way Believers have been like that from time imoral they said we are not going to eat these pigs and these things you have squeez squeezed we are not we are going to eat greens we are not eating food from the king T why because they knew the King was not following the Jewish principles of making meat we will not bow we are believers who have going to have the same Zeal the same fire amen even though I walk alone I will walk in this way how many will say like that even though I walk alone in all my family I will walk in this straight way the Bible says narrow is the way St is the way that leads to to to the kingdom of God right it is narrow it is St it's not easy it is not an easy Road friends we have to take a stand I remember growing up I would be asked by friends but what games do you like and I remember all the games I used to like when I believe this message it all changed is that a Doctrine I did not say it's a doct all I said I'm giving you my testimony I lost the appetite I used to play Duru I lost the appetite I used to play cards I lost the appetite I used to play rud I lost the appetite if your is not lost I don't know about you but maybe if you find what I found make get lost I lost the for the football games for those filthy movies I lost the appetite I have a new appetite Hallelujah being a Believer is not a joke is having a backbone to stand regardless of the criticism accepted to be called an A and even then standing so he says abstain from fornication the whole world will say it has no problem but what does God say we find out here when this balam came and you know you know brought you know they brought the king brought all his girls they were cut off you find the brothers already in those Dan in the worships you know a brother in a disco no it is it has no problem it is at a school these days they have it they call it what somebody that's the doct of bam I believe a young person who is a Believer Christian should not be part of pro that is worldly the the world has not parted us we have no part in them and we should shine those things stay away from it we should amen have our way clear and we find that This Is How They started started you know playing those dances and things and before you knew it they were sleeping with those girls and there was this one of the boys he went you know the brothers and sisters were praying they were crying out in the congregation and Moses was there they were weeping the do of the Tabernacle of the congregation and he says and and this this median itish woman that one of the boys brought her and and and and took her out into one of the hearts or one of the rooms before the the congregation and there was a brother who was in the congregation he saw this scene happening he did not keep quiet let me tell you brother if you a brother or a sister living in fornication and you keep quiet you two you're going to be aable you will be a part of their sin we have to hold the standard of this message who will hold the standard of the message you will hold the standard of the message each of us have the responsibility but there was one called fin the son of elz the son of Aon the priest this was one amen of a kind he was from the priesthood he was a young man amen he arose from among the congregation he did not call everybody he did not call everybody he had gone with a Zeal with a Zeal of the word of God with a Zeal of the god of Israel and he took a Javin in his hands and he went as this these two were sleeping in a bed and he got that ja and pierced it through both of them and they di now when they are dead the plague was departed because remember God had instructed Moses amen to to kill them kill everybody they were all supposed to die and they were cutting off the heads let me tell you God doesn't joke with sin God wants Holiness God wants righteousness who told you Grace is a license for sin is not a license to say grace amen makes our heart to Grace brings the Holiness of God in our hearts Grace separates us from sin but some preach as if to say we can live and and live with sin and sinners preach good things don't talk about those things no it is in the scriptures and we are supposed to talk about where are the fines of today that will take a javing amen and kill every sin in the and you find fornication in marriage in Matthew 199 199 says and I you whoever shall put away his wife except it be for for fornication and shall marry another commit adult andever Mar her which is put away Comm doubt and in the message questions and answers 59 say so fornication what is fornication fornication is what a girl when she lives unclean that's fornication because she has no husband but when she's married and then she lives like that she commits adultery against her husband a woman came not long ago and she said oh I've confessed all that she was nervous and had a breakdown and said I've confessed all that to God I said you have to confess it to your husband it wasn't God that you committed adultery [Applause] against it was your husband and if a man marries a woman and she lived unclean before she marries him and then she comes to [Music] him if they've been married so long and then she come to him and says honey I want to tell you something I did run out with another man I Never Told You Jesus said he has a right to put her away and marry another because they are not married in the beginning because she falsely told a lie against him very very serious very very serious fornication God doesn't like it he even brings it here as a room for divorce that is why you young girls younger boys don't flee from from fornication flee fornication because if you don't it will follow you all your life and especially you who do it after knowing the truth come into the knowledge of this message come into the grace of God come into the light of the world let me tell you when you go and live that kind of Life only God can lift you out it becomes very difficult you can never be the same even after repentance you will struggle all your life it will be a scar on you you want to live straight if you did those things out there before and now you are here in the Lord free from it it is not how close you can be to it and overcome it is how far you can be from me that is how you can flee and you find fornication in the church young people committing fornication 1 Corinthians 5:9 I wrote unto you in an epis not to company with fornicators yet not all together with the fornicators of of this world or with the cious or the extortioners or with idolators for then must ye needs go out of the world but now I have Reas unto you not to keep Company If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator orous or an idolator or a or a drunker or an extortioner with such one know not to it verse 11 [Music] you find someone is a ra no a raer is someone who you know complains or Pro or protests strongly and persistently about something yes and also you find other brothers are extortioners no extortioners are people who practice obtaining things especially money through force or threats yes yes that's the correct interpretation you know the extortion money from people and things from people that is not a good brother you find a brother drinking alcohol is a drunker you find ad aous man or a fornicator the Bible says I'm not telling you not because it says don't company with these people but he saying I'm not saying all the people in the world because in the world everybody is doing these things saying if a man be called a brother if a man be called a sister a brother one of us but you find them out there Meandering around going with girls you know deceiving this one deceiving that one sleeping the other one sleeping the other one you know you find is a drunker here is extorting money from people what is it he says this one don't company yourself with them don't even eat with them now in questions and answers 1961 brother B says that's the reason I am anindependent I do not belong to the organization because I do not believe in organizations and I believe it's scriptural for an organization therefore I could not belong to any organization and feel justified by doing it therefore I do not take people in and make them members and so forth like that because I believe we are bound to be members we are Bond into the Church of the Living God says we don't take people's names off of the book and excommunicate them and everything like that because I believe that is not our duty to do that no man can take you on the book no man can remove you on the book only God can but follow along I believe it is God does the excommunicating hallelujah hallelujah but I believe that the church if there would be a brother that was doing something wrong and then he says for instance if they brother Neville brother Junior Martin brother brother one of the trust or something another doing something wrong I believe the thing to do is for the church to get together and pray for this brother I believe some of you are waiting for something like this they try to get together and excommunicate the brother no we have the attitude of Christ the church should get together and pray for a brother who is in the [Applause] room I believe the thing to do is for the church to get together and pray for this brother if you still don't get straightened up then let a couple go with him go to the brother to be reconciled and if then if they if he doesn't receive it then tell it before the church then if they don't receive it then that is the time for the whole church then see that's for pastor elders and everything else to do it I don't believe that any Deacon board has a right to throw anybody out of the church a right to do it I think if anybody was to be this Fellowship would be because of immoral living amen or something like that that he wasn't a fit person he wasn't a fit person like a man coming in here defiling our girl or insulting our women and things like that and still professing to be one of us here now if he isn't out somewhere else coming in why we have to do something about it but when it comes to a person like that an immoral person trying to make love to our wives or to insult our daughters or you know something another like that or do something immorally around her or taking our little boys out and making PS out of them or something those things should be taken up and then that fellow should be ex communicated from the fellowship and not permitted to take communion with him because we are not supposed to do that we are not praise the name of the Lord now you ask me why because he's still a brother he's claiming to be a brother but he's not putting himself right excommunication is for someone that is rebellious having lived immorally he's living immorally and remaining in his and in the church we should try to help him try to pray for him try to go to him another person to them and it's not changing then the cas should be brought to the church and he should be excommunicated that's how serious fornication is forication can kick you out of the church fornication can kick you out of a marriage forication can kick you out of the kingdom of God flee fornication and there are two things that you can do to avoid it the first one is to walk in the spirit Galatians 5:16 then I said then walk in the spirit and he shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh The Works of the flesh are manifest adultery fornication uncleanness idolatry witchcraft hatred Varan emulations wrath Strife TS heresies ining MDS drunkenness revilings and such like of which I've told you before as I've also told you in the time pass that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God if you walk in the spirit you will not fulfill the last of the flesh meaning the last of the flesh never goes it's always there because the flesh is can the flesh doesn't get filled with the ghost but how can you overcome walk in the spirit if you walk in the spirit you are not going to fulfill the desire of the flesh because you're going to live above the flesh you are going to colonize the flesh you are going to control the flesh amen why because you are walking in the spirit how do you work in the spirit by being in prayer how do you work in the spirit by reading the word by coming to church how do you work in the spirit amen by being filled with the Holy Ghost if you're not filled with the Holy Spirit it will be difficult for you to walk in the spirit praise God praise God and the last the last the last example here or rather solution to avoid fornication is marriage he says 1 Corinthians 71 now concerning the things whereof you wrot unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband 7 to9 for I would I would that all men were even as myself but every man has his own proper gift of God one after this manner and another after that verse seven I said there now this is verse 8 to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as I but if they cannot contain pain let them marry it is better to marry than to burn so now if you do not walk in the spirit even when you marry you will still be defeated because you are can in your heart you need to walk in the spirit and then later on you need to marry single you may be a widow you may be um you know unmarried but if you cannot contain it says marry fornication God hates it it's a it's a spirit that is stripping all all over young people they in church but living in fornication but they don't even understand the implication of this thing there is a big implication upon their [Music] life and if I were you I would flee from it this is the time to put yourself in prayer to seek after God to be filled with the Holy Ghost and to Ser God there's really a lot to do for the [Music] Lord God bless you son [Applause] next maybe I'll talk about I'll talk to you on uh on on the doctr of bam and show you how that Spirit can creep in and how you need the grace of God to be able to overcome it may God help us to be leaving EP pie read of all men that we may be examples let us pray precious Lord we want to thank you so much for the
