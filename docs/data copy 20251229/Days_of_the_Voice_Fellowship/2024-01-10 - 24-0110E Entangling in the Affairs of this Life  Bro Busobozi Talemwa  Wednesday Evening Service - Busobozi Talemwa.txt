days I spoke to him today and uh he's in pain and we need to pray that God will heal him you know it is good for us to cross over into the other life or or to leave to us there's no difference but pain is not our portion suffering is not our portion and so let us pray that God will heal him out of do we believe together the Bible says if two shall agree touching anything will be given to them of so before we go to the word why don't we bow our heads loveing Jesus I've been so touched Lord by our sister Esther her dedication her sacrifice towards your work Lord father Lord I've never seen anyone in your word being so concerned about your work and you forsook them I've never seen it if someone is busy for you you will be busy for them if someone gives themselves to you you'll give

as you say thank you Father we thank you because we believe it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord amen after the service tonight I'm going to the airport to pick our first guests amen I've hosted many people uh throughout my life and time in Ministry in Ethiopia and also here in Uganda but I've not seen anyone that the devil has fought with a magnitude like he has fought brother Timothy the devil has prevented him to come from the moment it was declared that he was coming and until recently his motherin-law took sick she was taken to the hospital I was in Kenya at the time in the meetings I spoke to the Believers and told them what was happening and we agreed together and prayed and uh she started improving and was removed from the hospital and uh and uh then then also his wife you know had some conditions and so he asked me to pray and he told me that if his mother in-law in the you know would not be fine then he would not be able to travel and so I said we are believing that God will heal her and so she came out of the hospital and so he took the he took the trip and uh yesterday in Europe in Geneva texted me and and told me that there was he actually sent me a picture there was a huge storm and I asked him is it not dangerous he said he doesn't know so that means it had the potential of being dangerous to you remember Jesus before he delivered that man who was in the tombs of gadara remember what happened a storm and so we see that when the devil raises a storm someone is getting ready to be deliver and so I I I prayed I was at home when he sent me that I was with brother Henry and brother martin so we were in the compound discussing that was last night right so we held hands and prayed and so he was able to get home and God calmed the storm and now he's telling me that his mother inlaw has been taken back to the HP and the devil is trying his best to stop him but I told the devil you are too late whatever you are hindering is not going to happen whatever you are hindering God cannot allow you to make praise the name of the Lord and so I heard him say he was on the flight to come that was the last message I heard from him and so tomorrow tonight after the service I'm receiving him and Brother David Brother David from so both brothers are arriving they are our main speakers and they are arriving tonight so our youth meetings have begun praise the lord the devil is too late tell the devil you are too late amen anybody who is bound even if you are here even if you streaming the service make sure you

in the Affairs of this life and we are reading out of the book of second Timothy chapter 2 we are reading from verses one up to verse four I don't know I've been feeling like an evangelist of late and so we know that evangelist speak a bit of hard things so you pray for me that whatever it is that God will use it to bless you this evening uh Second Timothy chter 2 1 to 4 let us pray Our Father who is here with us today we ask that you you give us utterance you give us inspiration and you lead us Lord into your perfect will for this service in the name of Jesus Christ we ask you amen thou that my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that thou Hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also thou there endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that Warth Warth and Tangle himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who has chosen him to be a [Music] soldier [Music] you may be seated please I'm happy to see you brother Baka I'm always happy to see you in church when I single out several people sometimes it is because because maybe I was thinking of them or praying for them so when I see them I'm happy so when I see you I'm happy hallelujah praise God and uh I like I told you I've been feeling like an evangelist today I had to call out was it today or yesterday I had to call out my daughter and I was evangelizing to her seriously things that uh this fire that is within my heart about what I believe that God desires for us as a generation and uh things that I believe that God wants us to do God wants a generation which will fear Him a generation that is going to desire after Holiness what generation will that be are people that will desire Holiness righteousness Desiring to please God and not did you know without Holiness you cannot see God God is Holy and he wants all of us to be holy and so this evening I'm sharing on entangling in the Affairs of this life and Paul writes to Timothy and he says Timothy my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses you know Paul had an Apostolic Grace upon him and there is something quite similar among all or most of the uh people who have the apostolic mantle upon them that they always want to be followed they always want to be hard because what they have is usually some kind of dispensational teaching that can revolutionize someone's life and fully and perfectly Chang it into uh some uh into something else and myself I fed from a Ministry that I believe was some kind of apostolic Ministry and I've never SE said this on pulit before but brother Eddie bisc mentored me you know I heard many things from him you know in text messages on emails and uh never would discuss and talk and sometimes he I don't know but whatever he wrote to me he it really I I should say changed my life sit under that Ministry and watch service after service and I can see my life right now completely changed my my my my aspirations in life Chang my ambitions and plans and we see here brother Paul also is talking to Timothy and says you have heard me speak things and I would want to you also to commit these things which you have heard me teach to Faithful [Music] Men shall also teach others and he says you should therefore endure hardness hardness and as a good so of Jesus Christ and now here is where I took my title out of verse four he says no man Warth entang no man that worth entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier now when a Soldier is a soldier we have one in the church and you know that a soldier is someone that lives a dedicated life a soldier dedicates his life to a cause and without you know pursuing anything else he intentionally closes his mind to other things that are contrary to the cause many of many times are not even allowed to get married they discouraged from that others they discouraged for many things and when they training them they train them to follow instruction they follow them they they train them to obey they train them to submit [Music] to their Authority and when they when they pass the [Music] test then now they are graduated and now they positioned in a place it is not easy at the beginning of the year you had a brother omet giving a testimony on how it was difficult and how many others died in the course which they had embarked on and I want to say this friends we are also soldiers and we have been enlisted on the greatest army in the world right now people think the greatest army in the world is the US Army but I want to say the greatest army in the world is the army of the Lord are people that God has recruited people God has called out and he did not call out anybody and everybody he called specific people you know when they enlisting soldiers they have they have qualities they look at they cannot St someone who is very short they cannot take someone who does who does not have a good weight [Music] because they may die the chances of death in training are high so they have to look at you whether you are fit that is even before training and then when they enlist you then that means you are almost fit but then many die because the ones that enlist them are not sure about who they have chosen but now in our army the one that enls Us by calling us is sure about everybody that he [Music] calls sister peace he knows amen that when he chooses you you are going to amen go through the training however hard it is that's why he told him endure hardness however hard your training is however what you're going through is he said endure it endure it because you are a soldier and you are chosen to be a soldier and we are not chosen to be defeated we are chosen to fight and when we fight we must win the battle listen the battle we have our great enemy our greatest enemy is sin which is death which is the devil that is our great enemy and we here on Earth to war against our enemy to fight our enemy to overcome our enemy but is also an enemy that has been experienced for a long time he's not an amateur he knows what he's doing Satan has fought for a long time the Devils were are fighting they the same one that fought against Adam they fought against Eve they are the ones that even fought against Moses same Devils until the man of God said may God rebuke you to those Devils some devils that Joshua fought against some devils that even our lord Jesus fought against they are not new demons same demons same Devils that brother bam fought against would come and CH demons out of people and when he goes to his room hotel room they would be waiting for him to torment him some Demon we are not fting new demons it is a demon it is not a new demon it has been here for ages let me tell you the same some Demon have been defeated many many times many many times Hallelujah and if they were defeated before be defeated again and I believe I am one of those that is born here on Earth to bring all hell to that these demons we are talking about there are people listen listen what I'm saying whether you feel it or you don't feel it it is the truth there are some people who are born on the Earth that we are meant to be enlisted on this Army and all these people were born under that sign that they must defeat all hell they must defeat all demons they must defeat all sin they must defeat death Temptation they must defeat last they must defeat whatever demons it is even sickness did you know sickness are demons there are people who are born that were never going to be overcome by deathu Hallelujah people who can never die why because they have died already the moment they received Jesus Christ they were dead therefore they cannot die again so death can never take me death cannot carry me away that's why apost Paul shout and he said where is your victory victory has no death to a Believer who has been enlisted on this Army he is a soldier and he's a warrior and he's a defeater of demons he's a devil stomper I am one of them if you're one of them you can say I am one of I am one of them even if you're feeling like you are defeated amen you believe in thus sayth the Lord that I am one of them you know when when when soldiers are going to fight usually a captain comes up and he begins charging them speaking words speaking words and even the ones who are feeling like they defeated they begin to say no no we are going to consume our that's why we come for a preaching we are an army of soldiers and a preacher comes to motivate us to remind us who we are to tell us brother we are going to overcome eny don't don't be overcome don't be fearful don't shy away don't hide your face stand straight and look in the face of your enemy stand straight and look in the face of your Temptation and tell him devil I am here I am born to defeat you I am born to defeat you I am born to overcome you I am born to be a coner because he that is a conquer is in me and if in me there is more than all the demons put [Music] together and the Bible here says endure sadness endure hardness rather as a good soldier of Jesus Christ Hallelujah soldiers amen soldiers soldiers always answer Hallelujah when they told to say they [Music] say hallelujah amen soldiers We Are Soldiers of J Christ oh my I love that brother we are in a battle we have to over whatever the devil will do let him be there and we must over this battle no man wor and Tangle himself with the Affairs of this life that's what I'm talking about today if God permits me entangling in the Affairs of this life we soldiers but the problem of it is many people desire to entangle into the Affairs of this life you cannot win your enemy if you are entangling in the Affairs of this when soldiers go to Afghanistan to fight they have no time to use WhatsApp they have no time for jokes everybody and anybody around them is an enemy a potential enemy so they always on high L knowing anybody could be an enemy and someone could be a terrorist so they're going to be on high alarm but the Church of Jesus Christ is sleeping they are supposed to be soldiers but we are not on high L we don't pray anymore we don't cry after God we don't seek after God we don't read Bible if you a Christian and you don't read your Bible you can never live an overcoming life we don't read the Bible we we used to sing read your Bible and pray every [Music] day but this is never done anymore some Believers even don't have Bibles now let me talk to you who don't have a Bible and you think you are a soldier how can you be a soldier without a sword how do you know know when soldiers go to battle their gun is their life and if their life has been taken away from them they are considered dead they tell them if you fall down fall down but protect your G this is your life let don't let your enemy touch this is your lifeline and I want to say the same this is our life the word of God is our life but do we read it or do we just have it but if you don't have a Bible and you don't even have a h I believe no one in this church especially should claim that you don't have a Bible because I believe everybody should have a Bible and if you don't have a Bible come we shall buy you a Bible there is actually a sister who sent about 400 Bibles a sister who streams our services here 400 Bibles said every young man who doesn't have a Bible in the youth meetings let them have a Bible I'm telling you and you cannot claim that you don't have a Bible you don't want to have one but God will always raise somebody if you don't have a sword God will arm you he will arm you because he needs you to fight and the Bible is one of our arms and we should fight with it read the Bible pray fast pray but these days young people are bored and you say you are bored you are really bored Brother Sam how can you say you Bor sincerely in this generation how can you be bored with everything around us with the Bible that we have have you ever finished this Bible I don't want to embarrass you but I may ask you how many have finished this Bible from cover to cover you say well it is so big well then I'll ask you how how many years have you been a Christian and then how how much of it have you read did you know you can read this Bible in half a [Music] year answer me did you read know you can read it in 12 months actually if you're doing more you can even do it in six four months when you're not just reading but when you are studying it but we are so bored we have the message 100 1,200 TS which you can listen to which you can read but do we have time for it we are so busy with bom we are so busy with bom do we have time to pray we don't pray why because we are so busy with B we don't pray we don't sing I Remember growing up in this message every after Sunday service go around the pastor's home and you would find young people there including myself we getting this song book we didn't have even song books on the we didn't have song books on on on the on on on the phone but these days we even have it on the phone but we used to have these books and he would take song after song everybody would bring a song and he would sing and sing until we are so happy until we are carried away we begin shouting We Begin clapping our we begin to feel so sweet we sing and sing and sing until we are drunk you know it's a s atmosphere you sing until you [Music] prophesy you sing until you speak in you sing you know but these days no one has time for it when you begin a song you begin seeing one of one by one going away where are they going they are going to entangle into the Affairs of this life everybody is busy no hunger no thirst no desire no pool towards the things of God that's a sign of backsliding It's a Sign you know what do they do when they go out you know when they together they're just doing you know rumors talking this and that did you hear this did you see this did you see that did you what hear what the pastor say they begin talking negative things about fellow brothers about sisters they begin talking about what went wrong in the church and they can never be among those who will bring the solutions why because they're entangling themselves into the Affairs of this life so then how can you be a good soldier you know all these things I've been talking about these are tools that can make us busy we can become so busy that we don't have time for B you don't need a pastor to tell you to you know do Bible study or to tell to hear the message or to to go and do evangelism I was never bored growing up in in this message I believe it when I was 15 years I was just a boy but I'm telling you what did what what did we used to do you know just go up and about with nothing about about this message brother Dixon we used to tell people God sent a prophet we were not shying away from it we were not ashamed but you see what the thing of it is the young people are now ashamed of standing with what they believe do you know if you are not concerned you are not convinced but anybody who is concerned you will be convinced about telling others about this message I rarely went to church alone I always picked a friend in the week and I would share with them the message and prepare them up to the level where now they are ready to hear the preaching and I would bring them to church you know and when while the pastor is preaching I would be on fire not really for myself but for my friend whenever the pastor hit some Nots that I had already discussed with my friend I look at him like this I T on him are you hearing are you hearing because I was excited about this message and when you are excited about the message you are going to share it others let us come out of our comfort zones let us leave those borom things and let us be you know on fire let us not be entangled I never watched football I never went to movie theaters I never you know went to bar I never went to lud what was I using my time with I was using it to evangelize speak to my friends one by one I was you know studying the message I would take a book and read the message while I am taking notes you know it's not because I was a preacher but it was a desire to know more of God and I believe each of us can do imagine if each of us did that we would have a big time Revival among everybody we would have no time for boy girl relationships until we are ready for marriage we would have no time for wasting but if you are Idol the devil will have a lot to bring your away and I don't mind is a devil's worksh the devil will come to you and bring ideas and then you will agree with them because you have too much time because you bored so the devil will make you busy but I don't know about you as far as I'm concerned I don't want the devil to make me busy I don't want to be entangled in the I want to be entangled in the Affairs of the Kingdom what I'm speaking about I'm talking about the life that is coming let me tell you life is coming but also fire is coming what will it be for you you know we have to make a choice every one of us young people especially when you are still young you make a choice what will it be for you will it be life or fire as far as I'm concerned I made a choice it is going to be life and everything I do the friends I met to help me keep the life not entangling myself in their Affairs in their things because I'm a soldier I'm a soldier of the army of the Lord I am going to overcome I am not going to accept defeat I'm going to overcome I'm going to fight I am not going to be entangle I am intentional I am intentional in everything I'm doing and that's how each of us should be but false teachers will not tell you that first teachers in second Peter 2:8 the Bible speaks of them this ways when they speak great swearing words of vanity they Allure they Allure through the lust of the flesh through much wanton those that were clean escaped from them who live in error p [Music] while they promis them Liberty they themselves are the Servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage shall come to that for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the [Music] beginning for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is is turned to his own vomit again and the soul that was washed to her wallowing in the [Music] m now this is a very good Evangelistic text let me read for you this portion the same portion in the Amplified Bible Verse 18 for uttering loud basts of folly they beguile and lure with lustful desires of the flesh those who are barely escaping from them who are wrongdoers they they they beguile and lure lustful desires yes those who are barely escaping from them who are wrongdoers they promise them Liberty when they themselves are the slaves of De privity and defilement what good is it for a preacher to preach to you Liberty Freedom power but when you know you are on your way to hell when you know your life is not right with God but he says these people they promise them Liberty when they themselves as slaves of De privity and defilement for by whatever anyone is made inferior or worse or is overcome to that person or thing is enslaved [Music] if it is money if you become a slave if if money overcomes you if the love and the last for it if you become inferior to it are you hearing me church if you become inferior to money the last and the love of it then you become a slave of you become a slave if you become a slave if you if you you are under that desire that last full desire for something for anything it may be anything it may be an idea or even a person it may be anything but when you accept to become inferior to become something come take away anything but leave this when they touch that they have touched your heart you stop functioning the Bible says you have become a slave and we see in the world we are living now people are slaves to many things people are slaves to football people are slaves to movies people are slaves you know to games whereby someone ask me is it a sin let me tell you if it's not a sin I ask you something are you above it or are you under it anything if it is above you if it is not Jesus it is a sin anything it may even be a wife or husband but if it's above you more than Jesus Jesus should take the first priority in your life but we see they overtaken by this some people they submit to last you know and then they be these restful desires begin to rule over them and they become a slave to them you know they will submit to these desires that is entangling yourself in the Affairs of this life but as a good soldier nothing should be above you but you're a commander and our war Captain our commander is Jesus Christ is the word of God it should be the only thing above us everything else below us everything else should not rule over us but where you let a situation a condition it may even be a condition you are in or a thought and then you are troubled by him you are troubled by him until you can no longer think straight many people get into depression why because they have become a slave to that thought can you imagine many people can I have a thought that see I am not beautiful that's just a thought I am not beautiful and then the devil will take that thought and will slowly drag you under that thought and then you will not think anything else but that you are angry when someone looks at you you feel bad oh they looking at how they are looking at how ugly I am oh they looking at how little or small I am or they're looking at how bad I look you have become a slave to that little thought and that's entangling yourself in the matters of this life listen I don't care whether I'm beautiful ugly handsome tall short I am a soldier I have a fight to fight I have a battle to win I don't care about how I lost these are matters of this life I have a restaurant and you see many people are overtaken by those things that's why women you will find them painting themselves you will find them you know even changing their skin color they bleach it I'm so black oh goodness I'm so black I'm so black and they become a slave to that and the devil tells them now because you're so black bleach yourself and they begin bleaching I'm so black they become a slave why now at that moment they are becoming a slave and they entangling themselves into matters Affairs they're losing focus when brings a blow a bullet it will come straight because you are distracted many times we are defeated in this life not because God is not with us but because we are distracted even a good driver can knock if they are distracted if you look at this or that times it is people who will come in your life and I tell you without me you are nothing without me you are gone without me there is no future for you I am your blessing if you don't have me you a c that is a matter of this life I am not going to accept to be a slave of any man I am only a slave of Jesus Christ where he leads me I follow where he takes me I go I am only a slave of Jesus I am a sold in theallu my destiny is in his hands no man can control it no man can control as long as you are in the will of God no man can control your Destin and some people will come to you and say words that are very sharp maybe some of you are here and someone has spoken to you sharp things until you cannot go away from them and then whatever you do it fails to prosper then you say that person cast me for sure it worked let me try this and I see maybe I will prosper it doesn't work out the C is working on me you are a slave it's a thought maybe you you committed a sin in your life and it it you know you repented of it but the devil knows your memory is not like God's memory God forgets every sin that is under the blood but you don't and the devil doesn't that's the only thing we have in common with the devil and he will come to you tormenting you say ah I think I'm cured I know what I did before I believe I know I'm under a cur I can't come out of this situ let me tell you you are a slave you have no freedom because you are enslaved by that thing which has made you INF it has overcome you it may be last or last full desire it may be a thought like I mean this area of life where you become enslaved for if after they have escaped pollutions of the world through the you you know the full personal knowledge of the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ and listen church we Are Soldiers remember don't allow any thoughts to enslave you don't allow any mind of the devil to enslave you whatever is under the blood is under the blood whatever you have walked away from it not amen you know change your destiny the moment you met Jesus things changed our destiny was changed and from that moment the past cannot affect you Jesus does not come just make us better people he comes to change everything he you know a soldier is timed changed change the timing they change the trajectory when Jesus comes you have to be changed are you hearing me you know the way you think it has to be changeed that's why some people they say is brainwashing oh yeah it is brainwashing because we are recruited in the greatest army it is an Elite Force where our mind has to be changed where our mind has to be renew whereby we are no longer under the thoughts that rule over we are being ruled over by a higher thought which thought the thought of the world where he says I know the thoughts I have toward you thoughts of good and not of evil I thoughts of prosperity the thought of God is your mind is tuned different oh my God and he says here we have escaped after we have escaped the pollutions of the world through the full personal [Music] knowledge of they again after they have done that they again become entangled in those thoughts in them and are overcome that's the problem and that's what I'm talking about today many Believers after believing then they reach somewhere and they again are overcome and they get entangled and the Bible says when that happens their last condition is worse for them than the first rather if you have decided to be a soldier let let us move as soldiers let us fight as soldiers let us you know a soldier is a soldier did you know you cannot just leave the Army did you know that the moment you recruited you cannot just leave are you hearing me if you're hearing me say Amen you cannot just leave tell your neighbor you cannot just leave you cannot just live the moment you are recruited the moment you are amen your name is written down it is permanent you have to follow the standing order if the order says run run if the order says sit sit if the order says stand stand if the order says raise up your hand do and here the order is saying we are going to overcome the world the order is saying going to overcome the world and so shall it be what I say we should not be in tangle in the Affairs of this life the things we left the things we foru the last we live the fornication we live the smoking we live the drinking we live the we left we should not be entangled again we should be new people because if you go back again your condition will be the worse than the first for never to have obtained a full personal knowledge of the way of have been better for them than having obtained such knowledge and then not to turn back from the holy commandment there has befallen them the things spoken of in the true [Music] proverb the dog turns back to his own and the soul is washed only to wallow again in the not accept to go back in your vomit brother don't accept to go back in the M he brought me out of the mar clay he set my feet on the Rock to stay I am not going back no going back no going back praise the name of the Lord am I preaching to someone tonight we are not going to entangle ourselves in other words if we are to be Christians let us be Christians inde it should never be said about you we don't understand that person it should never be sa about you we don't know him very well be known be understood let your testimony be spoken even by your enemies brother bam here says something in the message the great warrior Joshua and as they came through the water they were baptized unto Moses unto God when they crossed over the Red Sea they had a little spell of rejoicing how many have crossed over they had a little spell of rejoicing you know when when someone has overcome they begin rejoicing that's why you should never worry about people in the church who Rejoice so much it's a of Victory it's a sign of overcoming are you hearing me child it's a sign of overcoming when someone begins rejoicing sometimes how many have ever been happy and you don't know why in church you begin shouting you begin clapping you're just happy and you don't know what is wrong with you you even wondering why everybody is not what is that it means you have crossed over you have crossed over you know when they did

see them again you will not see them anymore when they went through all the parasites drowned all the parasites drown amen can I preach to you in a moment CH all your should drown all your spiritual pow that should Hallelujah and these people who are trying to impersonate Christianity living like the world running around to every kind of place they ought not to be belonging to church and call themselves Christians God is praying on his D today separating his people calling out filling with the Holy Spirit segregating them do you want doors spray me oh Lord you know the World wants mixers God wants separators separate yourself from the things of the world then Christ will receive you hallelujah amen that's why we do not listen to worldly music that's why we don't listen to those things

D they will all die they last to die PR to die to die and all of them will die must be sprayed tonight we did because we are soldiers we don't want to be entangled in the Affairs of this second Timothy 2:20 give me a few moments here but in a great house there are not only vses of gold and silver but also of wood and of Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man that himself from this he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meat for the Master's use [Music] [Music] Hallelujah hallu prepared unto every good work free also youthful L but follow righteousness Faith charity peace amen with them that call on the name on The Lord out of a pure heart but foolish and unlearned questions avoid you out to say Amen to that knowing that they do gender strives and the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men able to teach patient in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if God per Adventure will give them repentance to acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the [Music] devil who are taken captive by him at his will now friends I want to be a vessel of Honor when God has sprayed you with his D and you have purged yourself from then you become a vessel of hor how many want to be a vessel hor I want God to honor me and use me for Mighty things God can only use you for God can use you for

say God it's not the other one it is me spray me me me that I'll be a vessel of war and as I'm finishing I want to t you to when you go back home maybe on your family altar please read 2 Samuel 11 from verse one and you can read all the way maybe to finish it verse 13 you find a man his name is or whichever you want to say was a man that was a soldier and he was a vessel of Honor but he left his wife at home and he went to battle and while he was battling his wife went to showering and she did not close her curtain the prophet says he not she did not close her curtain so you see you might actually begin to blame King David but also the woman did not close our C sisters you need to close your C leave as a a ver of Honor keep yourself pure keep yourself virtuous don't entangle yourself in the Affairs of the world and the woman did not close her C and so when the king looked from up he saw her showering and he said to the to the man bring bring me that woman and after she had come into the the palace we know that she she took and she became with child and and uh and when when she became pregnant of David David learn about it and the moment he learned about it he said I have to

to thy house and wash your feet and departed out of the King's house and there followed him a mess of meat from the [Music] King a mess of meat but UIA slept at the door of the King's house with all the Servants of his Lord and went not down to his house and when they had told David saying went not down unto his house David said unto C thou not from thy Journey why then did thou not go unto th house and said unto the king the ark and Israel the ark and Israel and Judah abide in tents and my Lord Jo and my Lord Jo and the Servants of my Lord encamped in the Open Fields shall I then go into my house to eat and drink and to lie with my wife as thou livest as thou livest and as thy soul leaveth I will not do this things and David said unto T here today also and tomorrow I will let the depart so in Jerusalem day and theor and when David called him he did eat and drink before him and made and he made him drunk and that evening he went out to lie on on his bed with the Servants of his Lord and he went not down to his house the first thing that was given to him was food he refused to eat and even if he ate he saided to sleep there on the door the when that did not work out the second thing that was given to him was they made him drunk do you know how many times the devil has wanted you to be drunk and you you lose focus on the mission God wants you to let me tell you the
