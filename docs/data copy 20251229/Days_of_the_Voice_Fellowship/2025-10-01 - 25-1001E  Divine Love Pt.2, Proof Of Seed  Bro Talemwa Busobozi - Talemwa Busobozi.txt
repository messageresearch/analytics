Bless you saints. Like to greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Always good to see those who um um able to come on Wednesday night. Amen. Shall we go to the word this evening? We are also speaking to Evening Light Bright Tabernacle on Zoom. Evening. So uh just send my greetings to all the saints uh that are fellowshipping with us on Zoom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that would mean that I'm going to speak for one hour not more. So let's just go to the book of John chapter 13. This would be part two of what I spoke on on Sunday here on divine love. &gt;&gt; And the other title I wanted to give it was proof of seed. [Music] John 13 33. Amen. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me and uh and as I said unto the Jews, wheither I go, ye cannot come. So now I say to you, a new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. 133. Amen. [Music] Amen. May you may be seated, please. Um on Sunday we had a good time on this subject &gt;&gt; and I had a bunch of people who really came to me and told me that they were really blessed and that it was for them and I also heard of some who were offended. They're saying that uh it looked like I was picking on them. But as I always say that when the word of God comes, it really comes to pick on you to to to help you and that's the purpose of the word so that it can correct us. So tonight we are just continuing with that thought and I pray that God will give you understanding, an open heart, revelation to know what he his spirit is saying. Now if you see the words of Jesus here, he says that ye shall seek me and and and whether I go, you cannot come. But now I say unto you, a new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. Now you notice that Jesus is suggesting to us that we should love one another the way he loved us. But really, how did he love us? For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. Whoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. God loved the unloved. What you can say the unlovable. Yeah. And that's what he loved. He did not love us on the basis of our actions on our good actions. God did not love us because we had loved him. We actually sing a song that he loved me before I knew him. You see, we that English word there has the word error. Before error is before e r e. Yeah. Before he loved me, before I knew him, he loved me. So I want you to understand the love of God. The love of God is very different from the love of man. And when we talk about and I had a discussion with a brother after the service and it seemed there are many things that we would really talk about when it comes to the subject of divine love and you know he asked me a question. He said, "Does it mean that if I love somebody that I should, you know, forgive them without condition and I should let them despitefully use me and you know so there is a misunderstanding of what love is. You know, we are not talking about human love. We are talking about divine love. Divine love is different from human love. Divine love, human love is the uh the the downgraded love of God. If you see the love of God is the is the ultimate God. It is with no condition. You love somebody regardless of what they have done or what they have not done. God did not love you because you were the best in your cult in your family or because you loved him more than others. Do you understand? There are people who pray day and night. Some of them fast for 40 days. All in the name of loving God. Others are preaching on the streets. Others cut their body. Others they beat themselves in form of sacraments. Others they pray hail Marys and I don't know how many times you know. But with all that many of those shall not go in the rapture. So if you say they don't love God, you you you are not you are not saying the truth. You you are a liar and the truth is not in you. These people genuinely humanly love God. But you see God does not want us to love him with our human love. No one among us can be able to love God with our human love because our human love cannot be trusted. Our human love is watered down. Our human love will always fail. Our human love is bound by conditions. You can love somebody so much today and tomorrow you will hate them as much as you love them because of what they did to you. And and so that is not love. The love I'm talking about, but the love I'm talking about is called divine love. Divine love which is the love of God. is beyond conditions. Regardless of what someone has done, regardless of what they have said against you, regardless of what they have done against you, you will love them. And that love is permanent. It does not shift. It does not change. It does not reduce. It does not increase. It is permanent. It stays. It is called divine love. Now, this is the love God had for us. When he loved us, he loved us before we were born. He says, Jacob have I love and Esau have I hate. When did he love you? He loved him before he was born. He loved him before he was in his mother's womb and he hated Isa before he was in his mother's womb. So what basis did God base on to love in his um um immutable power authority in his grace he loved But you see, all those that he says he loved were those that were in him because they were his attributes. Follow me closely. They were his attribute before the foundation of the world. And so they did not do anything so that they can be able to qualify for that love. They qualified for that love because of who they were. Hallelujah. Before Jacob did any bad, before Esau did any good, God loved Jacob and hated Esau. Because Esau's seed was different. Both loved Esau and that was human love. But you see with human love you can even love the wrong person. That is why never rely on your human love because your human love you have it today and tomorrow you don't own it. it will shift on you. It is a feeling which is driven by conditions and situations. But you see the divine love which is the love of God. It's not driven by condition or situation. It is moved by God. It is permanent. Amen. As long as you have God in your heart, you will love permanently. Now when I say that God loved Jacob and he hated Israel, it does not mean that God hates unbelievers. For God loved the world. If you have the love of God in you, you will love everyone, a believer and an unbeliever alike. You see, when Cain and Abel began to express who they were, you realize that each of them had a seed in them. Kane had a seed of God. And Abel, rather, Abel had a seed of God and Kenya had a seed of God. And as we saw on Sunday, it is not possible for a person for the serpent seed for the seed of the serpent to have this love I am talking about today because Satan cannot love. I read for you a few quotes but I'll read for you some more here. Praise the name of the Lord. I'm just going to break it, break it, and take it as how the Holy Spirit will lead. You see in the message, faith is a substance. Satan can copy any kind of a gift. Any kind of a manifestation, but he cannot love. God is love. Satan cannot love. Amen. So Satan cannot love and his children cannot love. But God is love and his children love. And the kind of love I'm talking about is divine love. God is love. God is love. And that love never wears off. Because of this love. Amen. God came to Cain and he told him, "If thou doest well, will you not be accepted?" And I always say in that phrase, in that statement, God preached to serpent seed and was trying to say something serpent seed that because of my love, you two can be saved. Because of my love, you too can be accepted. Because of my love, you too can be redeemed. Because of my love, you too can be in the beloved. But the problem was not God is love. We sing that God's love reaches even to the lowest hell. God's love surpasses anything that you know. But you see, the only reason why it does not seem to reach some people like Kane is they do not have something to h that love. They do not have the seed of life in them because they are the serpent seed. So they cannot receive the love but God will always give his love but they cannot receive the remember it is it is a burden and and as long as you receive it is the word. It is the life and as long as you receive it. But if you don't receive it, it will give you death. The same water which saved Noah and his people, killed everybody else. You see, this word is a double-edged sword. And God is love. And and the love is the word and God is the word. Praise God. Praise God. So when we talk about divine love, Jesus said, "A new commandment I gave you. That ye love one another." He's talking to who? He's talking to the believers. He's talking to the sea. Amen. And he says, "Then ye they shall know that ye are my disciples." The only proof that someone is a true disciple of Christ, he will have love, divine love. It is impossible for someone who is not born again to have this divine love. You can try to pretend. You can try to mimic it. But I tell you, sister, brother, what I'm talking about, it is impossible to pretend it. It is impossible to pretend that you have it. You can only pretend for so long, but one day something happens when you're truly exposed. Because I told you human love fails with situations. Circumstances will fail you. So circumstances will happen in your life and then you will say I will not go to church again and then you will become indifferent and then you become bitter and then you don't like a brother, you don't like a sister. Then we can know you don't have that love in your heart. So you can imagine how many people will miss the rapture. &gt;&gt; And you know you don't need to wait until then. You can design yourself by the hearing of the word. How far are you? If you don't have this divine love, my brother, Don't pretend about it. Ask God to fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Because when you are born again, it is an automatic thing. No preacher can give it to you. No church can give it to you. You see, you receive it automatically the moment you are born again. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; You remember that I I spoke to you on Sunday and we read uh uh maybe I'll just rehearse a few things today. 1 John chapter 3. In the interest of time, we just say what I'm saying. For this is the message that he had from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain. The moment he begins to talk about love, he talks about Cain, talks, he goes to the seed. You remember before he talked about love in first John 3, he was speaking about the right. He was speaking about righteousness and that he that loves God doeth righteousness. And I told you this is not the righteousness of the law. It is the righteousness of God which comes to you when you receive the Holy Spirit. And that's why Jesus said a new commandment I give you. This 11th commandment once you have it. What is it? Love. Divine love. Once you have it, you have fulfilled all the requirement of the Lord. And this is the message that we heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain who was of that wicked one. and he slew his brother. And the question was, why did he kill him? Because his own works were evil and his brother's works were righteous. You see, marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. So the world will always hate the believers. But the believers will never hate the world. When I say the world, I mean the people in the world. &gt;&gt; The believers, a believer will never hate the people, anyone. You will never hate a brother. And you know the Bible when he says here, follow me closely. He says, "Not as Cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother." So he's now saying that Cain was Abel's brother. But actually we know that we are of two different fathers. We are living in this world as pilgrims and strangers. This is not our home. The father of this world is not our father. Our father is from above. But while we are in the world, we have our brothers here from the same mother but from a different father. Brother says they all in the framework of the Christian church. They our brothers. You see, someone may disagree with you. They may have a different opinion on the same thing. They may even believe some other doctrine. But as long as they believe Christ, they are your brother. Hallelujah. But now the test, the test of a true genuine believer is if you have love regardless of what they believe, regardless of what they do to you, regardless of what they say, you love them the same way. Not pretending, but genuine. When you shake their hand, you can say, "I truly genuinely love you." &gt;&gt; And you mean it. No attitude. How many have reached that level? A believer's enemy should be the devil only. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Mother not my brethren. If the world hate you, we know that we have passed from death unto life because because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abides in death. Can we all say amen to that? If you don't love your brother, you you are in death. which means you are not born again. You are not yet born again until you love your brother. Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer and he know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. So in other words, Cain was a murderer because he hated. You know, brother Bam in the church age book many places shows us that the other seed will always hurt the seed of God. The false church will always hurt the truth. The serpent seed will always hurt the truth and their mothers. If they can do anything to you, they will do it. But Abel loved Cain to his grave. If you can't love your enemy, you don't have eternal life. If you can't have a love for somebody that that doesn't agree with you, you don't have eternal life dwelling in you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now, let me show you something here in the Ladesian church age. He said, "Now we we can see why there were two vines, one true and one false. Now we can see why Abraham had two sons, one after the flesh and that persecuted Isaac and one after promise." Now we can see how that out of the same parents two boys came forth as twins. Same parents, two boys came out as twins. One knowing and loving the things of of God and the other the other knowing much of the same truth but not of the same spirit. There are some brothers who will claim to believe this message, but they don't have the same spirit that you have. They are within the same church. They within the same faith. I'm trying to show you something. Saints, these two seeds have been growing together from the very beginning. from right from the first church of Ephesians. Those two seeds were there and they were planted at the same time rather one was planted and the other was planted and and then when the servant said to the master should we approve the bad seed he said no you cannot wait until the time of the harvest. Amen. That's when we are going to see the manifestations of the two seeds. Do you know we are right in that time? We are living in the end time when those two seeds are beginning to manifest themselves. You are beginning to manifest who you are. When the time of maturity has come, listen church. When the time of maturity has come, you cannot pretend. It is a must. You have to bring out what is in you. Amen. If you are if you are the right seed, it has to manifest. If if you are the the the chaff for the wheat, the the cocoa, you have to manifest now. That's the time we are living in. You have to show what fruit you have. That's why he said he shall know them by what? By their fruit. &gt;&gt; That shows what they bearing, what what they bearing, what is in them, what is coming out of. Jesus said what goes into the mouth does not defile it but what comes out of it that's what def cannot defy you are hearing the word you are hearing the word you hearing the word but do you know some people the more they hear the word the more worse they become and others the more they hear the word the better they become. What's happening? The issue is on the sea. The life that is in you but some of us have the life of God in you. We are the predestinated seed of God and we have come into this world to manifest who really we are. We were bad. But the more we hear the word, we become better and better and better every day. Praise God. Praise God. And some of the things we begin to drop them. We had hatred in our heart. We had envy in our heart. We had jealousy in our heart. But you see the more of the word come, the more lovely we become. You need to see all those old time people who were filled with the Holy Ghost. Regardless of what you thought you believed, they loved you this. Let me tell you, brother, that's the proof of who you are. It shows what is in you. You cannot bring out love when you don't have love in you. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you can't pretend either. You either have the maze on you as a fruit or you have nothing. You are just a weed. What fruits are you bearing? [Music] What fruits do you have as a Christian? as a brother, as a sister, what fields are coming out of you. [Music] You know what shows that we are believers is not when we come to church and shout and clap our hands and feel good. What shows that we are a believer is how we live dayto day in our life outside of the church. That shows who we really are. Brothers and sisters, we are coming at a time of full manifestation. This is a time we can't hide what is in us. Get deeper in Christ and begin to pull out what has been in you, all his word. The more you hear the word, the more lovely you should become, the more bitterness you will drop away. Someone may do something against you and they may hurt you. But don't you worry if you have God in your heart. That's why the Bible says if someone has done something to you, you go to him. How can you do that if you don't have this divine love? It is impossible. It is impossible. Normally, humanly speaking, we will say it is him who did it. Let him come and apologize. And when he comes, you will say, "I'm not satisfied. I the way you are apologizing I'm not even satisfied. You don't even have tears. You're not even kneeling down. You are not even I'm not satisfied. I'm not forgiven until I see tears and when they show tears. Okay. But the way you are speaking, it is not conviction. There's no conviction there. That shows you are walking in the flesh. You are still a cannon believer. But brother, if you're a spiritual believer, If you are mature, if you have divine love, you will not wait for them to come to you. You will go to them and say, "Brother, you offended me when you did this and this. And before they say a word, you have already forgiven them." Hallelujah. That's what Jesus did when he came down. He came and told us you did this and this and this and this and this before we say the word he said don't you worry I have paid the price I forgiven you already you are free and he say love everybody love one another as I have loved you [Applause] that's the love of God friends and until we come to that spot We still you still need to be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we can see how that out of the same parents two boys came forth as twins. One knowing and loving the things of the of God and the other knowing much of the same truth. but not of the same spirit and hence he persecuted the child that was elect. God did not reprobate for the sake of reprobation. He reprobated for the sake of the elite because of the elect. &gt;&gt; Because of the elect. God did not just decide to hate Israel, but his hands were tied because of the healing. Hallelujah. Amen. And he came to you. And he said, "I love you. I love you." Not because you did something good. Simply because you are the elect. Sometimes even life may not be well. You may not have money, even for food, even for basic needs, but then God says, "I love you and the proof of my love is that you are the elect." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Can you imagine that? The proof that he loves you, not is not when he gives you a car. is that when he does all these good things for you, he will prove that he loves you through election. So when you're walking, you're walking with shoulder heart. Brother said, "We believe in eternal security." [Music] Amen. Amen. Oh, how he loves me. Oh, how he loves me. I know not why. Oh, how he loves. Amen. I have a friend, a precious friend. Oh, he loves me. You know what? He loved me before I even knew him. Tell me what greater love than that because I am his attribute. [Music] I am a part of him. Without me, he is not full because he's the head. I am the body and him and I make God. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. We may not understand this right now because we are wearing the flesh, but one of these days now. Hallelujah. Amen. When the trumpet of the Lord shall come, you will know what I'm talking about, you will see the living room, of the love of God, of this fellowship divine. Praise God. And henceforth you see he prepared for the sake of the elect. And now he begins to talk about the elect. And he says elect cannot persecute elect. Hallelujah. The moment you have someone, maybe a brother in your church that you don't like and you you wish something bad happened to them. I wish they bewitch them. I wish they fail exam. I wish they lose their job. I wish they never become friends. I wish they never get married. And you are thinking you are an elect. There's a problem. And let me announce to you either none of you is an ill or you that is hurting is the one who is but I can assure you can never persecute. [Music] Hallelujah. An elect can never have hatred. Can never have hatred but he will always have love. Hallelujah. Amen. Elect cannot harm elect. It is the reproets. Hallelujah. It is the reproets that persecute and destroy the elect. Look, look at Esau. He's hunting Jacob to destroy him. Who is Serpent seed. &gt;&gt; Look at Cain. He's hunting and he finally destroys it. Who is Kane? Serpent seed. Amen. Look at Judas is hunting Jesus cunningly in the eyes of being a brother. You know, look at all the examples I've given you. Pain was a brother of Ab. Isa was a brother of Jesus. Even Judas was a brother of Jesus. But all of these ones being brothers, one of them was a elect, another one was a reprobate. And the reprobates will always hunt the elect. Oh my god. But the elect will have an open arm. An open hand, an open heart. Brother Bam said when they draw a small circle and they draw you out, you the elect, you will draw a bigger one and you will draw everybody in. That is why we are not a denomination. Hallelujah. Amen. We are not Catholics. [Applause] But I will tell you what, we welcome all of them here. They are our brothers. We love them. Why? Because we want them to receive this message of God. Amen. The elect will be in love with the world. Praise God. All those reprobates are religious. They are smart. They are of that cane line. The serpent sea. They build their bubbles. They build their cities. They build their empires. And all the while calling on God, they had the true seed and they will do all they can even in the name of the Lord to destroy God's elected ones. But they are needed. They are needed. We need them. What is the chaff to the wheat? No chaff, no wheat. But at the end What happens to the ch? It is burned with a fire and what about the wheat? Where is it? It is gathered in his garden. It is where he is. You are the wheat. We are preparing ourselves to be gathered into the garden in the rapture, the change of our bodies. And you know there is one thing that brother Bam said will be the way uh will be the thing that will help the seed to overcome is when she realizes and by God's spirit design this wrong spirit the antichrist spirit that is working within the framework of Christian and she will withstand it, then she will be an invisible. And it says the book of Revelation shows the the works of Satan, which is the attempted destruction of God's. and his children are alive. &gt;&gt; The children of Satan, by the way, are not dead. Even Satan is not is not dead. He's alive. He's on earth today. [Music] He's a spirit of deception in our generation. He has come to us as a pale horse rider. All of it mixed together, deception, death, persecution, and is coming to attack the bride. And you know what? He has made his preachers, ministers of righteousness. So there are people wearing suits today just like me when they are children of Satan and they're reading from the Bible they're just like Cain they are brother and their work is only one to build a big bell to build a big city to build a big empire while calling on God. They are very smart. They are trying to build a very big religious city. But the purpose is one. Open your eyes. The purpose is one to destroy the elect. What is the purpose of the World Council of Churches? The Bible calls in the image of the beast. What is their purpose? You know the whole purpose is one. They're bundling themselves together. We know for one purpose that they may destroy the true church because they will have one voice, one world religion and then they will fight against that lead church that does not have membership in their organization. But I don't know what Amen. That the elect can never be destroyed. Where do they go? They go in the rapture because we in this end time are anointed with the anointing of the flying eagle, the flying eagle. Go and read your Bible. Four beasts. And the last beast to come is a flying eagle. You know we are not flying to escape. Some people think we are escaping. We are not escaping anything. We are flying away because we have overcome. Amen. We are flying away because we have defeated the Lord and all his works and all his tactics. That's why we are against denomination. The spirit of denomination, the spirit of religion because it comes to destroy the healer. God did not send us religion. He sent us the word but man turned it into religion. Religion is the highest, the greatest enemy of the church, organized religion. God has separated us from all. But you know we have no hatred in our heart. We love everybody even those that are not part of us because the why do they form denominations they said we are the right ones others are wrong and they our enemies the moment they do that says they die they die and they kept on doing that forming all denominations but you see The moment you begin to feel we are the only right one, everybody else is wrong and our enemies. That's the the dividing line. You have now made yourself a denomination. But this message was not intended to build a denomination. [Music] Right? You see, we have many churches of the message all over the world. many different registrations. Our registrations is not an issue. Those things are for the government. It's not for our identity. What identifies all of us is the message we all feed on. The word we all feed on that identifies us in Christ. The Holy Ghost which we are baptized with that identifies us and we are we are not a denomination and we cannot be praise God firstians 4 but as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you for ye yourselves a taught of God to love one another. 1 Peter 1:22, "Seeing you have priified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unf of the brethren. See that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently, being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. Praise God. 1 John 3:23. And this is his commandment. that we should believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us commandments. 1 John 4:7 beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love. And it is who has manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him. Heroin is love. Not that we loved God, but that he loved us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We were the bad one and he being good, he loved us. But now that he has loved us, he has been born in us. That's why we born again, born of God, not born of the flesh. We are now no longer what we were we were before he came. We are now born of God. So now we are him. So the way he loved us, we didn't love him. He loved us. So the same same way, we that were loved by him can now love others even when they don't love us. Hallelujah. Here is love. Not that we loved him, but that he loved us and sent his son to be properation of our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. Praise God. and their eyes were open and they knew him. Let me tell you, just don't join church now. That won't work. You've got to be born again. Not an emotional workup. Not some little something you say, "Oh, well, I shouted I spoke with that ain't it." When really down in your heart something comes to change you and you become a new creature in Christ Jesus. You received the person Christ Jesus when old things die out and new things are born again. You make things right that you did wrong. You love your enemies. You pray for those who respect you. That's when you are a Christian. The tree is known by the fruit it bears. [Music] And he says in here him, I don't care if you are a church member. Don't be ashamed. Church member is all right. But brother, that's not what we talking about. Have you really received something in your heart that makes you love everybody? Okay, I'm about to finish and listen to those words. Have you you you received something in your heart that makes you love everybody? Listen. Love your enemies. All all the old things this person you become. Some of you are saying, "All things are passed. I'm now new. I'm born again. I'm a part of my savior." But yet your heart is filled with a lot of hatred, with a lot of envy, with a lot of gossip, wi-i with a lot of bitterness. You are lying yourself. You are not yet new. you are old. Would you stand your feet now for prayer? And that's what Brahos said, which means it is possible for you to truly be born again and you receive true pure love. Love that workketh no ill to his name. And he says that love is the fulfilling of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Let me just try to wrap it up now. I I wanted to speak on Peter. I spoke a little bit on it on Sunday. How it tells us about the state of a perfect man and brother Bam says building this monument building this sture starts off with the foundation of stone faith virtue knowledge patience godliness now what does it do then they are waiting for the headstone which is love. For God is love and he controls and he is the strength of every one of those things right in here. See all those works in here. And here these little waves come. What is that? The Holy Ghost coming down. Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is above all this. welding this together. Building what? A perfect church for the capstone to capital. [Music] And this capstone what we are preaching to you is the capstone message. The message of the seven thunders which is the capstone message. What is it? It is the revelation of Jesus which gives you not only rapturing faith but kepts you off as a perfect church. with Christ the head perfect love sitting on it. Praise God. Let me tell you friends. When you when you study this subject of love, it makes you wonder whether many of us have yet gotten there. Someone can preach for I don't know how many years but not yet there. But when he comes is going to only attract the substance that is like him. Can you disagree with somebody and you love them genuine? Can someone abuse you despitefully use you and you still love them? How come we have all these attitudes as a believer? You you have those attitudes and you say that one we will never work together again we don't see you that one sir blacklisted there is a problem with you not with them and if a problem is not with the seed then you're just not born again But I want to believe they're just not born again. But you see, Bible says, "Ask and ye shall be given. Knock, it shall be opened." If you want to be born again, it is very easy. Be born of the word. Be born of the spirit. When you receive the word, he will fill you with the spirit in your heart. And how do you know that? When you have divine love, that one cannot fail. If you can stand on your feet, it will the Bible says it beareth all things, believeth all things, endureth all things, not easily performed, thinkketh no evil, doesn't rejoice in iniquity, rejoices in in the truth, it is not self-seeking, is not puffed up, doesn't supposed to vault itself. No envy in it, is kind and long-suffering, doesn't behave itself unseemly. Would you ask bow your head tonight? And you know speak to the Lord. Tell him Lord. I need that. I need that for my brothers [Music] that I will love my brothers. That I will love my sisters. That I will love my enemies. The Lord Jesus. When people see me, when men see me, then they will know I am his disciple. That's the only way they can know. Not by so much prayer, not by so much shouting or rejoicing or being religious, [Music] but by love. The love that never fails. Conditions can't fail. situations can't fail it. That love will remain perfect. It cannot be. It's like a rock. It stays for ages. Lord Jesus. May you give that to my brother, my sister. May you make this a living reality to each one of us, Lord. And we may come to that place that whereby we can say we love everybody. We love our brothers. We love our sisters and we have no enemies by the devil. Lord, I know that these things cannot be able to be attained humanly speaking. But if you can give us a new path, bring us to that level, Lord, of perfection that we may know. It's not about us. It's about Christ. It's all about you. Granted, I pray. Bless everyone that has been listening and all the saints on Zoom tonight, also here, and elsewhere. Father, bless each and every one of us.
