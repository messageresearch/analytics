we hear from above that's our desire tonight father Lord you know whoever that was going to be a part of this service and they are here and others are streaming this service not here physically with us but with us in the spirit May minister to each heart I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] amen I would like to invite you to the scriptures First Corinthians 11 [Music] verse1 we are reading only one verse what does it say there English it says be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ amen amen you may be seated so I greet to you all in the name of Jesus Christ once again amen amen so we are happy to be in the house of the Lord this I've also been asked to speak to evening light bright Tabernacle Tabernacle so we greet the Saints uh on Zoom this evening last Wednesday I preached on pointing people to Christ and so today I will talk about the same maybe it can be a part two of what I spoke about many people contacted me and they said they were really blessed by that service and actually one one believer told me do you have a part two of that I realized I might have a few parts of this same thought so uh let us be in prayer believing that the Lord will minister to us amen pointing people to Christ be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ you notice uh speaking of this we need to understand that the world that we are living in currently is a world that is looking for followers when I say world I mean the people you see everyone is looking for followers uh hospitals are looking for followers when you go there they register you they want you to keep [Music] coming and so when you go back it will not be a hustle so you are a follower when you go to churches churches also look for followers and uh it has it has come to a point whereby churches or denominations begin to burst uh according to how many followers are following their Church and if we were to say that the church that has the biggest following is the right church that would be the Roman Catholic church because the Roman Catholic church has the biggest following in the world how many knew that it has the biggest following but I hate to disappoint you but it's not about how big the following you have many times if you have a big following actually spiritually speaking a big following is a sign that there is something [Music] wrong you know when Jesus Christ was still on Earth he had a big Following also at one time time we see he started as a small Church really with only a handful of Believers and then later on the people multiplied into uh thousands because as they kept on hearing the test the testimonies out of his ministry they would hear that the man was raising the dead they would hear he would you know give uh you know you know Miracles he would heal the sick he would Open the Eyes of the Blind and as they kept on hearing these testimonies they were touched and they were pulled towards the ministry of Jesus Christ and so at one time he had 5,000 in his church and so it was a big church what today we call a mega church and so Pastor Jesus came up one day and you know the people were hungry and you know Pastor Jesus had to bring a solution you know this is a miracle worker this is a promis keeper and so when he was standing right before them and they told him that the people are hungry he they looked at him and kept quiet they waited for a solution and he told them what do you have he took what they had and he multiplied it and they had many bread and they had many fish and every one of them every last one ate every last one ate and they even had a remainder of some fish and some bread and they collected a bunch of baskets and people were happy said our pastor is the pastor our pastor is the best they said our pastor there is no one like him our pastor he is the top notch his sermons do wonders in our life he only spoke and bread was multiplied let me ask you Church who among you would not want to be under the ministry of such a man he you come and tell him Pastor I have no rent he says receive your rent and money just is created in your says I have no food and food is just created by a miracle that is the nature of Jesus's Ministry and people loved him people increased actually we say he had 5,000 but it was more than 5,000 because 5,000 were only men so if you count women and and children she had about maybe 15,000 or maybe 25,000 because usually women and children are more than men so he was a pastor of a mega church but then he brought uh another Revelation this is what pushed away the people he now did not preach a message of Miracles he did not preach a message of signs and wonders but now his sermon was the word he says he that cannot eat my flesh and drink my blood is not a part of me and they looked at him they said is this man a vampire how come he can tell us to eat him and drink his blood we cannot do that God forbid one by one they walked away one by one they walked away the church which had tens of thousands of people remained with only about 12 people 1 2 3 4 5 12 and they looked at Jesus and he looked at them he did not say please remain with me please stay but he looked at them and he said do you also want to go meaning his message was not that which was pulling people towards himself but yet he is the only man in this earth who had a Ministry that was worthy pulling people towards him but today we have every preacher every man behind a bu his minist is pulling people towards him that is a clear sign of a false prophet a true prophet of God will not pull people towards himself he will pull people towards God towards the word because God is the word his word can never lie his word is the truth his word is final praise the name of the Lord while I'm continuing here you have to clear my sound I'm hearing a lot of uh you need to make it a bit better praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and Jesus preached a very hard someone that day let me remove my to he preached hallelujah hallelujah tell your neighbor don't be so gloomy tell him be happy smile Hallelujah if you want the Lord to speak to you amen be ready to receive how many are ready to receive this ready to receive praise the name of the Lord and so we see that Jesus preached a very hard some on that day and the people left him but he was not pulling the remainder he instead told them to go away but those who stayed they told him he says to whom can we go who has the words of eternal life why did they stay they did not stay because was a good man they did not stay because he looked so nice they did not stay because he did miracles for them they did not stay because he had a big church but they stayed they stayed because of the word amen we are here because of the word We are following him because of the word amen Brothers uh please help on the sound is becoming worse now praise the name of the Lord there's quite a lot of stereo or maybe I'll not preach until you Brothers brother Dixon I I don't know why you always have to be told you will have to excuse us friends well I think that is becoming better when it is good I'll tell you praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and so I think that is good now that is good now I think we can go with that so he says be ye followers of me even as even as I also am of Christ and I want you to think about the scenario when these people leave and they are only left with Jesus is left with only a handful and he does not beg them to stay but today when you have a church of 10 people 20 people 30 50 you don't feel very satisfied because you feel maybe what you're preaching is not the truth the truth will not draw [Music] crowds the truth will draw only those that were predestinated to [Music] life and any God called man will preach the truth regardless of how many people he is preaching [Music] to and when he preaches it he will preach his heart I always say he will preach like a dying man to a dying generation because we are not preaching to bring followers to us we are not comedians we don't come to make you know to make you happy so you can follow us we don't come you know to give you things so you can follow us you know we come to tell you something which will prepare you for the coming of the Lord because Jesus is coming and he is the one we love he's the one we worship he's the one we follow you know let me tell you in this world today there is a church which is not amen leading people towards that denomination it is not leading people towards a man it is not leading people towards a system but it is leading people towards a living God it is leading people towards Jesus Christ I believe I'm part of that church I believe I'm a member of that church and the bishop of that church is Jesus Christ himself the one that died and aen rose again and I want you to hear this from the message Elijah when you see these drunks and prostitutes on the street don't Point your scornful finger and say I'm better than they are I'm requesting you brother Dixon to sit there brother Prince sit this side and make sure brother Dixon that the sound is perfect amen when you see these drunks and prostitutes on the street don't Point your scornful finger and say I'm better than they [Music] are how many saw a drunkard this past week brother how did you feel about the drunken it was nasty it is really nasty this is really mess I'll tell you 90% of Believers feel that way but our Prophet here tells us when you see these drunks and on the streets don't Point your scone full finger and say I'm better than they are the thing to do that person is just as low as they can get now if anything is as low as he can get if anything take them by the hand and lift them up and point them to Jesus Christ the son of God who can save them but oh I belong to the churches we don't have such people like that in our churches we've we've drawn a boundary line now we just let a certain class of people come to our churches what we need today is that old fashioned Holy Ghost Revival a nationwide which makes us all shake hands with one another and call one another brother and sister are you hearing what I'm saying Church the problem we have the problem that we have that many people you know draw a boundary line they say oh that one is a drunker oh that one is like this or that one is doing his hair like that or that one is doing this and that for us in our church we are better than all of them so in other words they kind of feel in their Church they the only ones going to heaven in their Church they are the only right ones let me tell you that is how denomination started and we are not members of any denomination Believers of the message of the hour they are not followers of any denomination we are followers of Christ we are not followers of denomination amen there is a message in the L it is called the end time message it is not any religion it is beyond religion Beyond Church it is beyond Fellowship it is a connection with Jesus Christ amen and we are a part of it here we don't want to draw a boundary line we want we don't want to have a certain class of people come to our [Music] churches we need everybody to come we want the Muslims to we want the Catholics to come we want the drun to come we want the to come we want the immortal to come we want the Sinners to come when they come they going to meet a living God and this God will change them and this God will baptize them with the power of the Holy Ghost and they will no longer be what they used to be some of those were us some of those were you but now we have been washed but now we have been Sanctified now we have been filled with the Holy Ghost we are now on our way to heaven some of you are not there yet but I tell you you are going to get there as long as you stay under the pure word as long as the pure word is preached there is nothing that can take that Revival out you must be filled with the Holy Spirit tell your neighbor you must be filled with the Holy Spirit you must be born again as long as the the true word is being preached to you praise the name of the Lord Hebrews Ser he says now the little Tabernacle he was talking about his Tabernacle in has no membership but we have fellowship and I want to say this every true church has no membership but has Fellowship you see what is membership is when they tell you you know we own you some of them even in the dominations they bring a book where they tell you to sign your name as a member subscribe as a member whereby if you left it will be as if you're going to hell but in the message we have been set free in the message we don't do it like in the denominations we don't believe in church membership but we believe in Fellowship we have no Creed but Christ we have no law but love come on say it with me we have no book but the Bible That's the only book that we know and the only thing that we know as we have as the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all s we have Fellowship one with another while the blood you know when we come in the fellowship and the word is preached the blood begins to take to cleanse to cleanse you to Cle you to cleans you and as you are being clean as you are being cleaned then we can have Fellowship what is the basis of Fellowship the basis of Fellowship is the blood of Jesus the basis of Fellowship is the true word of God being preached if any church does not stand with the true word of God I have no Bas of fellowship with them if they Don't Preach one God and they preach three gods of the trinity that is not a Bible Doctrine it was brought and added by the Roman Catholic [Music] church and that is why I cannot Fellowship in the Roman Catholic church because I have no basis of Fellowship my basis of Fellowship is with those that believe in one God in the one God of Abraham the one God of Isaac in the one God of the Bible amen my best of Fellowship is with those amen that believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit after believing my Bas of Fellowship is with those that believe we have a message the eny that has restored us back to the faith of the pente fathers we have no membership we have Fellowship tell your neighbor we have no membership but Fellowship are you not so glad to know that you are not owned by a church you are not a property of days of the voice Fellowship you are not a property of evening light but you are a property of Jesus the man that died for you the man that gave himself for you he gave his life's blood for you and me he's the one that owns me he the one that consumes my my life he consumes my mind he consumes my heart he consumes all of me I want to be his and I want him to be mine amen he owns me I am his and he is mine he is my Bishop he's my teacher he's my Lord he's my savior Hallelujah I am so glad that I can boast in Christ not in my church not in my religion not in my denomination come on sisters in my church not with my pastor but I can boast in Christ Jesus hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord 1 Corinthians 12:12 he says for as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit we are all baptized into the one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be born or free we we whether we be English or African amen we have been baptized into one body by one spirit and we have all been made to drink into one Spirit the more we hear the word of God the more we are drinking into the spirit and the Bible says here amen that we have many members but the body is one tell your neighbor the body is one but the members of the body are many now all the members of that one body being many yet it is one body and he says by one Spirit are we all baptized into that body how many bodies one body now if anybody is going to go in the Rapture he must be a member of that body we don't have two bodies of the Lord there can only be one body I want you to think about it friends amen before this message came we have had many religions we had anglicans which I was part of Catholics Adventists you know morons you know and all the others Pentecostals and each group was claiming to be that body the Catholics were saying we are the universal Body of Christ and anyone who is not a member of the Catholic church is not part of the body and they were saying we are the body the anglicans came later they said no you are wrong we are the body and and the Pentecostals came and the Baptist came and Presbyterians and each of them was claiming to be that body we are the body but here when when God inen in the end time restored the Church back again to the foundations of the truth told them none of them is the body because those are systems listen those are organizations those are denominations are you hearing me there is no religion going to Heaven There is no denomination going to heaven but let me tell you souls are going to heaven people are going to heaven only those who are a part of that body and he says how do you become a part of the body you become a part of the body by being born into the body listen you do not join the body by writing your name on a church book you don't join the body by shaking a pastor's hand don't join the body by attending Fellowship somewhere but you become a member of the body of Jesus Christ by being filled with the Holy Ghost and how do you be filled with the Holy Ghost chapter two chapter 2 he says repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and he shall I know and he shall I know where Where is the scripture brother and he shall be filled tell your neighbor and he shall be F you shall be F how you can't be filled by being a member of a certain Church you can't be filled by going to some organization you can only be filled amen by being amen by by receiving Jesus Christ through repentance after belief of the truth and you baptized in much water in the name of Jesus Christ there is no other name whereby we can be saved but the name of Jesus Christ amen is the only name I said there is no other name but only Jesus that's the only name thereby we can be saved and once you have believed on that name and you baptized in much water then God looks at you because you have faith he accepts you and as a proof he has accepted he fills you with the Holy Spirit when you receive the Holy Spirit you are now a member of the body so who are the members of the body of Jesus Christ they will believe in all that where are they going to come from they will come from all denominations they will come from Anglican they will come from Catholic they will come from Pentecostal they will come from Baptist they will come Froman they will come from everywhere and they are going to come from Every Nation on Earth what I'm teaching today is something foundational I want you to listen to me with all your heart you see they're going to come from everywhere we should never we especially as Believers of this message we should never think that our little church is the only church that has the truth that is foolishness we would have become denomination the body of Jesus is a large body it is all over the world you see these names we name ourselves dvf blah blah blah blah blah blah blah it's just like the Catholics also Nam themselves Roman Catholic Anglican Presbyterian no differ no difference it's just names that is used for the government those are not even ours we do not identify ourself by dvf or by evening light that is just a registration for the government to identify us but how do we identify ourselves we identify ourselves as part of the body if we are filled with the Holy Ghost if we are filled with the Holy Ghost if we believe the truth then we know we are members of the body we cannot know we members as a group we have to know as individuals many of you can come here and you still go to hell if you're not filled with the Holy Ghost so it's not about where you go for church you can even go where the truth is preached and you miss it but if you receive it and you filled with the Holy Ghost then you are sealed as a member and when the trumpet of God shall sound amen you will be among those that you will go in the Rapture the Bible says your body shall be changed morality shall put on immortality and then you will fly away but I tell you what you can easily miss it and the body of Jesus is one body but with many members the moment you are filled with the Holy Ghost you are a member and how many members do we have in this church I am a member if you don't know whether you a member or not amen I tell you what every service you come to be sure you are a member because if you are not a member you will not go in the sometimes when you preach against what some denominations do and what some Churches preach people get offended how can you speak against my church my Bishop my denomination they love their denomination more than they love themselves because if you loved yourself you would surely love the word of God but people love their pastors their churches their denominations more than they love the word of God it is only in the message of the hour amen that God has said come out of we are called out to come out of the system of man to come out of denominations to come out of religions so which religion are we which religion are you friends which what is our religion I'm asking you you don't know your religion sorry praise praise God somebody said we don't have I say I am not a member of any religion but I am a member of the body of Jesus to you who wanted me to be a member of our religion let me ask you what member which religion was Jesus a member of what about Paul what about Peter what about Silas all the are in the Bible they were a member of which religion their religion is my religion and their religion is the old time religion the one that was given in the beginning and I am a member of that religion give me that old time religion give me that old time religion give me that old time some people here are not members otherwi they would know the song of our religion give me that oh give me that well give me that oh is good enough for let me tell you what is going to be good enough for you the old religion what did it do in the beginning the old time religion did not believe in women pre if you a m of it whatever I say you say Amen the old time religion is the religion of the Bible he did not believe in women preachers he did not believe in meup he don't believe in that he did not believe in women cutting their hair the old time religion did not believe in denomination the old time religion did not believe in baby or infant baptism is it aen the time religion did not believe in following a man the old time religion pointed to Christ I said it pointed to Christ the time religion did not did not accept a man who was married more than once to be a pastor is that a man the old time religion preached Christ not money the old time religion pointed people to Heaven not to Hell the time religion they not believe in women wearing many skirs is it a man the old time religion believed in men being real men not wearing those things as if they power them inside the time religion believed in people being filled with the Holy Ghost the all time religion belied in people shouting people clapping their hands people dancing for the Lord the whole time religion amen was fire the time religion I said was fire not coldness the time religion did not believed in Holiness the religion believed in Holiness can I have an amen the old time religion did not believe in fornicators remaining Among Us the religion kicked out fornicators out of the church unless they repented the old time religion believed in righteousness can you say amen and we are a member of that old time [Music] religion Jesus was a part of it Peter was a part of it John was a part of it and I'm so glad I can say I am a member W hallelujah praise God the devil doesn't like that but we love it the old time religion believed in love a brother was a brother a sister was a sister are you hearing me the religion did not believe in hatred did not believe in division Church in in Corinth amen when the church Ephesus we Brothers Believers together members of one body no division in the body the time religion did not believe in men being Bishops over others in a way that they control other pastors the old time religion believed in every Church meaning local Fellowship being independent being Sovereign but their sovereignty was only under the word and the Holy Spirit so all the fellowships wherever they were they were preaching nothing out of the word they would only preach the word oh we are going back to our ABS we need to know our ABS we need to know what we stand for your amen should be better than that one Hallelujah there is only one body we become a part of it by a spiritual birth he says where we are born or free whether we are you know Jews or gentiles and you find in our generation you find a lot of issues a lot of problems listen to me people dividing themselves so this one is a church of this this one is a church of this one is for us we are for us we only here no no no this one is only no no this one is for children of nambi are you hearing me that's not the old time religion we were part of those tribes we were part of those but when we came to the Lord we were changed changed and we were made members of one body so once you are filled with the Holy Spirit you are part of it God does not have grandchildren he only has Sons and Daughters children are usually born by un experience not joining the family so we don't believe in this kind of thing that I I joined so I'm a member also no we don't we don't accept that you must be born into this family and this family you born into itat by an experience you are not born into it by shaking the pastor's hand you are you are not being born into it by being a a family member somewhere it doesn't matter whether you your father is the pastor are you hearing me it doesn't matter whether your uncle is the pastor it doesn't matter whether your father in-law whether your brother in-law you I don't care that doesn't make you member you must be born again by the same same experience that the first Believers have like on the day of Pentecost you must receive an experience you must meet God you must be changed amen the fire of the Holy Ghost must me your soul or else you are not a member you see and if you're not a member you are not going to the rapture we don't have things like you know me I was born like for me I was born in the Anglican Church what is your religion I am Anglican why because my father was Ang and his father was angry now today what do we have what's your religion I'm a message believer oh how when did you believe no I was born a Believer you hear many of them say like that I was born a believer One one of them told me oh I was a Believer even when I was in my mother's wom that's a lie of the devil you cannot believe in your mother's home you believe after hearing the gospel and accepting it so whether your father is a pastor or not or whether it's the arch Deacon or the bishop you have to have an experience that every member has heart you cannot say I'm a Believer by proxy or I'm a Believer by extension God does not have grandchildren God has children only Sons and [Music] Daughters tell your neighbor God has only Sons and Daughters no grandchildren we are all children of God I've even never had any someone inspired I am a grandchild of [Music] God now we say I am a child of God that's why everyone must have that experience praise God 1 Corinthians 12 for the body is not one member but many verse 14 verse 15 now if the food shall say because I am not the hand I am not of the body is it there a for not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were un ey where were the hearing if the all were hearing where were the smelling but now God has set the members every one of them in the body as it has pleased him and if they were all one M where we the where we the body but now are we but now are they many members yet but one body so listen friends I want you to listen carefully we cannot say that the only dvf family is the body anybody else that does not interpret things the way we interpret them is going to hell we cannot say that why we are only a member of the body and and even in the in the local Fellowship we have many members and every member is a member of the body and then you go from fellowship to Fellowship and every Fellowship is a member of the body is a member of the body but he has said now in the body there are also gifts and now we cannot be able to say that now one Fellowship is now the whole body no we can't say that there are different parts of the body praise God the church is the body the local church The Universal Church it begins with an individual you you are the church tell your neighbor you are the church now you are the church from you individual to a local body Fellowship from a now we are the body also meaning we are the church but now from us comes the UN all over the world they are scattered even here Ina there are many fellowships here and there right now I'm speaking only to days of the voice and then evening light but these are only two B two members of the body but then we have many other members and each Ministry is important each Fellowship is important because each Fellowship is a member and we need one another because we are only one little piece of the body you have seen here when we make meetings you know we need very many from other fellowships when they make meetings they they invite some of our people so some of you musicians you can never be able to say me only play for our church you don't even know what you're talking about your church is not only this one this is a fellowship of the church the church is big huh brother where is brother Prince you can I cannot tell you brother please song today no no me I only song in gu for my past who told you if you are a song leader in the body you a song leer in the home whole body of Christ if you Aon same thing if you are a m if you are doing media Department whever there is a meeting and you're invited you are part of that [Music] body we don't we should never have attitudes that is not our church this one is our church that is not our church those are bad attitudes there are for people who do not know who we are for me and my house as for me and my house we know one thing we are part of the body and we are not the only body but the body of Christ is universal the bride is comprised of the whole body not just a piece therefore there is no room for a p to feel as if they were the only body we are all part of one another praise God one time I was speaking to someone some years ago and he told me my pastor is the best pastor in the world I hope some of you don't feel that the only best person in the world is Jesus Christ all of us are just sent we are preachers of the Gospel and no one higher than the other and everyone has a peculiar gift and every gift is different and every gift is needed and every gift is important you cannot say this one now is better than the other one this one is better than the other one it's all right to appreciate your pastor but never appreciate your pastor over Jesus Christ because if your pastor is a man of God he's pointing it to Christ he's not pointing it to himself he's not pointing it to his Fellowship is pointing you to Christ and that's why I believe the enti message because this message did not point me to William BR did not point me to a church this message pointed me to Christ I now know Christ in a way I have never known him because of this message praise God I have a few more minutes listen no competition if you know you are a part of the body there won't be competition for importance some people have even noticed them sometimes in many churches some people when they realize that they have been used a lot or that they needed a lot or that they think they know something better than others and they not respect they feel they not respected enough they will walk away let me see now how they do without anybody whoever does that is because they don't know how it works just a little needed but you're not the only one that is needed everyone is needed you may not even be a minister preacher you may just be a church member sister Grace you come and sit there let me tell you by sitting there you are ministering to others we as a body need you there is no little one and big one and small one we are all important we are all needed we are all necessary so we all part of the body praise God and the eye We are continuing in 1 Corinthians 12:21 and the I cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble and necessary are you hearing me whatever if you feel you are a little piece of the body you need just like fellowships whether a church or we call them a church but they fellowships where Fellowship has 10 members or they in some Village somewhere they are needed here days of the voice we are needed some evening light you are needed someone told me one time why don't we remove all the other churches if we one body and we make one big one and we bring one man and make him our leader that's a denomination of spirit God does not work like that if if so why didn't he make the whole body one eye why did he make the whole body one hand and you see one hand moving and you that one is sister but what did God do he created many members one hand two hand many fingers another feet another feet the ears the nose the mouth the hair many members one body so every Church Fellowship is necessary and is needed and how do you want to how do you become part of one you just join whichever you feel you're comfortable with and be there steadfastly pay your tithe support with your presence encourage the Believers but with other fellowships when they have meetings go join them don't say what I receive from my church is enough for me no it is not what you receive from me is not enough for you go in other meetings join them join in with others fellowship with them that's what we believe Church praise the name of the Lord and even those who feel more feeble they are necessary some people say for me what do I do in the church I don't song I I don't sing I I don't play any instrum even if I go later at church I am not important you do not know what you're talking about you are necessary you member of the church a member of the body Hallelujah imagine if one morning you woke up and and your left feet said since I'm not the right feet I am not very necessary let the rest work I will work after 24 hours the whole body will suffer imagine a man walking in the morning the left food what is itanda refuse to work it is saying I am not needed I'm not necessary this how the body will be the body has refused what part of the body that's how you make the body sick when you do not play your part each of us is necessary each of us is needed each of us is important praise the name of the Lord sometimes you as a little member of the body may do things which nobody May ever know they may never talk about but you are necessary you were needed you have to come and bring your leak of fire together what you have to do after all I'm not an interpreter now let me not let me not tune the sound so that they will feel necessary you don't need to show your necessity by by doing that yes Play Your Part in the body play it with joy play it with love as being a part of the you see everything in the church you know we have curtains in the church clean many things that go on and we call it we never talk about it it is necessary and what the part you are playing is necessary just by coming to church necessary you you you you the body is moving when you say let me stay at home I'm not important and others begin competing praise God since I'm ministering to the zoom Saints our time is done but I'll continue with this the church needs this we need to know what it means to point to Christ and to be a member of the body of Jesus Christ there is more than we think it is and I pray that each of us will'll be able to realize our place in the body and and play it act it play it do it with rence so that the whole body can move as one body that will you pointing people to [Music] Christ but if you're a musician others you know even preachers in concluding let me just say this even sometimes preachers when he's not the one preaching I will not even say amen I even see very very far and I will watch and see then you don't hear Brother Martin is amen then there is something wrong but when is the one preaching I'm giving you guys an example because I know you are very good when he's the one preaching he will invite everybody he will send the links everywhere the one come and listen but brother do you do that when your pastor is preaching or when another brother is preaching I'm going to talk about it on Sunday compe in the body very bad Spirit we need to appreciate one another every part of the body is important that way we will all point to Christ and not to ourselves God bless you for now let us pray Lord Jesus I've not even gone halfway of what I wanted to say tonight but father what you knew that I would say and what these people could be able to take in as being sa tonight help each one of them Lord to appreciate their position and their
