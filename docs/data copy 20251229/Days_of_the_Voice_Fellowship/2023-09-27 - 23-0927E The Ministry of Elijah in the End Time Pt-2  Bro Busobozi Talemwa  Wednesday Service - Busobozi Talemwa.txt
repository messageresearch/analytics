Lord spoke to us in Jesus name amen hallelujah Bibles because I'm going to be speaking part two of what I spoke on on Sunday yeah [Music] and I'm also ministering to the Saints in evening like uh Circle so for their service this evening on Zoom services so I'll greet them in a moment um praise the Lord are you happy to be in the house of the Lord amen Amina David said I was happy when they said unto me let's go to the house of the Lord so tonight we are reading once again from Malachi chapter 4 verse 5. [Music] and then we will read other scriptures later on behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord [Music] so I send out greetings uh to evening light by Tabernacle um asked me to speak to the Saints on Zoom so the Saints are streaming this on Zoom I send you our regards in the name of Jesus Christ so we are speaking on the ministry of Elijah in the end times there is a lot to speak on this subject So within one hour you can imagine that uh I I would just be hinting on a few things here and there sometimes I have quotes to read and then I end up not reading them but we just asked that the Holy Spirit to lead us tonight we have received an Elijah Ministry in our time and this ministry has turned our hearts back to the Faith of Our Fathers and um but you notice that Elijah did not just oh will is not just coming in the end time the ministry of Elijah has really been there even before our time the ministry of Elijah has been in the in the Old Testament again and it was prophesied to come again in the end times the prophecy which I read here in the Book of Malachi chapter 4 is just a prophecy after the ministry of Elijah's existed twice [Music] because the first Ministry of Elijah is seen in the man himself Elijah and that was we will be able to look at it briefly today in the book of First Kings 18 shortly we shall read there but we also see that when Elijah left again that his ministry continued with another man called Elisha the anointing that was on the ministry of Elijah or the anointing which was upon Elijah came back in a double portion upon Elisha and Elisha's Ministry if you read your Bible you will find it has many similarities with the ministry of Elijah is because the ministry of Elisha was the continuation of the ministry of Elijah so now now after Elisha after Elijah and after Elisha now God through another Prophet Malachi she gives a prophecy he says behold I'll send you a lady the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord so in other words the ministry of Elijah is in continuity here oh where is now you have to understand that the man Elijah Was Won and he did not die he went to heaven alive again and you know but his spirit let me put it this way the spirit of God which was working upon Him continued working yes if you see if you you start the prophets you can study Daniel you can study Isaiah you can study you know Ezekiel and many other prophets you will notice that their Ministry was a bit varying ways for example the ministry of uh of Moses was that kind that would turn water into blood [Music] you know it was sent to force from all the other prophets we find you know love they wanted to use the ministry again he uses it for a walk of restoration so I want us to look at First Kings 18. and we will begin from verse 19. praise the Lord now there are quite very many verses but uh we will try and see how much we can read for you now there are for send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's table so I have sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together and to Mount Carmel we are reading from verse 19 chapter 18. um and Elijah came unto uh better please and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long hold ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if Baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word then said Elijah unto the people I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord but bal's prophets are 450 men um let them better forgive us two blocks and let them choose one block for themselves and cut in pieces and lay it on the wood and put no fire under and I will dress the other Bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under and call ye on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and the god that hazareth by fire let him be God and all the people answered and said it is well spoken calling me cut it but way into Billy bear was interim vegetables and Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal choose you uh one block for yourselves and dress it first for year for ye and many and call on the name of your Gods put no fire under and they took the Bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon saying oh Baal hear us but there was no voice no any that sound answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made and it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a God either he's stalking or he's pursuing or he's in a journey open Adventure he's sleepeth and and must be awake foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and license till the blood gushed out upon them and it came to pass when they when the when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer no any that regarded foreign [Music] praise the name of the Lord now Saints I want you to uh uh to to follow me closely here sometimes you think that these things we've gone through it many times and you know you already know them but I know that it's the word of God is always closely so that you can be able to understand you see this sounds like a very good story foreign [Music] this was a time when Israel had backslidden Elijah came at the time when Israel was back Sweden and the glory of God had departed from Israel so King I have married from the among the heathens in shortly we are going to look at that mall but now you know Jezebel started fighting against fighting against Elijah and maybe I'm thinking for a little more Foundation I should give you a little more scriptures here for you to look at um uh I've not finished the reading in uh First Kings 18 Simmons similarities but if I don't go back please you could note it down and then read it later never said to you one day and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jehovah I'm the son of neighborhood that it took to wife Jezebel the daughter of ethbal King of the disadonians and went and served Baal and worshiped him foreign [Music] thing if you work in it anymore and you know we can know that by seeing the church the the church natural Israel is the church and we've seen that Israel God dealt with Israel as a as a nation as a group deals with uh with uh with the Gentiles as individuals everything that happens to Israel as a church as a nation it happens to us Gentiles as individuals while I look at Israel as a nation I wanted to examine your own personal life as an individual so now everything begins with before God sends Elijah things be you know the Bible says you know he had seen it as a light thing as a simple thing [Music] you walk in the sins of the son of deep of neighbors but now before we look at jeroboam I want you to look at them but before you look at him I want you to look at Solomon before we look at Solomon I wanted to look at David the whole thing begins David the Bible says he was a man after God his own heart [Music] whatever God said David said amen I believe it David walked in the will of God indeed what God desires yes David was not a perfect man just like every individual even you who is listening to me today you are not a perfect man foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] you know God told David well you know I love you but you have too much blood on your hands I won't allow you to build a temple foreign [Music] [Music] amen oh fathers how many fathers do we have all you fathers all your fathers on Zoom today amen all of you hearing me for your father if you have children claim every one of them and you put them under the turkey none of them can be lost if you believe that with all your heart amen because the promise of God is unto you with your children that's the promise of God that happens also among the Gentiles if it happened to the to the Jews and so then Solomon built a temple but you see along the way Solomon most of these women he married them because of political alliances and he thought that he will it will help him to be a strong King [Music] if God has called you he has anointed you to be what you are you do not need to go into any alliance with anybody you can accomplish the purpose of God for your life without any Alliance and many times these alliances trouble with God praise the name of the Lord is here that then so when he grew old his women they started to you know bring him closer to the to their God and they started building artists the same man who built the altar of the Lord began to build the altars of this other God because of that you know he came down when Solomon was about to die he comes down to it to one of the prophets and he told him I'd like you to go and prophesy not to the son of the of the Kings but to one of the servants prophesy to him and say praise God that God is going to reap the kingdom into two the cartoon and he's going to give you ten tribes and he will he will remain in Jerusalem because of my servant David the city of God could not be taken away from Death from the lineage of David because of David not because of Solomon the way you serve God can end up blessing your children there are certain things you are fighting am I preaching to someone here there's certain things you're fighting in your life listen listen those things that we are fighting if you don't overcome them it will be passed down to your children [Music] [Music] it must die with me but the problem here Solomon Suleiman received and he reaped the blessings of his father [Music] but he was not able to keep them he went and served other gods and when that happened God was not happy with him he said I'm going to take the kingdom and I will give the biggest part to the servant of Solomon so that he can rule as he wishes God is God that's what he desires listen so now um if you can go with me to the book of First Kings chapter 11. let us see this prophecy quickly now verses 29. and it came to pass at that time when went out to Jerusalem that the prophet ahija the children found him in the way and he had cried himself with a new gamut and they too were alone in the field and I he just called the new garment that wasn't him and he rent it in 12 pieces and he said to jeroboam take the ten that were the pieces for thus say the Lord for God the god of Israel behold I I will reign the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and I will give you ten tribes but he but he shall have one tribe for my servant David is sick and for Jerusalem's sake the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel because that they have forsaken me and I have worshiped and have worshiped asterisk and the goddess of the zidonians the god of the moabites and Miracle the god of the children of Ammon and have not worked in my ways to do that which is in right in my eyes and to keep my status and my judgments as did David his father how bait I will not take the whole Kingdom out of his hand and I will make him Prince all the days of his life for David my servant is sick whom I chose because he kept my Commandments and my statutes but I will take the kingdom out of his son his hand and I will give it unto thee even ten tribes and unto his son will I give one tribe that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem the city which I have chosen to me to put my name there I will take thee and thou shalt Reign according to all that thy soul desireth and shall be king over Israel and it shall be if thou Wilt how can unto listen listen to this part now and it shall be verse 38 and it shall be if thou Wilt hecken unto all that I command thee and he will walk in my ways and do that which is written my sight to keep my statues and my Commandments as David my servant did that I will be with you and build the assure house as a build for David and I will give Israel unto you oh my God and praise God I wanted to hear this you know this is a powerful promise you know God was you know if there is something that God loves someone who will stay with the world someone who who the ability to stand with the world in the face of anything in the face of every Temptations [Music] It's a holy city but you see because of Solomon now Solomon carries the the legacy of his father because he went to other gods [Music] God was not happy with him now send Prophet ahija to go and prophesy to a servant called Jeremiah was only a servant someone who did not even have any claim on on royalty someone would never dreamed of being a king someone who never thought you will never be anything that is the same way God blesses the Gentiles [Music] God keeps you an Everlasting Covenant we have a big promise here it can be accomplished it will be accomplished there is a condition God gives a condition [Music] he says yes you know he had a new government yeah and it begins taking your new suit and cutting it into 10 pieces some of you can box him but as long as it is praise God come here that's why people don't believe in the way the Holy Spirit acts when it comes because people shout and dance they feel offended the holy spirit is not emotion but the holy spirit is emotional whenever he moves on somebody who does things in an emotional way you see but for for Solomon they addressed Suleiman One Tribe will be given him again the way which catch him and he will remain with a City Jerusalem because that one was chosen city of God and because of David my servant it will remain in his language I want to say this God does not remember does not forget God always remembers every promise he makes when he made a promise to David he did not forget it has God given you any promise he cannot forget the promises Hallelujah that he has met to his beloved I'll give One Tribe to him because uh I I am because of David myself so God remembers the son of solomona not because of Solomon but because of David God will remember your children's children because of you if the Lord Jesus the decisions God will remember your children his children because of you know because of your stance because of your good decisions we remember the generations that's a powerful prophecy praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah and it says and it shall be yeah and then he says here and I will thank you and you will reign and forget according to all that your soul desires and you will be king over Israeli when you are given a promise you God gives you Liberty the Bible says where the spirit of God is hallelujah amen when God gives us all the Redemptive promises in the land cartoons it's up to you to go from glory to glory it's up to you to buy more clothes it is up to you the promise has already been given and you are going to take alive so it's up to you to enjoy it to the fullest as long as we can start you stay within the world that is the only thing that God requires of you stay within the world stay within the world Amina so you tell us God is giving you 10. 10 tribes the way you desire according to the desire of your house my goodness oh Hallelujah according to the desires I mean when God gives you a blessing you are not going to keep going back to him shall I now do this if he has given you a blessing it is yours to enjoy the way you desire amen and now he fell into things and and God told him you will rule according to the desire of your heart and you will be king over Israeli and it shall be if you will hecken unto all that I command you Bollywood day that is the requirement of God if you can do all the words then I will walk in your in my and walk in my ways rather no time and they do that which is right in my sight no correct not what is right in yourself but what is Right In God is sight is the word of God hallelujah I believe every day you desire to know what is the will of God what I'm doing what does the word say about it she's God okay with it that this one is our guiding pillar this one is our road map the Bible is our roadmaps the Bible leads us if you do anything out of the world out of the message of our days foreign [Music] as long as you keep way and working my ways and you do that which is right in my side I mean and working my ways to keep my status and my Commandments as David my servant that I will be with you that I will be with you Hallelujah man we have a promise oh my when I read this I'm not reading this I'm reading about myself when somebody knows God said I'll be with you you ought to believe it for yourself as an individual he says I if you do this then I will be with it he didn't say if you will feel me but he said I will be with you if you walk in my way if you keep my word I will be with you and about upon this election I can now say like amen I will fear no evil regardless of the situation around me I know the Lord is with me foreign [Music] Nuevo [Music] an everlasting Kingdom that's what it means as I build for David my goodness God was ready to give it to Jeremiah [Applause] if only camera house and I will give Israel today what a promise this is the promise some promise we have God is promising Hallelujah God is promising like you promised David to walk with you aiming to be with you to give his right to you what is Israel Israel means a place with God that means god is promising amen that you will be a royal priesthood God is promising you will not be a common noun I will make you Royal God is will accept to stand when Nina [Applause] um he wanted to kill him no one can kill you I mean you can't die before you attacked if you have a prophecy of God over here determine Brothers there will be a bride in every nation and the Book of Revelation says there will be overcome in every generation that is a prophecy on my head I cannot die until I overcome I cannot perish if you're a bride of Christ God can't even allow you to die until you you overcome if you die it should be gained for you because you just wake up for the Rapture so in other words foreign foreign foreign [Music] now Katie and went to Egypt and he healed himself and it was quiet the whole time King Solomon hunted for him and he couldn't find it even if your seat don't go in a bar tomorrow afternoon don't go into bad things stay in the right way saying the right things the reason why God told you that you are who you are and you know who you are because he has given it to you as a way for you to keep yourself away from other things [Music] kept himself in Egypt and now Solomon died King Solomon died Hey listen to me when King Solomon died was you know now Gathering the people to be crowned as a kid he said it is time for me to go and possess my prophecy my promise you have to receive a revelation this time I mean those times ABC radio of living and wallowing in in sin those times of living in the world you have to have a revelation it is time for me right now to go and claim my pleasure in the word of prophecies amen that's why we are here we have come to Grace our position so we have faith in the word of prophet which cannot failure quickly with all the other people so they came and brought a proposition to the king they said foreign [Music] foreign don't be very strict and then let me also go to my little buddies those ones we went we used to go out in the world you know to do this you know when you're Consulting if you consult from everything on anybody you're going to be confused I I preached to you on one time on icons I'm not done with it I'll go back I canceled this you see if you you're going to get the council God has a cancer foreign [Music] foreign because the the anger management if you speak that way they would think you are strong so the moment he said so it has an opportunity he gathered the people let's go home yes of 10 tribes I mean Hallelujah so the mystics of Israel the unbelief of Israel Israeli what happened God used it so that the gentle Church the Bible in Romans 11 it says Amina because they were blinded we can see until when until the fullness of the gentles until the last age [Music] [Music] that's the question ask the question Lucas First Kings chapter 14. [Music] we'll read just about four four verses from there God tell jeroboam that saith the Lord God of Israel for as much as I exalted thee from among the people and met the prince Over My People Israel and rent the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to thee and yet thou Hast not been as my servant David who kept my Commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in my eyes but has done evil evil you have done if above all that is before thee for thou has gone and made thee other gods and Mountain images to provoke me to anger and you have cast me behind your back verify hold I will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam and I will cut off jeroboam hymn that pisses against the war and him that is shot happened and left in Israel and I will take away the remnant of the House of jeroboam as a man taketh away down till it be all gone him that died of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and him that died in the Us in the shall the fowls of the air eat for the Lord has spoken it this is everything that comes to anybody that does not walk in the world one Behavior the promises of God are sure the ways of God are right and his reward is always on point but to those who work according to his ways are you hearing me [Music] sins could not help let him be blessed is and the Bible says he provoked God's anger because he cast God behind him let me tell you life and death in your hands when God gives you his work his word is going to give you everything life yes but remember that is not only the promise of God it is also your way of Behaving around God's promise that is when God gives his promise his promises is it easy no it is not but he he he he failed today you think because he didn't want to go to but in his understanding thank God for brother he preached a message he was maybe telling him you have to marry these women so that you can keep the kingdom let me tell you we are not going to get the kingdom by Alliance you find even the churches they are doing what they call you know Federation of churches to come together so they can get money from the government and I have someone saying even messages
