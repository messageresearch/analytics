[Music] foreign for when God gave so when God made promise to Abraham because you could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing our blessed thee and multiplying I'll multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained a promise for men verily swear by the great by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them and end of all Strife where in God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of the promise the immutability of his cancer confirmed it by an earth that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the Veil and and which entereth into that within the veil whether the Forerunner is for for us entered even Jesus Medan high priest for a Forever After the order of Melchizedek Buffet amen we ask that the presence of God will just come be pleased with our fellowship tonight you know that the hearts desire of your children and even those that would stream this service and that your word is impossible for it to failure and it is also unchanging when you gave it once it is now may you come and dwell in the presence of your children let words be spoken from your throne that will encourage them first moment now to you take me out of the way Lord you speak to them in Jesus name amen amen amen please be seated I'm speaking to you I'm still continuing on our subject which we spoke on last the message of the hour I'm speaking on the anchor praise the name of the Lord amen Amina if you have a neighbor near you tell them the anchor the anchor in Anger now this is a very important thing because I believe that in every age God has given an anchor the people of that age and without an anchor the Sheep is in trouble is a tool lowered into the bottom of water to keep the sheep in its place [Music] this is especially during a bad weather you know bad weather conditions or during a storm or maybe a typhoon and so the anchor secures those aboard the ship [Music] the ship does not sink it's usually a chain and this chain you know you know it is thrown into the water and it goes all the way to the bottom of the water body let us say maybe it is [Music] and so the anchor is very important on a boat or on a ship rather and without it the sale is very dangerous and so tonight I want us to talk about the Anchorage and I want to talk about this in connection with the message that we have received in this generation when the boat there is a lot of bad weather conditions and you know you see the bot of life our life is almost in danger and you see that has been the case in every generation people have been in danger in danger of death in danger of losing it and the only [Music] that our life is not secure without [Applause] I was reading something and there is this one Reverend Johnson he said something very stunning for me I thought I should quote it for you you know [Music] figuratively of the Christian's confidence having security of Hope in Christ [Music] this symbolizes [Music] steady fastness and stability so as a sheep itself when at an anchor so are we is a symbol of us being grounded in Christ when we experience crisis chaotic conditions are you hearing me disturbing difficulties all these things in our lives when we experience them we have an anchor now when when all these waves and the storms of life when they come to eat if you [Applause] but the lives will not be lost because I am telling you there is nothing in this life that can help us if we don't have this anchors there are times when you're rich in life and you are so disappointed or depressed [Music] when you don't have a meaning to life [Music] when you try to chase after things and it seems it is not working out when you are working on something and it is not progressing when you ask for things and it seems God is not answering you and when you find yourself in a place when it seems you are all by yourself if you were disappointed let me tell you you need an anchor [Applause] We Trust in our church [Applause] Hallelujah I want foreign because they wanted to find other solutions to their problems I want to read you this Hebrews this scripture in in the Amplified version of the Bible yes it says for when God made the promise to Abraham yes by himself since he had no one Greater by whom to swear saying I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply you Gaga and so having patiently waited [Music] he realized the promise [Music] meaning yes in the miraculous birth of Isaac as a pledge of what was to come from God yes by one greater than themselves elves and with them in all disputes the Earth serves as confirmation of what has been said and is an end of that dispute [Music] even these days when someone is borrowing money they tell them to bring a guarantee one greater than you oh um when you fail to pay that they will be the one to be answerable yeah and so he says God in his desire to show to The Heirs of the promise the unchangeable nature of his purpose so that by the two unchangeable things I won't already into everybody they are true unchangeable things one is his promise God gave the promise and he swear by himself because there is no greater than him so he gave the promise and these are the true unchangeable things by these two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie we who have fled to him for Refuge we will have strong encouragement and the that the waves May blow Cartier and everything will come at this but as long as the anchor holds the sailors are hopefuls this is not even Faith they have something they know because I have something I have where I am holding and he says so that we can hold tightly to the Hope set before us and he says this hope I can assuming you know this confident assurance [Music] [Music] foreign Hallelujah [Applause] our prophet in the message Jehovah Jireh says like in the North Star is the typos to every shipmaster the campus points him only to that North Star yes the word is every Christian's North Stars if you are lost and the Holy Spirit is what points you to um it won't point to nothing else and so forth and Christianity mixed up in it whatever it may be it's like the world shifting [Music] it changes those stars but it cannot change that you neither can anything change the word of God and he says [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] if that happens your life is upside down but if you put your heart if you anchor it in the word of God oh friend the word of God never changes time is filled with swift transitions [Music] you find even many people in the churches they put all their hope in their pastors some they even worship their pastors when something happens to the past all of them a few of them remain Believers if you put your anchor in the world it doesn't matter what changes my heart in the word of God there is one [Music] that actually you are left alone [Music] thank God for the anchors Hallelujah [Applause] yeah blessed our anchor there let me tell you young people there are many things you can put your life and you say as long as I study no guy must say we're not summer I am sure I will have money I'm sure life will be well soon but I am I here to disappoint you yes oh that is change in just a moment in just a moment you can actually study yeah you might study your studies you may get a job and you get fired and you get fired and they get fired until many have become depressed and many have blamed God but this the reason was simple they put their anchor in the wrong things give your heart all your hope in God they say don't always put your eggs in one basket but as long as this is concerned put all your eggs Mina proving his word he says and I wanted you to be sure to see that the anchor that we have we are not anchored by a church we are Anchored In Christ you see he is the only way he is the only place of safety change the only place that God ever put his name and God said he would meet the people in the place he chose to put his name again but in the gate that he chose and in that place and there only and we find out that God never put his name anywhere else but in his son Jesus if our anchor is in Christ he called it an assurance this hope is confident Assurance of the Soul amen what Assurance if we are Anchored In Christ everything is sorted if you are Anchored In Christ please provide your needs in Christ he will take away your problems he will hold you there he will make sure they don't destroy it even some of you who are Anchored In Christ you can give a testimony there are things that came you were almost sure it was going to destroy your life [Applause] yeah he was still standing together what is that the alcohol can you say it on your mouth the uncle oh hallelujah amen and because of that I said keep trusting in Jesus you remember those times when you cried and cried and cried when you prayed and you thought God can't even hear yourself God Gave You Grace because The Anchor Holds Hallelujah that's why we are throwing our anchor in Christ I don't fear no windows to run away from the ship foreign because they're throwing their anchors but Brothers these storms I wanted to see here in the book of Acts chapter 27. was it happened to be at Sea um and there was a very big way a typhoon [Music] and it was with soldiers and a centurion and and it's long story but I just read a little portion of it I'm just reading out of verses 23 to 26. and I'll give you the background support here says he says for this very night an angel of the Lord to whom I belong [Music] God has given you the lives of all those who are sailing with you so keep up your courage man for I believe God and have complete and have complete confidence in him that it will turn out exactly as I have been told but we must run the Sheep are ground on some islands [Music] now the background of the story is that for about 14 days Paul and those on the ship had been battered by a big storm and for 11 days they were in total darkness and they were in suspense [Music] you know maybe none of us has ever been at Sea obviously so we may not relate from reading this scripture here it shows us that the the they were in this big ship and it was going a certain direction and when this storm Cameo it blew them so they couldn't resist it so they let themselves go as God the way it is taking them but they have thrown the anchor and so the first anchor that thrown it down and so they were on the on the board and it was just the storm was just taking them they reached a place where they were in suspense completely hopeless the place where they were was dark for 11 days 11 days one two three four five six seven eleven days [Music] we just don't know when death is I said but now yeah the anchor had been cast The Anchor was holding praise the name of the Lord and that's the only thing that encouraged encourages [Music] the anchor was holding while all this was going on do you know suspense when you don't know what is coming next foreign [Music] [Applause] I don't want you to be afraid he said stop in the amplifier he says stop being afraid Bible yes tell your neighbors stop being afraid brother some stopping Africa stop being afraid Hallelujah stop being afraid then you spoke to him the reason why he says stop being afraid because there is some good news that was some good news he said stop being afraid you know you must stand before Caesar stop being afraid you know you must stand before the devil and defeat him um [Applause] to stand for a testimony the lives of all those they died God has given all of them I don't know whether you're getting some deeper definition and they will come to him he would say oh yes I'm the one that you preached to indeed engineer let me tell you we are going to be there together you behind our message foreign [Applause] you are not going to die that is the Promise by these two impossible oh my God God cannot lie we have a promise foreign do you know you can you you you you can plead for your children foreign Paul confidence in him that it will turn out even as exactly as I have been told foreign you know many times we think it's only the anchor the anchor that works but the anchor has a chain on it this chain which is connected to the Anchorage I said the chain is also Christo balances depending on what you're going through you know God katonda will give you more grace the Bible says he giveth more grace what is that it gives more power he gives his presence and this is and it cannot failure is immutable and as I'm approaching to congratulations is when I look and see the nation is broke I see politics I see the homes broke I see the church broke there is just nothing else can mend it that's all because they have not nothing else the morals of the nation is the political parties you are saying what is happening recently you know if they see even within themselves they're fighting and then another party they're fighting with another party and the police so much in our politics they are broke and some great fellow in in England not long ago he said well democracy was all sales and no anchor um he was saying that it is democracy is all sales and no anger government democracy he's not talking well about it he's saying it's just sales without an anchor okay that said they would have there would come a time that they would be on us on soapboxes electioneering he says well that's true he says but he didn't think of his own beloved House of Lords meaning in England how it was also a lot of sales and no anchor too it will be aware also you see this is um uh someone from England trying to say that the democracy was not good and them in England they're better off but brother is trying to prove a point here that all politics is all sales and every Kingdom of this world will be brought to Pieces Jesus Christ will rule and Reign yes even our schools where Christians will fear to take their children to such schools because the whole thing is broken the death was taken over what is happening the world systems are crumbling is a Christian should put their anchor in Christ My Hope Is building nothing less than Jesus is blood and righteousness All Around My Soul gives way he is Christian foreign I always say those who will be left the ones that will will feel the most pain will be those who are going in the message foreign foreign yeah but all hope will be gone don't find your place yourself in that place you just a Believer by name but not by life let this message be in your life this message should be the anchor of your life you should be determined actually I'm finishing he says he says don't be defeated you can't be defeated you are children of God God promise the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit he wants to give it to you tonight and he says now don't tell him how you want to get it tell him you want it no matter how it comes some people say oh I want to receive the Holy Spirit but I don't want to shout oh I want to receive the holy spirit in you know you know in a very compost way don't tell him how you want it no matter how it comes what was that yeah tell me you want it I want something to Anchor your heart to Anchor it away until all doubts and fears will pass of heaven will ring through your soul God will take care of the rest of it you just ask him to give you the baptism of the horse [Music] foreign Lord we see the world we know it is passing away and all the elements all the things it's passing away where can we bless our anchors We cannot put it on things the twins they come up into that are sinking a bitter we want to place our anchor on a rock a solid rocket Lord we believe you are that Solid Rock when you have helped us to place our anchor

everything is done we know that we have that life in us that it will take us through every storm help the young people Lord especially that they will realize all these things might be good to the eyes
