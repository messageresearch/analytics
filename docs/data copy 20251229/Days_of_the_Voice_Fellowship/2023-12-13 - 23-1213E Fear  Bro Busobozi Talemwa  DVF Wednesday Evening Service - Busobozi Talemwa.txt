the website you can be able to find so uh we have our the sched out praise the Lord amen okay I want to see where we beginning at so today is the 13th on 15th which is uh which is uh going to be a Friday I would like to let you know that we are going to teach we're going to be teaching on communion and foot washing we've not done we've not done that yet and our fellowship is 2 years old so we've been lacking in that area so and many of the young people especially those ones who just came into the message recently don't really know what foot washing is communion they might know because even in the religious churches they do [Music] communion but as much as they don't do it certainly according to the how we were told to do it in the Bible would like to teach on communion Friday I'm going to be teaching on that so I I'm requesting you to come to come on time it will be an evening service just like the one today will be beginning at 5:00 p.m. to 7 p.m. uh so then this Sunday Sunday no I've been asked by uh uh the Tom to go and Minister for them he told me quite some time ago but I was praying about it and waiting upon see how God will lead me and so I just called him this um this afternoon and confirmed to him that would be coming so on Sunday this coming Sunday brother martin will be taking the service here and we believe that God will visit both here and in an as well so I'm asking that you remember both services in prayer amen uh then also next Wednesday today Wednesday so next Wednesday we will not have a normal Service as usual we shall be having I was going to call it a minister service but I think let it be a man's service service yeah so if you know you a man come and attend that meeting I want to talk things Ministry and so it will be a normal service for for the men for the brothers things that I have on my heart to share with you that is next next next Wednesday for our channel so those of you who will not be coming here we will put something for you on online so you can be able to have a service then um on on on the next Friday next week that is Friday next week yeah um I'm traveling to Kenya you know I've told you that we were invited by Pastor BTA to go and speak at his meetings in Western Kya [Music] so we will be going there on 22nd the Lord willing for the first time I'm Desiring to travel with my family I've never taken them on that trip it's been many years uh my family crossed borders uh since Ethiopia so we trust that it will be refreshing time so they will be having meetings there on Friday Saturday Sunday Monday up to Tuesday now some of you think that because it is Kenya it is very far but is really near it is just here in the in the east of Uganda after after the Border in you just drive about 1 Hour 1 hour and a half and from here to the B of it is about 3 hourss how long does it take to reacha 5 hours over five hours so it's like a journey it's very close all you need to have is a national ID and you get a bus ticket and you can get there if you want to be a part of those meetings was told of I think one other family that wants to come so we'll see be um also then on7th which will be the last week of December that Wednesday we are going to have Pastor chak Patrick is a pastor from Zimbabwe he's coming to dvf here to minister to us so so it will be a good time remember to pray for that

this evening uh I've also been requested to speak to evening light bright uh fellowship and so they are going to be streaming this service on their Zoom and so I send our greetings to the Saints at evening light Bri may the Lord bless each of you and Grant the desires of your heart shall we please turn to First John vers 4 chapter 4 ver 17 rather amen we read from 17 to 19 as you know whenever we are speaking to the Saints on Zoom we always have but one hour and so uh you always try to catch me quickly so I don't have to take a long time uh laying a a big Foundation you can do that if you focus right and then the Lord will bless you so we're reading from verse 17 here in is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear has torment he that fear is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved [Music] us [Music] amen amen amen you may be seated uh for a while now my mind has been going around the subject of love and so today I did not know what exactly I was going to speak on but then I had that fear and so I'm going to speak on fear this evening fear tell your neighbor fear even by speaking that word fear you already are fearing so you don't know what a might fear and so there are two categories of fear in the Bible the first category of fear is the fear of the Lord and the second category of fear is the spirit of fear now the fear of the Lord is not necessarily like fearing something bad but it means to respect God it means to have a reverence for his power and His [Music] glory and you also respect you have you respect or you have respect for his anger and for his [Music] wrath um it could also mean to know God is God to know him as God and to know him as Supreme you know that is having the fear of the Lord to consider him in all things as first priority the reason why the people in the world have no fear of the Lord it's because they do not take God or they don't they don't know God as God and so they have no fear of the Lord and that's why they sin but you cannot sin he that is Born Again cannot see not because he's fearing the people but because he's fearing God what brings that distinction between between a and a nonbeliever is that a nonbeliever or a make believer or or a fake believer not will will will not do certain things in in in certain places because they fear man or they fear to be seen or they fear to be known that they will not that they can do such a thing and so they will not fear to tell a lie they will not fear to tell a lie because to them there's nothing about it they will tell you they will ask them what is it that you are doing it's nothing because to them it's nothing much but a child of God you have the fear of the Lord in you you will fear and you will tremble because you consider God first in all things that you do you don't know him as just you know some God somewhere but you know him as God as Supreme in your life some people they even say he's a god of white people no I was going about to take a subject probably in the future I'll take a subject on that white people most of the white the majority of the white people have left God many of them no longer have the fear of the Lord and and we see that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom that's what the Bible says Every Nation on Earth that has prospered you go back in history and study you will find that that Nation had the fear of the Lord every family that has prospered you will find that the the father of that family raised or the mother raised the children on the basis of the fear of the Lord you even find out that the father of Barack Obama was a Muslim and if Barack Obama was raised by his father in Kenya he would never have got to that place of power and influence but he reached that he attained that because his mother raised him up on the B of the fear of the Lord and so he he he was able to get to a place of power and influence because he re he had the reverence for God the scripture continues on a good understanding have all they that do his Commandments his praise endure forever so we notice that the fear of the Lord has good benefits it is the beginning of wisdom it's the beginning of knowledge is the beginning or it brings good understanding it leads to good life and to real life you know the fear of the Lord brings rest and peace to your soul it brings contentment listen it brings satisfaction Proverbs 17 it says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge just like in Psalms triple1 10 it's the beginning of knowledge but then he says but fools despise wisdom and instruction so the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom but but the fools despise wisdom meaning if you you despise wisdom you will not fear the lord and you are a fool that's the conclusion of the whole matter but I don't want to be a fool I want to be wise I want to be with good understanding he says but fools despise wisdom and instruction Proverbs 14:16 says a wise man fearth and depart from evil but the fool he raes and is confident even when the word of God is preached you will find that some people are fools that they are confident in their sin they confident in their LIF style and they are not willing to live that lifestyle because they fools but he says a wise man fearless and departed from Evil so what is that kind of fear that is the fear of the Lord and in Proverbs 14:15 it says simple believeth every the simple believeth every word but The Prudent man look well to his going a wise man fear and depart from evil but the fool raes and is confident he keeps on repeating these words now why wouldn't why wouldn't uh a man want to have wisdom why wouldn't he want to follow instruction because they are fool and the scripture then says a fool has said in his heart there is no God but I trust you that are listening to me this evening you believe there is a God in heaven and you don't believe only that there is a God in heaven but you believe that he is the only God absolute and is the master of of your life and is the ultimate and absolute and that he the fearing him is the beginning of all wisdom and fearing him brings good understanding listen here in Proverbs 14:26 he says in the fear of the Lord is strong confidence and his children shall have a place of [Music] Refuge the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life to depart from the snake SNES of death meaning if you fear the lord you will not come into the snares of the the devil lays snares in the ways of every believer in whichever area of Life the devil will try to ensnare you the devil will try to snare me he will try to snare you but then what did he say here he says the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of [Music] Life and he says to depart from it his snars of death and that's why brother sister we should never depart from the fear of the Lord it is the fear of the Lord that will bring us to repentance it is the fear of the Lord that will will keep us within the context of the word if it wasn't for that that is in our hearts many of us would have been in the world many of us many of you listening to me tonight we would have been in the world we have the power to do the things the world does but because of the fear of the Lord is not something you make up it is something that amen God Ls up in your soul amen he just kind of gives you that fear I've heard and I've seen and spoken to many Believers told me I was on the brink of going into sin but somehow at that moment fear came over me and I couldn't go through with it what was that it was the fear of the Lord what does it do he say it is a Fountain of Life Proverbs 19:23 the fear of the Lord tendeth to life and he that has it shall abide satisfied tell your neighbor you will be satisfied if you have the fear of the Lord he shall not be visisted with evil if you fear the lord evil shall not come in your house evil shall not come in your day shall not come where may try to come but it cannot abide in there place in a house in an individual that has the fear of the Lord praise the name of the Lord this the fear of the Lord that called David to repentance was a man he was King he feared nobody like all Kings who become fools for thinking that because they are Kings they there's nobody above them we have a record of them in the scriptures also in history kings that have not feared God and God brought them down but we find that all kings that feared God God loved them God gave them long life God blessed them because of the fear of the Lord it brought them down to repentance each time they sin I remember when David sinned David committed immorality and murder and when this happened in his life you know and the prophet of God came and gave a prophecy and he told him what he had done the fear of the Lord came upon him and he faed a war and began crying to the Lord and we know he said God against you and you only have I seen what a king this was a man that knew that nobody in Israel was above him but there is something he heard and it was called the fear of the Lord the fear of the Lord took him away from God loved David and God blessed David and God told David I'll give you an everlasting house I give you an everlasting Kingdom and David was was blessed all through and yet when his son came Solomon he did not fear the lord after building the Temple after doing everything he did later on he builds houses of other gods and because he didn't fear God by doing that God removed him and he put his servant to be a king brethren we should fear God our God is a living God the B says a consuming fire Praise In The Name Of and but then tonight I don't want to speak and dwell so much on the fear of the Lord I want to speak on the spirit of fear somehow I want to dwell on that for the remaining minute and this is the spirit of fear that the Bible is speaking of in the book of First John he says here in is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment brother you have to rectify my sound I cannot hear myself well that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world and then he says there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear tell your neighbor perfect love out fear in the message expectation the prophet says this now fear has no valuation in [Music] it n whatsoever is perfectly endless it doesn't it it hasn't got one thing good about it if it because it says if I was to be a to be short in the [Music] morning I was if I was going to be short in the morning what good would it be to have fear what good would it do to me you say well what good would would Faith do to you Faith could deliver me but fear won't help me a bit you just get yourself all worked up and more nervous than ever when it comes time for the gun to fire by the time they bring a gun on your head you've already wasted yourself you already look so bad you you've already swe out swe it out you are so nervous your heart is bumping you've exed on yourself because of fear but he says if I was going to be executed in the morning what good does it have for me to fear fear has no valuation in whatever it is perfectly endless it doesn't it doesn't it hasn't got one thing about it so you say well what about faith what does faith do to you and says faith could deliver me faith will deliver you but fear won't help me a bit you just get yourself all wed up and more nervous and then when the time comes to fire you are so nervous she says let's have Fai Faith could deliver me doesn't but if it doesn't what good would fear do anyhow I Thought I Loved this qu so much Faith could deliver me but if it doesn't what good would fear do any so he said just stay right with faith hold to him take God's promise with God we've had a lot of people in the Bible here our examples who have had no fear absolutely whatever we can talk about a man like like Daniel when they told when a law was passed Daniel knew it was targeting him because he was worshiping God and and the law was passed that no one should worship any other God and so when Daniel heard it he even went and opened the windows he said so you don't want me to pray I will pray and I will open the windows so you can see me praying here is a man who had no fear brother sister when you are faced with adversity when you're faced with trouble face it like a man or woman of God have no fear to what the devil can do to you stand boldly before fear I will even open my windows because the God I serve can deliver me even if he doesn't believe me what good is it for me to fear I will not fear and he opened the windows and and they saw him praying so they quickly went to the king they sent A man is pray said which man one of yours here Daniel he said are you sure he said yes so they brought him said Dan if it was you would you have you been praying they did not actually said the truth because yeah I was likeing but exactly that is fear but Daniel said yes do what you will I have no fear why because I have the word of God I'm standing right on the Promises of God he knew that the prayer that David had prayed that when they would look to this Temple no matter where they are you would deliver them and he was praying looking towards the temple he was looking towards the promise not towards fear look beyond your fear I say look beyond your fear and see the promises of God they will shortly come to pass and right at that moment you know they said now you have to be thrown to the lion is den oh my good Lord if it was you maybe you would begin immediately shaking after all you're going to be thrown in the light and you wouldn't know that you wouldn't know what it is but you would hear water all over your pants you're going to be lion lunch today that's what the Bible says the devil is like a roing lion I said have no fear our God is not like a lowering lion our God is a lion of the tribe of Judah and he has prevailed over the devil oh hallelujah hallelujah and so right there you know when he was thrown in he had no fear and when he reached there the man had no fear the Lions looked at him hi Daniel so you're not eating me so you know me yeah Daniel we know you it's only a lion which has no fear and the lion saw Daniel as another lion because because another lion was in Daniel the Bible says that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world it is the devil in the world that lays snares to make you fear but it is God that is in you that gives you boldness in the first of trouble and when he stood before that lion he had no fear he had no fear and he looked at the Lions and was singing and playing with them the whole time singing songs that man knows nothing about lion is so F when I was in Zimbabwe I touched a lion oh boy boy I I know then I knew what fear is when I touched that L I touched its rare and and just on the hip and I was just pressing it like that in just one second less than one second its mouth was where my finger was they told me yes that's how fast that Beast can be when did [Music] thatw don't kill me it was it was in the net in in the whatever blocked somewhere but even then I don't know what I almost did I will not tell you fear is real but fear is a spirit but hallelujah hallelujah God has not given us the spirit of fear amen and so we notice there was another another people we always talk about them when these boys we told that you should not bow to any other God but only the the god this image when you hear the drums when you hear the what then bow down they remained standing they gave them another chance they remained standing I want you to understand this was an entire kingom bowing down but these three boys refuse to bow down even if you are the only one who shall refuse brother to bow down to the devil do not bow down to the devil even if everybody else would agree to bow I agree not to bow amen our strength is not in agreement with others our strength is in agreement with the word if you agree with the word then God is right beside you to accomplish his promise but agree with man man will forsake you at the time when you need them but cannot forsake you the Bible says the present help in the time of trouble and if you believe him like that even in the time of trouble you will have no fear what the devil will do against your life at that moment they said Will Not Bow look your boys we are going to burn up this furnace again and recind again and again seven times and if you don't bow we will throw you in there they said Bring it on Bring it on we will not bow to the condition of the time did you know that fear has never been holistic fear is always consequential it's like fear I don't know whether I said that right but fear is always for the moment how many of you feared at one point in life all right how many of you who that who feared at one point in life and then later on you realize why did I fear later on I remember when I was in school one time uh there was a teacher who usually here in Uganda I don't know whether they are beating these days do they beat now noways students yes some good oh we used to get Enzo really so now there was these teachers who would make you li like a snake and and he would bring thato and the English speakers will not understand what we're talking about BYO and but I don't know it would bring a stripe a rod it is just like a rod and and he would bring it down on you I I would say he would Rin it down on you and so uh he said this teacher would say anybody below this Mark I'm going to give give you five you you know you are gone so now then after he says that then he brings the papers even by the time he's bringing the papers you are shaking because not the way you perform you don't know whether you reached that Mar by the time by the time he brings your paper you already and by the time you look at your paper your hand is shaking and if you see you are P the mark you can even even fall down in appreciation you just feel fear but when you realize that you are below the mark you will go back to your chair but you you will feel it hot can't even sit down some of us would not sit would just kneel down there because you you you know you waiting to receive the and then one day the teacher did that and at the end of the day um you know he spoke and he spoke and he spoke the road was there he spoke and he spoke and this session ended he said you have survived you have survived but I was going to now we wonder now why did we fear after all he has not beaten us from that moment I said fear will no longer control me because I know after after the fear you will not fear again did you hear me after fear there is no fear fear is only for that moment but the devil will try to bring many things in your life which will bring fear in your spirit and these things many times may be sickness it may be words that you have heard it may be things that maybe people have done to you it may be anything and then all of the sudden to bring a blanket of fear over but this is only for a moment but the devil will show it to you as if it's for a lifetime maybe you don't have money I want to tell you it's only for a moment maybe you have not tution it's only for a moment maybe you are sick it's only for a moment maybe you have issues in your family or in the church it's only for a moment but I tell you what we have an eternal God who is over and Beyond a moment he an everlasting God there before fear he will be there after fear fear has no power before our living and all they that trust in him amen have no fear also for there is no fear in love and so we notice these boys said We Shall Not Bow do what you will they they they boiled up the fire seven times completion the fire was completely hot the devil might have boiled your mind and he even brings you know what we call nervousness nervous there are people who become nervous and then others begin to fear begin to feel kind of depression so sad you feel that that feeling has overwhelmed you but that comes out of fear and others think that when they go to the psychiatrist psychist will help them let me tell you what you need you only need a holy ghost filled person to to you and cast out that fear because fear is a spirit and he said fear brings torment that's why to a Believer who is walking right with God no matter what comes no matter what go you will have no fear what devil will do what devil will say what devil will why because you know where you are standing you are standing on a solid rock the Rock of Ages the rock of the world the three boys said we shall not have any fear as long as we know the promise and they took them they had no fear they pulled them they had no fear the devil might have taken you he might have pulled you he might have done whatever he to you but I say have no fear hallelujah amen where is taking you in the fire our God is a consuming fire amen when he dragged them to the fire all of them got burnt but the boys themselves were in the fire dancing thank God Hallelujah Glory hallelujah our god are consuming fire me tell you brother sister oh Hallelujah let me tell you why we listen to the word every time because the word casts out fear God is the word and the word is love says with God in love there is no fear perfect love cast out fear so when we hear the word you get praise God and I want to say to you this evening if the devil has dragged you in the fire don't fear because when you are in the fire you are in Victory why because he that made the fire is right there in the fire amen you pray oh God send a sign an angel send this one send a word and God may not answer all those PR if God has not oh there's somebody who asked a question here why do I feel God is not answering my prayer here is your answer if you feel that God is not answering your prayer he's waiting to answer it in a greater way why are pray oh God come and consume all come and strike the the image come and and when they caught them come and strike all of them nothing God was waiting the angels in heaven were like oh God your people are being taken your people are being taken let us go woman say Let Me Go water God said no okay let me go and bring fire no let me go and bring he stopped all the wind the because God was prepared to answer the call himself and when the king saw he said didn't we throw three men in the fire why do I see four and the first of one is like the son of man who was he who was he he is the one in you he is the one here they saw him as a separate one but you don't see him because he's in you that's why I told you you are greater than you know because he that is in us he's greater than he that is in the world he's greater than any discouragement of fear he came down in a moment and fire meant nothing so they had no fear but even if he did not serve them they were ready to die but not fearful they were not yes don't be fearful brother don't worry even if God doesn't save you die strong die Fearless die standing on the die believe it if God doesn't heal you don't you worry die like a warrior don't die like a fearful person die like a warrior but I want to say to you tonight our God is more than able to deliver you some of said I can't overcome this I can't overcome this I can't overcome that Believers we are supposed to be soldiers we are fighting a battle and we are fighting until we overcome if we will not overcome we will die fighting keep fighting don't come out of the ring don't fear it's the fearful that go out of the ring stay in the ring even if you open it is a giant fight with him until you overcome him if you don't overcome him die trying but I want to say our go has been tested Our God has been proved over and over and that he cannot fail that he does not fail it's not what about what I'm saying it's about what he's saying it has been time tested there are for wife here praise God just stay right with faith and hold on to it take God's promise and remain with God in the message in the church age book The Church age I'll read you this quartner God says this church of the Lan age is wred wretched or wretched or whatever that word comes from two Greek words which means endure and tri endure and tri endure and TR yes praise God and he says and it has nothing to do with the trials that come to a true Christian for God describes a Christian in trial as blessed this is not about a Christian because this is not the church ised wretched find the word in the in Revelation chapter three vers something there they're wretched and blind naked wretched and blind did you get it quickly we don't have much time now and it has nothing to do it says with the trials did you find it brother chapter 3 anybody found it vers 18 no no no vers um verse 17 because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing but thou knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked s so the word comes from two which means endure and trial and it has nothing to do with the trials that come to a Christian because for God does not describe for God to a Christian he describes a trial as a as blessed and his attitude and his attitude one of joy is one of Joy whereas this description here is phrased as wretched and [Music] miserable how strange Listen Listen Now quickly now how strange in this age of Plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance How can there be trials well now it is strange but in this age of Plenty and opportunity everyone has so much and there is so much more to be had he says what with all the inventions to do uh what with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure but suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation even here in Uganda the mental are becoming more and more when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night I don't know how if there are people who do it here even many believers do let me tell you if you do if you do take ctiv to sleep oh it's not evil but I tell you you can be delivered off of that God can take you out of it because that is not your portion the Bible says he give his beloved sleep praise the name of the Lord and he says when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking stives at night he says P pills in the morning rushing to doctors entering institutions and nothing listen and trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol they're trying to drown that fear with alcohol do you know many people who are taking alcohol and drugs because of fears they living in fear they in bondage yes this AG B of his tremendous stores of worldly Goods but the people are less happy than ever bsts of his spiritual attainments but people are less sure of themselves than ever this Ed of better moral values and it is more corrupt than any age since the flag it talks about his knowledge and science but it is fighting and losing a battle in all fields for the human mind and soul Spirit cannot comprehend keep ESS with all the changes that have come upon the Earth in one generation we have gone all the way from the horse and bu age to the Space Age and we are proud and blessful about it but this generation inside the peop is a Dark Void C that is crying out in torment you know the scripture said that fear has torment and without a known reason many's hearts are failing for fear and the world is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of neuro [Music] neurotics the wife is fearing a husband the husband is fearing his wife father's fearing son son is fearing daughter daughter is fearing you know brother there's fear everywhere the other time I heard there was a woman that powered hot water on a husband the man just walk up only to go to the hospital half dead why burned by the wife why maybe the woman had her fears or insecurities you find a phone someone has 20 passwords someone just Scrolls the whole screen to put a password fears they have nothing on the phone no money nothing but Secrets what if Pastor finds out what if my wife finds out if you you have your secret password and your wife doesn't know there is a problem with you you have fear this is my phone this is your phone we settled that one long ago in my marriage say my wife we are one you have my password I have yours if a Thum print yours can open mine mine can open your when I'm sleeping I'm peaceful you can check all you want no fear when I go in the bathroom I can leave you with my phone you can check all you want you can search all you want I have no fear but what has the devil done fear what if they do this what I even have no fear even if she found something bad she will not come and beat me up she will not come and divorce me she'll ask me darling what is this and I and then we will talk it over and then we will kiss each other and that will be but what but what has the devil done fear and and he causes that kind of stress even in marriage relationship you know even the devil would want to you know the pastor is fearing the people the people fearing I've heard often times people say oh we fear pastor I hear it in some Churches I get shocked you a pastor well of course you have a right to fear if he walks with the guards with a gun maybe but in the message churches your pastor is your brother you fear your pastor what is wrong with you no because the past invite him to your house no one has ever invited me don't but I dare not go and push myself on the homes of the people I'm your pastor open we don't do that wherever Jesus was invited he go no fear no fear the spirit of fear is bad it brings nervousness it brings a torment and he says the generation is all in torment country is fearing another country you know are they going to are they going they keep spying on one another because of fear countries do that I hope people don't do that what what what are they saying what is he saying why because of fear Tor it brings torment people even I've seen many young people they're not confident of themselves of fear oh I I don't look nice my body is so tiny I'm so fat I fear how would they say what they think don't fear those kind of things fear comes from the devil what God has made you let me tell you is good and anybody that will not appreciate you is the devil why because he that believes in God should believe the word of God and the word of God says are fearfully and wonderfully made but the devil doesn't believe that but every believer believes that praise the name of the Lord and we don't fear what the devil thinks about us and without unknown reason many's hearts are fading for fear world is so darken that this age could well be called the age of neurotics boss but it cannot be back it up cries peace but there is no peace it cries that it has a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire fire there is no peace sa my God to the wicked there's no P the wicked but I want to finish like this I will not finish my sermon but I'm just finishing because of time just go back and read the thean church age very good nuggets there in Romans 8:15 he says you have not received a spirit of bondage against fear but he have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry when you receive the spirit of adoption you are blessed amen as a Son of God you are not made a Son of God you have always been a Son of God but the spirit of adoption blesses you as a son you perfectly love God and God perfectly loves you and perfect love cast out fear perfect life cast out fear if I had time I would go into the blessing of a son spiritual adoption and BM of the Holy Spirit but I tell you friends we have been blessed as sons of God we have nothing now to fear our heart is at rest no more anxiety no more depression no more fears what comes of God our God is in control because we are in him and if you in him he has everything covered he if he has my past covered and he has my future Covered he has covered my presence hallelujah amen nothing is going wrong all is well let us stand on our feet Hallelujah give him a clap of Praise if you believe that hallelujah hallelujah blessed be
