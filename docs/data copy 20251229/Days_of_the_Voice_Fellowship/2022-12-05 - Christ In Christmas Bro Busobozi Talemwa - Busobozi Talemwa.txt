actually members of my my family that is myself and then also uh brother calebu and uh brother Peter burganda Peter um brother Solomon also gave something on November third Solomon those are the only names I've seen since October movies if you've given anything since October first that means we never received it and um brother Tim brother Tim God came and visited us here he was his time was short

speak on this rare subjects [Music] at the end of this service give me inspiration let your Holy Spirit [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] I'm just praying that the Lord will count me down and uh so I don't just go over the things but be sensitively his spirit and if you don't get done maybe we'll just carry on on Wednesday praise the Lord so it is December this is the month they say that Jesus was born of course we know that is not true um okay so those are the things I want us to deal with everybody and this is one that actually shocks a lot of people when they get to realize it if there is one thing that is really so bad whoever wishing there is nothing as bad as tradition they were say why by slowly erases the truth and the truth sometimes and many times is actually replaced with tradition Al and when you tell somebody a tradition is not true they will disfellowship with you they will disconnect themselves from you and they will say you have a first doctor like you know when we tell people that the Trinity is a Doctrine from hell yeah it's a Catholic Doctrine it has nothing to do with the Bible oh they will frown at you they will tell you what because the Trinity has been preached as a major Christian doctrine for centuries but last Sunday we dealt with that next Sunday we were able to find out there is nothing like a trinity or persons there is only a trinity of a person one year that manifests himself in three different manifestations but then they said father is God son is God and holy spirit is God and each of them is independent um but that is not true there is nothing like an eternal son because to be an eternal son you have to be without beginning and without ending but we know that Jesus at the beginning at the beginning [Music] you can go and listen to that someone is called the unrecognized Christ so this morning we are going to deal with Christ in Christmas now I know among the message circles we should not do something because we want to look different and I want to thank God because we have a guide the holy spirit is our God but the Holy Spirit uses men and women and in our generation he has used the prophet that's why foreign foreign we will read from verses 1 to 7. and it came to pass in those days that they went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made once geranius was governor of Syria and all and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea and to the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was the he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the Inn again [Music] [Music] because there was no room for them in the Inn ate together for everyone now because there was no room for them in the air amen you may be seated now in the message the acts of the Holy Spirit the prophet of God says now as we are approaching Christmas time now cutting electricity foreign [Music] [Music] one they're decorating that by my team W1 and instead of Jesus we are approaching Christmas together this is what they are doing do I have your attention this morning they are decorating Santa Claus but Timber Santa Claus instead of Jesus they don't even spell it anymore Christmas Christmas it is they don't even spell Christ in Christmas anymore what it is really good teacher cheat again and they think other clothes and instead of rejoicing under the spirit of God they go out and get drunk and rejoice and listen to me the prophet of God says here that is what makes the difference if there is effect Allah there will be an original door actually the very reason why there is a fake dollar is because there is an original dollar into anything wrong there is something right and so we see that the people the correct uh whenever Christmas time comes there is something I want to draw your attention that it's not about Jesus what we see on the outside is actually not about the Jesus of the Bible they get drunk and then they Rejoice so I want to ask you a question why are they rejoicing is it because of the birth of Christ because of the alcohol what is the celebration about teaching from the beginning the birth of Jesus Christ was not celebrated from the beginning we've read it together here you know it was time the time of taxing charity and the emperor had given an orders he said everyone in the world should be attacked and so everyone started to go to where they came from and Joseph you know the story of Joseph and Maryam how Joseph was espoused engaged with Mary history and then she he found one day he woke up and found his girlfriend pregnant and you know there is only one reason that a man can divorce a wife as a matter of fact Jesus himself when he came yesterday he said If any man um divorces his wife and marriage accept it before the cause of fornication um now listen let me explain that a little more so there is a difference between fornication and adultery nobody right living is immorality before marriage is the same act done by somebody who is married [Music] because she is your wife adultery does not warrant divorce I always fornication dance so how can I married a woman for the kid um so that means if the God does it um and 10 years later she's married to her husband you know I'm a virgin you know he finds out 10 years later [Music] they have a family [Music] that man has a right to divorce her um because they never married to begin with marriage must be made on the basis of good faithful [Music] you must confess your life to him just like we confess our life to Jesus [Music] before he takes us in as his wife and after we confess everything to him he forgives us everything we did in the past and he says all the past is now gone [Music] so here we find out that Joseph was engaged with Mary and Mary was a virgin Mary but later on Joseph finds out that Mary is pregnant oh she lied to me she must have lied to me but Joseph was a good man you didn't want to ashamed so he wanted to leave her but privately but that same night the angel of the Lord came to Joseph do not divorce your wife married he is of the Holy Ghost praise the name of the Lord amen and we notice that Jesus yes was not made out of the egg of Mary yes but he actually came from the word of God he himself was the world praise the name of the Lord and so now Joseph carries on with his wife and he said okay let us now raise this child and one day they have gone to do the taxing with Mary Maryam and Mary was about to deliver Mariam of the pregnancy and while they were there the Bible says the days were accomplished we shall come back to this but I want to ask you how many days does a woman take to deliver foreign [Music] and Lady him because there was listen now to this because there was no room for them in the innate she for eign did they celebrate it as a matter of fact when Mary was going to give back she went to the to the Inn again with Joseph to try and find just a room where Jesus where Jesus will be born yes but everybody told him I'm sorry we are busy they must I'm sure they must have gone in almost every place if they were the only available places we are preaching we are so busy foreign anymore the religious man of the time did not celebrate it but nothing eventually the Romans the national leaders they did not celebrate it the family of both Mary even the family [Music] you don't know what we are talking about you're not giving birth to a child is not celebrating it means it is you know children you know children are joy in the home and you know even whenever a girl even becomes pregnant without being married you know many people will not celebrate the birth of a child and to find your Humanity but at least [Music] [Music] [Music] because this is the foreign foreign [Music] foreign how did they stop so there is something we need to find out they celebrating the birth of Jesus or something else it is I will prove to you in a few moments because the Bible in the book of second Timothy chapter 3 verse [Music] in the last days for men shall be listen man shall be [Music] loversius disobedient to their parents in our generation you give somebody something and they say only this is [Music] [Music] question you know one day I was just thinking about it you know on the screen I was putting certain things for my children I know will be good foreign [Music] thank you foreign are the form of godliness [Music] are you hearing me now in the days of the birth of Jesus can we say that our generation is better Our Generation loves Jesus there is a form of godliness [Music] the Bible says in the Book of Romans why because it is and this gospel is the power I am not ashamed to carry my Bible yeah I walk on the road I tell my friends about Jesus tell people I believe in Jesus Christ is the most sinful day on Earth hey what is wrong with you Pastor today I'm saying the truth even people over here and probably literally they leave church in the early morning and they go to bars why today is our day it is Christmas anymore they have removed Christ is nothing about Jesus Christ and then they bring their father Christmas what connection does he have with the Bible Father Christmas in the Bible I want to say to you days of the voice hallelujah amen let us put Christ back in Christmas hallelujah amen they say they are celebrating his boss foreign and their father will go again [Applause] [Music] nothing to do with Jesus Christi let us tell our children let us they tell them the true birth story of Jesus as a matter of fact the Bible does not tell us to celebrate the birth of Christ and if we celebrate our own birthdays I want to say this to you as the true pride of Christ kind of people to celebrate the birth of Christ amen in the right way [Music] is not a celebration it is a worship it is foreign they have depressed Christ with X Cristo is clearly this is just a form of godliness let me show you the truth celebrities praise the name of the Lord and they'll and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and Lord the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone right about them and they were so afraid and the angels said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy Hallelujah who shall be to all people read that Lucas new [Music] all right I mean yes amen I want you to see how Jesus wants to receive his birth Jesus did not go to the priests yesterday against he did not go to the to the king he didn't even go to the them churches the synagogues but where did he go by advisation of angels you went to the Shepherds where was Jesus born yes yes so he went to the Shepherds who understand the manger I mean hallelujah amen so you went to the surface they were at the lowest and I always sized people of their time even today [Music] what is a shepherdachi you know when you go to the Village you find them you know having a road stinking clothes it's smelling cow dungus having that you know just you know having even the belly dressing and then you know you know going with the cows [Music] so when you really pass a Shepherd you look down on them shepherds are not great people just like Lambs hallelujah amen and when the angel of the Lord came down and light the glory of the Lord Shone around about them and the angels for the Lord I bring you good tidings of great joy we shall be to all people run to you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior is [Music] born this day of David a savior which is Christ the lord now many people they think that those wise men they came on the day Jesus was born [Music] the wise man they came between one another and two years after the birth of Jesus [Music] you remember that after they left but I'm out of fire and the King wanted to kill the children because he wanted to kill Jesus killed everyone two years and below because Jesus at that time was in that age group but the people around to that made the birth of Jesus on the same day Christo verse 12. the community and this shall be assigned unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothe is lying in a Manger okay and suddenly there was with the angel of multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on the earth peace Good Will toward men and it was it was and it came to pass us the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said unto one another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the Lord has made known unto us and they came with haste and upon Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all that they had and all they that had it wandered orders at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in our heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had had and seen as it was told unto them now I wanted to see several things here one way in February number one that the news or the message of his birth was ministered by an Angel not Santa or a priest [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] Christ yes it is the same yesterday today forever now we are not looking for the one then we are looking for the one now because if he was there then he is here foreign [Music] let us first look at a few special applications the message will always come to the vilest of sinners the message from the angel told them that Jesus was in a Manger the most unexpected place droppings of sheep and everything smelly yeah [Music] they went to see him by hearing and reading them they met Jesus with exceeding Joy yes we receive the holy ghosts unspeakable and full of Glory Christ in US of our resurrection and they made it known abroad when they had that we do also must prophesy again to tell the testimony of Christ [Music] actually that is the true Christmas story now if you missed it you'll go back and listen to them now foreign [Music] foreign [Music] the Dynamics how many systems are there um Four Seasons God bless you Elizabeth now that in which season was Jesus when alarm was born foreign all right this little sister here spring is Gabriel was sent from God and to a city of Galilee named Nazareth to our exposed to remind yourself and his name was Mary Luca is all right to listen go ahead um [Music] amen Amina when did the angel come Mariah which is I want a very good mathematics student yes foreign [Music] to be foreign foreign let's save it um June July August September October July August September October November December foreign becomes [Music] [Music] [Music] it is winter episode and no Lambs can be born there was okay thank you in December we find it you might be a Catholic and you believe Jesus was born on 25th December I have a question for you was Jesus born as a premature yes was he put into a woman the Bible already has told us in Luke chapter 2 verse 6. that easy to say of Jesus being born the Bible did not say oh because Joseph and Mary were walking yes the pregnancy went upside down [Music] if Jesus was born on 25th December since he was born as a premature but according to the Bible Bible he had full time he had to have full time be a hundred percent a man so that you can be able to save us from our sins nine months yes in Israel are usually born around that time [Music] to be born around that time even when you see when Jesus was born they wanted a Manger there was no snow but whenever you see people celebrating Christmas during snow time why did they choose that date that death was already there before the birth of Jesus December and our Jesus was actually born yesterday in the springtime [Music] God bless you thank you for opening my eyes now I know why they do everything they do because it has no connection to the birth of Jesus where is Santa Claus on the day that Jesus [Music] but now as it is they have completely there is no Christ it's about other gods completely about other gods that's why they are celebrations giving all those kind of gifts of alcohol and they go out naked they're going fornication clubs Christmas not even Christmas anymore it's X-Men Christmas because the Christ they're celebrating is not ourselves put back Christ in Christmas they are celebrating their own Christ have our Christmas we must tell our children [Music] what is wrong with food a military coach we must have wonderful food because our Jesus Christ he was born yes was he born on 25th yesterday he wasn't they are very well I can choose to celebrate Christ even today what is wrong with that attention the queen had two best days one I think was I don't know I don't know how they call it but yeah the official one and then her real birthday and like you yourself recently my mother told me that that was that's the wrong date foreign foreign those of you have never received gifts on their birthdays we have a meeting I don't remember the day you also had ever had a gift I can't remember but I would sure be happy to get one yes sir so now find out Zula that Jesus was not born 25 seconds it is not wrong to Worship in the right way and remember the birth of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen praise the name of Allah in the deity of Jesus Christ says we are today all over the world is being celebrated of the birth of Jesus and he says which now is just traditional government Jesus was not born on the December the 25th yesterday the hills of judeaf was full of snow at that time so how could it be the Shepherds were they are grazing their sheep so coming soon no you're not in the snow it was spring time hallelujah amen so you see Jesus commonly by astrology so forth and by all of it was born first around the first of April yesterday so when it was time and she said but this is a day listen to me but this is December which is all right [Music] just set aside to watch any Memorial of his coming to the world one of the greatest gifts that God ever give to the world was Jesus Christ [Music] giving themselves those kind of gifts we are going to give us ourselves the gifts Christmas because oh dear now your Prophet received the Bible on Christmas [Music] he had a Christmas tree in his house and then the little children you can't expect they can't understand you have Revelation they don't or you know and then he would put the gifts under there and and you know they would come and pick it up and they would be so happy that you would make their time of telling his children [Music] because my time is done but I will just have most of these I'll share them some of them on Wednesday if I feel late if not I'll just post it on the chat group and you can all yeah let me read a little more for you in Divine Healing he says and the fact of all the era and everything there is about there is something about it that the world tries to make it an Xmas moving to Xmas he says and the fact of all the errors [Music] and everything there is in this thing there is something about it that the world tries to make it an X-Men it's that the the error is is really the world Mexican [Music] but God has still got a Christmas somewhere I went to our house and here he's got something about it justice the very names and the thoughts of the birth of the Lord Jesus Oh the world has put Santa Claus in his place but not the Christians still a Christmas a child Christmas that's what your Prophet says Christianity is still a Christmas we have not done it as a next month has not remove the Christ we shall not remove replace him with Santa Claus Santa Claus praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah Christmas is the day of worship Christmas the prophet says and let me read another here in Christianity versus idolatry says Christmas is no more a worship Christmas is a celebration gambling arousing just Pagan to the limits maybe after Christmas I'll speak again on Christmas he says it won't deprive the little meaning of the children but you can't tell that that to little children like that they see little fellows on Christmas night getting Christmas presents and things like that so they can't understand it who is a very holy brother [Music] you told your children for us we don't give gifts on Christmas Christmas but that it is Christmas or Christmas Merry Christmas and he's seeing the other children very many young children who were raised by parents who believe the message when they became of age they didn't follow what the prophet said are you hearing me Church fathers who are here mothers were here it's all right to give your gifts to your children on Christmas oh it's perfectly all right but you can't tell that to little children like that they silly the fellows on Christmas night getting Christmas presents and things like that they don't understand it together and we've got to remember them they have things in common we've got to bring ourselves down to remember them little fellas praise the name of the Lord in Psalms we would see Jesus they have taken the sacredness from Christmas to make it not at Christmas but a day of Celebration we do not you hear people say we are going to Celebration we are going to celebrate Christmas what is wrong we should never celebrate Christmas is a day of worship Christmas is not a celebration hallelujah hallelujah but looking back on my life I wonder where it happened from them little Christmases when we hung up our stockings and Mama would get would probably get an orange and two or three little pieces of stripped candy and that was a great Christmas to us but you know kids they look forward to the to those to them gifts we find out that that Christmas is is uh to the is mainly children foreign and I can go on and on and on and on and on praise the name of the Lord I want to thank that lady I can't think of her name is Billy just told me that had given me a box of Christmas candy sweet is a Christmas and just brought it out to the car a few moments ago the sister I can't think of her name here in California that was my first Christmas presentation foreign [Music] [Music] for now hallelujah amen some of you can make it a point I have a Manger today I believe you were born [Music] I want that real Christmas gifts Hallelujah I tell you what some of you can receive the holy ghosts Hallelujah I mean prepare record of Jesus Christ at some place in questions and answers 59 it says he took his children 118 he took them right in to see the Christmas lights some people I I feel they would like to see this he said says Christmas Means Christ [Music] a very Merry Christmas to everyone stole this church I believe those angels said more than that we're so happy they were rejoicing it was a wonderful thing Shepherds had the news where does Santa come into the picture don't bring Santa in your house Santa is nowhere yes Jesus is the issue in the issue let us do it in a greater way Hallelujah [Applause] foreign foreign foreign [Music] and we were riding last night showing the kitties all the Chris the houses decorated and everything which is awful nice [Music] did I read it correctly I was writing last night and all the houses [Music] but I thought if I ever had anything on my house I ever wanted to write [Music] what does the neon sign somebody help us [Music] trusting it would be saying this way trust in Christ will be in your Christmas is [Music] [Music] let me trust that Jesus will be in your Christmas tonight put Christ back into Christmas foreign just up there which I haven't opened up until Joy comes in
