ministering of the same may we be blessed in your presence I commit the hearers tonight everyone that will be under the sound of my voice may your Holy Spirit move in their hands speak to us that we will go away from here today saying that our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us Grant it father in the precious name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen amen I greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight that is 10% of you amen I see uh sister esta I think I didn't see you on Sunday where you on Sunday I I'm happy to see you again and all of you we are happy to be back in the house of the Lord and so today we are just going to continue with the our Sunday on Sunday I just barely read the opening scripture and we did not go into the message how many appreciate the presence of God on Sunday it was just wonderful I just pray that God gives us more of that and those who missed the service you really missed a lot such moments you cannot manufacture it it just comes from from the supernatural [Music] so we are going to go to the Book of Exodus uh brother Dixon you still have some work to do Exodus chapter 3: 1 to uh to9 [Music] okay so we are reading from vers three sorry vers 1 to vers 9 this is the same portion we read on Sunday we shall just rehearse it and then we see what the Lord will speak to us amen now Moses kept the flock of Je th his father in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the back side of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even Tob and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not [Music] consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to seea God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I draw not nther put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them out of the that land unto a good land and a and a large and unto a land flowing with milk and honey and unto the place of the Canaanites to the heit the hammerites and the perizzites and the hites and the jeites now there Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression where with the Egyptians oppress them [Music] and he said lastly we read the verse 10 as well come now and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt amen you may be seated praise the lord we have been dealing with a subject on the uh people for his name and we were we were talking about the battle the battle being the Lord is amen I think it was a very good service on Su because God show that the battle is his it's not ours you know the Bible speaks of um when they were dedicating the world the temple the the Temple of Solomon it says the presence of God came down and it was so heavy that the ministers could not be able to minister to me I I feel that if were we were in such a presence it is much better than spending hour was teaching uh because on Sunday I mean I just read the opening scripture only and every from after I read opening scripture I notice the ho Spirit was reading me differently I was not able to get to my notes and read other verses and quotes and scriptures and so sometimes you know the prophet told us that the the a gift is a man taking himself out of the way and then letting God use it because you cannot do it on your own whether you are a Pianist or guitarist drum you know or a preacher or a singer if you cannot say well I know what I'm going to do and then whenever you are going to say I know I know I'm going to do it very well that the day you will fail terribly even if you knew how to sing and then you say let me I know all the verses i w even read anywh I'm just going to go and enter the spirit and sing it that's the day you will fail terribly the focus will not work the key will be different than the one you singing you struggle your eyes will go red until you just no let me let me quit so you see but if you have a gift of God you have to learn letting go and allowing God to use it operate do not try to operate it yourself and and so I noticed even with preaching it is the same if had come up and said well I have this notes I must preach it Tom iay upon God I started but you see when I step here or when any preacher steps here we don't come to show off we don't come to show what we know we don't come to to demonstrate something you know no matter how long a preacher will preach I mean no matter how long he has been preaching you if you're truly having a gift of God you can never get used to standing before the children of God and preaching to them it's always a nervous experience you don't know how it will come out because you see you're not relying on your own you relying on on on something Divine something superal isn't it so lovely for you to come to church and hear from God you know even you who just comes and maybe sit down and hear the word you need to train yourself hearing from God if you just come and say today I'm just lazy I'm tired let him preach to others today you'll get nothing out of this but when you come to the service even if no matter how you're feeling you know you just yeld yourself and say I don't know what he's going to speak to you but I want to open my heart and I want to hear what the spirit has for me let me tell you that day you will have a real good service praise the Lord and so uh you know how everything went how everything went um brother Henry was telling me uh he also did not I mean we did not plan that you now come and song it was just the whole spirit that was doing that and then even the songs he was singing you know he would leave start sing another one the words spoke you know everything was just Supernatural friends I think we should be more sensitive to the holy leadership of the Holy Spirit you know the word may be so nice that the Holy Spirit nudges you to stand up and cheer it shout and enjoy the word and and you like no how will they see me you are not yielding yourself we should be a Congregation of people that learn to yield ourselves many of us sometimes come to church weak and tired and weary and sick by the end of the message we are all happy and rejoicing and he so how many have come expecting tonight amen may the Lord speak to us I know some who have traveled from far in G you know it's it's wonderful I pray that God will be able to minister to us so today I might be a little longer than usual always end the service at 7 may go about 30 minutes more so just prepare your mind for that so now I'm I'm looking at um the people for his name you see the the the Jews left Egypt they went into the Wilderness they crossed the Red Sea and now when they had crossed Jordan that's when the real battle started you think that they were fighting battles before but really the real battle started when they had crossed Jordan and that is how it is with our Christian Life the Christian Life is a battle it is something that you you have to be willing to fight it is not Prophet says it's not a Bed of Roses there are many scriptures written here many of which we know it is it is easy to read them but it is hard to leave them because is a battle you have to fight every inch of ground so I want us I wanted us on Sunday I hope that tonight we'll be able to do that I wanted us to take Israel as a nation and see how it types us yes so God always works and deals with Jews and Gentiles separately he deals with Jews as a nation he deals with Gentiles as a people now Israel is the church natural we the Gentiles were the church spiritual now whatever they they as a nation went through we go through as individuals so in order to call the children of Israel out of bondage God did a few things number one he sent a prophet with a message number two it was a message accompanied with signs praise the name of the Lord do I have the the controller for this yeah one brother Dixon or somebody can you come up excuse me [Music] please okay sorry it was just making my lips so dry that I can't talk okay you know he uh he sent a prophet with a message and it was a message accompanied with [Music] signs I want you to follow this Clos but the signs followed the message not the message followed the sign if you understand that say Amen some did not understand did you get it we see here that God speaks to Moses when God when God had the people crying they cry of course on Sunday I went through the whole history on how they went and ended up in Egypt so I want to go back into that I want us to see how when God calls Moses and he tells him Moses I am now going to send you to Egypt because I have heard the Cry of my people and have come down to deliver them and I'm going to send you down there to go and deliver them now I want I want you to ask yourself a question wasn't God able to deliver them without Moses the question is did he have the power to do it he could do anything because God indeed do anything but God did not do it without Moses God cannot do it without a Moses without a prophet because whenever God is dealing with his people he expects his people to trust him the way if you go through the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation that is how God works God has never worked without man as long as it is a business to redeem or save man God has always used man to to to to work with man man because you see God knows it is difficult for man to believe in in fellow man but it is only those with the seed of God in their heart that will see a man before them and they will not see a man but they will see God speaking to them you remember even in the New Testament you know this man I think it was Lazarus when Lazarus died and uh he he went to heaven he wanted God to send him because he was talking to at least let me go when they see a man from the just jumping like that I am your brother from the day and I've come to tell you hell is real I am right now burning in he thought they will believe but what did Abraham tell Abraham said down on Earth there are preachers if your people hear them they will not come where you are so everyone has an opportunity God gives everyone an equal opportunity to hear the message and believe it or to hear it and reject it and God will judge each one according to whether they rejected the word or they received the word but you see you cannot accept the word go without accepting the messenger are you following me Church you have to accept the messenger in order to accept the word follow me closely here we see that God now sends Moses and he tells him go I'm going to send you to my people and I want you to serve them I want you to bring them out of that land and I I want you to bring them to a land flowing with milk and honey so the Lord willing we shall be able to talk about the land and the battles of the land but for now let us talk about okay that's becoming better now so let us now talk a little bit about how uh they were able to come out of Egypt okay all right so now I want you to go to Exodus chapter 7: 3 praise the name of the Lord vers three says and I will and I will harden Pharaoh's heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt but Pharaoh shall not hecken unto you that I may lay my hand upon Egypt and bring forth my my armies and my people the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by great judgments and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen I want you to see something here God has armies God is a god of love but also God is a god of war and he has armies but his armies are invisible but before he releases his armies he releases his man oh you're not hearing me today are you hearing me well if you're hearing me say Amen before he releases his armies he releases his man and we see that before he released his armies he released his man who was the commander of his armies and his man was Moses sent from God God every time everywhere every day he sends a man when you fa to see the man God will not fight your battle but when you receive the man that God sends to you then you remember that man will be the one that will command the armies of God so now God wanted so much let me tell you when you talk about fighting the Battle of faith it is not us fighting it is God fighting in us so here he made sure he is sending a commander to be able to fight imagine can you really choose a commander when you are not ready to fight if you have a war captain or or a commander of a battle you are expecting and you have guns and weapons and you expect that there is going to be a now listen this is the amazing part God now says I will harden Pharaoh's heart and I will multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt why did God even want to harden Pharaoh's heart because God wanted to show his power sometimes you fight things for a long time and they don't leave you they don't go away from you but let me tell you the reason is some of those things it is God who permits them or allows them to happen and whatever if it is God who has permitted it to happen he is waiting or fixing or wanting to multiply his signs and his wonders there will not be signs and wonders if there are no problems you remember the child who was blind and they came to Jesus and said why was he this way is it him who sinned is it his mother who sined is it his father who sinned he say none of them sin but the power of God must be made manifest sometimes God allows problems to come in your life in my family in your family you know because he wants to show forth his signs and his wonders in the land of Egypt when you are still in your problem he wants to show his signs and wonders in the land of your problems Hallelujah so now Pharaoh the Bible says he will harden Pharaoh's heart and he says Pharaoh shall not hecken to you sometimes you know you cast out devils I cast you in the name of Jesus and you remain sick I cast command and the devil doesn't hear don't you worry the battle is not yours the battle is not yours to fight if the devil doesn't go it means god is fixing oh Hallelujah he's fixing to do signs and wonders he says Pharaoh shall not hecken unto you the devil shall not hecken unto you that I may lay my hand upon him that I may lay my hand upon Egypt Hallelujah hallelu and bring forth my armies you see what brings the armies of God that the devil doesn't listen to you so that the armies of God can come the armies of God are invisible why do we call him the Lord of hosts host he has an army he's the Lord of hosts he has an army which cannot be seen with eyes the Bible says we War not against flesh and blood but we war against principalities we war against pow we war against spiritual darkness in high places our enemy is not physical the fight of faith is not against brothers and sisters it is against demons and spirits we can't see but you know the devil doesn't listen to us so that God can release his armies hallelujah amen and he says and my people the children of Israel you know they will you know out be out of the of the land of Egypt by great judgments God will have to bring great judgments upon the Devil upon the powers of Darkness upon the principalities upon the sicknesses upon the troubles and The Temptations God will have to show his power and the Egyptians shall know hallelujah amen and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord L O R Lord Hallelujah when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them now these were children of Israel and blood of bus and gods the same thing that applies to them applies to us spiritually if God Did It for Israel as a nation God does it for us as individuals you know the Journey of Christianity is not easy but don't worry God who is our savior he's also the enforcer of every promise of God we are not the ones who make it come to pass it is God who enforces every promise of his word hallelujah amen hallelujah amen when the enemy comes in like a FL his Spirit his armies always fights for us they lift up a standard against the enemy Hallelujah let us continue on to verse eight and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying when Pharaoh shall speak unto you saying show a miracle for you then Thou shalt say unto Aon take thy Road of warfare it has never been the strong that win the war always has been the good War captain that is a very good strategist always you you you go and study the art of Modern Warfare or or Ancient Warfare what it has always been the one who was who was always having the upper hand was the one who knew how to [Music] strategize he had to sit usually they walk up they have to sit down on a board and they draw how the they actually preempt how the war will be they write on a board and show you know they they have things like um you know they have these things like chess they have like something like a chess board and and then they will they will tell you now our enemies are going to come here they will come from here and they will come here but they have advantage on us now because we may be on Higher Ground here and we are in a valley but here is what we are going we are going to send spies so that we know their position and then we shall send our Calvary these ones going with horses and we shall keep them be right slightly behind them and they will not even know that we have our army behind them and then we shall come as a small army and then when they see us they will send all their armies to the thinking they're going to consume us but why they think they're finishing then we shall send all the other Battalion and we shall finish them in the coming from a higher ground that is now a good strategist he knows how to fight so it is because of the captain that the war will be won it is not because of how good the soldiers are it is because of how good the captain is hallelujah now listen to me Church our war Captain is Jesus Christ Hallelujah he has already made the whole strategy before we even came in the battlefield he has already drawn the whole strategy of war and he knows how everything is going to he knows where your enem is going to come from he knows how your enem is planning to fight how did he know that because he came as a spy he himself came as a spy he came in the battlefield and he fought this enemy and he knows this enemy so well before that he was even in heaven and he had defeated that enemy before and he know how our enemy fights and he has an upper hand against our enemy and that's why here he was telling Moses when you go you know Pharaoh shall speak unto you how did he know that Pharaoh will ask him this because he's a very good strategist he will ask you and says show me a miracle then you tell Aon to throw out down the road and he will cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent he knows the future he knows all about me he knows all the future he knows about my future enemy he knows about my future battles he knows about everything and he's telling me here what the enemy is going to say what the enemy is going to do and wait he will tell me what I need to do [Music] also Hallelujah need the Holy Ghost because he said when the Holy Spirit is come he will show you things to come when you are filled with the Holy Spirit nothing can take you unaware many times even when the devil wants to bring sickness God will speak to you he will tell you the devil planning a sickness begin to pray you begin to pray before you even become sick and when you become sick you are saying I'm fighting a defeated enemy Hallelujah there is nothing can take a child of God unawares the devil cannot surprise you the devil cannot surprise us because we know his tactics it has been exposed by Jesus Christ and here Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh imagine going to your enemy when you know everything he's going to say when you know everything he's going to do he's going to do this and I will do this he will do this and I will do this and I will defeat him and Moses and Aaron went went unto pharaoh and they did so as the Lord had commanded and Hallelujah you listening to me church this message has power to defeat every Spirit of adultery to De to defeat every fornication to defeat every drunkenness to defeat every powers of Darkness every Spirit even of social media every spirit in our generation this message has the power it has the power to overcome it but let me tell you what do we need to do we need Amen to follow the prescription we have the road of power what is the road of power the road of power is nothing other than the power of God behind this message God only gives us the message and expects us to use it to get the results follow me cl you said you came from do you know how they enchant okay he said he used to be outside not inside all right so doesn't know how they enchant who knows how to enchant like witches you know I don't know how to enchant like them but whatever it is I know it really looks so weird they must have come with their roads and you know trying to show that they have magic of power you know and trying to enchant yes yes it must have been that way you know trying to you know to call all the the Demons of Egypt all the powers of Egypt it's not the powers people tribes have powers you know cultures have powers that for us we have a lot of spirits and that in our culture they say you know you you you have a a priest upon whom the spirit of all our culture or whatever sit on them and so is every tribe you know actually in our own tribe in our own family in the of the where I come from the one the demons the spirits of our tribe sit on my uncle and let me tell you he has made a lot of money because many people go to him for him to enchant them if I mention his name probably you've heard of him but this is not a place for me to mention his name I don't want to give him publicity but I tell you what they have the powers they surely do when I went to him I've ever gone to him one time in his house and then I saw all the things that he had put on his wall and I challenged him and I said is your god alive he said Son do you want to prove that my God is alive my God is powerful I tell he's even more powerful than your God I told him what makes you think that he said all the pastors come here for power the come here for power you know they all come here and the man has made himself a kingdom he's very very rich when he's going in the village there you know he goes with a I don't know how many cars following probably 50 cars and with the people who are there you know spirits on them they all doing enchantment and they're speaking in Tong and you know they are there and they go in the mountains there and when they go everybody just runs away because they know the power of the of this area has come but I stood right before his face I told him those people that you're talking about they don't worship the god I worship the god I worship is far more powerful than your God they told me you ought not to have done that because it means I have challenged him [Music] and I may not leave but until today I am alive until today let me tell you I'm alive and I was purposed to even PCH out his sons and show them my God the god of the Bible and when I started out with one of them you know he he he tried to he told me I'm coming I'm coming and then from then he never answered my phone what it tell you and he's one of the people that always go there in the in the Inner Circle to do the enchantments they must have tried and they failed and his father must have told him stay away from those people so I'm here to tell you something witchcraft is real my uncle told me I tell you what we do I can I can make someone dig for the whole night said really how do you do that don't worry I told I can make someone dig even K and these people are not [Music] bling Pastor are you losing your mind I'm not losing my mind if we don't believe that witchcraft exists we don't believe God exists but God is greater than witchcraft that is one thing we have to understand he brought the men amen who were the ones that were enchanting the H of Egypt he brought them all the Winds of Egypt were behind them all the Winds of Egypt were behind the roads they have and when they took those roads and cast them down those roads became serpents just like the road of Moses became a serpent how many roads of Moses one how many roads of the Egyptians many many many many witchcraft many Sorcerers many a lot of power but let me I don't care how much someone thinks they Bewitched how much someone thinks they are under some kind of spare if they test the God of this message witchcraft cannot stand before the God of this message that's why message Believers we do not believe in being Bewitched am I preaching to Believers here tonight we do not believe in being Bewitched if you feel your Bewitched go in prayer and if you pray sincerely whatever powers that have been upon you they will go back to the center let me tell you I don't believe that there is witchcraft in in Israel upon Jacob he said there is no enchantment there is no witchcraft upon Israel upon Jacob why we are people for his name we try to do it cannot attack us it cannot defeat us because we have a higher power power we have a higher anointing we have a higher [Music] force and when he threw they threw down all their roads with their [Music] enchantments and another one [Music] then Moses cameon said what are we going to do Moses told him you know you remember I'm your God CU God told him you will be a God and be your Prophet so told him you watch so the snakes came with all the demon power if you read demonology a prophet speaks up about demons in religious real and demons in Physical Realm not every demons come in a Physical Realm others come in a religious real someone coming religiously as if they're very spiritual here we have seen some people like that someone is over spiritualizing themselves but when they demon possessed you have to design that this spirit of God or it's a spirit of the devil praise the name of the Lord and so when these Spirits came to attack the road of Moses the Bible says simply opened his mouth simply open his mouth and these ones could just humble themselves just yes sir you want us to go inside there no problem they just enter the mouth and after they enter the mouth of the snake of the serpent of Moses it became a Ro again and he picked it up in other words listen Pharaoh now I possess all the powers of Egypt in my hands and there is no power that can Prevail against me Hallelujah let me tell you brothers and sisters we as the message Believers we possess all the powers of of heaven and on Earth it is in our hands as long as we have the word of God this word of God is above every Power above every principality above every Spirit there is no weapon formed against us the battle is not ours it is the Lord is you find Believers shaken with witchcraft which is nothing to us do you know Africans whatever happens they think they Beed I'm beeded oh brother sister where is your face do you know who you are you go to class you play around with your books and then you fail and then you say I think I was Bewitched yes you fail to be a good sister you are running around with every boy and so boys don't pick you and then he begin saying I think I am Beed all the sisters are refusing me all the jobs are running away from me I am Beed for sure you don't know who you are you don't know who you are you don't know who you are a believer of this message cannot be Beed if you are Beed it means you have not yet been filled with the Holy Spirit number one number two you do not know who you are they will try to I remember even when I was still a little boy of about 12 years I was going to school and I had that Revelation already and you know how many know these things they put in the in the crossroad you know people when people go to which doctors they tell them now you go in the in the Crossroad that's where you should wash all the cures so they go with some hubs and some enchantment they begin Wasing doing enchantments they throw in the crossroad how many know about that you you have old in the city you don't know you know some of you know but you don't want to raise up your and so rumor had it when you jump them without seeing you get elepant is it called you get a very big leg and it can end up busting and so uh we had seen people that had got the same we knew it happens one day I was working with my friends and they told me and then we came across it very early in the morning it was about 6:30 too and then my friends told me you said you believe in God can you jump this thing and then I was tell of course I believe in God of course as I was talking I was still fearing inside there I cannot Sur jump this because I don't want to die but the the man these boys provoked me they said no if you believe in God for sure jump this thing today and then we shall also believe that God is there when this boy provoked me like that but is it's just like I broke into a revelation I said but isn't isn't God surely there I said no I believe God is so I told this boy okay was me and I jumped it and and as soon as I jumped it I began feeling my my my leg tingling I began to feel you know those things like like the Sparks I told him I'm fine I'm fine are you fine are you fine I'm fine but for sure I was feeling already things were beginning to work themselves there I was Anglican but I was part of the Revival of the we believed in prayer so I started praying I said God if you are there in heaven prove to me now by not ashaming me before my friends so as we were walking I was behaving as if I'm feeling nothing but for sure things were operating themselves inside there but friends by the time we reached school I had even forgotten about it nothing happened to me nothing absolutely the leg did not buge out and let me tell you I believe from that time that God is God and is greater than witchcraft hallelujah amen our God is greater than enchantments never fear such when go when when you know when you when God reveals to you something like that of course they will try to attack the Believers they will try to attack but because they try to attack it doesn't mean they will prevail you have to take your position as a Believer and say I don't believe that I can be Beed tell your neighbor don't believe I can be Beed I am a royal priesthood I am a holy nation I am a people of God I am the for his name no power of hell no power of Darkness can Prevail against man amen hallelujah yes so we don't that's why we don't respect those kind of rituals of our cultures we don't respect them we only respect the culture or cultural norms that agree with the word that's why we don't they call it busting don't do that we don't death because those cultur those Norms are against the scripture the only one that has power to bust death is God himself and he did on the cross and he said is finished so that is a deception of the enemy and we don't do those rituals tell you now you put this on your mouth now do like this and now you speak like this Believers Never be a part of that when you go to BU someone they tell you oh now you have to do this you have to put this one if you don't do that when a child is born now you take this bit put it around around the West you know this child will be loved she's a girl she will grow very well every man will be attracted that is rubbish believe that we don't do those things we don't believe in those kind of things why we are a royal priesthood we are holy nation we are different Hallelujah and we have come in this world to take over Hallelujah we have come to take over our culture is the super culture our rest is the super rest am I preaching to a Believer here tonight amen our rest is the super rest our tribe is the best Hallelujah we are Christians that is who we are we are believers of the message that is who we are my my my my what we have is more powerful so whatever you see before your eyes as Moses was seeing those serpents I can tell you it is potentially under your feet sometimes it is not it's not how many symptoms you see you see you are sick you see you see you see you see you see sometimes not how many signs the devil you know performs before you before your eyes you know but what you see before your eyes those serpents those that enemy before your eyes by faith I want you to say tonight it is under my feet amen what what you are is more powerful you know and this is how we fight our battles believer we fight our battles like that hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord Genesis 474 man I spent a lot of time on that but probably someone needed that for 7 says they said moreover unto Pharaoh for to s in the land are we come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the famine is so in the land of Canaan now there we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of Goan now this we talked a little bit about this on the and the fullness thereof is the Lord the Hebrews wanted Goan because it was the best of the land of Egypt later on it would become the place of their slavery they suffered in what appeared to be a blessing of God but you you see they did not know that this suffering was not going to be permanent they did not know the best was yet to come they did not know these people these people the ones that were going to be in G they were the people of the convenant they did not know God had a plan amen my God as they were before them crying that they wanted go before and even let me tell you even at that time when they thought they desired and they needed gion even if Pharaoh wanted he could not tell them no while you are still here on Earth whatever you desire as a child of God the devil even if he wanted he cannot say no all the earth and the goodness thereof is the L and and and and and you know and you know like like the Israelites like the Jews we today the place where we have been found sometimes you get a job and then the job begins giv you suffering and sometimes you go into a marriage and beginning getting questions and trouble here trouble there you know I always say this the Jews while they were in gion Pharaoh would look in the window after a while this a pharaoh who never knew Joseph you look in the window what did he see slaves look at this when Moses came the prophet of God he looked through the same window what did he see the elect the people of God hallelujah hallelujah the denominations have called us what whatever they have called us they called us Pentecost Full Gospel angan Catholic poor they've called us poor that we come from a poor family that's what they've called us that's why the world has called but what does the message call us God has sent us a prophet in our generation and by the way this message has told us things who we are and said my people shall know who they are and what they stand for there shall be an invisible Army an army which cannot be defeated which means everything will try to fight you last will try to fight you yes the word will try to fight even your own flesh will try to fight but let me tell you they cannot Prevail again amen and even when all your culture and tribe and whatever they say you are poor never let me tell you never accept such testimon no child of God is poor by the virtue of the fact that you believe the message of the [Music] hour you have great spiritual riches which are able also to translate into physical riches Moses would look in the same window and we would see theant people of God what this message has told us that we are the people of God he said one time the prophet came up and he said I now no longer call you bride I call you his wife I no longer call you church I call you bride what happened it was God telling us who we are hallelujah hallelujah and as they were exiting Egypt in Exodus 11 they had to eat bitter HS each house had to eat a lamb they had to eat UNL bread whatever God told them through Moses they had to do if we are willing and an interested to exit this world do I have people here willing to go in the rapture if we are will to say to the word goodbye we should obey this message we should amen submit oursel to the word of God to refuse the word is a sin Let Me emphasize on this a little bit can you read 1 Samuel 15: 23 first Samuel 1523 for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou H has rejected the word of the Lord he has also rejected thee from being [Music] King if God did God speak to Moses did he have that say the Lord it is the word of God did God speak to William BR you that say the Lord that is the word of God and that it for every believer so we as Believers are not supposed to debate with every part of the word with any part of the [Music] word when says under no circumstance should beli unbeliever believe say say young people you should say Amen it's a word of God and you find a brother wanting to marry a Catholic you find a sister getting married to a Muslim saying after all he loves me who told you is the basis of marriage the basis of marriage is God when we say the best of marriage is love we mean God because the says God is love amen if the other person has no God in them then they don't love you genuinely the love they have will fail but the love of God never fails charity never fails that is the love of God but the other types of love will fail if every believer could follow that we would have few divorces but why do people's love for each other faint why because they do not have God in in them the love of God is not in them the love of God is in you the more you dislike each other the more you love each other because you have some stronger Force within each of you bringing it together that is the force of God God is love himself and that cannot fail but you see you find people getting attracted to each other because of their looks not because of God but to rebel against the word is as a sin of Witchcraft stubbornness is as iniquity and [Music] idolatry so you find people that you can preach the message too they hear it you say Believers says fornication should never be mentioned among [Music] you and someone hears that and says it's not a big deal is not a big deal that is stubborness that is rebellion you've taken the word of God in vain we must fear God brethren how do you fear God by taking his word serious we must fear God by taking his word serious by being ready to live for his word for him I have no life to live for myself I have no life of my own you think you have a life no all you have is this flesh flesh is just soil it is just magots today you have it tomorrow you don't did you know that it will just go fly away but let me tell you we have a body all those that believe in God and are waiting upon his appearing we have a supernal body that is beyond this natural as body and whenever you believe in the word you are hearing from your theop you are connecting to your spiritual body Hallelujah and one of these days brothers and sisters those of you who have heard the word those of you have believe the word one of these days we are going to walk into those bodies Hallelujah we shall have overcome we are the people for his name we are not here in vain we are not wasting time we are building something we are working into Hallelujah my my my my amen and we notice here the children of Israel reached a place where they had now to cross over you see this is where their faith was tested can they still believe the word that the word cannot guide them into a dead end sister Faith that they had to believe the word cannot guide them into a dead end the word of God cannot do that the Bible says the word of God light unto my feet he leads me in the path of righteousness for as long as you were under the word you submit your entire life to the word and you said not reasoning you say yes to the word in every place to say yes to the word yes to the word yes to the word you believe the word will never lead you to a dead end sometimes like the children of Israel we reach the Red Sea and we feel it is a dead end but let me tell you brother sister when they reach the Red Sea what have you done to us you wanted us to die here as if there were no Toms in the world in the in the denominations you brought me here in the message to die things are not working out you know when I was the denominations things were very well but since I came into the message things have been a bit tough you've come to your Red Sea the Red Sea is a must for every Israelite to go to the promised [Music] land you must come to the oh hallelujah what is the red SE to us the blood of Jesus Hallelujah it was a type of the blood and prophet says in the message believe th this and there when Israel was called out a type of the church Israel was always a type of the church that was the church natural this is the church spiritual they were called out and as soon as they were called out they passed through the Red Sea baptized unto and as soon as they come on the other side they were baptized with the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah picked up a tamb and down at the bank she went dancing Hallelujah hallu yes sir she had a victory did you ever get that much all right she was dancing in the spirit all the daughters of Israel followed her dancing that's why we believe in dancing you believe in dancing in the church let me add that one Hallelujah we don't believe in dancing in the world we believe in dancing in the church when you are dancing you are dancing on top of the Devils on top of the PA of Darkness did you ever get that much she was dancing in the spirit and all the daughters of Israel followed danc Moses stood with and his hands up and sang in the spirit why they laid all those task master they all laid behind them all the old things they ever done and the things that you've done when you see the red blood of Christ you are cleansed from all your sins you too can sing with a Victorious Soul Hallelujah amen thank God for the blood we all came through the Red Sea you remember we read this at the beginning of the year and talked about how when they were crossing the Red Sea the pill of fire was before them showing them the life and they were running they were running through the Red Sea every little one every adult every young they were running let us all run through the Red Sea let me oh hallelujah hallelujah if if you as an adult went through the blood of Jesus and you repented your sins even your children must go through the same process each of us must go through repentance each of us must go through a sanctification amen not only water baptism water baptism is the beginning and it must be baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not father son Holy Spirit but the Lord Jesus Christ is a name above every name and once you baptized like that then he says all your sins that you ever did will be washed away we'll be cleansed from you you'll be sanctified what happens you are going through the Red Sea and as they were going through the Red Sea are you following me as I going through the Red Sea the P of fire was be before them and the Egyptians they TK Masters the last the sin fornication anger witchcraft right the flesh the desires of the flesh the last of the eyes the pride of life it was very bus Ching after them I have to catch him I have to catch the spirit of Lies I have to catch them I have to catch them as they were coming the Bible says the pill of fire changed position Hallelujah the pill of fire changed position went away from before them and came behind them I told the battle is his it is not ours to fight the hallelujah hallelujah don't feel tired don't give up fighting in this Christian battle friend no matter how you feeling it's not about your feel don't give up the fight keep fighting because the battle is his and as they were you know you know going they realized they could not see the P of fire anymore and they felt we are left alone but at that moment that was even none of their concern their concern was we must run to save ourselves they thought they were saving themselves [Music] you can't save yourself it is God fighting behind you let me tell you brother sister if you can't see God in your situation he is right around the corner behind you fighting for you the Bible says the P of fire went behind them and the eyes of God everybody say the of God came right in the pill of fire and looked at the task master looked at all of them and their chariots and the more he looked the more they fell down without anybody touching them I I told you he has armies which are not seen the more he looked more his armies went taking down casting down all evil imaginations all imaginations by a mere look may God look at your enemy tonight Hallelujah may God look at your enemy Hallelujah and as he looked at them all of them were destroyed in one instance and they all drown that pill of fire is with us today by looking why do you think I'm encouraged because I know he's looking at all my powers of Darkness that have been tormenting is looking hallelujah amen and I know I have to be more than a conquer I have to defeat the P of Satan cannot defeat me lost the batt God cannot let the devil win if we on God side when you cross over the real battle now starts but it is not anymore your battle it is still his battle as long as you follow his leadership you will always have the when they cross over amen the B says for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah after you've been Sanctified then he gives you the Holy Ghost and the Bible says now p and began dancing hallelujah hallelujah didn't the devil win oh he didn't let win oh he didn't let devil win oh yeah and as she was singing as she was dancing right there lifting up his hands worshiping God God fill them with God will fill you with the H and when that happens it will give you a joy from within the Bible says is there anyone happy let them sing amen that's why when you have the Holy Ghost he will give you a new song he will give you Joy in your heart no matter what you're going through you may not have a shing in your [Music] pocket like me right here now but you have a lot of Joy I have no but I'm so happy because he saved me I'm so happy because if he comes now I'm going in the Rapture I'm feeling so good right
