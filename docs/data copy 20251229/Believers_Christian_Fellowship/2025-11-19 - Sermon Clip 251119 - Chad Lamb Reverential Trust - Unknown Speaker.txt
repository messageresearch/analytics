========================================

when Tamar, amen, put on the the veil and the and the clothes of harlotry and she went to DO WHAT SHE FELT LIKE SHE NEEDED to do for redemption for the seed line. Amen. She went to play the harlot with Judah. You realize she come to a point of no turning back. &gt;&gt; SHE COME TO A PLACE WHEN SHE MADE UP HER MIND AND MADE HER DECISION. THAT WAS NOT A HALFHEARTED DECISION. THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THAT HALF-HEARTEDLY. YOU CAN'T DO THAT HALFWAY. THAT WAS A FULLON 100% COMMITMENT. I'M GOING ALL the way. This is the only hope for me. THIS IS THE ONLY CHANCE THAT I'VE GOT. IF IT'S NOT THIS, THEN I'LL BE LEFT DESTITUTE AND I'VE got a right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To that seed line, &gt;&gt; she went. Amen. She did what she had TO DO. SHE ASKED for the TOKENS THAT SHE ASKED FOR. AMEN. But when it came time for JUDGMENT TO BE PASSED THREE MONTHS LATER, word had come, SHE'S A HARLOT. SHE'S GOING TO BE STONED. Judah pronounces judgment. Bring her here and burn her. I &gt;&gt; mean, she comes to Judah. Listen, all she does is lay out the tokens. &gt;&gt; She doesn't argue. She doesn't persuade. She doesn't beg. She doesn't do anything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She said, "I'm pregnant by the man who owns these. You discern whose these are." &gt;&gt; Yeah. basically saying, "You decide whether I'm righteous or not." &gt;&gt; She had to trust in Judah to be a righteous judge. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because if Judah protected himself and he covered it up and he lied, she was being burnt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But Judah is the judging tribe. Judah is the king tribe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is the lion of the tribe of Judah, the judge, the righteous judge. And here I in the story of Ruth, Boaz is playing the part of Christ. &gt;&gt; In the judges here, Judah is playing the part of Christ as the judge to judge righteously. Amen. And he looks at the tokens and he realizes, Amen, this woman is more righteous than I. And he declares her virtuous. He declares her sinless. He declares her right. Amen. Why? She came. What? What was her s salvation? She came to the point of no return. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the way I believe this message, friends. It's the point of no return. There is no halfway believing the truth. Amen. Brother BM's a prophet. He's right about this, but he's wrong about this. And he got some of these things right, but I don't understand about that. And I'll still take my own idea on these things, and I want to mix it with what I feel about that. Hey, that's going to make you miserable. &gt;&gt; But if we come to this message, we got to come like Ruth coming to Boaz. And we got TO COME LIKE TAMAR giving herself completely up. Amen. her reputation and everything, giving it completely up for redemption, for the right to receive the seed from the seedgiver himself. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Trusting in his character, not mine. &gt;&gt; Trusting in the character of Boaz, trusting in the character of Judah, and now I trust in the character of Christ, who is the messenger, who is the bridegroom, who is the headship, who is the word that's been restored. I've seen enough to know he's trustworthy.
