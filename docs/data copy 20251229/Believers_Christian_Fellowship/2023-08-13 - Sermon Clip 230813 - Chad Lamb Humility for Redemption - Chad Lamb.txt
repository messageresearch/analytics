========================================

in order to manifest Christ the first thing I need to do is make myself of no reputation that sounds easy I mean that rolls right off the tongue but that's one of the hardest things for a human being to do it is so hard in this word that says make himself of no reputation this word reputation means actually means nothing it means be void to be empty to be nothing he made himself void empty nothing he made himself absolutely nothing and took on him the form of a servant so if I'm going to follow after Christ I need to make myself I'm supposed to have this mind that was in him this is the mind I'm supposed to have which who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God Amen we know that this is part of the mindset understanding where we came from understanding that where we originated understanding that we were part of God and with God before the foundation of the world that's part of this understanding but being that that's part of the understanding it's almost like it's foundational for the next part Because unless you get the first part you'll never be able to come to the second part because only those that are part of God can take the nature of God and make themselves of no reputation because Lucifer can't do that humans of themselves can't do that amen because that whole nature of Lucifer got injected in humanity at the fall he found through the serpent a way that he can inject himself into the human race and with that he brought Pride with that he brought arrogancy with that he brought all of these uh other things self-preservation and all of these things was entered into Humanity right there amen and without without a revelation that I was before I came in Fallen flesh I was I was part of God I was one of his attributes part of his thinking he had a design and desire to express me in this life now I've fallen into hybrid condition but this hybrid condition will not Define me because my existence was before the hybrid condition so I will not let the Fallen nature Define who I am I will not let the flesh control me amen because this part of me that's been awakened by the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been quick in the life that part was somewhere before it came into this vessel and it was part of this God this divine nature this Supreme Being so there it carries with it characteristics from God
