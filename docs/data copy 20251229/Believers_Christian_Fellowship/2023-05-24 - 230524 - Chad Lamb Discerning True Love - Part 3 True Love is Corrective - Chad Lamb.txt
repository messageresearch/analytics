attention on you and may we give you our full heart and our dedication all of our Focus Lord may you come now Lord and break the bread of life and feed your sheep for you are the great Shepherd Lord and we are your sheep and I pray you come and use this vessel Lord as a tool in your hand knowing that you might get all the glory and might you might speak Eternal words to these lips of clay for we yield ourselves to you for that purpose and may you give us all ears to hear and a heart to perceive what you want to speak to us tonight may you take preeminence among us we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you we're going to let you take your seats for just a moment and then we'll stand and go to the scripture I just wanted to give you a little update on our trip down to Junction City we had a wonderful time I've got a few pictures that I want to show you um we really are enjoying this group of Believers down there these new Believers as you know they left the Amish Church some time ago and they were they were meeting together and then brother Levi Yoder had witnessed to one of the men here brother Irvin Ray Miller and they they received the message one and more we remember when we went and saw Jesse Smith baptized 17 of them and they're continuing on so Brother Kyle was there last month to minister to him amen they've been traveling around visiting and and we were had the opportunity to go last Sunday and this is the three-car garage that Brother Kyle told you about and they're in here and this is where they are worshiping the Lord and receiving the word and I've got a little clip here of the singing [Music] and [Applause] where it is [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] amen I enjoyed that and so we had a nice service there and then I was surprised when Levi showed up he told me that we have baptisms today so we baptized three more souls in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so here they set up the baptism outside it was an absolutely beautiful day here at this is Brother Howard's home where they have the meetings and that baptismal tank is the same one that Levi and his family were baptized in the same one that we used to baptize Arlee stutzman and he he brought it again to baptize these three Believers and this was a good investment he made in a horse trough amen and so you can see brother Levi and his wife there and some of the Saints there gathered around as we started talking on water baptism and this is the first man Brother Marlin the first two brothers Brother Marlin and brother Matthew they were two individuals that brother Levi has been witnessing to and brother Levi witnessed to him brought him to the meetings amen they ended up driving to the meetings and mother Marlin had a truck and he brought the baptismal tank so he brought his own baptism with that the tank for his own baptism so it was really neat and so we baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then this young brother Matthew we baptized him as well and then the Sister Mary Sister Mary her husband Eli is the one standing there right in the front of the picture uh Eli came down and was baptized with the group of 17 that got baptized he's not part of the Junction City Group he lives an hour and a half north and she didn't come at that time and so she came today this time this past Sunday and after we baptized the two men I knew we were going to baptize them because Levi had told me when we got there but at the end I just opened it up for anybody else that liked to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and she said I'd like to be baptized and so that was exciting we baptized her and I just love that smile on her face as she's taken baptized and joining her husband in the revelation of the word and so God was certainly very good to us and we appreciate God's grace and his mercy and what he's doing he's definitely doing a stirring in that area that community and it's exciting to see and and it's done in such a way that nobody can get credit for it it's just something God has done sovereignly but I'm so thankful that we've been able to witness it and see it because it's been a thrill it's been exciting to see so we really appreciate Brother Kyle staying home and ministering here for us on Sunday I had an opportunity to watch the service and I enjoyed it it was really good I also enjoyed brother Isaiah's special so I'm glad he was in the service and some of his family as well so that was good he also texted me and told me he enjoyed the service and enjoyed being here let's turn to First John chapter 4. I'm going to continue on with a thought Discerning true love this will be part three and um as so often happens when you look at something it expands and God just dropped a few things in my heart several weeks ago on Discerning True Love on the subject and and for me when it drops in it's almost like I see the whole picture all of a sudden it opens to a whole nother level it's not all new things it's things we've talked about many times amen but it's on a whole new level amen and and so when that happens my my natural tendency the natural man Chad is to put it all in one package and preach it and one two and a half three hour sermon but I don't want to do that amen I want to stop and take bite-sized pieces because I want to I want to resist my own natural tendency amen because I see it as a picture I want to preach it as one picture but it doesn't always work that way so I've been forcing myself to slow down and thankful that I have because it keeps me in that channel and keeps me looking so today we're going to look at Discerning true love part three I start with first John chapter 4 verse 7. we've been reading this scripture all along first John chapter 4 verse 7. beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love so when we want to look at the subject of Love of true love God is love it's not something different than God or in addition to God it God is love and this kind of love is God verse 9 in this was manifest the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him hearing is love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if we if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no man hath seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he had given us of his spirit amen God bless you as your seed and it will take a moment and look at this scripture for a little bit I love the the end of this if we go down to uh verse 12 again no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us so if we love one another with this genuine true love then God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us and this word perfected means to come to maturity or come to fullness and so it's showing that his love is perfected in US so so God's love is coming to a full manifestation as his love by his spirit is coming into us as individuals and causing a common Bond of love between the attributes of God which are the children of God so it's not just a Commandment that we try to be nice to one another no no this is God Amen the love of God being perfected in us coming to full maturity to full display coming to the Finish amen is when God's love in US reaches out to one another and is reciprocal amen then the love of God is perfected in US amen so when we preach these things we're not preaching them as something amen that we must try harder to obtain although we should try I hope you understand that we're not saying that we don't try but our efforts will fail it's something that we surrender to this is the love of God should have brought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost and so it's not our love being exercise it's his love being manifest through us so what do we do amen we must recognize and that's why I I was preaching on Discerning true love because sometimes it's so difficult to discern between filio love and agape love amen sometimes our emotions get entangled and we want to know we want to discern what kind of love this is so we can discern what's going on around us but also we can discern what's going on within us because sometimes it's hard for us to discern but when we understand how true love acts and how amen a filio love acts we can begin to discern that this isn't true love this is me this is my emotion this is my feeling but this isn't the love of God that way we can die to that kind of love and yield to the other kind of love and let it flow through us so it's not a putting on something or climbing to attain something but it's moving the false out of the way and dying to it to let the true come forth so we have to have a level of discernment even for ourselves so I want to read this again no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he has given us of his spirit this love comes by his spirit if we love one another then God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US praise God so now I want to jump up to the the middle of this verse in verse 9. verse 9 and this was manifested the love of God toward us so God loved us but that love took on a manifestation so that love was was declared that love was went from the invisible to the visible amen and and it says and this was manifest the love of God towards us because that God's sin has only begotten son unto the world that we might live through him so the manifestations of God's love is god making a sacrifice God giving of himself god-giving for us not asking us to give for him but him giving for us herein is the love of God made manifest so then if we are to love one another as God loves us and God's God's love is perfected in us because his spirit dwelleth in us then we should be sacrificing for one another man it's that simple so let's read this again and this was manifest the love of God towards us because that God's sin has only begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is Love This is Love This is how you see love not that we love God but that he loved us and send his son to be the propitiation for our sins so we go to Discerning true love this is a big part of discerning it here in his love this is love this is true love not that we love God but that he loved us and gave his son to be the propitiation for our sins because God loved he gave he so loved the world he gave and if we are to love one another then we need to be giving amen we need to be sacrificing amen for one another not demanding that everyone around us sacrifice for us but that we sacrifice for everyone around us now if you have a body of Believers which the body of Christ is a body of Believers and they all take that nature of God by the spirit of God and everyone is sacrificing then there's no lack there's not like you're sacrificing and nothing's coming in return no I'm sacrificing for the Brethren but the Brethren are also sacrificing for me not because I require them to do so I require nothing for my love my love will sacrifice my feelings my time my efforts for them amen but because God's in them they will sacrifice their efforts their time their feelings for me that's why this works so well in the marriage amen because if you ever have a marriage that is lopsided where one has a perverted love amen and is requiring the other to always meet my need meet my need meet my need meet my need amen that's not how you get your needs met the way you get your needs met is by meeting their needs it sounds it sounds opposite amen it sounds opposite to what the reality is but I do not get my needs met by requiring somebody meet my needs I get my needs met by meeting my wife's needs and when I meet my wife's needs by sacrificing my energy my time my feelings my whatever for her then now I have energized her to be free to express the love that's in her back to me it's a reciprocating love and gone amen we love him because he first loved us God didn't just stand and demand that we love but God first demonstrated love and in the demonstration of sacrificial love he gets a return of sacrificial love not because he demands it but because he gave and so in our homes even with our children amen it's not that we demand that they love us it's that we we sacrifice and God's love is perfected in us and we give and here in his love not that we loved him but he loved us and gave here is the manifestation of God's love that he sent his only begotten son so what is the manifestation of our love and our love manifested our love given will bring a reciprocating love but when we when we make demands on the people that we love I demand you meet my need I require you love me I demand this and demand that amen then then the person who is under those demands automatically understands that this something is wrong inside them they may not be able to verbalize it they may not be able to articulate what's going on but there's a repulsion inside because this is not the way God loves so now all of a sudden that repulsion amen and it looks like they're unloving it's not that they're unloving it's that this is a perverted love a pure love is a giving love but that pure law of giving Will Find a reciprocation and that's reciprocation won't won't need requirements demands it won't need any of that those things will come by free will if our marriages will begin to reflect the relationship between Christ and his bride this is the kind of nature that our marriages will take this is the kind of nature our families will take and we don't preach these things as if they're impossible they're not impossible this is the reality that God wants us to live in and do we live in hybrid flesh yes does our flesh get in the way yes will we make mistakes absolutely and we'll have to come to a repentance and make that right amen but this is where God is bringing us to amen this kind of love I believe that with all my heart I believe that this is the work of God in this day not my work it's the work of God but I must recognize the day that I live in and the hour and the word that's to be fulfilled and deny everything contrary to it and let that word flow through me the prophet of God he begins to refer here to Peter we won't go and read and and Peter where he says by these promises uh we were made partakers of the divine nature and and it starts to to show the progression of the nature all the way up to the headship which is Charity which is love and in Blasphemous names the prophet of God says first foundationally is faith second add to your faith virtue to your virtue Knowledge from knowledge Temperance from Temperance patience to patience godliness and from godliness Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and then love being the Capstone seven of those things seven Church ages see and seven stars of the church ages and all of it is tempered together by the Holy Spirit now that's what it takes to become a servant of Christ Christ built his church in seven Church ages his bride a person a woman a church what has God been building through seven Church ages what are the virtues about what is the divine nature about God is building a person and he's building her by these Divine Natures by the divine nature by these attributes and he's building her all the way up into completion which will be the capping which will be him himself which will be love so he says now that's uh seven churches you see seven stars of the church and it's all tempered together by the Holy Ghost and that's what it takes to become a servant of Christ Christ builds his church in seven Church ages his purse his bride a person woman Church seven Church ages constitute and make the bride so what what makes the bride the divine nature built through seven Church ages and capped by him that constitutes the bride coming into the reflection of Jesus Christ let's turn to Matthew chapter five Matthew chapter five we're going to begin reading in verse 43. you have heard that it has been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that you that that ye may be children of your father why is he telling us to do these things because that's what God does and if you want to be like God this is how you become like God amen let's read it again in verse 44 but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise in the evil and the good and sendeth Reign on the just and on the unjust for if if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the public is the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public and so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect Jesus is Calling them to a higher order he's calling them to be like God and in order to be like God God sends the rain sends the sun and the rain on the just and the unjust amen God's not waiting to to do good until good is done to him but even when the evil is done to him he continues to sustain life he continues to keep the world in its place he continues to keep the seasons in place he continues and continues and continues even when he gets no love and Jesus is telling us do these things so that you may be like your father which is in heaven so if we want to be like God you know when when I remember growing up as a boy amen and all of a sudden you'd go to church and talk about love and love and be nice and this and that I mean I was tuned out because as a boy I wanted to be a warrior a soldier I wanted to be anything but a loving nice little sweet kind but this kind of love is tough this kind of love amen is not a sisified feeling love this kind of love will have you swallow your feelings and move forward contrary to the way you feel and contrary to what's convenient and it pushes you out into the battle for us and get sends you out there to get stoned again to get slapped again to get knocked down again to be rejected one more time this is not a sisified love this is not a heart on Valentine's Day kind of love amen this is real genuine love the same kind God has and and and and Jesus is here instructing him his his disciples don't do like this do like this if you want to be like your father and I say this is the this is the hour for us to manifest the very Life of Christ Christ was the mystery of God revealed the mystery God was shrouded in the mystery no man had seen God at any time amen God was shrouded in a mystery and here God comes down in flesh and his son Jesus Christ and that flesh man was the manifestation of God and God was manifest in Jesus Christ and Christ is the mystery of God revealed amen but now the bride has been taken out of his side at Calvary and she's been grown and built through those virtues over seven Church ages and she's coming into Perfection not Perfection as Flawless Perfection as complete mature whole a finished product brother Venom says as long as we live in these bodies we'll have a sticky conquerber nature that's going to bother us I don't believe that I'm not I'm not expecting to become Flawless I'm expecting to become mature finished work complete amen one God that says that's what I'm looking for amen not not that I've never in my life made a mistake or I get to a point where I'll never make a mistake I don't know if we'll get there or not we might get there 30 seconds before the change of the body I don't know but what I do believe is we're going to come into this picture amen of the stature of the perfect man we're going to have these virtues living through us it's going to be manifest in a body on Earth which is the bride and the bride will be the mystery of Christ made manifest is this Christ was the mystery of God the bride will be the mystery of Christ May manifest the rest of his body on Earth connected to the Head living the same life brother Branham says in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed so now there is what I'm trying to say to you this is the portion from pick up your pen and write the angel dictated or actually moved his hand said now here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction brings forth of its kind Genesis 1 11. these last days true church bride comes through the headstone will be the Super Church a super race as the nearest the great headstone they will be much like so much like him even they will be in his very image in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations can never produce this why is it denominations can't produce this because denominations don't have the correct word and the word is the word is spirit in life so without the correct word you can't get the right spirit and Life to manifest that word but the word Jesus said the words that I speak unto thee they are spirit and they are alive so when the words of Christ come forth when the anointed word for the hour comes forth it brings with it the very spirit in life it takes to manifest that word that's why denominations can't produce that they're the wrong seed they're a mongrel hybrid seed mixed with man's ideas not the pure word and not the word for the day amen but when you come to the word for the day it has spirit in life why do we come to preaching week after week after week after week amen and and sometimes we hear same same things or similar things over and over it's because there's a casting of the seed God's word is a seed Amen in his casting and casting and at one point amen at one point it may have fallen off of us and hit the one next to us but at some point it's going to fall into our good ground that's prepared to receive that seed and it's going to bring forth a harvest when it's watered by amen the spirit the spirit will bring life to that word amen so why do we preach we don't we're not preaching Amen to try to get people to do better and be better and work harder and attain something that's not the point of preaching the point of preaching is to bring the word that has the life and has the spirit to produce the life of the word and so it must be preached because there's a power in the spoken word of God and that word Must Fall in good ground and it must be watered by the spirit of God and it will bring forth the life so we come to preaching to get more of the life and see well I mean now I have to do this and I've got all these things that I have to do no all you have to do is receive the word by faith and say that ain't nothing but the truth let it be in me that way God that's what I want I can't produce it but I'm going to get everything I can out of the way so it can come praise God so this bride is coming into this image this is this is the hour we live in France we're not waiting for another generation to finish this is the generation that will finish these scriptures so the the fivefold ministry is here for the edification of the body for the preaching of the Gospel till we all come into the unity of Faith until we're built into the stature of a perfect man so the preaching of the Gospel is so that we all come into this picture which is Christ manifest in Flesh on Earth that's what we're preaching for but not in the way of you have to you measure up here's the line no this is the word receive it and let it go to work amen Matthew 22 let's turn to Matthew 22 together I still haven't got to my subject for tonight but just in the review as we were talking the last couple of services we were talking about true love sacrifices the lover for the loved we saw that and and God we saw that with Christ true love sacrifices the lover for the loved perverted love sacrifices the loved For the Lover so perverted love requires you to make the sacrifice for me but true love will allow me to make the sacrifice for you and then the last service we preached was love seeks the best for its recipient love seeks the best for its recipient and and we made the statement true love will allow the love to suffer for the greater good so with true love the object of my love the object of My Affection I can allow it to suffer for the greater good a perverted love won't do that but a true love will because that's the kind of love God has and so now when we come to tonight I'd like to talk on love is corrective and it goes right in line with what we were talking about uh the last time but let's first look here at Matthew 22 verse 35. then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him saying Master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets you want to come to the Fulfillment of the word we come to this love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and love thy neighbor as thyself amen let's go to Romans 13. and we'll see where Paul refers to this Romans 13. in verse 8. Romans 13 and 8. oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law for this thou shall not commit adultery thou shall not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not covet if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law it's that simple all the law the ordinances the Commandments all the that that Moses had turned over to the Levites to teach the children of Israel all of that is fulfilled in these two great Commandments the great commandment and the one next to it is love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and love thy neighbor as thyself and then Paul picks it up and says now all of these Commandments don't commit adultery don't steal don't bear false witness don't do any of these these are all fulfilled if you love your neighbor as yourself you won't commit adultery you won't bear false witness you won't lie you won't steal you won't covet you won't do any of these things if you have the right kind of love amen that's why love is so much higher than the law amen that's why there's a law of Love which supersedes all other laws because the law was a way for man to recognize he couldn't do it that was the purpose of the law the Apostle Paul tells us so the law was perfect there's no problem with the law the problem was with flesh so the law was there to show man that he couldn't do it amen he needed something greater amen than just his ability to keep the law he needs the love of God should have brought in his heart by the Holy Ghost to where the Fulfillment of the law is love because love will not do ill to its neighbor and love will not reject God and do ill towards God and if we have the right kind of love that will not reject God and will not uh uh disrespect God and will not do ill to a neighbor then we don't have to worry about any rules amen because all rules will be fulfilled in this one praise God amen so love is the fulfilling of the law now in the message Christ is revealed in his own word he says I've been this week down in this country staying with some very dear friends I asked some of them at the table yesterday when we was eating we always sit around and have like a little study on the Bible we was talking about love so brother bear I'm sitting around the table fellowshipping with some friends and he begins talking about love that's the subject they're studying and here's what he said and there was a certain person said to me he said I believe you're an antichrist remember the subject is love they're doing a little bible study on love somebody said I made a statement that they somebody had said about him I believe you're the Antichrist you're an antichrist I said if that would be pleasing to my Lord that's what I want to be I want to be whatever he wants me to be I love him and if he should cast me into hell I still will love him if I go with the same spirit I have now he looked at me kind of strange I seen four or five of them there young men young wives fine women I knowed how them boys loved their wives so I said to them I said here's the way to test it if your wife before you were married now you go back say this married life you've been dreaming you were married you really wasn't married but you dreamed you were and you woke up and you went in and talked it over with your girlfriend and said you know I dreamed that we were married and we had children we live happy and waiting for the coming of the Lord and everything and then this girl would say to you you know I love another man better than I love you I could be happier with the other man could you from your heart love her well enough to say God's blessing rest upon you my dear go with this other man you tell me Love is Easy love is hard now this is my brother says now check that each of you men or you women say well if you love if your love is correct you would do that for you are interested in her welfare that's true love interested in the other that's true love what you know you know you could have her you can live with her she's your wife she will be she'll marry you but she won't be happy she would be happier and then if you love her then you want her to be happy therefore whatever the will of God is let God's will be done whether I'm happy with it or not I want to live so he will be pleased with what I do therefore check your objective and your motive by that you know whether you love God or not what if he'd say you serve me and I'm going to cast you away I love you anyhow but I remember showing us what true love is and he brings it into a practical application and he takes these these uh four or five young men and their wives who love their wives love these women but he said that correct love if you weren't married yet and before you got engaged before you come to marriage she confesses she would love somebody else if you have pure love you would want her to be happy and pure love to God wants what pleases God not what pleases self so he's taking one to show the other amen if I love God there's billions of people who claim to love God Amen but really they love themselves because they love what God can do for them they love a God who will heal they love a God who will deliver they love a God and we certainly do love a God who will do all of those things but sometimes God Amen will ask us to do things we don't want to do and sometimes God will allow us to pass through trials we don't want to pass through and what do we do then when the God we love amen is actually asking us to do something that will please him and serve his purpose but we don't want to do it now and everything in US is resisting this thing that God has willed and determined for our life amen what does true love do true love says not my will but thy will be done true love says whatever is pleasing to my father is what I want to do and so there's there's many times in life that we pass through things we don't want to do amen but God knows the end from the beginning and he knows what's coming next so he is always looking to the Future amen let's go to James chapter 2. James chapter 2 verse 8. uh James two and eight if you fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture what is the Royal the Royal law Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself if you fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you do well James calls this the Royal law this is the Great Law the law of love problem of God says now look I don't want to criticize I love you in genuine true love always is corrective remember we talked about last time that that that love seeks the best for its recipient and if love truly seeks the best for its recipient amen then love will do what it takes to bring the best for the recipient and many times sometimes that's correction sometimes correction is what's best that's true for our children and that's true in many ways here's a few things brother bam says he says and then the strange thing how that his great wise Providence how he works things how he works things out seems like that love has a funny feeling to it not a feeling but a reaction saying love has a funny reaction to it and when I look out amongst the people as he called me to be a servant and I look out amongst the people and I see sin creeping in then I have to just tear in there with all that's in me you see to tear it out and that makes it look hard to me to my way of looking at it why to say those things but yet down at the bottom true love runs like that true love so even brother himself he says sometimes it looks like it's so hard to my way of thinking when I see sin creeping in I gotta re I gotta go in there and tear it out amen that's the reaction of love so sometimes love has a as a funny reaction to it and that's the reaction of love and he types it to a family now to a mom or dad he says now your little boy or little girl was playing on the street where cars are running and you knew sooner or later they're going to get hurt now he says why Papa I want to be out here would you say bless your little heart junior you just go right ahead and play in the street that's not a real daddy if you have to jerk that little fellow up and give him a spanking scold him tie him up anything else keep him off the street he'll get killed is that right well that's the way you have to do with the gospel you have to shake and push and try to do everything you can to keep the people lined up and I hope everybody understands that way I'm trusting I love this statement I'm trusting that someday after it's all over and then when the veils are taken from before our face we will understand then sometimes statements seem so hard and it seems like some services are so hard and some things are are are are are set in such a hard way and brother bam himself says sometimes I think it's hard in my way of thinking amen but he says down at the bottom of it is true love someday when the veil's taken away I'm sure a little child at home when Mom and Dad bring a correction and they bring a chastisement and that little fella goes to his room and he's sulking he's crying in his bottom stinging and he's feeling like nobody in the world loves him and he doesn't understand why it has to be this way amen when that little fellow becomes an adult the veil is taken away and he recognizes I'm thankful for that that's what I needed and I needed that that's what Brother Bear I'm saying someday when this Veil is taken away we'll understand then let's go to Proverbs chapter 19. Proverbs chapter 19. verse 18. Proverbs 19 and 18. chasten thy son while there is hope and let thought thy Soul spare for his crying boy this is a tough scripture very tough scripture chasing thy Soul while there's hope you've got to do it while there's time while there's a chance don't put it off Chase and I said well there's hope and let not thy Soul spare for his crying he's crying don't even let yourself pull back don't let yourself spare don't do that because why you've got his best interest in mind long term that's true love and that's parenting with true love you know we talked before I think it was a couple Services ago about sometimes you know how a grandmother or grandfather or somebody can interfere amen and there's discipline that needs to happen to a child and Grandma will get away say oh don't do it don't how can you do it or there's nothing wrong they're fine they're fine that's not love and when the statement's made I just can't stand to see him punished well who Do You Love More yourself or the one who needs it that's a perverted self-love that's a love that says it pains me to see proper discipline I'm not talking about improper discipline I'm talking about proper discipline it pains me so I want you to forego the proper discipline to spare me any pain and suffering in my emotional realm and I tell you that is a human perverted love that's not the love of God the love of God you'll hurt absolutely you'll hurt You'll wish it didn't have to happen you'll cringe you'll wins you'll leave the room you'll go outside you'll do whatever you have to do but you won't interfere with what's best for that child that goes for a mom and dad both ways amen amen we have to sometimes do the hard thing take the higher Road amen because of love because of pure love let's go to proverbs 23. verse 13. Proverbs 23 verse 13. withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die Thou shalt beat him with the rod and shall deliver his soul from hell what is the objective what is the objective the objective is salvation the objective is character the objective is is driving away a rebellious Spirit a rebellious the spirit is as the sin of witchcraft amen so you're driving away and keeping at Bay those spirits that want to take over why because you've got a destination in mind you're you're trying to prevent them from Hell amen and so you're willing to do what you don't even want to do you're willing to do what they don't want you to do in order to do what's best that's true love amen we find so many there's an absolute total failure in parenting in our day you look around the world there's an absolute total failure in parenting we've talked about it before but I mean how many times you hear the kid out of control in the grocery store I don't hear it anymore because I refuse to go to the grocery store absolutely out of control demanding things I want this I want this I want that and and Mom finally snaps and she yells and if you don't stop that I'm going to this that and that and they continue on and you hear her say that five six seven eight nine ten times but she never does anything I I I'm just going to make this statement and and it could get me in a lot of trouble but that is a perverted love that woman loves herself more than she loves that child because if she loved that child and had a long-term vision for that child she would leave her grocery cart parked where it was take the little child out to the vehicle and hopefully it's a van with tinted windows do what needs to be done to drive that spirit away and bring Harmony back into the relationship and bring some Mission and drive away Rebellion bring the child back and set it in the car amen and push it on through amen and finish getting the groceries there is absolutely no reason amen you cannot take your children to the grocery store when I hear parents say I can't take them to the grocery store then you failed as a parent because if you can't spend an hour hour and a half grocery shopping and your child sit in the car stand next to it amen we used to make our children they had the when they were little they had to hold on to the cart and they weren't allowed to let go unless they had permission why because we hated him no because we loved them we didn't want to lose them in the store so you tell me I can't take him no you can't take him because you don't want to go through the hard work of making them listen because you're not building the proper character in a child they meant to be submissive and be obedient which is what they need at that age so that they can go to the next stage of life all right we can't skip these stages and expect everything to work out later amen and how many times have you seen parents amen that that their child is being an absolute brat they're doing something wrong and Mom will see it and act like she doesn't see it turn or try to get in a conversation and act like she or he doesn't see that going on right there and everybody else in the room sees it but that's not the right kind of love because what's happening is amen at you have an opportunity to take care of something and you can't always take care of things right then sometimes you have to defer to later but you can't let those things go mom and dad you can't act like you don't see you act like you don't see so that you don't have to be inconvenienced with stopping your conversation getting out of your seat breaking your fellowship going over and taking care of what needs to be taken care of that's a selfish love but true love does what's best for the recipient of their love what is best what's best is I say excuse me I'll be right back break my fellowship break my conversation stop eating what I'm eating and go take care but my food will be cold but I'm preventing Rebellion from taking hold of my child I've got a long-term Vision here I'll eat plenty of warm meals later but I got to get them through this stage of life I'll eat so many warm meals I'll get tired of them I'll eat them by myself when they're all grown and gone but right now I've got to take care of this because I love them too much to let Rebellion grow I love them too much Amen to let these things go amen and so we have to take care of them so that that that situation of acting like you don't see it and pretending that it's not happening that is not doing that child any good that's only sparing you inconvenience and maybe an uncomfortable situation and an uncomfortable Exchange but it's worth for the soul of that child it's worth being inconvenienced it's worth being made uncomfortable it's worth the difficult situation it's worth the difficult conversation it's worth the embarrassment of having to stop everything and go take your child and take them to the bathroom take them to the car take them home it's worth it that's what love will do love will expend itself for the recipient of love love will will will give up pleasure comfort peace for the one I love you you can't hardly stand to go out in public anymore with the way things are the the way I mean if your children sit at a restaurant talk to you eat their food people buy your meals because they're so impressed and that is supposed to be normal and it's become abnormal amen because uh because there's no more love in the heart of men that's a sign of the end time everything is moved to a perverted love there's so little true love this is a sign of the end time so little true love that you'll sit down to dinner or you're in the grocery store child starts getting to be a brat they need some discipline and they hand them their cell phone to entertain them and all we've done is reinforced the problem and made it worse because now when you're bad and you inconvenience me and you upset me I will reward you with something you want you want a piece of candy if you be quiet if you be quiet I'll give you a piece of candy no you'll be quiet because I said be quiet not because I'm giving you a piece of candy I'm not going to reward you with your little popping bubble game because you've been a brat in the store right because why that might work to get you through the store but what's going to happen when that taller is 14 15 16 years old you tried to get through the store but I mean you're going to have a miserable life because the lack of Love is going to come back to bite you so what works in the natural and the spiritual they they coincide with one another God has our best interest in mind and God has a long-term objective for our life not the short term amen the short the short displeasure the pain the discomfort amen God is not so much discouraged by that he's encouraged by where we're going amen by the direction we're going in and God doesn't withhold chastisement from his children because of the end that he has in mind foreign God said love is corrective if love doesn't correct then it's not love you see your child down on the street and don't give him a little bit of posterior protoplasma stimulation I hope you know the interpretation of that if you don't do that you're not a good dad but a real mother or dad will turn him up and spank him there's the interpretation let him know he's got to get out of the street or perish that's genuine love to say junior dear I don't know you may be you shouldn't be out there at this time of day the end times then the cars are going pretty fast oh nonsense you sisified Preacher Brother ma'am just took it from home right to the pulpit oh nonsense you sisified preacher not the audacity to take God's word and call white white black black right right wrong wrong amen so the scripture is teaching us that love is corrective the prophet's reinforcing them he makes this statement remember now that we're trying to do brother and sister is to come to the house of God as a place of Correction a place where we sit and feed on the word of God and go out different and he says in perfect strength and perfect weakness and that's what we come to church for is to find where our fault is so we we come to church this brother I'm saying in the statement we come to church to find where our faults is but but also when we come the word the word is an encourager and the word is a corrector you can be corrected and encouraged in the same service that's what we come to church for is to find where our faults is and the things that we might better ourselves by if we come to church for any other objective than this I'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church that statement just boggled my mind all of a sudden I thought wait a minute I got to see that again if I'm coming for any other reason but to find my faults brother I said I'm afraid we won't get too much from coming to church if I just come to be told that I'm special do you're the bride you're predestinator you're special God loves you everything's fine you're fine everything's fine everything will be fine it'll always be fine there's no problem with you you're perfect that's not what we come to church for we need to know that because that gives us the encouragement amen that's our destination that's how God sees us it gives us the encouragement to keep going on but what I need to know is where am I blind where am I trampling the word of God where is the devil taking advantage of my emotions so that I can die to that and receive the word amen and let the word flow I need I need the preaching of the Gospel to expose those places in my life where deception is still laying there and I'm not seeing what I'm doing amen so it's not so much that we won't even hear a hard sermon because it's not necessarily A Hard sermon that brings the deepest correction it can be the gentlest sermon but it's the word that brings correction and the word that separates our thinking from God's thinking so it's not all sudden like we have to be hard and harsh and critical and point on every flow no all we got to do is preach the word and the word brings the separation and all of a sudden you say I was thinking wrong that wasn't right that was me that wasn't God I thought it was God but now I see it's me and now I'm going to reject that and receive the word so I want to read this again if we come to church for any other objective then want to find our fault any other objective than this I'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places what if you don't believe you have any bad places amen then you need to spend more time in church we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places so see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's strong then all of a sudden when we find our weakness we find our faults then we find our solution and our strength is him amen let's go to proverbs 13. 24. Proverbs chapter 13. Proverbs 13 verse 24. I'm going to read he that spareth his Rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him be times this word b times means diligently it means sincerely or diligently and so he that spareth is Rod hateth his son that that what seems like love oh I just can't stand I just can't do it I can't bring myself that's not love oh they're so sweet and they didn't mean to yes they meant to it's amazing how little they start to mean to [Laughter] far younger than we ever expected them to be able to mean to but but when we go down that road amen we're really not sparing them we're sparing us and that's a perverted love but if you spare the right if he that spareth his Rod hateth his son that's the Bible that's God's word we spare this Rod he hateth his son but he that loveth him chases him diligently or sincerely or earnestly not harshly not hard not extra firm but with earnestness that I'm taking my responsibility seriously and I tell you it's way better when they're little than when they're standing looking you in the eye it's too late then so I would be sincere and serious and diligent when they're young and if you're sincere and diligent and serious when they're young you will reap a lifetime of benefits from that you will spare their soul from hell and you will see them moving in the right direction because you did what the Bible said to do and you demonstrated true love now I want to be clear and I know you all know this but true love is not it's not angry and spanking your kids because you're in a bad mood you're mad or they made you mad that's selfish love is love is not and that's what happens amen let's go back to the grocery store okay we got mom who's telling her kid you be quiet you'd be quiet stop it and screaming screaming screaming and nothing's happening and we tried the chewing gum trick we tried the counting to 10 or counting the threes and Counting the ten getting red-faced telling them to shut up we've tried all of that and it still doesn't work and you've heard it from the produce to the milk and finally she gets so fed up she reaches over and smacks them that also wasn't love because that's not chastisement that's retribution that's anger that's venting she's still disciplining for herself not for the benefit of that child because she's finally come to a Breaking Point and now she's far beyond wanting to be inconvenienced far beyond being embarrassed far beyond all of the now and now she lashes out in anger that's also perverted love but true love is a decision true love is not motivated by emotion it's motivated by knowing what's right and deciding to do what's right not till you aggravate me so much now I'm willing to not till I've told you 10 times why didn't you do it when you told him once yeah once is enough see now I'm angry enough now I'm inconvenienced enough now I'm upset enough that's also not love so we can get off on one side of the road or we can get off on the other side of the road but true love always does what's best for the recipient of love and true love sacrifice itself for the recipient of love and true love is not a reaction by emotion true love is a reaction by understanding Amen brother member says that's the way God does love is corrective and that's genuine love when a preacher stands and lets you women Bob your hair and wear paint and stuff and don't correct you there is no genuine love there and won't call it out and let you man marry three or four times and all of these other things and get by with it there is no genuine love there let you join a church and Pat you in the back and smother you with some Creed saying that's all you have to do is join the holy church there is no love there or either the man has totally lost himself and he don't see genuine love is corrective and brings you back to the word of God this is key genuine love is corrective and brings you back to the word of God so what's the objective to restore us to the word of God what's correction from the pulpit for amen not to make the preacher look good that's the wrong motivation that's perverted love amen so if correction from the pulpit is coming in order for for the congregation to make the pastor look a certain way or be held in a certain respect that's perverted love but true love will bring a correction to bring us all back to the word of God because that's where we Prosper grow where we're safe where we're saved where people are born again amen that's true motivation of Correction let's go to Hebrews chapter 12. Hebrews chapter 12 verse 4. in Hebrews 12 and verse 4 he says you have not yet resisted in the blood striving against sin and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not now the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God deals with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement where of all our partakers then you are bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness amen why did God chasten for our prophet not for his for ours that we might be partakers of his Holiness he chastened us for our Prophets he chastened us and he chastens us because he loves us that's the motivation of chastisement if chastisement in the spiritual in the church in the home if there's chastisement for any other reason then that chastisement is wrong because that chastisement shall be based on love and it shall be for the benefit of the one being chastened if we look in Jeremiah We're Not Gonna I'm not gonna have you turn there because we're running low on time but in Jeremiah God begins to tell Jeremiah because Israel forsaken me because they've turned their back on me they're going into bondage and he's bringing Babylon in to carry them away but he says to Jeremiah in chapter 29 verse 10 he said for thus saith the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place he's bringing them the chastisement he's correcting them with the rod of man and he's carrying them out of the land and carrying them captive which he said he would do all the way back and Moses when when he gave the law now he's keeping his word amen and he's causing him to go out but he's going out they're going out with their return in his mind he why he wants to restore fellowship and he wants to bring them back into the right order but he must bring chastisement but the chastisement has an end in mind he said after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you and causing you to return to this place for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected him then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all of your heart and I will be found of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from All Nations and from all the places whether I have driven you saith the Lord and I will bring you again into the place once I caused you to be carried away captive he's bringing chastisement but why so that he can restore Fellowship when you love me with all of your heart and seek me with all of your heart I will bring you back to this place I'm only sending you out so I can bring you back in a different state than you're in now because you're self-destructing now you're destroying yourselves now amen I must send you out so you can have a change of heart and change your mind so that I can bring you back and when you call or answer because I have thoughts towards you thoughts of good and not of evil all they could see was evil amen Nebuchadnezzar's Army coming in Amen to destroy villages to take lives to carry away captive they saw evil but God says this isn't for evil this is for good and my end in this chastisement is a restoration of Fellowship to bring you back to the word now let's look at First Corinthians First Corinthians chapter 5. First Corinthians chapter 5 verse 1. it is reported commonly there's there is fornication among you and such fornication is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife and you're puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you Thrive early is absent in the body but present and spirit have judged already as though I were present concerning him that has so done this deed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when you are gathered together in my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus your glory is not good know you not that A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump here we come into a matter of church discipline where there's a grievous sin amongst them and they hadn't done anything about it and the fact they hadn't done anything about it Paul seizes them being puffed up they're proud not humble before the word of God not humble before almighty God in obedience but they're proud and he's saying that you should put one out and deliver that one to Satan and that seems so hard and so evil but he says deliver that one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh so that the soul might be saved what was the whole purpose of of chastisement in a church setting and church discipline was for the saving of the Soul the whole purpose is for a real genuine love it's not love to let the sin remain amen and think somebody think that they're okay they're destroying themselves and destroying the people around them but true love says no we can't do this we must deliver you if you won't repent we must deliver you unto Satan amen for the destruction of your flesh that's all harsh amen but that's what God did to his children in order to save them and so sometimes chastisement seems so harsh and so hard amen but true chastisement is an act of true love amen churches today won't call out any sin not just Grievous and no sin they'll allow adultery and fornication and and and and and multiple marriages and all of these things just continue on and on and on and on and on Amen and then constantly amen they're told God loves you God blesses you God is your servant he he he wants to take care of you and do everything for you and make your life easy and make your life good and no correction no correction no correction and the people are being destroyed from within all kinds of devils are permitted to operate in their lives and take over them and bring destruction and keep the promises of God everything that's promised from the pulpit is not coming to pass because because there's no sin being purged out of the camp and the devil is allowed to sit right there and take advantage of the open door that's not love but it's called love they'll call themselves a Grace Church we're a Grace Church not a law Church Well a true Grace Church will have Grace enough to tell the truth because that's love love is not going to let you sit there in your sin and be destroyed but tell you this is not the word of God and if you can't line up to the word of God you can't stay here because you have to go amen and get your chastisement so that your soul can be saved because we're not going to let your soul die in a pew [Applause] it's called love it's promoting death in pews you die in the church because they love you too much to correct you that's not love that's promoting death spiritual death going on in churches while praises and blessings are being showered upon the congregation so God help us never to get down to this path to where we just want membership and we just want people and we don't want hard things and we don't want to deal with hard things and we don't want to say hard things amen because that's not love that's only a selfish love that doesn't want to go through the difficulty of tackling a difficult situation but love will sacrifice self for the benefit of its recipient and sometimes it doesn't look like love but it's love because that's how God loves and if I want to be like God I'm going to have to act like God many times we have to do things we don't want to do brother bear says sometimes I scold and I go back home and I just think Lord what did I do it for this is the prophet of God he's going home struggling oh I'm so glad he said this because I've been in this situation so many times why did I say it like that why did I have to say it it seemed so hard it seems so harsh and when I see brother Branham struggling with this it does me a world of good sometimes I score and I go back home and I just think Lord what did I do it for but it's because I love them if I have to scold my little boy for running out on the street he'll get killed if I don't get him off the street sometimes I have to whip him correct him say sun South the street it's not because I don't love that child it's because I do love him that's the way God has to do us scold us Shake us make us real true persons that lets his child just do anything is not a good parent now let's go to First Corinthians 11. First Corinthians 11 and we read this every month at Communion would pick it up in verse 31. for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world why does God chasten us so he doesn't lose us so that we are not condemned with the world why does God chasten us because he won't lose us that's how much he loves us he loves us enough to chasten us he loved Israel enough to allow the king of Babylon to come destroy burn kill and take away captive that's how much God loved them they didn't understand love sometimes we don't understand love but love is always looking to the end not to the present and love is willing to forego comfort in the present for what's best in the end Proverbs 3 11. we'll finish with this scripture Proverbs 3 11. says my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his correction for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth even as a father the son in whom he delighteth why does the father create the son because he loves that son and delights in him why does God bring correction our way because he Delights in US and he will not lose us when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord so that we will not be condemned with the world I thank God who loves me like that I thank God for a father who would correct me my dad made lots of mistakes but he corrected me and I'm thankful for it thankful for a mother who corrected me I'm thankful for people who've told me the truth I'm thankful for people in this congregation I'm thankful for preachers who have preached the truth and are thankful that it raked me over the cold sometimes and I left wounded and I left bleeding from a thousand stabs amen but I'm here today saying I'm thankful for those preachers who preach the truth I'm thankful when they didn't hold back I'm thankful for hearing the truth because the truth has Set Me Free from the bondage the devil was bringing in my life and I'm thankful true love is corrective amen let's all stand musicians if you'll come like if you'll come please let's bow our heads together and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for your goodness and your mercy God we can see your tender hand didn't always appear tender at the time as your Prophet taught us about the tender hand of Jehovah driving your children back to the promised land was the Holocaust nobody in the world could see that as love but oh God you are looking at the end not at the present you weren't looking at a snapshot of time you were looking at the direction you were moving in and that you wanted to bring your children back to their land so that you could fulfill the promise and bring Redemption God what looked like the worst thing that could happen to
