and if you regularly attend here you're welcome too we love you as well we always greet visitors but we're happy to have everybody amen let's look at Matthew chapter 28 Matthew 28 and verse 19 Matthew 28: 19 go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even to the end of the world Amen God bless you as you have your seats for a subject this evening I'd like to take uh I am with you and in you and many of you know the message really well you know that brother brandham says this many times when he quotes a couple different scriptures but he'll he'll use the term that he'll say I am I am with you even in you to the end of the world and and brother bham is combining a couple different scriptures together when he does it and he repeats it that way multitudes of times amen because it's absolutely the true it's a true statement amen because he says here uh I Am With You Always even to the end of the world and so that's a promise that has God given to his disciples amen it's in a promise that we never want to forget uh if you can turn with me to Acts chapter 7 we're going to read here in uh out of Acts we're going to read a little bit about Moses going to Egypt but we're going to pick it up in Acts because when Stephen is is preaching right before he's stoned he goes through a history of the church and he condenses some scriptures down into a thought and it's very concise so I'm going to pull it here from from what Steven says in Acts 7:33 it says then said the Lord to him put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where thou standest is Holy Ground I have seen I have seen the Affliction of my people which is in Egypt and I have heard their groanings and and am come down to deliver them and now come I will send thee unto Egypt amen so God says I have seen the Affliction of my people amen and I have heard their groanings and I have come down so this is the coming of the Lord he's coming to fulfill his promise word because he made a promise amen that his people Abraham's seed shall sojourn in a Strange Land for 400 years but he said I will bring them out with a mighty hand so God had promised to visit them and God had promised to deliver them and now God comes to the time where he comes to the Moses and he says I've seen their afflictions I've heard their groanings and I have come down to deliver them amen I've come down to keep my promise but when I come down he says now come I will send thee un Egypt so when God came to deliver what they saw brother B said what they saw was a man with a stick in his hand and a beard amen that's what they saw but it was God coming to fulfill his word it was God coming down as he promised to deliver his children with a mighty hand amen and so amen they had to recognize their message and their day yes let's go to Exodus chapter 3 and Pick up a little more of this in Exodus chapter 3 look at verse 11 it's amazing what always throws people off is the way God fulfills his word he never does it a way they assume when he says you know the children shall sojourn in a Strange Land for 400 years but I will bring them out with a mighty hand you know for years they would recite that uh promise to one another and they would look forward to it and it was a source of encouragement a source of strength some anticipation but no doubt they had many fanciful ideas of how that was going to happen but the way God did it was not the way they expected it amen but it was God nonetheless and it was God working through a servant working in and through a servant and he was working through Moses and brother Ben said it was Christ in Moses CU Christ was the anointed word for the day and that anointed word was working through Moses God had a vessel and in Exodus 3: 11 he says and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go into pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee of course he'll be with thee CU he said I come and I'm going and I'm sending you so certainly he'll be with he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee I have sent thee when thou has brought forth thy people out of Egypt ye shall serve God Upon This Mountain so God was sending them to Egypt to bring them back to to worship on the mountain and he said that's going to be the token but he said certainly I will be with thee that was a promise to Moses Moses was sin of God Amen he was there representing the power he was there representing the arm of God to deliver them and God was working through Moses amen but God said I will be with thee and then in Exodus 14 Exodus 14:1 15 this is when they're up against the Red Sea they begin to holler and complain in verse 15 he says and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest down unto me speak wherefore Christ unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea so now we know the predicament that Moses is in Moses has went to Egypt he has done the the the signs that were that the God gave him to declare himself to Israel now he brought uh destruction upon Egypt through the plagues and he delivered God had delivered through Moses delivered the children of Israel with a mighty hand and they spoiled Egypt and they came out into the desert and they were dancing and they were happy and they they had spoiled their their their captors and now they come up to the first big trial up against the Red Sea hemmed in by the mountains with no Escape Route amen and the army of Egypt was barreling down upon them and they began to lose all hope am mean they begin to lose I mean everything that God had done had just went out of their mind all the plagues all the destruction I mean they're there crying and their children are robed in Silkk and golden chains around their neck because they had so much loot they couldn't carry it themselves they had to put it on their kids can you imagine them standing there Egypt is absolutely H wrecked amen they spoiled their neighbors and they're standing there and and in Rich apparel amen they're standing there with with all kinds of goods and their kids have gold chains around them and they're saying why did you bring us here to kill us we're all going to die amen oh man it sounds silly but it happens again in this day they're there with the blessings upon them forgetting what God had done they were looking with their eyes at the obstacle and there sound no no way around it amen and then Moses began to cry out and God says to Moses why criest thou unto me speak that the children of Israel move forward and and and it's amazing to me say why CRI out to me amen because God was looking at the solution the solution was Moses amen Moses you speak that they go forward you lift up the rod I sent you I've come down but I've sent you and I promise to be with you why Christ unto me speak that they go forward move the right you're the solution you're the one that I sent my power is working through you you're the one who's bringing the Deliverance now I'm not God was doing but he's doing it through Moses Moses was the solution amen when they got in the bind they forgot but God saved them let's turn to the Book of Judges now now let's look at Judges chapter uh six Judges chapter 6 and verse 11 come to the story of Gideon and in judges 611 it says and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was in ofra that pertaineth in joash the abizer and his son Gideon threshed Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracle which our father told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites this is amazing the angel comes to to to Gideon and he knows where to find Gideon hiding behind the wine press um threshing out a little wheat to hide it from the midianites and he says I love how he says this he says the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee the Lord is with the that was a revelation to Gideon Gideon didn't know the Lord was with him Gideon thought they were Forsaken and they were all alone and they had been cast out and God wasn't with them and there's no more miracles and and they were under bondage and they were coming to take our crops again and the midianites are strong those are all the things he saw but what the angel came to tell him was tell him something that God saw that Gideon couldn't see and he said the Lord is with thee and he says wow if if that's true the if God be with us and why why is all this befalling us and where are his miracles and where are this and I love it the the scripture now says and the Lord looked at him let's let's read on verse 14 and the Lord looked upon him and don't read further I didn't give you permission to refer it says and the Lord looked at him the Lord didn't answer his question at least he didn't answer it directly he didn't explain all that had been going on and why it had happened and the falling away and and the things that he was displaying he didn't explain all of that he had already told him the Lord is with thee and Gideon begin to question it and begin to and it just says I just love it and it says and the Lord uh verse 14 and the Lord looked upon him I wonder what kind of look he gave him because I mean the scripture is very specific that the Lord looked upon him I mean could have just went into saying what he was going to say next but it stopped to say the Lord looked upon him and it to me I believe that there was something in the look there was a pause there was something that that that is significant enough that the Bible records and the Lord looked upon him because he had said the Lord be with thee and he starts to say well well how is he with us if he's with us then then why is this and where are the Miracles and all of that and then the next thing it says is the Lord looked upon him very very interesting and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent theej amen here what he says the Lord is with thee if God be with us then why this and why this and why everything I see and why all my circumstances and why is the mid nightes and why are the Miracles and why and the Lord just looked upon him the Lord just looked at him didn't answer he looked at him he says go in this thy might and thou shalt deliver you're you're the place of Deliverance you're the Miracles you're just like I he said the he just like he he said to Moses I will be with thee amen certainly I will be with thee I send you now he comes to Gideon and he looks at Gideon and Gideon's going to be the solution to Gideon's own questions it's going to take place in his own life it's going to happen through him it's going to happen to him and he's wondering well all this stuff and why is it this way and the Lord just looked at him and the Lord I can only imagine now I don't have a clue what God was thinking or why he looked at him the way he did but I wonder if he's looked at him and tried to get Gideon to realize it's you yeah where's all this and why all this and I already said I'm with you I'm with you what else do you need to know the Lord is with thee but why this by why this but he's not answering that he just looked at him man I wonder how many times in all of our crying and all of our complaining and all of our worrying if God doesn't just look at us say I already told you through a prophet I'm with you I promise to never leave you nor forsake you I said in the word I'll be with you always to the end of the world Amen this day it's in you you're the solution you're the answer to the question he says all he says is go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee Hallelujah that's it that's it it's finished if God sent him it was over if God sent him he was going to win if God sent him they were going to be delivered if God sent him now was the time if God sent him all questions are answered amen we ask a lot of questions yes and I wonder if he just looks at us sometimes amen let's go to John chapter 20 can you imagine after the prophet told us who the bride is and what Christ has done in this generation and we in our moment of Crisis begin to cry out God where are you where are you where are you where are you and the prophets already told us where he is we say God why won't you come why won't you come on the scene why won't you come and Deliver Me and the prophets already told us where he is wonder if he could just look at us John 20: 211 then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost brother Brenham said though same way the father sent him as the way he sent them he went in them amen so as the father has sent him so send I you and it was going to be the coming of the Holy Ghost he was going to actually come in them and Le through them and he promised I will be with you always let's go back to verse 14 or chapter 14 I'm sorry go back to Chapter 14 verse 18 Jesus says to them in chapter John chap 14: 18 says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you amen yet a little while in the World teaches me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you I am with you and in you now it doesn't make sense anymore to pray God where are you God where are you God where are you I don't see you in the trial I don't understand where you're at I don't know why the situation like this I don't know why I'm in trouble I don't know this I don't know that where are you I wish I wish sometimes we could just see his eyes look at us and say go in this thy might amen I'm using you to finish my work in this last time I'm using you to finish the work that I left for this hour go in this thy might and go do the work I've called you to do have not I sent thee amen I don't want it to be just for Gideon and just for Moses but I want it to be for me now God has sent me when he told his disciples go into all nations and preach the gospel he sent them out and said lo I am with thee always I want to believe that he's with me now and according to the word in Meen brother Brenham has a a interesting quote I'd just like to bring to your attention from calling Jesus on the scene he he says now you say how could he be God and be man see there is a mystery see in body he was man in spirit he was God someone asked me said then how did who did he pray to In The Garden of Gethsemane I love this quote this is one of those head Spinners you know but it's the truth and nonetheless who did he pray to In The Garden of Gethsemane I said I'll answer you that when you answer this do you believe you have the Holy Ghost said yes said then who do you pray to where is he at When you pray to him amen when you claim you have him and yet you're praying to him see people they they just get some little idea and run wildly you see that's the way it goes amen I love the way brother B answered the question amen who who was Jesus praying to in the garden of gethy and the question is do you have the Holy Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost where is Christ he's in me he said he would be in me he promised to be in me he said I will be with you I will be he said I will be in you amen and now we believe he's in US by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and who do we pray to we're praying to Christ where is he how far away how long does it take from my message to travel from my lips to his ears how far does he have to travel to come on the scene to deliver me amen we've been brought up higher in this age so we don't keep thinking those carnal thoughts and keep putting God far away amen and we can feel God's presence so close and know that he's so near to us and we walk away elated sometimes with a church service cuz it was so tangible his presence was so real amen but then we get into a trial and we don't have that same feeling and he feels so far away and we're praying to a God and our prayer the the tone of our voice and the way we're praying we're praying to somebody that is far far away but oh God give us the Revelation amen that breaks that off of us and let us realize that if he's if he was with us he's always with us he's not coming and going he's not leaving he's not abandoning ship in the time of trouble but he's here he's in you he promised to be in you Amen brother bham said in the message the healing of gyrus his daughter this is preached back in 1955 he says just just previous of this chapter we find one place where the Son of God spent so much time in prayer I want you to hear how he talks about prayer and if Jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more do you and I have to spend in prayer so Jesus was spending time in prayer to do what to pray to a father that was far off in heaven to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him so now what is our prayer life doing staying in fellowship with the spirit of God that's in us staying connected to the one that's in US amen almighty god let's go to the Book of Jeremiah listen I am going to read all of these things and we're going to say Amen to all of it and the next time we get into a trial and everything goes wrong we are going to have to ask God to bring this back to our memory because we slip into the carnal so fast because our human side is so carnal it's always see taste feel smell and hear but we got to come back to the revelation of this power and understand where he abides now amen he poured himself where into the church amen where he's at he's in you amen he's in me amen where am I praying how far am i mailing it how many how much postage do I have to put on the prayer so that it gets to the destination I just need to pray to stay in fellowship with the spirit that's in me jeremi 8 and 19 Jeremiah 8:19 says behold the voice of the Cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country they were crying because the enemy was coming they were going to be taken captive it says is not the Lord in Zion who's he talking to he's talking to Judah he's talking to those that dwell in Jerusalem those that dwell in Zion he said my people are crying because of a people from a far country but is not the Lord in Zion is not her King in her amen is not her King in her this is this is what through the Prophet Jeremiah this is what God is trying to bring their attention to you're upset you're crying because of there people from AAR countries coming but isn't the King in Zion amen isn't the Lord and Zion isn't her King in her he says why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and with their strange vanities the Harvest is passed the summer has ended and we are not saved for the her of the daughter of my people I am hurt I am black that just means he's mourning dark with mourning astonishment had taken hold on me is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of my daughter of my people recover covered he's saying you're not forsaken you're not abandoned it's not the Lord in Zion you're in Zion is not the Lord in Zion amen what you've done is you provoked me to anger because you missed who was in your presence and you went running around and trying find help somewhere else going to graven images and going to idols and going to the high places what were they trying to do they were desperately trying to get help from somewhere and they weren't recognizing that the King was still in Zion the King was in her and she was missing it running around scared trying to go to other gods for help and he says is there no bomb in Gilead is there not a physician there why then is my daughter not healed because they didn't recognize what was there that's why brother Benham is preaching in Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he says this he says we are his victory the church is his victory we came forth in the last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory amen where is the Lord he's in Zion where is the king he's in her man we don't need to run all over the place trying to find help the help is here amen the helper is here he says this shows that that he couldn't keep they couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us that's right and we are already potentially arised because we raised from dead unbelief in his word from denominational Creeds to an eternal word of the Eternal God which is him hisself working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever and then the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word word nothing can be added or taken from it so the same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one they are husband and wife they're flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life Spirit of his Spirit see amen how do you know Bears the same record same fruit same word see manifest Christ same life same God Same Spirit same word same book amen amen same signs things that I do show you also oh Hallelujah notice the vind ated word in his body is his victory and the reason of his death what is that this message came Amen to be what the Vindicated word in his body a many membered body in his bride that's the Victory and that's the reason of his death so that what so that he can be made manifest in you where is he in you where is he living in you where is he working in you where is the Lord in Zion where is the king in her I don't want to be like Jerusalem of old and running everywhere trying to find help the help's here the help's here amen they were looking for a hero and even at one place they were entertaining having Egypt coming to help them and pay them a sum to come and help oh how the Lord was so angry with that because they were running everywhere to try to find help amen find so many times amen people begin when they get in trouble we find ourselves not just people me too like all people all of us we try to run to and fro trying to find help we go from a minister to a minister to a meeting to a meeting to a church to a church what are we trying to find we're trying to find somebody that can help us but we're failing to recognize he who's here he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world Amen and we're we're looking for a hero for another great one amen God wants to be the Great one amen we get scared and we get nervous we get fearful and we got to find somebody with the answer why is this happening why is this befalling us he looked at him go in this thy might and thou shalt deliver Thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the minites have not I sent thee God wants to overcome through you and I he wants to be the Overcomer he wants us to rely upon him and he is the word yes sir he wants to live in US dwell in us and he wants to conquer through us and overcome through us let's go to Matthew 21 it's amazing Israel wanted a hero but God said he came down amen Moses agreed too they needed a hero he just didn't believe he was the one who could be the hero in the days of the minite uh uh enslavement they needed a hero even Gideon believed they needed a hero he just never believed that God would use him to be the hero amen sometimes we believe we need a hero but we failed to believe that God wants to overcome through us as simple as it is the Overcomer is here he's in you it doesn't mean that God's not going to use somebody else he'll use he'll use all of us to help one another but if we see somebody else as having God and I have to go to them to get God I miss the god that's in Me God can speak through that voice absolutely God can help me through that hand that's God too that's this Dwelling Place also and I recognize that but if I look that I need the I need somebody else because God's in that other person then I fail to recognize God's also in me so I keep looking for a man with God a man that's in touch with God a man that's close to God a man that can touch God how about being the man or woman that's in touch with God where God dwells in you amen amen Matthew 21 and 20 and when the disciples saw it they marveled saying how soon is the Fig Tree withered away Jesus answered and said unto them verily verily I say unto you if you have faith and doubt not you shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done the key phrase is if ye shall say ye who ye who can do this ye if ye shall say don't be mesmerized by this don't don't be so caught in this but the truth is if ye shall say and you don't doubt in your heart but have perfect faith if ye believe then the mountain can be plucked up and cast into the sea this is what Jesus is trying to get them to understand they Marvel at what Jesus just did amen he just spoke to this tree and then that they come by the next day or whenever it was and the trees already withered up and they marveled at how soon it was withered up and Jesus said don't don't get don't get your eyes off on this amen realize now that if you if you believe and you don't doubt ye you not just me Jesus is standing here in flesh not just me but you can say to this mountain amen amen but if ye shall say let me pick it back up where I was I say unto you if you have faith and doubt not ye you shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree but also if ye shall say unto the mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive praise be to God man let's turn to Luke 17 now Luke 17 and verse 20 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither neither shall they say loow here or low there for behold the kingdom of God is within you amen how many's looking for the kingdom of God it's hiding it's hiding where's it hiding the kingdom of God is within you Amen in the future home brother bam said God already took us up uh God already took up his his Abode potentially brother V's preaching about future home where the bride and the bridegroom will dwell after the Millennium he's preaching future home and he says but God already took up his abod potentially the kingdom of God is on earth now amen in the hearts of his Saints we're always looking to Future looking to Future looking to future but but God potentially is already taken up his a boat on the Earth and he's taken up his bone his kingdom is in you amen his kingdom is on earth now in the hearts of his Saints it's his attributes that he began in the beginning now his attributes is redeemed so God the kingdom of God is on Earth how many believes that where in his bride and Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of God is within you said the Bible said the Bible Jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life so what is the kingdom of kingdom it is the word of God made spirit and life in our life it's the word living in us that's the kingdom of God bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word of God was one and the word of God is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last last days and be taken up from the dead and the resurrection to go back and restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning In the Garden of Eden the three-fold mystery of God his body amen so the kingdom of the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our life amen let's go to First John 4:4 first John 4:4 praise God I think I could wake up every morning and remind myself of these things I think I should wake up every morning and remind myself of these things 1 John 4:4 year of God little children and I've overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world right amen no matter what you face greater is he that is in you and he that is in the world where is the answer it's in you have not I sent thee brother bam preached a message titled he that is in you he preached it in 1963 and he says this in this message if we only could receive this truth now just a moment if we only could realize that this scripture mean he that is in in you is greater than he that's in the world we can't understand that yet we say we believe it and we know it's true but we really don't understand it I'm glad he said that but I believe God's wanting us to understand it better I believe we're coming into a greater understanding because that's what he wants to do in this day yes sir but he says I love it he says we can't understand that yet we say we believe it and we do believe it and we know it's true but we really don't understand it Greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world what is in you that's greater it's Christ the Anointed God that was in Christ is in you greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world then if he's in you it's not you anymore living it's him living in you it's not your thinking what you would think about this it's what he said about this then if he is in you he absolutely would not deny what he said he couldn't do it but he would keep what he said and he's trying to find that person that he can vindicate himself through now listen to what he says next this is a really interesting statement and I'm glad brother B said it this way he said now that doesn't mean that he has to do it to everybody and the time that Moses led the children of Israel there was one that was Moses the rest of them just followed the message see some of them tried to raise up to impersonate it and God said separate yourself and just swallowed them up see now but he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world God in you like he was in Jesus Christ because what all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church see that's God in you he that's in you now he says this about he not all has to do it not he says now that does not mean uh he has to do it to everybody but in the time of Moses what brother Bram is showing is we don't have to repeat brother bram's Ministry to believe this is trueth we don't have to repeat that like brother ringan was saying God's not repeating we're not going back and trying to copy amen we're moving on into the bride dispensation of Jesus Christ is something he wants to do today we don't have to go back and repeat that God already did that to show where he was to vindicate the message coming to prove that this is I this is me amen so that we would receive it the rest of them just followed the message but that doesn't mean he's not working in you amen just because he did something special through the prophet to bring a Vindication he wants to be seen in a many membered body and he wants to do all of his works on Earth today through this body amen amen amen we don't need another another Prophet to rise up like brother bam God's already accomplished that amen the seventh angel is already come that work is finished now what he's wanting to do he's wanting to do in a many membered bride not in one man anymore and where is he going to do it he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world Amen we keep like I said before we keep looking around for a hearing hero but the hero is inside we keep looking around for somebody to rescue us but The Rescuer is inside yes amen you know this is this is where it comes to many times we don't know where to turn we don't know what to do we don't know what the solution is we don't know why we're in the fixes we're in sometimes we don't have all the answers and we just would love for somebody to come how many of you have ever wished brother was still alive you're honest praise God I've wished it many many many times but God saw fit to bring us to a greater maturity amen God saw fit to that he was going to do a work and that work was going to be in you in me we have to believe that and yield to that amen and and even though God used gifts in the body and God uses gifted men and women and God can speak through a brother or a sister and that that's still that's still the voice of God God can still do those things but you still have to have the witness inside of you that it's true somebody can get up behind this pulpit and they can lay out exactly the answer to the question that you had amen scripture by scripture by scripture it can be the voice of God absolutely speaking to that situation but if you don't have the resonator on the inside that say that's the truth you're just going to going to go over your head you're going to come into the service and leave the service and say oh I wish God would come and speak to me amen and it'll happen it'll happen time and time again a brother will say something in a conversation something will come up something will happen amen because it's it's he that's in you it's not that God's not using gifts God will use gifts it's not that God won't use the preaching of the word he'll use the preaching of the word he can still use dreams he can still use a word of knowledge he can use all of that but there's got to be something inside of you that clicks with that and say that's for me and that's the truth it's he that's in you right he's the hero he's the deliverer he's the Overcomer we are his victory he's having a victory inside of us that's where it's happening in the message go wake Jesus we we many of us know the story of gowake Jesus brother brandom preaches many times about Jesus getting into the boat after the campaign and he was tired and he goes to the back of the ship and he falls asleep sleep and they they they go out into the Sea of Galilee and they get caught up in a terrible storm and and they think they're going to die and and brother B preaches this in many places gowake Jesus calling Jesus on the scene and all kinds of places but here in go Jesus said then it must have said John the young fellow might have said think of it brethren we have him with us now oh what a thought he's now in the ship with us man they had just come from a campaign and they seen him do some of the greatest Miracles that's ever been done on the face of the Earth and they climb into this ship and and they they look back and they see him asleep back there and I love the way brother Brenham dramatizes this and they said think of it brethren we have him with us now oh would have thought he's now in the ship with us if we tonight my precious brother and sister could only settle down for a few moments to realize this Messiah that we've been talking about and God said would come and was here on Earth died rose again ascended into heaven and come back uh after 10 days and appeared to them at Pentecost and commission his church that same Jesus is with us today as we're sailing life solom man we talk about him we think about him we read about him what he did what he was how he lived what kind of works he did and then forget about it do you realize that he is with us not only with us but in us oh how I think that what a feeling of security it must have been to think about the very Creator himself sailing through Troubled Waters with them that's what John was thinking when to look back think Brethren he the one who opened the blinded eyes the one who fed 5,000 the one seemingly nobody can resist his wisdom nobody can stand against him no circumstances he's with us what a comfort that was What a Feeling of security it must have been to think that the very Creator himself sailing through Troubled Waters with them that's the way we feel sometimes when we're in the service and the word is breaking so powerful amen you feel like you could just scream and you could just take a Rapture right then or when God delivers or God heals or God answers a situation so perfect you know it was none other than the hand of God that just came down and boom boom boom the situation you were in is now solved you say oh you look over to your wife you look to your husband say oh isn't it so comforting to know that he's with us he's in the ship with us but listen what brother B says as he goes on in the message said then they found like we have today that trouble sets in the ship began to rock the winds blowed the sails away and the water filled up the boat what all hopes was gone all hopes of survival yes all of the sudden something happened trouble arose and down went the sails and Away the wind puffed it away and the ores begin to fail and crack and Creek as these bronny backed fishermen laid to them knowing how to face those waves and all of the sudden the boat filled up with water but isn't it strange that men who just a few hours ago amen seen him do such things had forgot all about it the God who raised the Dead The God Who healed the sick the God who feels fills with the Holy Ghost that we've seen done is now the same today he's right here here in the boat he is here with us Lo I'm with you always whether in troubles or when she's sailing smooth I'm still in the boat they had forgot about it and they thought all survival was gone they thought they had seen him do so many things but now they had forgotten he was in the boat all forgotten in the time of trouble just like it is now I have lived through this myself not the Sea of Galilee not a leral boat but I've been in the place where God so supernaturally delivered me so so powerfully showed himself to me did things that that no man could have done and and I had such a testimony of what God and it was so comforting to know God's with me and then the Troubles of Life creep in and then things unexpected happen and then things that go beyond our control and beyond our capabilities brother mam talks about these men were fishermen they were born on the sea their living in occupation with fishermen for Generations they were masters of mastering the sea but it got Beyond them yeah beyond their control beyond their ability and all their efforts failed and all their abilities failed and when everything failed they despaired of even their lives and they forgot that the one who fed 5,000 was right there he was right there and because he was inactive and not speaking and not animated they didn't they forgot all about who was in the ship yes amen I'm not angry at the disciples I'm angry at me because I forgot who was in the ship I forgot who promised that I'll be with you always to the end of the world that I'll be in you I in you and you in me amen that I'll not leave you comfortless but I will come to you I will indwell you and in the time of trouble I started talking like he wasn't in the ship I started acting like I was all alone I started speaking like there was no hope and all was lost yes turn to ma Mark chapter 4 with me turn to Mark chapter 4 verse 38 it says Mark 4:38 and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awoke him and say un him Master carest thou not that we perish look how their attitude had shifted they started out the boat with the blue skies and sunny day and look he's right here with us think about what he just saw what he just did and doesn't it feel good to walk with the Lord doesn't it feel good to be his disciples does it and in just a few moments time the circumstances changed and they said Master carest thou not that we perish like he didn't care and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith he was there all along brother B said he was just waiting to be called on the scene he was just waiting for somebody to recognized that he was there and that he had the same power he always had and he's the same deliver he always was he was just waiting to be called on the scene instead of calling them on the scene they were they were they were hoisting the sail and and they were bailing water and they were speaking ores but then when it got beyond all their power then they said now now they didn't say oh we need God now they said don't you even care but oh he cared he cared he was there waiting to be called on the scene friends he's with us he's in us he's with us always don't let there be a Bible verse Oh God help it not be a Bible verse let it be a reality to me that he's he's with me always even to the end of the world he says in the message go Jesus again I'm a little further down he says the father dwelleth in me he was the Messiah by that with that anointing made him fully Messiah and we with the same Spirit was upon him not in portion but the same quality with a portion upon us would make us like messes would be little sons of God adopted sons of God God and His holy spirit has sealed us into his body and we are his children there should nothing bother us nothing worry us we're his amen amen again in go Jesus he says now those disciples should have said all right now brother B's going to tell us what they should have said not what they said under the but what they should have said are you ready those disciples should have said why there's nothing wrong now listen remember the situation they were in remember despairing for Life gave up all hope of surviving amen the ores were breaking the sails were blowned down the storm was so bad the boat was swamped they thought they were going to die they even woke up Jesus said Master cares not that we perish but brother brandham said in that circumstance here's what they should have said they should have said the disciples should have said why there's nothing wrong now why there lays the creat right there he's sailing with us why just look at the things that he has done well what do we care about the waves oh if we could feel like that about it how much different it would be oh God you know what we need to do sometimes when the waves are swamping our boat we need to stop one time and have a testimony service and remember what he did last time and talk about what he did to our brother and to our sister and to me and how he brought me to the message and how he cleaned me up and saved me and delivered me things that I could never get over and things I tried all my life and when I come to the Lord when his when he filled me with his Spirit he took the desire out of me and I've got victory over that thing for 20 years now 20 plus years amen what was that that was the power of God and he who delivered me there is still in the ship the one who fed 5,000 is in me amen the one who opened the blinded eyes the one who raised Lazarus from the dead where is he he's right here amen not far off not I have to cry longer I have to cry louder I have to get his ear and get his attention and ask him to please come down here he's here friends he's in us and he's trying to get his bride to recognize who she is who he is and where he dwells right God's word made manifest in you that's his victory that's the reason of his death where's the kingdom of God it's on Earth and his Saints amen man we can't stop being a human being you can't stop thoughts you can't stop feelings but we have to learn how to possess our vessel we have to learn how to rein the feelings back in and say you know what I feel like All Is Lost but nothing's out of cater there's nothing wrong with feel there's nothing wrong with feeling like All Is Lost as long as the Revelation in your soul tells you everything's fine you can let your feelings go here they'll go up they'll go down don't worry about feelings cuz they're going to change real quickly they're not going to stay the same way forever so just let the feel say Lord I feel this but I know your word says this Lord I feel like there's no hope but I know there's always hope because you got a plan for me from before the foundation of the world and nothing is going to change the plan you have of me amen you you you you wrote my name in your book you sealed it amen amen and there's no way that nothing there's no way that I'm going to be destroyed there's no way I'm going to miss the mark there's no way I'm going to miss your purpose for [Music] me we need to speak the word amen we need to let the word come out of our mouths amen let's go to Romans I want to go to a scripture in Romans Romans chapter 10 Romans chap 10:5 Romans 10:5 for Moses described the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of Faith speak on on this wise say not in thy heart who shall Ascend to Heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall descend into the depth that is to bring Christ up again from the dead but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach how far away is he how far away is he he's given us his word amen not that we have to go pull him down from heaven or bring him up from below it's not the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth our Victory is here with us he's given us a mouth to speak his word God Amen it doesn't you can't stop from feeling afraid just try sometimes say okay I decided I'm not afraid anymore it's not going to work I just I decided I'm not I decided I'm not going to let that bother me anymore I mean we're fooling ourselves the reality is God this thing that's happening is scaring me but I know greater is he that's in me than he's that in the world and I know for sure this thing's not going to destroy me I know for sure that your plan for me is steadfast I know for sure that you're not changing in your thoughts towards me I know for sure you have a plan and I need to just sit still and wait these waves are no big deal amen cuz you're in the boat praise be to God he says in the message again he that's in you when he come to the Red Sea and it was in his way God said speak to the Sea and Moses spoke to the Sea and greater is he that was in Moses than the sea was itself is that right God didn't speak to the Sea he told Moses to speak to the Sea because he told Moses I will certainly be with thee because I'm sending you now you see greater was that was in Moses than he that's in the world greater is he that was in Moses than any nature there is in the world he commanded nature at whatever God told him to say he said it and that's the way it was the same God is with us tonight not only with us but in us he proves he was in US greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen what are we afraid of the world there's nothing to be afraid of friends amen the the like I said we live we're human beings we live in a world we live a human life and God intended for us to human live a human life we feel the things the world feels we we have the reactions to certain things that the world has we can be fearful we can be perplexed we can be confused we can be confused even about what God is doing in our lives but it doesn't change anything the reality is still the same he's in the boat he's with us he's in US circumstances can't change that am where is go where is the king he's in Zion amen where's the Lord he's in Zion where is the king he's in her what shall destroy me when he's with me and if he's with me the only thing that can happen is whatever this is that looks like it'll destroy me can only carry me to the next dimension cuz he's in me the Kingdom's already here we don't have to be afraid we don't have to be perplex we don't have to worry we can come back to the word and say God greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world will things happen absolutely do you think you'll ever be afraid again but where will he be in the time of trouble where will he be the next situation that we can't solve or figure out where will Christ be the next time that circumstances start to mount so fast we feel like we're drowning where will he be he'll be the same place he's always been he'll be in you man help me God not to run all over the place like a wild man trying to find somebody with an answer the one with the answers inside he may bring it through a brother in the pull pit he may bring it through a brother and sister in a conversation he may allow somebody with a gift but it's still him inside of me has to bring it to a reality amen still the faith that's in me has to say that's nothing but the truth and that's for me men if we believe we're the Bride of Jesus Christ we've got nothing to be afraid of we've got nothing to worry about we have nothing that we need to lose our minds over everything is okay and what the disciples should have said was that's no big deal well I mean I'm paraphrasing but that's pretty much what he said let me read it again now those disciples should have had said why there's nothing wrong now why there lays the Creator laying right here amen life happens but God doesn't change circumstances change but God's word never changes if he said he's with you always even to the end of the world that's a promise if he says he's in you say greater than he that's in you than he that's in the world that can never change next time we meet an obstacle we just need to hold steady quit running quit jumping quit getting scared just hold steady and say God I don't exactly know what you're doing and I don't exactly know how to move forward but I know one thing for sure you're still with me you have not left me you have not forsaken me you have not changed your mind about me you have not changed your word one iota I know you're with me and I know you have a plan so I'm asking God that you help me each step of the way because I don't know what's happening now but you know what these waves are not a big deal because the big deal is inside of me the one who created the world is in me the one who spoke the world into existence is still dwelling me his spirit is still dwelling in me I have nothing to worry about if he needs to part the waters he can still part the waters if he needs me to walk on the waters human beings can still walk on water I can't pretend I can't fake I can't make it happen but he can he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world Amen let's all stand together I think we're going to remind ourselves of these as often as we can cuz times are not getting less complicated they're getting more complicated and news is not getting less frightening it's getting more frightening but greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world there's wars and rumors of wars and pestilence and all kinds of troubles all over the place but it doesn't change anything really God knew what he was going to do in 2024 and he knows what he's going to do in 2025 if there is a 2025 God knows all about it we have no clue but he does so I need not to let the news and the circumstances and all the situations cause me to lose sight of what is so important to remember it's no big deal I don't mean that trivial but in the spirit it's true in the real reality it's true in my flesh I can't help it sometimes I still get worked up I still get I still get knots in my stomach over certain situations I mean I'm not I'm not preaching anything that I'm not experiencing I still have situations don't know how to solve I get knots in my stomach over certain things because I don't know how they're going to transpire I don't know the way out I don't know what's going to happen next but I got to keep reminding myself he knows he knows he knows what's happen happening I don't know what's happening he knows what's happening and when he got into that boat with the disciples he had a purpose in getting in the boat amen cuz he was going to go to the other side you know when God got in this boat of me he had a purpose he was going to get it to the other side and it's going to get to the other side I don't know if the storms are going to rise or not rise I don't know if the sails will break or not break I don't know what's going to happen but if he got in this boat to go to the other side he's going to go to the other side amen and I've Got Confidence in that and say God remind us of these things let us re rehearse them in times of trouble when chaos breaks out let's be reminded that he's in the ship and let's bow our heads and pray together dear heavenly father we thank you God that your word is ever true God we're learning as your bride to depend on the word above everything else you're speaking to us time and time again show showing us that the word is the only way that you made promises and your promises remain true that your word doesn't Fade with time it doesn't grow weaker Lord but it's as powerful as it's ever been that the promise is sure God I pray that it becomes more of a reality to us day by day there's a reason you speak these things to us because we need to be reminded because we are your victory in this time you want to overcome through each one of us Lord and you need us just to hold steady and trust you you need us to believe you Lord in the midst of chaos you need us just to let you have your way and show yourself Mighty on our behalf that you might get the victory through us and we can be your victory in this end time lord Jesus I'm sorry I'm

not just when it's smooth sailing but in Troublesome times that you're still in the ship and I believe it Lord for you say greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world if that's true Lord then there's nothing we have to be afraid of God let that truth become Superior in our hearts and our lives thank you for the reminder Lord for surely we need it surely we'll need it in the days that lay ahead Lord I Thank you that you reminded us once again may this word go into our hearts Lord and may it root itself down there and spring forth life and may it not just be something that hit our ears and tingled in our minds but Lord may it be something that becomes part of us a reality Lord that we lean on that we trust in that we act upon we love you father we thank you for your word we ask that you would bless us now as we part God as we look forward to the upcoming weekend with brother Alistair I pray that you would bless him and refresh him and bless him in all his travels and that you would use him as a vessel Lord that you can speak through and may we have the witness in our heart heart to ears to hear all that you're trying to say to us may you bring us Lord to a greater manifestation of the word for this day may we live it Lord and display it in Jesus Christ's name we pray we thank you Father amen and God bless you all brother John as I look back in history I see a
