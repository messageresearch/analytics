========================================

my boat of Life sails on a troubled sea wherever there's a wind in my S but I have a friend who watches over me when the breeze turns into a I know the master of the way I know the maker of the rain he can calm the storm and make the sun to shine again I know the master of the way sometimes I soar like an eagle in the sky among the Peaks my soul can be found and unexpected storm may drive me from the heights it may bring me long but never bring me down I know the master of the wind I know the maker of the rain he can calm the storm and make the sun to shine again I know the master of the way will I know the master of the way I know the maker of the rain he can come the storm and make the sun to shine again I know the master of the wind verse two sometimes I soar like an eagle in the sky among the Peaks my soul can be found an unexpected storm may dry me from the heights it may bring me low never bring me down I know the master of the wind I know the maker of the rain he can call the storm and make the sun to shine again I I know the master of the wind Angels F their wings as we boldly [Applause] see Redeemed by the lamb now holy We Stand we're offering [Applause] praises all our

praise the lord it's good to see you all certainly good to be together every time that we can gather now in worship it's a precious time amen I think the fellowship has become sweeter and I think it'll become sweeter yet amen when we finally get through all the obstacles and all the hurdles and and the the things begin to change and we can get back together I got a feeling we're going to enjoy our fellowship amen it's going to be sweeter and sweeter and sweeter man let's take our Bibles and turn to the Book of Job job 23 I wanted to move in a different direction but the Lord wouldn't allow me so we're going to kind of stay in the same vein we've been in the last few services and I just have really just one thought really just one thing the Lord impressed on my heart I want to bring so we can be done in 15 minutes or 30 I don't know how long it'll take but I just want to share this one thought amen and it's not a new thought it's nothing deep it's nothing major but it's it's one of those things that the simplest thoughts are the most profound amen it's always that way with God no matter how simple it looks there's the things in the scriptures and things of God that are so simple you can speak it you can say it and you can get a child to say it and understand what you're talking about but the more you explore it the more it unfolds and the deeper and deeper it gets it's profoundly deep and and absolutely simple I don't know how God can do that but that's our God Amen that's the way he does and he continues to unfold himself so let's look at Job 23 we'll begin begin here job 23:10 but he knoweth the way that I take when Heath tried me I shall come forth as gold I want to minister on he knows the way that I take man let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus Lord we ask that you would just Minister Lord unto us Lord tonight that you would be the preacher Lord that you would be the one Lord who speaks it may be these vocal towards of a human man but Lord that's not what we want to hear from Lord we want to hear from you lord your spirit speaking through this vessel give us ears to hear and a heart to perceive all that you have for us may we receive it Lord and may it change us may we be able to glorify your name more and more in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you as your seated we're going to look at this scripture again let's go back to verse 7 and catch the a thought here where job is at in verse 7 there the righteous might dispute with him actually uh let's go to verse six will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me there the righteous might dispute with him so should I be delivered forever from my judge behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth this goldone so what job is saying is in the midst of his trial uh job is going through a real ordeal amen does anybody believe that job was really in a trial am mean he was in the Press I mean he was being pressed out and everything was being pressed out of job and and he had lost so much and and yet he was depending on God and he gets to this place where he's saying I go forward but he not there I go backwards but I can't perceive him I look to the left where I know he's working but I can't find him to the right he hideth himself for me he's saying I don't know where God's at I don't know what God's doing I haven't gotten God's movement figured out but this thing I know he knows the way that I take I can't figure him out his ways are in the sea and they're past finding out I'm I'm not going to say I know what God's going to do where he's at what he's going to do next cuz I can't perceive what he's doing all around me but I know one thing he knows the way that I take and when I am tried I shall come forth as gold this is the beautiful part of this when when job is saying when I am tried I shall come forth as gold amen he's making a profound statement because the trying of the gold can never change what's not gold into gold amen the trying is not to change the trying is to purify and make gold more pure gold so job is not saying after he's tried me after he's pressed me after he's beaten me out after he's burnt me in fire all of the sudden you know this Clay is going to turn into gold that's not what he's saying when job says he knows the way that I take and after he's tried me I'll come forth as gold what he saying is God knew what I was before and job knew what he was before this is a huge statement and though he tries me though he tests me though he puts me in the Pres and he puts me in the fiery furnace he knows the way that I take and when I'm tried I shall come forth as gold amen job was talking like a Believer but oh what a what a hard trial he was in let's go from here over to Proverbs and I want to pick up the two verses that I started with on Sunday this is what I'm having a hard time getting away from Proverbs 16 and 32 he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh a city amen better than the mighty and he that can rule his Spirit that's the human spirit is better than he that can take a city Proverbs 25 skip over to proverbs 25 and verse 28 he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that has broken down and without walls so there's there's we come to this life amen with the human spirit amen and this human Spirit we know is Fallen we come through a mother and father and in that through the the breeding and the mixing together we get all kinds of things that come down through and and then there's some shaping that takes place in our life amen that brings out more of these qualities or more of these undesirable qualities amen and and it accents them or highlights them for us amen but but if we don't learn how to possess our vessel amen if we don't learn how to uh uh to control our spirit or have dominance over our spirit amen it'll be like one with a a wall with with with a city with no walls that's broken down and defenseless because we're just going to be flying off the handle all the time are are making flighty decisions just based off Feeling Just based off emotion just based off the way that we're moving Amen in the spiritual realm but there's got to be something more solid a little down deeper that'll take control of the spiritual realm and say no we're not going to run over here and we're not going to be afraid and we're not going to be angry and we're not going to get hostile we're not going to speak nasty amen there's got to be something else amen and he that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a city amen because you're going to be more powerful amen and you're going to be you're going to be a greater conqueror when you can conquer yourself than he that can conquer a walled City praise be to God I going to look at the life of brother Brenham just for a minute and I just want to say as we start into this that I thank God every day and I can't thank him enough for a wave sheath offering that was weighed before the people the first part of the word to come to full Harvest maturity and that first part of the word amen came to maturity in that vessel of clay and when the word was lifted up it was lifted up in that vessel and weighed before us and we could see a mature Son of God on display but thank God for 1200 tapes and thank God for an honest vessel that would stand over the pull pit and tell the truth about his life amen because if it wasn't that we would be a confused beat up uh disappointed group of people amen because he was there telling us the struggles he went through and his failures and what made him the way he was and the way God was dealing with him and the correction that he was under so we could realize a mature Son of God Amen can still make a mistake a mature Son of God can still get corrected and so I thank God for that amen I can't thank him enough for that amen because it it it really tells us where we're at and as God is bringing us to maturity he's correcting and correcting and correcting and he and he wants something that he's going to get out of this vessel something he knows is already there and he knows how the second circumstances to get it out amen and to let it come out he's got to get us motivated to get ourselves out of the way and God knows how to get us motivated I mean God is the master motivator amen remember we're on free moral agency so he can't do the choosing for you amen you've got to do the choosing of your own free will in this life but he knows how to move the circumstances he's the master of the circumstances until he can get you to where you hate yourself so bad in the the decisions you made and the consequences for your action till you're willing to make the right choice amen and that's his grace that's his great love for us he won't let us just go on but if we go down the wrong road he'll move the circumstances around until all of the sudden you loathe the vessel that you live in and you hate the way you think and you hate your emotions and amen until you're willing to say God I absolutely have to have you because I don't I mean there's nothing good about me know not one good thing about me the only good thing about me is what you put in there before the foundation of the world a c Gene that believes you and want you and I'm praying God that you would just break me down so that you can have your way amen and that's his great love for us that he will do those things for us I mean we come to those times with tears frustration disappointment discouragement but it's his grace to us in the message uniting time in signs from 1963 says one of my main things that I've has always hurt me through my life has been a nervous condition that when I get so worn then I get real weary I kind of feel like nobody cares for you know and you you have it too and I just happen to have a real overdose of it you know and it gets real bad sometime and I can't hardly it's tension and that's what does it and I get to a spot then that many times especially with so many of those visions and you see it gets me I I look at a person I think this is a vision no no no it isn't yes yes it is it's it's not you see and you you just don't realize what a price goes with that then you wonder then you get to think well then you get off your side and say well now what what have I done here I am 50 years old and I've done nothing for the Lord and I'm getting old and what's and then I mean at this point we're chuckling right it's like brother B what are you struggling with you've done nothing for the Lord I mean nobody loves you but it's just as ridiculous as the things we struggle with the questions that are going on in our mind am mean another believer if you start to express some of the things that you're struggling with another believer will say that's not that's not a problem you're okay you're fine because they can see they mean they're not there in the complex they're not there with that nature they're not there with all the bombarding thoughts and all the tension and all the pressures amen that are bringing us to the wrong conclusions and here we can see brother bam in the same place said something that's i' bothered me all my life amen is is a nervousness amen is a nervous condition and you think how could he be in a nervous condition he's got a Healing Ministry he's prayed for everybody amen he after this he he got caught up in a constellation of angels he's come and he's preached the opening of The Seven Seals amen he has seen that the whole mystery unfold and he knows what it is how can he still be plagued with a nervous condition Hallelujah take that devil because you can be still plagued with a nervous condition anxiousness anxiety depression uh uh frustration and anger and all of these things jealousy all of these things can still be things that are plaguing Us in the spirit realm and God is teaching us amen how to overcome and brother brandom had the same thing after the revelation of the seals after after uh uh he receives the the open book and the revelation after I mean Supernatural in in 1963 he says you know this has been one of the greatest years of Supernatural in my whole Ministry things were accumulating so fast out there in the desert I couldn't keep up with it and here he is right in the middle of this in August of this year and he's saying I'm always struggle with a nervous condition get the feeling like nobody loves me nobody cares get to thinking I'm 50 years old and I've not done nothing for the Lord Lord my oh mind said I'm I'm getting old then you just get what we used to call the blues some of you Brethren about my age remember what they used to call have the blues pop used to talk about it and I wondered what he meant and I sure know now what he meant so then you get the feeling that way which is none of it true it's just you you know it see you know it it's just you doing that brother Benham he he was he was beginning to understand himself he was beginning to understand what where his weakness was where his nervous condition came from and when he began to wear on him and he knew when he got tired and then and got under tension with all the visions that would come on him and he says now you know that's not the truth you still feel that way but you know it's not the truth you know that's just you and and I want to just quote you from James 4:7 it says submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you Amen brother bham couldn't help getting to feeling this way amen but he realized that's not the truth amen see the thing you cannot do is identify with it that's it you cannot identify with it you cannot believe the devil's lie you cannot accept it and you cannot repeat it you you you can't stop from feeling that way in fact when brother Brandon went to Mayo's clinic and they did some testing on his stomach because he had so much trouble with it because of a nervous condition from a boy amen he had so much trouble with his stomach he was always looking for a solution to his stomach problem he went to Mayo Clinic he went to another doctor that put a scope down his throat and mean he did all these things he was trying to find a solution and in mayo clinics they said that's the way you'll always be he because because you got a blend between Irish blood and Indian blood remember that he said oh I was so discouraged they said that's just that mix and you get some mixes together and it's it's just a mix because of the Irish blood and the Indian Blood come together and you'll always be that way and there's nothing wrong with you you're just nervous because of that and that was the solution Mayo Clinic had but I want to say this brother Ben's the one who told us that God looked after your great grandparents and your grandparents and your parents de breed this one to this one that's what he said this one to this one to get it down to your mom and dad amen one had to travel from this country to this country or from that place to this place to get you just the way you are because he he had to get the Bell so much tin and so much copper and so much lead just to get that certain Ting out of that Bell or out of that chime so it can play in his great Symphony and God bringing that down amen it was his design to get it down because there was something he wanted in this mix when he got this mix together that you would play a note that nobody else could play but because it was a perverted life and it was coming a perverted way amen through sex desire amen also along with that breeding to get the thing God wanted there came some things that wasn't desirable cuz it what couldn't be in Perfection because it couldn't come his perfect way so now as it comes down amen through the breeding amen he's got to get this one thing that he wants to use us for but along the way other baggage comes along from great grandma and Great Grandpa and maybe we might have got something God wants to use but we got something else that's going to be a hindrance to us every day of our life something that we're going to have to fight with and contend with and keep at Bay amen these are the things the message teaches us it isn't thank God for a message amen thank God for an honest messenger who would tell us this is a real life this is what Christian life is all about you don't give your heart to the Lord he erases everything off of you and now all of a sudden everything's perfect no everything's perfect between you and God the blood of Jesus Christ washes you away and makes you sinless and and free from all guilt but it doesn't take away everything that we struggle with in this flesh some of those things are still there and God helps us to overcome those things brother B said in Christ is revealed in his own word 1965 I was just talking to a young Minister and his wife in the room just a few moments ago and both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world rest of the human beings on Earth I said remember Satan's got a Punch coming at you don't care who you are he's got a right for that one punch which had you rather it be that punch be blind or be arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous see he's got somewhere he can punch you he's got a right to that open place now that's the spot you've got to keep covering all the time and to see this nervous age that we're living in now see brother bams in an interview with two people and he's talking to a a minister and his wife and he's saying now you got a nervous condition you've got a nervousness and he doesn't say let me lay hands on you and take that away from you and now you bother you no more he didn't do that he said we all got something there's something amen that's come through life something we struggle with something we fight with there's something there a spot an open place that the devil's got a Punch coming at us amen he said which would you rather it be would you rather be blindness arthritis I mean so you find out that there's something that that God has left there something that God could could God remove it absolutely but something God has left there and it's a place where the devil can punch at us and it's a place that we've got to keep covered all the time so what brother benam did in the in the interview there he didn't take it away through superpowers what he did was reveal the mystery of what was going on in their lives and he equipped them to fight the battle he told them to keep that area covered this is an area this is where the devil can get to you you got to keep it covered and if you'll if you'll look really close at your life you'll find your failures and your frustrations and the things that trip you up are always come back to the same thing over and over and over again it's not something new every time it may be new circumstances it may be new people and new names and new locations but you'll find if you study the pattern of your life the thing that keeps getting you is the same thing over and over and over again true amen praise God it could be jealousy it could be lust it could be a temper it could be a nervous condition it could be a weakness in the body that keeps coming reoccurring over and over a sickness that keeps coming back right God and when you when we recognize that pattern through our lives now we know that's the spot where the devil's got a punch with me this is what I got to keep covered all the time this is what I got to watch for this is where I have to be on guard amen I I've told people before when we've talked in the office amen people will struggle with something over and over in their lives amen and I can say you know take gambling for instance if you got somebody who's got a real jealous Spirit on them they really struggle with that jealousy you know brother brandham said his wife hope had that his first wife had that and he actually told his daughter Rebecca Bram gives us in her testimony they say that's why amen God took her off the scene he had to have MAA because hope couldn't handle the kind of ministry that brother bom had these things are amazing God and you have somebody with a jealous Spirit that's the area they got to keep covered and watch for all the time amen they don't have to worry about breaking into a gambling spirit and running to a casino like it's not even a Temptation it's not even a pull it's not even a pressure it's not anything that's going to trip them up or anything's going to fail but the devil's always going to work the circumstances to try to put pressure on that spot that he knows he's got an open Punch coming that's the spot that works it works over and over and over again amen and I say God reveal to us the place we've got to keep covered amen so that we know how to fight that devil back and resist the devil and keep that covered amen and keep him drove out of our [Music] land amen it's awesome to have a prophet on the scene to tell us how this works so this a spot you got to keep covered all the time let's go to Judges chapter 3 let's look at a couple scriptures here in judges Judges chapter 3 verse one now these are the Nations which the Lord left to prove Israel by them amen even as many of israels had not known all the wars of Canaan so there's a new crop of Israelites coming up but it says these are the Nations which the Lord left he left some Nations he didn't drive them all out he left some Nations to prove to prove Israel by them even as many as Israel had many of Israel had not known all the wars of Canaan only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them War at least such as before knew nothing thereof namely five Lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the sidonians and the hivites that dwelt dwelt in Mount Lebanon from Mount Bale herum Herman unto the entering in of HTH and they were to prove Israel by them to know whether they would hearken unto the Commandments of the Lord which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses amen this is amazing God told them he goes I'll drive out the inhabitants of the land I'll go before you and drive them out and now he gets into the Book of Judges and he says here's the Nations that I left that I let remain amen so so all those to prove those of Israel who were not in the original Wars of Canaan amen so that the Next Generation why so that I could teach them how to war so I could teach them to fight amen and God leaves some things behind Amen to teach us how to fight spiritual battles and and he leaves some things behind in us to teach us how to waren amen we would love for everything to go amen everything from the family tree everything to go away but God leaves some things to teach us how to war because he wants us to always know how to fight spiritual warfare with the sword of the word to take the word to that thing and drive it with a strong hand of Faith to the heart of that and keep driving back the enemy and keep driving about the enemy so we don't forget how to take the word and fight amen why because there's things in US amen there's an open spot in US amen that came through life somewhere through a wound through a hurt through the through the genetics of a mom and dad somehow there's something that came in us an open spot and where the devil can get a punch at us amen and God left it that way to teach us how to war so that we would know how to take the word not emotion not feelings but take the word and defeat the enemy with the word how to resist the devil amen not to resist our brothers and not to resist our spouses but how to resist the devil and see the devil flee amen you see this is this is the thing that he that he wants us to overcome amen and teaches us this war and so we get to fight this battle a lot how many gets to fight a lot all the time amen why so that we're never lazy that we're never dull amen that we that we never because there's more trials coming and more things coming and God is always keeping us sharp amen be this open spot in us that we have to keep covered and God is keeping us sharp so that we can keep fighting amen you know brother brandham he he had these this issue this nervousness this nervous stomach this nervous tension uh uh this getting the blues he had a rejection issue because he was so rejected as a child amen and he had all of these things and he kept dealing with them all the way through his ministry and God trained him by these things and taught him by them and he learned lessons and then he would come to the pulpit and share the lesson with us so that we could learn the lesson am so that what was a we weakness in him and what he suffered with becomes a blessing for us praise be to God brother bam comes through the message standing in the Gap and he begins to relate to us how he had built up a complex because he was rejected because they rejected the message he came amen and he knew he was going to be rejected he preached the seals and he said this will cost 10,000 of my friends to leave me is that what he said he knew ahead of time then when they left him he got his feelings hurt and he built up a complex knowing ahead of time they were going to do it you see how see how easy this is as human beings if the prophet could suffer like this we can too and God would use this to teach him a profound lesson and it would be a good lesson for us he says in standing in the Gap I let the sick lay I want the Lord to tell me where to go and not to go that's wrong I built myself a complex cuz the people did didn't hear my message and he actually said if they didn't want to hear it then that's fine they didn't have to and I wasn't going to go out anymore and and then you know he came up with a plan his famous plan to go up and be a Trapper and a hunter and a guide uh up in British Columbia and go help Bud Southwick out and he was going to trick his wife into going you know we know the whole story and he come up with this plan what what was driving him to that rejection and nervousness reject and nervousness that he had plagued with as a child and had been with him in in in his Spirit realm all through life and you know God has left five Lords of the Philistines conscience reasoning affection amen they haven't gone away amen and he's left other nations to see taste smell feel and hear he he's he's left some enemies to keep us how to fight to teach us how to fight cuz a lot of these things are contrary to Faith in the word of God but he's given us something on the inside to fight with and that's Faith to believe his word and to take his word and to fight back not fight reasoning with more reasoning amen not fight with any of these measures but he's teaching us how to fight by the one thing that we can fight with and that's the sixth sense of faith faith in what faith in the word of God so there's five Lords of the Philistines are left he left them behind to teach us how to war right yeah praise be to God cuz brother bam fought his battle and he's gone all the old Fighters that were taking Canaan in the beginning one by one they're going away but there's a new generation and he doesn't want us to forget how to fight so he's going to make sure he's leaving five Lords of the Philistines behind so that we would know to take that word and resist the devil with the word not resisting with reasoning not resisting with anger amen you can't yell the devil away you can't scream the devil away you can't grit your teeth and will him away amen the only thing you can do is resist the devil and resist him with what resist him with the word and take the word and a heart of faith and a strong hand of faith and drive the sword of the word to his heart and keep driving him back amen and what will happen the next day he'll come right back because God wants us to know how to fight spiritual battles with the word because we've tried self-help and it failed we've tried thinking better thoughts it failed we triy a New Year's resolution and it failed the only thing that'll work is the word so God left five Lords of the Philistines so that you would try to make a deal with them in a New Year's resolution and you would try to put them under tribute by turning over a new leaf and and trying a new diet plan right or trying not to be angry or counting to 10 before I speak you see what I'm saying saying it fails it doesn't work and that's all human effort Amen to fight a condition a spiritual condition using a human Spirit human willpower human conscience human reasoning and the only thing that'll drive him back is the word get thee behind me Satan for the word does say amen that's it we've got to take the word and win this battle with the word so God made sure he left five Lords of the Philistines for us to fight brother Benham fought his he overcame now we're going to fight ours further on in standing in the Gap he said God bless you each one and we hope to see you again real soon till then will you do this one favor for me now both here and on tapes also you Brethren pray that God will place into my heart that something that I lost out there in that complex it's so easy to build a complex now listen the way brother B describes this he said said I built myself a complex he didn't inherit it the devil didn't give it to him said I built myself a complex well if you're the one to build it you're the one to tear it down build himself a complex and we got to be careful that we're not building ourselves a complex by nursing hurts and nursing wounds and and rehearsing old hurts and and keep letting the devil keep hitting Us in an open spot over and over and not realize what he's doing and building ourselves a complex and it's really the devil amen using a circumstance to get us in the open spot and we think it's the brother we think it's the sister or the family member or the nextd door neighbor and it's never them you understand it's never them if there's one thing that we can learn it's never my brother my sister it's always the devil that gets in between it's not my spouse my problem is not my spouse my problem is me this war is between me and my enemy amen it's not my enemy is not flesh yes my enemy is not flesh and blood but principalities and powers in Heavenly places we got to fight the right kind of fight CU we keep fighting the wrong kind of fight CU we keep thinking it's the guy at work amen so if I avoid the guy at work I'll be okay because the problem's the guy at work no the problem's not the guy at work the problem is the five Philistines that are left in your land and if it's not that guy at work it'll be the guy next door or the guy in front of you in line at the car washer somebody is going to find the devil's going to use somebody to find that open spot and put pressure on you to cause that same kind of failure it's not the guy at work amen it's you amen it's the devil working on your flesh amen the weaknesses that are there through through whatever through genetics or through your childhood they're there Amen brother brandom have them we've got them and now we got to start fighting back by the word if not the devil's always going to get us going in circles and circles and circles anden we're going to be tired and defeated and spiritually weakened until we recognize what the real battle is brother benam was recognizing said it's so easy to build a complex you know what happened he wasn't blaming anybody else for his complex he wasn't blaming the people that didn't listen to his message he wasn't blaming the rejection he wasn't blaming his childhood he wasn't blaming anything else for his complex he was finally owning it and said I buil up a complex and God's got to help me then he goes down the next thing he says he talks about brother wey he said I had a interview the other day with my brother wey sitting here standing here in front a good man but built his around the complex now now he's not just pointing out his own there's a man sitting right here in front of him he started pointing out his God bless you brother Brian you're in a good spot yeah I mean it we love brother Brenham being honest but how would you like it if he was honest I just met him in an interview and now I'm going to tell everybody in the whole church what we were talking about in the interview he's got himself a complex he built himself around a complex praise the Lord he says he said a good man but built himself around a complex another kind of a complex did the same thing brother way you can so easily do it it's you just get a little something in your mind keep thinking that way go back and check it with the scriptures God and see if it's right or not and then go from there yeah don't lose that feeling of the people you must remember they're not made out of sawdust they're flesh and blood human beings and a soul pray for me all of you if you will God bless you now so brother M's asking the people to pray for him to help him because I need to get back something I've lost in building up this complex I've lost a feeling for the people and then he goes out and he points out brother way and that's important that'll be more important here in a minute why he points out brother way and what happens next cuz most of you know just after that just a minute or two after that he falls over in a heart attack dead I mean Brian might if I keep going or Donovan he's he's in a better spot that's about where brother wey was but you know all of a sudden he falls out dead and brother bham goes down there and he's been preaching about complex and losing the feeling for the people he points out brother way and brother way under the shock Amen brother bam says in the next service under the shock of hearing that he fell over brother Bram goes down and calls for his life to come back and he comes back to life and brother Brenham says that was to confirm that he hadn't left me and the ministry was to keep going brother bam repents in front of everybody will you all pray for me I got to get out of this complex he points out brother way he got the same thing all the sudden a minute or two later he falls over dead brother bham goes down and prays for him in the next service brother Bram said see he did that for me to confirm that he hadn't left me and the ministry wasn't over and he wants me to keep praying for the sick see God God's not here to punish us and put us on the back burner and God's here to use us amen but but he wants us to fight this good fight amen he wants us to overcome these things amen if if we could pull up the overhead or the PowerPoint I just want to I want to look at something this is the real the real thing that I wanted to get to us tonight this is where the Lord has really dropped something in my heart brother bham he tells this story and standing in the Gap he tells us that he had a dream and in that dream he and Fletcher Bry which is his brother-in-law which was an alcoholic and he was a bum buming around and in the dream brother Brenham was looking for Fletch and he found him in an old dump you know and there was ditches in there and they were had a fire going these bums gathering around and and uh Fletch was trying to find a place for both of them to lay down and sleep and he woke up and he thought maybe Fletch need help and he went looking for him and he found him and it wasn't it so brother Brandon moved on and and then he had this idea you know he's getting this complex because he's upset at the rejection because the people didn't hear his message and he goes I felt they ought to well I feel like they ought to as well but he got this complex and and he's driving along and he's mulling over this idea they stop at a cafe and you know he sees a he sees an old version of Fletch and an old version of himself even Billy Paul when they stand at the pace said dad that looks like you and fles and brother R said something in my heart jumped and he saw them two old bums dirt over their face from standing over a fire just got a cup of coffee and something just for a little bit of change they moved on and he got in the car to drive and Billy Paul fell asleep and all of a sudden he got this real funny feeling something come over him and he had to pull over and stopped and when he stopped the Lord told him to look and he saw this mountain range and here's what he said he said I stopped and I looked up on the mountain and I seen those Seven Hills now here if you want to see something there was Seven Peaks on top of the mountain one mountain that ran for several miles the last Mountain before you go into the other country no more Mountains after that and it was running from east to the West the mountain set and it was snow capped on top the first two small Peaks then a large Peak then another small Peak then a larger Peak then a small Peak then a great large long snowcap mountain and I said Lord I do not understand what that means he said how many Peaks are there I said there's seven how many letters in your name b r a n h a m m a r r i o n b r a n n hm 777 you think he wasn't ordained to be the seventh Church age messenger William seven Mariam seven brandom seven and if you go and look at his house on euwing Lane I drew drove by it not too long ago when we had the brothers from Poland here we went down Jeffersonville and I drove by it and all of a sudden it just struck me I'm looking at his front door and if you look over brother B's front entry door there's a there's a sharp Peak on the roof and the the left side only goes halfway down and the the right side is double the length he's got a number seven right over his front door boy that was a coincidence no because that's going to be the house for the seventh Church age messenger the seventh angel God had ordained it when he was building the house amen I can't remember it was like 50 or 51 something like that when he got the money to build that house so his early 50s before he had an understanding of the seven Church ages the seven Church Church age messenger all of that he built the house and when they built the house there's a perfect seven laying right over his front entry door because God knew he was the seventh angel before he knew he was the seventh angel his name is William Marian brandham 777 before before his mom and dad or anybody else knew he was the seventh angel God knew he was the seventh angel and before way back how long back I don't know he set this mountain range here and in this mountain range had seven Pig and brother bam says I don't understand he says how many letters in your name seven how many Peaks seven brother B said and there was three outstanding Peaks he said those three Peaks are the first second and third pool the first one was your first part of your ministry small hill then your first pool pretty high you know sign in the hand and then there was a little interval in there the time that I was taken off from being too tired many of you remember it and then come come the discernment the second pool now I've had another about a few years here of just kind of little Peak SE back like my Ministry wasn't yet and then come the third one three is a number of completion see the third one the next Peak was five number of Grace the next Peak was seven number of perfection six days shall you labor the seventh is the Sabbath the end of the week the end of time and I stopped and I showed it to Billy and I looked at them he said that let that stand if there ever was a doubt in your mind remember this place come back back here am so brother bam is he's in the middle of his nervousness of his rejection of a complex planning on running away from the ministry upset those that didn't hear and God's driving him down the right Road the right road to have this internal conflict he's having an internal conflict at the right time and he's driving down the right road coming from Canada down through Montana I think he's going to Arizona he amen God timing is impeccable and brother R had no idea that he was going through a conflict at the right time because he had to be here at the time he was going through that so he could see that because that was going to be the answer to his problem and so here's another picture of of these Seven Peaks and brother bam said there was the first High one kind of high pretty high he said there was the first pull and the second pool and then the third pool and from there it went on out amen and it said that was that was the three pools of my Ministry and the Lord told him his name is wrote in there Amen brother brenham's name is in this mountain your name is there your ministry is there your life is there my question is when did that get there when was that put there how long ago did God put those Peaks there how did he shape them how did he get them to look like that how did he get the three High ones how did he get the ones in between how did he how did he get it how long did it take and how long it had been standing there waiting for the moment when a prophet under turmoil after he preached the Seven Seals after he knew he was a seven Church age messenger after he knew he was Revelations 10:7 coming down the road in distress with a complex we get the right place at the right time and how long did it take to get him to get that exactly that way and in that place and how long had it been sitting there amen it's a good question it's a good question but look here there was a low spot and brother benam said that's when I had to leave the ministry and go off the field because it got too tired remember this and he said I made a mistake he said I was praying too long for the sick I'd stay one time eight days at the pull pit praying for the sick and just sleep behind the pull pit take a little food and go back and he said I learned that was a mistake I wasn't to do it that way so he makes he comes out with a sign in the hand a Healing Ministry and he makes a mistake with it and he gets too worn down and too tired and that nervous condition kicks up and his stomach issue comes back and he has to leave the field for a while because of all this problem and brother Brandon would talk about you know I'd made a mistake and i' gotten too tired but listen friends the low spot was already in the mountain range it was already there his life was already depicted his life was already told he said first that little hill going up in the ministry then you got the first pull then that low interval where I got too tired and then it come back in the second pool and then it kind of levels off like nothing going on in my Ministry like it's not yet and then that third big one that goes on off into eternity he said my his ministry his life was already in that mountain range amen I want to ask you could he skip the low spot no way could he have skipped the low spot could he have figured out a better way to administer the ministry could he have done a better job amen could he have learned a little faster Hallelujah friends what does this mean for us it means God's got it all under control he knows the end from the beginning he knows the low spots he knows the high spots he knows what he's going to do with you he knew what was in your grandmother great grandmother your grandmother your great grandfather to get it down to get a certain Ting out of you and he knows the bad baggage that came with it amen he knew there'd be a prophet driving down this road in the middle of a complex amen and the I mean he's right preaching in the third peak of his ministry and he's in turmoil on a complex amen because of rejection from a child and from a nervous condition and he's driving down the the road and God knew when he would hit that spot and he said stop here I got something I want to show you praise God I already knew all about it I knew about the low times the high times I knew all about it and it's all under control yes and Billy Paul says let that stand there's ever a doubt in your mind come back to this and remind yourself of this I don't know if there's a mountain range with my life in it we're not the message for the age I don't know if there's a mountain range for your life but I know one thing if you're a Seed of Abraham there's a star in the heaven that designates you and that star is already in position that star is already set it's already part of a constellation it's already it's already telling a story it's already positionally placed and it was set there before at the foundation of the world when he set the heavens amen before there was anything going on on Earth you were positionally placed in the heavens and nothing will take you out of your position the story has already been wrote amen we got to come here to make our choice on free moral agency but he already knows the end from the beginning we've got to suffer through some things to learn some things we couldn't have learned these things as Angel Angelic beings in heaven amen never having a fall never having nervousness never having a complex never having rejection never having any of these issues there things about the nature of God we can never realize and there's things about evil that we can never realize but God has allowed the backdrop of black in our lives so that white will stand out so that when we finally amen when this life is over and we're restored into that Fellowship we will have an understanding and appreciation we can never have any other way we will have a learn this is our school amen this is where we get our education this is where we learn about God and this is where we learn to stand on the word and the word only and through this life amen God knew before the foundation of the world that Adam and Eve would fall why because he knew whenever he built this mountain range he knew brother benam would hit a low spot between the first and second pool and before the foundation of the world when he knew that Jesus Christ was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and he wrote names in a book of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he knew that there would need to be lamb that would be slain why would you need a slain lamb because his children were going to fall requiring a slain lamb so before they fell he already made a provision for the fall because he knew they would fall brother B said he put them on a free moral agency knowing that they would make the wrong choice he couldn't make them do it and be righteous amen but he could give them ability to choose they would choose wrong amen why because there was something in the master plan that had to unfold because there had to be a lesson that we all would learn we had to come Fallen we had to come failed we had to have complexes we had to have problems we had to fight with ourselves so that we would know more about God in his word so he's left some Philistine five Philistine Lords in your spirit realm so that you wouldn't forget how to fight and he wants us to fight amen he wants us to fight and he wants us to win but listen he already knows the low spots he already knew what would happen in the Garden of Eden he already knew it he's the one who planted the tree of Good and Evil in the garden and the tree of life and he's the one who put Adam there he didn't make him do anything but he knew what they would do because it would work out for his plan why cuz there was a Lamb's Book Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world praise be to God they go on they're standing at the road and they're looking at this and Billy Paul Taps him on the shoulder and says hey if you're ever in doubt come back here remember this God knows all about it your name's in the mountain your ministry is in the mountain then he looked on the other side of the road he said and Billy punched me on the shoulder he said Daddy look Eastward and how it ever happened I don't know but there on the east side of the road was that burning dump the same one from his dream where him and Fletch were in miles and miles from any kind of a city an old rubbish Heap dunch laying there on the left hand side of the road how he said how it was I don't know there was that burning dump the one from his dream and here God brings him right in between he's looking here at the mountain range he's looking here at the old dump and God had already told him if you go that way your wife will leave you blah blah blah all these things will happen to you and here he stands and he looks at that and he and he's rejoicing in what the Lord telling him and he looks over and there's the dump and brother brandom says and I'm going back on the field he knew what God wanted him to do he knew the choice to make by God's grace he showed him that it's all under control I've already decided son now it's your turn to de side I've already told the story now it's your turn to act out the story I've already seen it all now it's your turn to make the right choice remember Sunday we said when Danny Henry prophesied amen over brother bam he says you have chose the harder way you have chose the Narrow Path he said you have done this at your own choosing he said but it's the right choice it is my way so brother brandham had to pick God's way but he had had to have the freedom to make the choice and he made the choice he chose the harder way the narrow way but it was the right choice and it was God's choice and we are here on Earth to make God's choice we're here to make choices we've got choices we've got to make but we're here amen with something inside of us that was there when the whole scene was played out there's something in us that was in the mind of God when God fashioned the whole story and that's something in us and amen is is is not is not a flesh amen and something in US comes from God from the mind of God Amen was there when everything was played out but now it's in us moving us according to the word and mean guiding us giving us Faith to believe the word and now we've got to make a choice not off of the senses but by faith yes now we've got to come to this place where we recognize when you look up at the stars at night may it be like brother brother brand I'm looking at this mountain range say I don't know which one it is I don't know if it's a bright one a faint one I don't know if I can see it from here or not see it from here but one of them stars represent me because I'm a son of Abraham and as long as that star stays in its position amen nothing's changing with my position in Christ God already knew when he put that star there that I would come forth now and that star's position tells a story and that story has the story of my life written in it amen I don't know it I can't understand it but I'm living it out in Jesus Christ's name we've got to have confidence in those things we got to believe it amen because things are going to go wrong things are going to go wrong might as well get used to it things are going to go wrong because when when God designed this mountain range when he dumped it there when he when he pushed the plates together whatever he had to do to cause this range to come up and shape it through erosion he designed it with a dip between the first and second pool because he knew there would be a dip between the first and second pool and brother B said it was his fault his mistake but his mistake was according to God's plan I can't explain that I just know it's the truth that that dip was there before brother Brenham made his mistake and those two things his decision there and that dip have to go together I don't understand that but it's the truth we went through hard times but were they out of the will of God we've we've done made decisions that caus us to suffer the children of Israel Jacob's sons they made a decision that caused them to suffer and it caused their father to suffer they decided out of jealousy and hatred for their brother Joseph they decided to sell him into slavery and they sold him in the bondage and he went down and he suffered miserably under that bondage and finally was exalted to the right hand of pharaoh amen and then years later there was a famine that come CU God is the master of circumstances there was a famine that come in the land and the only solution that they had to stay alive was to go down to Egypt amen and the person that was in charge of all the Grain in Egypt happened to be the same brother that they hated in despised and sold into slavery it was their choice God couldn't make them do it they had to choose but their choice was telling the whole story of redemption right there in the Book of Genesis amen because they the Brethren the Jews amen they would hate Jesus Christ amen they would sell him out for silver amen he would go down into the dungeon he would be exalted on the throne on high and in the process he would marry a gentile bride and in due time amen when there was a famine spiritual famine in the land they would come looking for grain and they would come to Joseph and Joseph would send his wife to the Palace so that he could reveal himself to his [Applause] Brethren hallelujah how did all that happen there was human beings with complexes and hatreds and jealousy making decisions and those decisions they looked at was a mistake and it was a mistake and they suffered for it they sold their brother into slavery and then shortly after the whole nation's in slavery for 400 years God keeps Good Records friends don't worry but when they get to the end of the story they they they find out this is Joseph they said oh now he'll slay us they were afraid and he says don't be afraid he said you meant it for evil your choice you meant it for evil but God meant it for good the same evil choice that they meant for evil God meant that same choice that was based off jealousy and hatred envy and strife amongst brothers that was that was the the motivation to make their choice because God meant that choice to be for good why because a couple thousand years later the Son of God is going to be there the one with the rainbow Covenant coat amen and he's going to be rejected and sold for silver and put down in the dungeon and he's going to be exalted on high and he's going to marry a gentile and he's going to come back and reveal himself to his Brethren praise be to God you know some of those past things we look back on our life the decisions we made they were wrong they were mistakes we repent of that but some of those things were tools that God used to get us where we are now some of those things are tools that God has used Amen to get us to move in his program according to his will to the place he wants us to be and we look at back of those things and we and we shudder at what we did amen but now it's time to say whatever has been has been I'm moving on with Christ I'm not going to let the devil destroy me amen because of what has been God's in control of all things he's worked everything out for his good and I'm in the place I am in the place of God and he knows the way that I take and when I am tried I shall come forth as gold praise God Amen why I was gold when I came into the trial I'll be gold when I come out of the trial I will just have some impurities moved out of me praise God let's look at Hebrews chapter 4 the book of Hebrews chapter 4 verse three for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world he's imploring you to enter into the rest although he knows where you're going to wind up the works were finished before the foundation of the world let's look at Acts chapter n Acts chapter 9 verse1 15 but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he's a chosen vessel he's speaking to ananas concerning Saul who will become the Apostle Paul for he's a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake before he suffered God knew he would suffer and God says I will show him what great things he must suffer for my name's sake and and Saul could not say is this negotiable I mean what if I don't make any mistakes what if I'm a good boy what if I do things right God had already ordained it had to be this way and it was going to be this way so let's look at what Paul says about this in 2 Corinthians I just want to look at his attitude because it means it means the world to me this is the attitude I really want to have 11:23 2 Corinthians 11:23 are they Ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more and labors more abundant and in Stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths of of the Jews five times received I 40 Stripes save one Thrice was I beaten with rods once was I stoned Thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and a day I have spent in the Deep now this isn't a resume I would turn into an employer this isn't a list of accomplishments we would normally be looking at as a good thing to talk about but he was told before he was showed before what things he must suffer for his name's sake he knew he was going to suffer and he agreed to go anyways 26 in journeyings often in Perils of water and Perils of robbers and perils by my own countrymen and perils by the Heathen and perils in the city and perils in the wilderness and perils in the sea and perils among false Brethren and weariness and painfulness and watchings often in hunger and thirst and fastings often in cold and nakedness beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches who is weak and I am not not weak who is offended and I burn not if I mean must needs Glory I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities he goes on down to chapter 12: 7 we go over the next chapter verse 7 and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the Revelation there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take no pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions I take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am I strong Paul had been told you're going to suffer he knew it was already written into the script and when he walked into it he said now I will glory in these things because Christ is getting some Glory out of this he told me ahead it had to be this way if it has to be this way then I'm willing to walk this way and not be ashamed of it but I will glory in it I'm weak I am beat up I am cast about I'm rejected I'm all of these things but praise be to God he's more than enough for me and it's still according to his plan I mean can we say that I I have had trouble upon trouble I've had problem after problem but praise be to God he knew the Low Places before the foundation of the world I'm suffering because of my own decisions but hey brother brandham suffered because of his own decision but it was written in the mountain it was cast in stone before he was born before he made the choice it was already written in stone unmovable unshakable written in stone it had to happen these things has to be this way some of the things we walk through amen we just got to go through there's something we have to learn and this is the only way we can learn it there's something we have to portray there's something we have to display of the nature of Christ and this is the only way to do it and if that's the way God wants it then we have to start gloring in infirmities we have to start gloring that when I'm weak he's strong amen when I'm rejected amen he's accepted praise be to God whatever I have to go through to live this life it was scripted before the footsteps of the righteous or order of the Lord and He delighted in his way and I want to have the right attitude to say thanks be to God who keeps me through all trouble not always trying to get out of it or go around it or build a complex because of it but to say these things must need to be this way and if that's what God ordained for me then I want to say I love you Lord cuz your plan is perfect amen hallelujah I I don't know about you but I have never been able to scream at the Devil to change my circumstances to talk mean and nasty to him and to call him names right it has never changed my circumstances getting angry with him and shaking my fist at him or stomping him under my foot or calling him a dirty old nasty scoundrel has changed nothing in my life but the only thing that ever brought A Change Is to submit to what God wants and amen repent if I need to repent and take up the sword of the word and keep marching forward that's the only thing that has ever worked to defeat the Devil in my life is when I keep moving forward in the plan of God Amen praise be to God brother B says in questions and answers 1964 he said now in other words when you become a young man or a young woman and like God takes a picture of you now no matter how old or wrinkled how disfigured whatever it may be that that will wind right on down through and the body may be destroyed disfigured burnt eat up by lions whatever it is but it was made up of gases 16 elements of the earth it's calcium and potach petroleum and Cosmic light and so forth all goes together to make up the body now no matter that's the whole Earth is filled with that but now this picture is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases and acid and things come right back into the place and develops this picture again now this picture was not taken when you were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your best when was it taken before there was a foundation of the world it was put in God's Great file he's saying the picture of you at 181 19 or 20 was taken and put in God's Great file when before the foundation of the world and then the only thing it did was featured itself here for you to make your choice see then you become a servant of God him for knowing it makes him a redeemer as we been through it then that picture is absolutely this is the negative the negative part of life is where you live now and anything if there's a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere and this ain't the real thing this is only a foreshadow of the real thing that is to come now you got it so I don't care what they would do with you they cannot destroy that file amen it doesn't matter who says what who does what what actions taken it doesn't matter what happens in your life it cannot destroy that file God God has a fireproof safe he's got a bulletproof safe he's got anything proof safe and when he dropped that file of you and the picture of what you will be in a glorified condition amen and shut that file drawer it's safe and secure you will wind up in the place he's already filed away where you will be what you'll be like it's ordained to happen nothing here is going to change what's in that file in fact our life has already been written out to depict certain things that have to be portrayed in a Redemption story and we're going to have to live it out whether it's comfortable or uncomfortable whether it's Pleasant or unpleasant there are certain things we have to live out for us and for God but the key is to have the right attitude when we live it out to recognize that that picture has already been taken and it's already been filed way nothing's changing with God and nothing's changing between me and God this is just something he ordained for me to walk through and I want to do it the way Jesus Christ would walk through it amen I have the right attitude all the time amen let's look at Romans chapter 6 I'm sorry Romans chapter 8 verse 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that we might that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did PR predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified am before you were called you were glorified the picture of you glorified is in his file and you will arrive there cuz it just as much as it's written in the mountain the thing that's more enduring than that mountain is his word am that mountain could fade away that mountain will probably be absolutely destroyed in the final destruction of the earth when it's renovated for new heavens and new earth it might be destroyed when it's renovated for the Millennium but that what's in that file in the back part of God's mind will never be destroyed amen and if that's a testimony that will endure what about the testimony of the will and word of God it will endure forever amen and God is revealed to us that we belong to him and we're part of him and we come from him that's the most enduring testimony we could ever have amen we could have a mountain peak with our name written right in it that depicts all the highs and lows of our life amen but that could fade away but the thing that'll never change is a revelation of where we came from who we are who we belong to why we're here and where we're going to it's more enduring than that mountain range and it tells us he's already got a plan we're already part of that plan we were with him before and nothing is out of kilter and nothing is out of place and in that we can say in the worst trial in the worst time God be praised I love you for your ways are perfect amen and I don't know I go forward and he's not there I go backwards and I can't find him I move to the left and I can't discern where he to the right he hideth his way from me but I know one thing he knows the way that I take because he knew it before the foundation of the world and when I am tried I shall come forth like gold don't let the devil tell you things are out of control amen don't let the devil tell you things are out of control control don't let the devil tell you amen don't let him lie the old lies to you that God's not happy with you he's displeased with you maybe you're not a child of God because if you were a child of God he would have answered your prayer and all this would have worked out you this wouldn't be happening to you if you were weren't a child of God maybe the Lord's not pleased with you my goodness look at Joseph he was pleased with Joseph look at Paul he was pleased with Paul when Paul was

him and they wouldn't hear his message the religious World wouldn't hear his message the question is how did he get 10,000 friends to start with when he was a poor little boy rejected and nobody would even talk to him it was the grace of God that had lifted him out of poverty to begin with that had given him a Ministry to start with it was amazing that that boy would have a worldwide Ministry so that he could be rejected by the whole world and mean he's feeling the rejection but missing the miracle of being able to be rejected by 10,000 people that he had called friends the whole life was a miracle it was amazing it was impossible but God Did It am then when he looks at that seventh Peak he knows that's the place of his ministry when I look at that seventh Peak that's the part that belongs to me cuz that's the opening of the word praise be to God God is good to us friends we've suffered yes praise God been hard yes praise the Lord things have happened praise be to God he's

they weren't sad and me when Paul and Silas were beaten in through in prison they begin to worship amen cuz they were happy Jesus those that counted all Joy can I tell you a story I didn't preach very long so this isn't preaching this is storytelling preaching was short I was talking to Levi the the Amish man that uh you know we've talked about that received the message and I sitting talking to him and he he was trying to get reinstated into his church because he wants to witness to his people and he told me he said I know if I could go to your church I could go to another church and he goes but who would witness to my people who would take the message to my people he said they will only listen to an Amish they won't listen to anybody else so he's working to get reinstated in the church he now can attend and he had three ministers come and sit and talk to him and they were interrogating him and they were talking about reinstating him and he's got to go through all the rules and do all these things to get back in and when he was in prison he had wrote a I think it was a 133-page letter front and back in the the regular legal pad the white legal pad and he had drew a line in between each blue line and wrote that small 10 or 13 Pages front and back that's how much of a letter he wrote and he sent it to his dad and all the ministers and it was after he read the church age book and received the message and he realized he says I realized where our denomination went wrong and I wanted to tell my dad and I wanted to tell the minister so that we could get back on track so he wrote this document and he said I would go to the Bible and to the church age book and I go and he goes it took me 12 hours to write this he goes I was anointed to write it he goes I write it and I sent it off and he said the stuff I got back shocked me he goes I send it away joyful knowing that they were going to see the air of our ways and we're going to repent and we're going to turn the church around and he said he got hateful things back and terrible things and when he got out now he's sitting in his house these three ministers come they're talking about reinstating him and they start interrogating him and start questioning him and he says the one thing they said they said everything's good but there's one thing left they said you picked up some beliefs while you were in prison yes and he said you need to drop all of those beliefs before you instate you and he said instantly love and joy like a a a a tunnel fell down over me and he said I felt so happy am and so joyful praise be to God I wish that happened to me every time he goes and I just looked at him and he goes I smiled he goes and that really kind of shocked him a little bit he goes I smiled really big and he goes I thought count it all joy and disciples were joyful to suffer for his name and he goes and he looked at him he says this is real persecution suffering for his name and he was so happy to suffer for his name he said and instantly instantly a story out of the martyr's the martyr's mirror I think I think it's called the martyr's mirror but it's a book that's really important to the Amish it's talking about their their founding fathers and all of the Martyr ISM and all that that they went through to leave the Catholic church and start the denomination and it's a and it's a book that they all read and really important and he hadn't read it since he's 15 years old and a story came right back to a a young man that was that was protesting the Catholic church and sitting across from an interrogator and a Catholic uh interrogator and was telling him if you'll just get rid of the Bible and come back to the church will accept you back and you can live and he said in in the story that man refused and he said he was burned at the steak and he to he goes instantly that story came to my mind and he goes I remembered it in detail I remembered the man's name I remembered everything and because I was talking to them about this book that's so important to Amish they would not disagree with me at all they would disagree with scriptures but they wouldn't disagree with this book he said I told him that story and I told him the man's name and I told him what happened he said it was just like this and he says the man says I'll take my burning and Levi looked at him and says and I'll take mine too and he wasn't mad and he wasn't hateful he said it with a smile on his face he was so joyful the suffer Lord he said I'll take mine too and he said that ended the conversation they asked him no more questions and they were going to reinstate into the church keep praying for Levi keep praying for him that God will use him if there's one there he's there for that one and he knows he's going to get kicked out he knows it's not going to last forever but he's there just to pull out whoever he can pull out so pray for him but when he told me that story it hit me why can't I be like that when somebody accuses or or tries to get you know accuses makes an accusation says something off hand why can't I just be happy to suffer for his name why can't that flood of joy and love come down over me oh praise God if we just had less self we would have more of that if we quit defending ourselves if we quit being so proud and and so prideful and and if we would just get rid of that stuff we would have that joy and love that would flood our hearts and say praise God if I suffer for his name like I'm supposed to count it all joy praise be to God Amen I love him amen I love him I love everybody the ones amen the ones when I first come into the message who took me aside and in a loving way rebuked me and tried to get me to see the err of my ways and told me the message was wrong and brother Brandon went off on the end God bless him I love him you know why they caused me to go back to the Bible and to the message to prove that it was right in my heart I love them they're beautiful people am they did exactly what they were supposed to do the ones whove criticized amen that caused me to actually question am I right or am I wrong amen the ones who accuse you of doing wrong they're the ones who cause you to go back to the Lord and say Lord am I right or am I wrong they're beautiful they're wonderful I love them oh man I want to be like the Apostle Paul in perils in the Deep uh I mean beaten run from City to city in conflict with my country women in conflict with them amen but I count it all joy and I say praise be to God I glory in my infirmities God chose us to come here at this time to magnify the word and glorify him I say that's an honor amen and if we have to go through hardship to show his word and if that's his purpose I say it's an honor amen we have to go through rejection and ridicule and Scorn and rebuke and sicknesses and turmoils if we have to go through poverty if we have to go through all of that to display his plan and his will I say it's a joy count it all joy it's a privilege the greatest privilege I've ever had is to live for him and not for me whatever he wants I want him to have his way because friends there'll be no regrets when we pass to the other side there'll not be one regret for one moment of suffering when we get to the other side we'll be so thankful we didn't back down and didn't complain and let him have his way it's already written it's written it's in the file so Let It Be and let me have the right attitude oh God and let me love man you got another song praise God let's sing this song we'll eventually let you go but I think we got done early amen I think we had time how many loves to worship how many knows how many's confident that he knows exactly where you're at and he knows the way that you take I want to ask you this are you confident that after you're tried you'll come come forth as gold because you were gold deity to start with and deity has now fallen into the Earth gold deity and somebody had to dig it out of the earth and while it was in the earth it got impurities mixed in with it do we understand the story now it was gold but has been hidden in the earth and while I was hidden in the earth impurities got mixed with it amen and now God's got to bring it through some trials to strip all the impurities out of it the fiery furnace the beating uh through the smelter but it was gold before and after it's tried it'll still be gold what's he trying to do purify the gold in your life and purify the gold in my life can you say that though I'm tried I shall come forth in Gold he knows the way that I take he's already written in this file and he's a good god and I love him for it regardless of the pain I love him for it regardless of the hurt I love him for it anyhow let's worship him
