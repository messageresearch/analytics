this morning isn't this a wonderful place to be it's cold outside spitting rain so for that reason it's a good good place to be but aren't you happy to be in the house of god with people of like precious faith able to listen to the word to worship god in spirit and in truth that is something that we should not take for granted isn't that wonderful praise the lord maya it's good to be with you look around see so many different friends it's just a pleasure to be with you very thankful that brother chad invited me to be here with you today it's an honor and it's a real privilege to be among you amen well if you would i'd like to invite you to take your bibles with me thank you musicians enjoyed the the music and the singing brother nathan enjoyed that special wish i was going to be here next weekend to hear you but uh we'll be praying for you i'd like to invite you to turn with me if you would to the book of galatians and i'd like to read in chapter six galatians the sixth chapter and uh it was also good to be with the lamb family yesterday as they celebrate the uh the marriage of um of two wonderful young individuals and uh to witness the marriage of a lamb not the lamb that was uh you knew that joke was coming but uh it still cracked me up a little bit i enjoyed being with him you know i think brother branham said the best gift that god could give a man outside of his salvation is a wife a good wife and that's the truth that's nothing but the truth a good portion of who i am today is because of my wife and um and all that god has brought us through and brought us together for but you know marriage takes work it's not an easy thing you old-timers can uh tell me of that much more easily than i could at this point in my life but there's nothing there's nothing better than having someone who loves you and that you love you dwell together you you learn things together you learn about each other you grow you change together change is inevitable it's the only thing that is constant and you change together it's a beautiful thing it's crazy to think that you could take two humans from two separate families merge them together and they get along and then they create more humans who do the same thing it's a fabulous institution but uh it works praise the lord galatians the sixth chapter i'd like to read verse 14 with you but god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world let's pray if you bow your heads heavenly father lord thank you for all the many things that you have given to us thank you for your blessings and may we count every blessing which are many lord we thank you for the truth as we pursue it the best we can lord by your grace today may we seize everything that you have for us may you encourage may you lift up may you instruct may you remind lord we pray that you'd afflict the comfortable comfort the afflicted we surrender ourselves entirely into your hands we love you so much we say thank you bless these few moments that we have together in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen you can have your seats thank you for standing with me i was uh reading this week and and the life and the ministry of the apostle paul has always been of great interest and a wonder to me if i could write a book no one would read it but if i could write a book i would write it on the life of paul as as it as it should uh uh be a wonder to every christian the life of paul from what i can tell the uh a little over half of the new testament is attributed to paul more than half of the of the new testament is attributed to paul and then even when we look at the book of acts about his life the book of acts is largely about his life and uh the pauline of epistles that have been called in the in the on to the book of acts with the with the uh anointing of a lion he charges into the the world with the message of the gospel he gives the church the knowledge of their first love he he he was the one that that that spread it around and they caught a hold of the vision and they they grasped the message of the hour and he was the one that led that charge into a world that knew hardly anything of christ they knew nothing of christianity and he presented that to the first church i admire the experiences that he went through in his life i i admire most importantly as i was just remarking his obedience to the scriptures and uh of which he was a great scholar and a well-studied man of the truth and of the of the torah of the bible as well as um uh uh within the sanhedrin and all of the inner inner workings of the temple he was well studied he was a scholar of the scripture and so later in his life as he began to serve christ he submitted in obedience to the word which he believed all of his life in a greater way as it was revealed to him and what i find remarkable and what we find in the life of paul is that it take to obey is better than sacrifice as as the prophet samuel said but as we see from the life of paul it takes great sacrifice to obey and brother branham said that apostle paul was a bible scholar and a man who experienced so much but he never rested his doctrine upon his his experiences alone and i think that's very important that we that we we know that because as believers we experience so much we we have the blessing of his presence in a way that many people don't have it we experience it so much but it's important that we don't rest our doctrine on the experience alone and paul did not do that and he was a he was a hebrew by birth a citizen of rome and he studied in a greek university and so he was a well-rounded individual he's well educated of course but uh if you look the the the jews had a concept of light and i heard someone say this one time he they had a concept of what the light was that god is light and the romans had this idea of glory for the glory of rome and the greeks just lifted up knowledge to the point that it was unhealthy so the jews understood that the concept of light the romans went for the the glory of rome and the greeks were consumed by knowledge in the pursuit of such and then in second corinthians chapter four and verse six paul with his ability and his his intellect um in his revelation and by the inspiration of the holy spirit he says and he brings all three of those different components of his his background together and he says for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ so he brings his hebrew background his roman citizenship and the knowledge of the greeks and and his understanding of that and he brings it together and he says uh uh he he takes the abstraction of the messiah and brings it to the embodiment of the lord jesus christ all in that all in that scripture he commanded the light to shine out of darkness and hath shined in our hearts in the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ it's magnificent and uh he says here in our text a man with with his intellectual ability and he he said many times as he was going around uh different places he said i come not to you in the wisdom of man or the with the enticing words of man's wisdom i come to you in the power of god alone but with his ability to think and and to construct an argument and with his background he comes to this point in his life which was actually towards the end of his life when he wrote the book of galatians with his tenacity for what he believed in with all of his experience with all of his suffering and most importantly with his understanding of the revelation of the message of the hour he says god forbid that i glory in anything or anyone save the cross jesus christ now it's important i believe as believers that we grow in the knowledge of christ as the spirit of wisdom and of revelations as it says in ephesians uh i believe ephesians 1 17 uh as paul he prays that the the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him so as believers as christians we we must grow and in grace and acknowledge we must mature the seed that god has placed inside of us it grows and it produces fruit it's not for the intention of just sitting there and looking pretty the christian life is to be manifested it's to be exemplified it's to be something that that has an action uh uh from it it's it's to be in action uh your faith is to be in action god never intends for you to stay in the same place he intends for you to do you're not to be just hearers alone you are to be doers of the word and so we must take what we hear and we must grow in grace and in in in the knowledge of him by the spirit of wisdom and of revelation who is the holy ghost that works among us and in us it's natural that we mature from the elementary things of christ as a newborn christian you you learn things you hear things that are new and fresh to you but you must grow you must increase your understanding you must go forward in christ that is his intention that's the goal that's what happens when you water a plant you receive growth if you subject the plant to the right atmosphere you have fruit and so that's god's intention we grow in revelation we grow in the knowledge of him hebrews chapter 6 verses 1 through 5. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and this we will do if god permit so he's saying and and this is uh paul saying to the hebrew church he says this we will do if god permit this is where you were i want god to take you further so don't stay where you are we should move further than where we are don't just don't just stagnate the purpose of the lord jesus christ in his people is to make them fulfill the word of god in their daily life what is the purpose of of god's word if it isn't to manifest in your own life if it isn't to change you if it isn't to mold you and shape you more into the likeness of jesus christ himself that is the purpose of the word that is what the word does is it changes and so he's saying this we will do if god permit you've heard the gospel cry you've desired the sincere milk of the word as as peter said as babies in christ you desired this once you tasted that the lord was good you desire this sincere milk of the word and then paul he would later say to the corinthians later on he said i have felt i have i have fed you with milk and not with meat hitherto uh because you are not able to bear it so there is a time and a season when you are able to bear certain things and mature in revelation and understanding and god knows exactly where each one of you are you should never feel ashamed if you don't understand something god has a purpose in what you understand and what you know and what you can comprehend you don't have to feel like you're you're uh uh not as spiritual as somebody else and and you you you condemn yourself for it god knows exactly where you are in your walk with him and he is the leader of your walk with him isn't that right it's not the it's not a denomination it's not the church it's not any one pastor it's god and the individual and he is concerned about what you know what you understand and how you grow and the pace at which you grow this we will do if god permit and and he said paul said to the corinthians he said i'm not able to feed you yet because you're not there so you do grow you will get there just give a time and pray and give yourself to the lord so he can take you there so the holy ghost can take you there when you get ahead of god's timing that's when you get yourself into all kinds of trouble god knows when we're ready and he he knows and he will grow you as you need first corinthians 3 7 so neither is he that planteth anything nor he that watereth but god that giveth the increase it's god that increases what you know what you understand what you have in your heart it's he that does the the building and the growing then peter comes right along in second peter in chapter one in verse 10 through 14 and he says wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall and for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth yea i think it meet as long as i am in the tabernacle to stir up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as the lord jesus christ lord jesus christ has showed me he says now listen i know that you're establishing the present truth but i pray and i hope that i can stir up what is inside of you and bring to your remembrance the things that you are to do to bring to your remembrance the things that are perhaps more elementary he says if you do these things then you will never fail you will never fail and i believe and i as as what's been on my heart for the past couple weeks and it's just been pressing on my heart it's pressing on my heart even before brother chad asked me to come and speak there is one passage of scripture that i pray never becomes common to me and i also pray that it never becomes common to you as i fear there is a danger of it becoming so as as i was thinking and just in my own heart and in my own mind i i felt like i had lost just the the impact of it it's it's matthew chapter 27 verse 27 through 56. it's the story of calvary the story of the cross i hope that that passage matthew chapter 27 that it never becomes common to me i feel as many people and sometimes they've lost the impact or the feeling it's not about feeling we know that's not about feeling alone but they've lost the impact of the cross the passion of the christ peter he says in in paul paul says i i pray that you you'd grow in grace and acknowledge and then peter comes right behind and he says you've been established in the present truth but i bring to your remembrance i want to stir up that which you know that which you know to be the truth i believe uh we're in danger of the magnitude of the cross and perhaps i'm just speaking from personal experience so forgive me if you will but i believe some sometimes we're in danger of losing the magnitude of the cross to where it becomes common to us and it has no impact it doesn't move us emotionally it doesn't move us but and and we emotion is is good a lot of times we say it it's it's it can be dangerous and it can be but emotion is good god gave it to you for a reason he made you that way for a reason and to be moved by what what what christ did for us as a group of believers with the understanding that we have with the revelation that we have with the depth of the mystery that we have and to not be moved by the cross what a shame it's often the the first thing that you are taught when you're a young christian new in the faith but as time goes on you learn new things you grow and you mature but as you go spiritually in the message of the hour you experience amazing things uh that that most people on this planet uh uh uh could never experience um you you experience the presence of god in a way that most people will never have the privilege of experiencing the vast majority of the people on the earth will never uh be in the midst of a group of believers who are worshiping god as they should and and praising the lord jesus christ and you have that privilege and not only that you you have that privilege several times a week and you step into that and you experience that and you go through that and you have that that that honor of being in that presence you grow in grace and acknowledge and you're you you you are the grace the only grace that the world will ever experience you and and your relationship with christ and them seeing who you are is the is the only grace that they will ever see and you are that grace to them you as a result of your uh relationship with christ as a result of the presence of god in our midst uh you are hidden from the storm that that rages in the hearts of everyone that does not know the goodness of christ you are hidden from that storm and when we think we have problems we are hidden from so much and and however 2020 has impacted you you are hidden and and hidden under the wing of of christ more than you realize you are kept from evil more than you realize god won't tent you more than what you can bear but you are kept from the evil one much more than you could ever understand and then the enemy that lurks in the shadows and and wants to pounce on you and is kept by the grace and mercy of god and you have that privilege you fight the enemy on a daily on an hourly basis but you don't fight the victory or fight the enemy for victory you fight the enemy from a position of victory you are victorious you are an invincible army and thus you fight the enemy not for the victory not for the win you fight from a position of the wind you've already got the win [Applause] that's who you are you experience the richness and the goodness of god almighty and and you you have to keep yourself humble about it we've come so far in the opening of the word in the revelation that we have and it's a good thing all of those are good things but i believe in the midst of all this so many times we can fail to remember even though we say it over and over and over that there was a real man jesus of nazareth that was beaten and bruised he was a lamb led to the slaughter so that you could say and have all of what i just said he did that so that you could sit here and have all of that the apostle paul says far be it from me to boast in anything or anyone save the cross of jesus christ may we never trivialize the cross may we never do that christ's death and burial and resurrection is is not elementary in my opinion it's one of the deepest subjects that you could possibly talk about it's it's the reason that we are here and with the revelation of the opening of the word you can look back and see the truth of what the resurrection really was to us we can see what the resurrection produces in us with with the understanding that we have and and and within the remembrance of the cross lays the mystery of your future your expected end within the mystery of the cross lays your expected end and i believe by his grace and by his mercy towards you the reason that the cross is so important the reason that we should never trivialize it the reason that it should never lose its impact on us as individuals and move us emotionally is because the same power that raised jesus christ from the dead dwells in you today the same power that raised jesus christ from the dead it dwells in every single one of you you may be tired you may be anxious you may be depressed you may be uh worried about the week ahead you may be worried about your job loss you may have any of the issues that come as a result of living in laodicea but you have inside of you the resurrection power you have inside of you the same power that brought jesus christ from the grave it lays inside of you and god promised in isaiah 55 the word will not come back to me void it will not come back to me without have achieving what i set it out to accomplish and you have a promise in you that the same power that was in jesus christ that raised him from the dead is inside of you today [Applause] that's why we should never lose the impact and the emotional impact of the cross of jesus christ may there be inspiration in the present that comes from the remembrance of the cross revelations 12 and and the bride uh uh overcame satan uh himself by the blood of the lamb we can see this story from genesis to revelation the story of the cross but before even that in the mind of god in the foundation of the world even before the beginning it was in the mind of god 1949 the deity of jesus christ brother branham he says the same power of christ that was hung on calvary's cross the same god that raised him up in the day of resurrection is in you now and you that's got the holy ghost oh don't you love him oh hear his voice today you know the interesting thing uh i know some of you was talking about the rich last night about the uh the trip that they took to israel and you know i stood at golgotha's hill and i've looked at it and i've been there i've been at the tomb and you know i i never experienced any power there i i felt let down i'll be completely honest with you i was there and i was expecting this you know great feeling and i felt nothing i was recently i was on a work trip and i was in louisville and i went by brother branham's grave and i was standing there and i was thinking this is brother brandon's grave i had never been there just until recently and uh i was standing there and i was looking at it i was thinking man this is brother brandon's grave and i felt nothing i went to the place where the angel came down in the in the in the place and i matched it up with the photo and was standing right there and i was thinking this is awesome but i felt very little and you know what came to me is a realization that oh it's not there anymore it's in me i realized oh that's that's that's why this is an amazing place it's sacred to god it's an amazing place it's an amazing piece of geography on the face of the earth but god is not there anymore he's in me and i realized that that the power that was there has transformed itself into me why i don't know i still ask the question why but it is and i believe it is and my faith makes it so and i'm there by the revelation of jesus christ as the spirit of wisdom and of revelation works in the knowledge that we have of him he brings you into an awareness that you are the godhead bodily may the cross have its full effect in us today i i pray that it would may that may i pray that it would move you today i pray that as just in thinking of it just in bringing it up that it would remind you of who you are because of of calvary's cross sin was finished because of calvary's cross those who accepted your victory over death was won because of calvary's cross your healing was signed sealed and delivered your healing was signed sealed and delivered because of the cross your anxiety your depression your mental struggle your issues was won and finished because of calvary's cross because of calvary's cross you as the elect of god you see your redemption story clearly unfolding before you and your eternal future of godliness and peace and joy was purchased for you because of calvary's cross no matter how humble you are or how spiritual you are or how knowledgeable you are no matter how uh uh uh how how high you may feel you and me on the same level kneeling before the cross no matter how good you've been or how bad you've been you and me are on the on the same level as we kneel before the cross we're on equal ground you're we're we are on equal ground because it was god that brought us there you didn't choose to find yourself to the foot of the cross it was he that brought you there you didn't you didn't choose to find yourself to the place where sin would be finished for you he brought you to that place he brought you to the foot of the cross for god so loved the world that he gave he brought you to that place you are here this morning not by your own doing but because god loved you i pray that impacts you we're all sitting in this room today because he loved you god forbid that we should glory in anything or anyone save the cross of jesus christ if you have your bibles open to matthew 20 uh seven and forgive me um for for doing this five thousand years ago abraham is walking up the mountain with a promise in his son and he's going to express his faith in god not an intellectual faith but a real genuine faith he's going to offer his son as an expression of his faith in god and abraham was there with his son and he has the dagger and he's bringing it down on his son and god stops him and said abraham because you have done this your seed shall possess the gates of the enemy and daniel would write later on in in daniel 7 18 he said the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever forever and abraham called that place uh that that happened when the angel stopped his hand he called it jehovah jireh the lord will provide and 2 000 years ago from this point on the same mount abraham was to sacrifice isaac uh he fulfilled the promise god fulfilled the promise and gog off this hill on calvary and he took his son up that hill and as the knife was coming down that time it didn't stop god led his son up calvary's hill and the knife was not not withheld because it is is written in isaiah the word will not return unto him void it was predestinated to be so brother branham said in 1956 he said in the era of god's deliverance shot from a bow i love that title he says look yonder at calvary where a man hung on the cross and died and the only real example that was ever put on the wall in the world for human beings to live by is the man christ jesus uh again forgive me if you will but i don't know the last time that you've read this turn with me to matthew chapter 27. if you would let's start in verse 27. now this is before uh uh and i'm just going to go over this as time allows judas who was four ordained to um his condemnation betrayed jesus already and the the the sham trial which wasn't even really a trial at all it's basically a mob the sanhedrin they delivered jesus to pilate and um pilate plays uh politics and and he learned the inner working the inner workings of god's perfect will and how little power he actually had and uh we all learned that lesson at some point or another and they released barabbas and jesus is condemned to the cross and pilate washes his hands and the the people themselves cry out his blood be upon us and they were they remain in their blindness to this day and then starting in verse 27 then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers and they stripped him and put him on a scarlet robe and when they had played at a crown of thorns they put it on his head and a reed in his hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews and they spit upon him and they took a reed they smote him on the head after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from him they put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him as a society i i believe that we have become numb to violence it doesn't impact you especially if you're around hollywood at all it doesn't impact you you don't feel it even if you've seen news stories of bombings or whatever it may be violence doesn't impact us as a society hardly anymore some people who are more responsive to blood than others but violence as a whole does not impact us and if you think about this for the romans the romans who gloried in and it was a sport for people to have hand-to-hand combat with swords and spears and to to cut each other open only it to be finished off by predatory animals if they survived in an arena and they called that sport for them there had to be something far worse for a criminal if they called that sport and it was around that time that rome fell when sports was at its apex and if they called that sport then there had to be something far worse for a criminal that's what the romans did hollywood has done its best to capture the scene of the passion of the christ but i don't think we i don't think we fully grasp it we can read just just so just so casually and they stripped him and they put on him a scarlet robe when they had plated a crown of thorns i don't know if you've ever seen the actual thorns that they would put on his head but those bushes are all around and they're they're two or three inch thorns very narrow very sharp and they took that and they they they pushed it down on on jesus's head the the savior the man that the decide the disciples called master the one that we we look to the person of the lord jesus christ because he was the word made flesh and we we think about that we think about that that man who was there and i wonder how much it actually moves us what actually went on because it was your sins and it was my sins that put him there after that they had mocked him they took the robe off they took jesus and they beat him until his bones laid bare brother branham said they they beat him until his bones stared at you as the psalmist wrote in psalm 22 17 i made i may tell all my bones that they stare upon me and i just i just want you and forgive me for for um speaking on such an elementary level it's pressing on my heart don't don't miss the opportunity to grasp the humanity of the situation don't don't miss the opportunity to to remember the horrible nature of what happened to jesus christ i think the romans believed that this method of humiliation of of beating of of uh crucifixion was more a scare tactic than it was anything else if people would witness this in capital punishment perhaps they would just um they would uh um pers dissuaded away from crime and i agree with him it was the most painful death that they could concoct to beat him to to mock him to strip him naked to an open shame and for him to willingly submit to it he knew that it was going to happen he prayed lord would this could this cup pass from me and yet he willingly submitted himself to that kind of brutal torture in the pain and the severity of being beaten like that and in the the the the blood running out of of him even before all of this the the the horrible nature of the actual cross took place and he's there remember isaiah 53 it says for he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed 55 in the redeemer and redemption once placed your hands by faith on the head of the lord jesus feeling the the the pains of his suffering yonder at calvary in your stead remember it was your sins that done it to redeem you he did it god himself become flesh so that he could pull the stinger out of death they mocked him and i think few group fewer groups of people could be more obscene and and uh horrible to be around than a group of roman soldiers and they said that the band of soldiers the entire band came around him they prodded him with a stick they gave him a reed because a king needs a scepter they pressed the the crown of thorns upon his head and pushed it down and then in verse 32 it says and they came out they found a man named simon cyrene uh uh by name cyrene is a place in libya that's about 900 miles away and uh they actually um he had traveled over 900 miles to be there for the passover because there's a there was a group of jews at that time there's a group of jews in that that place and they would have most likely been in jerusalem because of that and so he was there you never know what what the lord is doing in your footsteps to guide your footsteps to where you are today and and simon was there and they asked him to come and and they compelled him to bear his cross verse 33 and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say a place of a skull jesus was to carry his own cross through the via del rosa i've walked that it's a long walk most likely he carried uh only the vertical beam which have which according to the lumber that was there would have weighed about a hundred to 200 pounds i i don't know exactly i'm just assuming this was during the passover so there were busy people all along the streets people running about families in town this walk is a long walk and in the heat it's hot it's a miserable it's a it would be a miserable place to be in 34 34 they gave him vinegar to drink and mingled it with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink according to the research that i could do that was a cheap roman wine and it was mixed with gall it was actually almost a sensory relieving drug so it was actually a cheap wine a vinegar wine that would actually relieve or dull temporarily the senses so when it says here that he he drank mingled with gall and when he had tasted it thereof he would not drink so he knew what it was and he wouldn't drink it in other words he wanted to bear the full impact of the pain that he was just about to endure he refused uh for better lack of the term the advil that he could have taken the tylenol that he could have taken he said i don't want any of it he refused it he said i want to feel the full impact of the pain and of the anxiety that i'm about to go through 35 and they crucified him they parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots they crucified him they you you probably know much of this is what i'm saying and uh again i apologize for being so elementary but perhaps some of you need to hear this maybe maybe this is this is what you need to hear today there's also children here who perhaps need to to hear the impact of the cross there was um they would take and he most likely carried the long beam uh that was there or the the cross beam that was there and they would tie the cross beam to them was about 100 200 pounds and they walked him to the place of the skull on calvary's hill and then he was there and then they would take that and place it on the main beam which was uh typically ready to be hoisted or already there and then they would hoist them up with ropes or whatever it would be pulley systems and so they they had him there and then they would they would put the individual down and they would take the nail which uh there was a body exhumed in jerusalem near near around the city that was actually crucified by the romans during that time they dated it back to that time and they they knew that the the nails would have been probably seven eight nine inches long and they would be tapered uh iron nails and they'd be very sharp and they would they would just that's what they used for the crucifixion was that length of a nail and so they would put it some say they put it on his wrist thomas said i want to feel his hands and jesus said i want to put it in my hand so i believe they put it in his hands and the hands are not able to to handle that weight so when you put when you put the nail that's why a lot of people think they put it on the wrist because the hands are the the wrist can handle the body weight of a 150 pound man but the hands cannot they would just tear apart and so wherever they put the nail they would put it there and they drove it in and they drove both nails in and then they put the feet typically on a little step or something like that and they put both of his feet there and they they nailed the feet down and what would happen is they they because of that support they would let their their knees go a little bit because they felt the support so they pushed themselves up and jesus at this point was was very bloody and his blood had had largely let out and so he he didn't they wouldn't have the strength and so they made this as excruciating as they possibly could and so when he was there they would they would let the the the cross do its work and they would let their knees give way and it would put the pressure on the hands and then when they did that it would restrict the the lungs to the point where they couldn't breathe in or breathe out so they could they could inhale but they couldn't exhale and so they'd have to push themselves up on that little post where their feet were which were nailed into the the the post so it's excruciating pain and they'd have to do that to exhale and then they would let themselves go down and eventually that that excruciating pain would would give way and they would die but typically it took a long time almost nine hours to die so that's why they would come by and take a post and break the knees of the individual they'd stab them they'd do whatever they could to get them to die because the roman soldiers didn't want to just stay out there until they died they unless they wanted to leave them out there for for for a longer time in which case the birds and everything would come in and and and pick at it and this this is this is what jesus endured and uh i was i was just i was just sitting in my office and i was just thinking of this and uh like ben sitting his office and you just the lord just moves you in certain ways and i just began to cry and i realized in myself i don't think i've ever cried about this i don't think that i have ever cried after reading what happened to the lord jesus christ on the cross which he did for me he took on my inability to save myself he he endured that excruciating pain and and refused anything that would dull his senses he he wanted to feel the full impact of the pain for me he he did that so that i could stand here today and say with faith i am redeemed i am the redeemed i i realized i don't think i had ever cried about it and you can imagine the people that were around you can imagine the disciples who were witnessing this not not filled with the holy ghost yet and they were witnessing this and they were thinking what on earth i imagine it may have been very similar to the people who surrounded brother branham right after he died a horrible car accident it didn't make sense at all and people were saying what do we do now he left no instruction on the on the uh on what the church should do after he passed away speaking of brother branham he left no instruction on okay now this is what happens this guy needs to start this church brother perry needs to go here but the biscuit needs to go there you need to have all these different guys doing this he left no instruction everybody just went home they didn't know what was to happen but then they began to get into the word then they began to go back into what he actually said and he said now was what what did he actually say then you begin to see the books come out and people got the word and they began to get in the word it was an exact fulfillment of revelations 10 8-11 where john took the book and it became a part of him in other words they caught the vision they were around it and they saw it and very few of them actually understood the impact of what was happening until they caught the vision and that's when god fulfilled his own word and filled them with the revelation of the hour and then it spread around to the rest of the world i imagine the people around jesus christ may have experienced the same type of feeling what on earth is going on this this was supposed to be the man that was going to lead us out of out of roman captivity or this was the man that was supposed to lead us into the very heavens it's it's themselves it's itself and he's he's dying like this i i can't imagine what it would have been like to have been able to say from the people that were there uh i saw the actual blood of jesus christ on that cross i actually saw the actual blood of jesus christ run red 1939 and they passed and reviled him wagging their heads and saying that thou destroys the temple and build us it up in three days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and the elders and they said he saved others and himself he cannot save and if he be the king of israel then let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him and he trusted in god and let him deliver him now and he they made an open mockery of him and now in the sixth hour verse 45 there was a darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour and in the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying lama suboxone that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me brother branham said in 1959 he said living dying buried rising and coming he said but because he died of grief he he because he came to his own and his own received him not he died of a broken heart and when he knowed the very creatures of time that that he would die to redeem had spit on his face and he was rejected of man i think brother branham said that about someone else that had said that he died of a broken heart verse 51 and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent in the temple the earthquake that happened as a result of the crucifixion it had ripped the veil in the temple from the top to the bottom so no man did that ripping god ripped it because it was from the top to the bottom in 1961 in abraham's grace covenant he says and now that was uh he's saying i'm going to take the covenant like this abraham and he took the the abraham and showed him what he was going to do with jesus christ the seed of abraham caused through abraham come isaac and isaac come christ and through christ the supreme sacrifice was made and all these others was natural seed israel israel israel israel but through christ open the veil to either jew or gentile greek bond or free male or female and that we all might enter into the shekinah glory which was only for jews alone but now it's for whosoever will let him come in first peter 3 18 it says for christ who also hath suffered for sins but just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but being quickened in the spirit i i was sitting there in my office and i began to ask uh just as i was reading this and i was just in tears and i i the the question always comes why why did he have to do this and i i believe that we know that um and you don't have to turn there but john chapter 12 and verse 24 it says very very i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit and i think a part of you may ask whether it impacts you greatly or even a little bit of of what happened when he was bruised for our iniquity and when he was crucified however much it moves you there's a part of you that may ask why did this have to happen it doesn't make sense to us why did it why didn't he just freely give it to us why didn't he just freely redeem us why why why didn't he uh just just totally do away with sin and and and death why didn't he just totally do away with it why why this process and then john except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit now we know that with within the message uh we know that there is the law of reproduction we know that very well and we're very familiar with it uh how every seed can bring forth of its own kind so we know that if if you put an apple seed in the ground the law of reproduction says you will get apples if you put this in the ground if you put corn you'll get corn the law of reproduction is is alive and well but uh it's the other part of that overriding the law of reproduction is the law of life and death so overriding the the law of reproduction is the law of life and death because in the reproduction of the plant there is life but there is also death so for the law of reproduction to work there must be overriding at the law of life and death in 1960 um in the five identifi identifications of the true church of living god he says the first thing he created was angels to worship him then he becomes god so isaiah 14 describes how lucifer in his heart was conceived to exalt himself above the throne of god and and gets down from the realm of heaven and and so god separated the light from the darkness and we see that in in genesis there was there was light and the light was separated from darkness in 1955 and i will restore he says now the book of genesis is the beginning the very word genesis means the beginning now everything began in genesis evil began in genesis good began in genesis life began in genesis and death began in genesis what i find is that people acknowledge that there is life you acknowledge that there is life that the life of god the presence of god is is among us here uh uh uh in in his life and we understand that uh uh that there is life in them but oftentimes we understand uh um the the fact that without death that life could not be there because life comes only through death in uh genesis god creates man and the places him in the garden and puts the law in place the law of life and death the death is a consequence of of of breaking the word so we're he's there in the garden of eden and eve was nowhere present when he placed the law of life and death and order and i find that interesting that that eve wasn't there um uh uh there was no uh if if um uh she was not present in bodily form if you will when god set the the law of life and death in order death wasn't a concept that was foreign to god where where one day the woman pulled from the man's side messed everything up that's not how it happened death was a concept to god before there ever was a man before there was a woman god had in his mind that there would be death because he placed in the word this is the tree of life this is the tree of knowledge of good and evil he said to eat thereof is death and to eat this is life and eve was not present when he said that so the overriding the law of reproduction is the is the law of life and death in 1965 god's chosen place of worship and that's just what god has two different laws and one of them is the law of death and the other one is the law of life god has two laws follow him and serve and worship him his life to reject him is death god has two laws 1962 from that time there was a time when there was no death on the earth there was a time when man didn't have to die but because eve reasoned listen to satan's reasons against god's word death began to reign from that time on and we know that the blood of the lamb which was slain was slain before the foundation of the world so god had his in mind the idea of a slain lamb he had the idea of death before there ever was the foundation of the world itself death was not a foreign concept to god it was not something that came in and messed the plan of life in order to receive life god placed in order the law of life and death life can only come from death it was under a conditional basis you cannot eat thereof and death came through the woman life comes from the male life comes from christ he is the author of life and when satan rejected god and wanted to be like him and and separated uh separated death was was separated from life but there was death created there was life there was the original seed there was the word a thought expressed and yet all of the attributes were in the mind of god and there was the lamb slain so when there was god when the word was there in the beginning with god in the word was god there was also the slain lamb now we take in 1959 a bomb in gilead and i want you to listen close to this now we take a grain of corn and put it on in in the ground and it may be a pretty grain of corn all polished up looks real nice but as long as it remains in that condition that's all it'll ever be so you can have a seed you can have an apple seed you can have a grain of corn you can have whatever you want and it's beautiful and it's nice and you can polish it but as long as it remains in that form that's all it will ever be and so we find then because the the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world there was more for there to come from the word from the seed than just to be the word there was more to it than just to be god in himself alone as the word he says now sometimes we join church and a lot of pretty things in it and maybe so forth and maybe we tried to um uh do pretty ourself up and go to church and got to know something or another to wear to church and is that all church means to you then i'm persuaded that you need a new birth it's exactly right that grain of corn will never produce any new life until the old grain rots away from it now the important concept to understand is that in the scripture we see that if a grain of corn abides alone and it goes into the ground and dies then it will bring forth much fruit but if you plant that grain of corn into the ground and you you you see that we are a seed word bride so don't lose the analogy here so you see the seed going to the ground if you take that piece of uh seed and you go back a few months later when the stalk is there and you pull it out of the ground and you look for the seed the seed is gone there is no more seed what it did is it produced something else and what you have to understand is that death is not to die it is merely a transformation to die is not death it is merely a transformation so if you go back and try to find the seed it's changed its form it's not there anymore so if a corn of wheat goes in a corn a corn of corn goes down into the ground and abides alone it dies but b but through death comes life and this was a concept that was in god's mind before the foundation of the world because the lamb was slain then and so if you pull the the seed up then and you look at it and you see more corn on top it died and it produced more fruit what it did is it didn't just remain its form that in that sense it moved up into the plant the very life that was on the inside of the seed changed its form it rotted off the core of the seed and it moved up into the plant and now the seed is gone it's no more the seed now it's the fruit in which it produced so the very concept of life is it cannot exist without there being death death is a means of transformation in order for you to have the same resurrection power that jesus had on the cross he had to go into the ground and die he had to receive the sins of those who he was dying for so that you could revive in newness of life when the new birth comes in it cannot come until there's a death first and people don't want to die i believe it was in um a perfect um strength in perfect weakness sermon i believe that was a sermon when he said what we need is a good old-fashioned dying out he says now in this sermon bomb and gilead he says now people don't want to die they don't want the simple leadings of the holy spirit and sometimes i think we can fight against the simple leadings of the holy spirit without even realizing it people don't want to die but but there cannot be life until death first they want to take their own thinking of it and you can't take your own your thoughts you got to think his thoughts let the mind of god of christ be in you amen and then when it's in you as far as the world concerned it'll bring new life and it'll bring resurrecting life it'll bring new thoughts it'll bring a new person it'll bring a new faith it'll bring you from death unto life now there is no condemnation to those that are in christ jesus they have passed from death unto life so in the cross of jesus christ and i believe i said this the last time i was here but i just want to go over it again briefly if if um we see in in first corinthians chapter 15 that christ was clearly the second adam and we see that if the first adam if if the wife was taken from adam's side then in the second atom he she would also have to be taken from his side and so that's how we know that we are as it says in ephesians chapter 5 i am flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and if we were there in the beginning with god as it says we were if the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world then he had the idea of the cross in his mind before there ever was a foundation of the world before there ever was a person because the law of life and death overrides the law of reproduction and so he had this concept of death but he had this concept of life coming from death it wasn't just the word it was to produce more word it was to produce a bride for his son and so in the first adam there was eve in the second adam there was also an eve but when we were cr when when the word was in the beginning the word was with god and the word was made flesh and it dwelt among us then it was he in the beginning we were in christ because we were flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone how many of you believe that you are flesh of his flesh and born of his bone you were there in the beginning with god because you were in the mind of god then you were in the mind of god because you are an attribute of god that portion of your soul that's in you that is eternal it was with god in the very beginning before there was a foundation of the world so you were there with him he was the word he was with god he was god and then he comes and it the the word was made flesh and it dwelt among us and so now the word is living among us and it dwells inside of us now jesus christ the person of jesus in nazareth he was there on the cross and if he was there paul in galatians 2 20 he says i was crucified with christ paul was not crucified with christ in the natural so how could he say i was crucified with christ nevertheless it is not me who lives it is christ who lives in me so if he could say i was crucified with christ then that means that he must have still been in christ and if the first eve was taken from adam's side and to be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone then that means that the second eve must still have been inside of christ when he was on the cross so that means that you as the word were still in christ when he was on the on the cross so that means that when he died and when he took unto himself death when he took them to himself your sins and your iniquities and your wrongs and your depression and your anxiety and all of the things that you struggle with as human beings when he was still on the cross you were inside of him you were in him there and then he sent his holy ghost back to as as the ages rolled on and as people pop up they they receive the word and they're anointed of the holy ghost and that seed that eternal seed they become the seed word bride by understanding the revealed word of the hour walking in the light and they receive the holy ghost and then they are made alive in christ they step into that stream of eternity they step back into that stream of eternity so christ was there in the beginning he was the word and then he was on the cross he was still male and female on the cross god hasn't taken that that female portion out of him yet and then he dies and he goes into the ground and the reason that we have a death is to produce life because to die is not death and so he raises again and when he raises again we rose with him and that is how paul could say i am no longer i am i am crucified with christ i was there in him on the cross and now it's no longer me who lives it's christ who lives in me nevertheless we live you don't dig the plant up and see the seed the seed grows up into itself and it produces fruit and you see the fruit you are the fruit you are what christ produced as a result of going into the ground and dying and producing life so the very reason that we can say it is it is uh this is the same power that raised up christ from the dead also dwells in your mortal bodies and it will raise your mortal bodies the reason we can say that is because we were in the mind of christ before the foundation of the world and then when he was on the cross you were on the cross with him and then he pulled the bride out of himself the second eve then you have the consequent uh seven church ages life christ died and we died to ourselves to change into the likeness of the seed that's in there god did this to express himself that's why he put the law of death and order before eve was even in the picture is because he had the intention of producing life in you when we think about the cross when we think about the passion of the christ i pray that it moves you but it's not the end of the story it's not the end of the story and as he was there i i don't believe that god i don't i don't think the angel moved the stone to let god out i think he removed the stone to let us in and so we we get in and he's not there and he comes back and he and he says uh um uh uh uh he comes back just just to say it simply he comes back in revelations 1 18 he says uh in revelation 1 18 i am he who lives and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and i have the keys of hades and of death only through death comes life jesus as a result of his death he crossed jordan's river and then he comes back across jordan's river because of my inability to save myself sin was a tone for healing was atoned for 1965 in the easter seal but the enemy says he is the judge and we are the witnesses that he's redeemed us and in us lays by the grace of god today that resurrecting power romans 6 4 he says therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead and the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life colossians 2 he says he made a show of the enemies of the principalities and the powers of this world openly triumphing over it i don't i don't think any of us in this room will ever understand how someone could love us so much to do that i just don't think we will i think fathers have a greater grasp of it in in in the thought of actually uh as abraham did in type uh of of actually having to sacrifice is his son and being will and having the willingness to obey the word because the obedience to the word requires great sacrifice i don't think any of us will ever really truly understand what that meant but you know i i believe this with all of my heart i believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever and i believe as human beings we all struggle um many are the afflictions of the righteous we go through many different trials and in situations we go through many different mental issues health issues we're not exempt from that we're not exempt from corona we live in this world we're not of it but i want you to grasp the reality of this that he who raised jesus christ from the dead man who endured all of that and died and rose again the same power that rose him from the dead it's inside of you and you think you're sitting there and you think i believe that brother steve i don't understand it i can't fully grasp it but i believe it and then you're thinking in me really the same power that raised jesus christ from the dead it dwells in you today this is not a tomorrow thing this is not next week it's right now for healing for deliverance from the things that you struggle with life can only come through death and he he died so that we could have life this morning so in the face of that and in that revelation as as jesus said to peter upon this rock i will build my church upon the revelation of who he is the gates of hell cannot prevail against that revelation and and the new birth simply put by brother banham was the revelation of who jesus christ is to you personally and so to to look back in the remembrance of the cross lays the mystery of your future and to to remember that and to think about that and just just to read the scripture whether it impacts you greatly or not just to just to read that scripture and to know he did that because of me he did that for me and i am here because of him and now sitting in your seats today is the same resurrecting power and keep in mind that the word it cannot return unto unto god void in other words it won't accomplish what it was set out to accomplish it it we it won't uh it won't not accomplish that which he was set out to accomplish it won't um uh not achieve that which god intended for it to achieve in you it can't do it it's impossible and so you're sitting there and you're thinking but i've got this and i've got this and i'm dealing with this and i'm struggling with this well welcome to laodicea hello did you expect any different what did you expect did you expect an easy life laying on a bed of ease 2020 has proved you wrong and so we think about all the different things that we have oh by the grace of god we have those things so that god can overcome them in me so that he can prove himself alive in me so therefore i glory in my infirmities therefore whatever you're dealing with all throughout the room which it could be vastly different one from another could be very serious it could be health it could be mental whatever it is vastly different one from another therefore glory in your infirmities because in your weakness he is made strong it's because he already paid the price for your sins for your weakness for your inequalities that you can say i'm the redeemed you can sit here today and claim the authority of the lord jesus christ as his elected of god because he paid the price because life has come as a result of death you have risen in newness of life and therefore because he paid the penalty of death because life can only come from death because he paid the penalty of death you have only life before you you have only life before you whether or not you experience death in the natural remember to death to die is not death so whether you die in the natural it is not death because christ paid the penalty of death for you so now all you have in front of you is life you are an invincible army you say brother steve i don't know what the will of god is for me you've got it this is the will of god for you the decisions that you make who you marry those are those are just stepping stones in the process of accomplishing his will concerning you so many young people they worry about wow you know where do i go to school what do i what do i learn what do i do for a job just relax i believe brother lonnie was the one that said the key to the spiritual is to relax just relax this is the will of god concerning you the decisions that you make the the scripture we were talking the other yesterday the scriptures of of of a good man are ordered by the lord the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by the lord in other words you may not know the decision that you need to make exactly you may not have an exact word from the lord it takes footsteps in order to be ordered by the lord so just just put your foot up and say lord where do you want me to put it where do you want me to place it you have all the power of heaven behind you which is he only acts in accordance to his word so don't abuse that he only acts in accordance to his word so don't say well the lord told me to do this and then it's totally off the word come on now but on the basis of the word which is what the holy spirit acts upon you have all the power of heaven behind you so therefore if you struggle with something if you have need of of healing if you're worried about something he is more than able you have been made more than conquerors because he paid the penalty of death which life can only come through death you everybody in this room you only have life before you you've passed from death unto life may we never trivialize the cross would you buy your heads musicians would come for the ben the chad brother ben if you would sing maybe a song or two and lead us in worship i want to pray with you gracious heavenly father god forbid we boast in anything or anyone save the cross of jesus christ lord may we know may we be stirred up as peter said in the remembrance may we be stirred up in us the reality of who we are in you it's a revelation of who you who we are in you in the person of the lord jesus christ lord lord and you we we can be we can really be changed we we can really overcome there's power behind the name of the lord jesus christ and you said you'd be in the midst of us when we gather in your name and we believe that you are here we know that you're here lord and lord i i pray for the people in front of me as brother nathan saying i pray for my family lord that we would know the full measure of the power of the cross [Music] lord it's it's with the the eyesight of an eagle we can look back across the pages of history and we can see lord we are the elect of god we we are the bride of jesus christ but it's only through the cross it's only through your death that we can say that we have life today but lord may we not just be hearers of it but may we be doers may you help us to do and myself and i'm sure many can say the same lord and i think so many times we just failed to do we think oh you know i've got to do this and i've got to do this but but it's not that it's in resting in the power of the lord jesus christ it's in yielding to the word of god lord it's in surrendering [Music] lord may we fully surrender everything to you maybe there's someone who hasn't done that yet lord today is the day may it not be tomorrow may not be next week may i overcome may you help me to overcome today and tomorrow is going to be another battle for itself but i'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow today i want to surrender myself entirely to you i want to know the power of the resurrection in my life in my daily walk with the lord i want to be able to overcome the enemy that sets itself before me i want to know the reality of the power of the resurrection lord would you grant it today would you move through our hearts lord [Music] lord we're all on equal grounds before the cross for that i'm thankful i think everyone in this room could say we're probably the lowest lord we're all on equal grounds the lord together may we say as the bride of jesus christ lord if it weren't for the cross where would we be [Music] move in our hearts lord move in our minds bring both our mind and our hearts subject to the word of god granted father that you'd speak to us just in the stillness and the beauty of your presence and in the name of the lord jesus christ do we pray do we ask these things and do we say thank you amen and amen i wonder if you'd stand for the ban won't you come and sing in the cross in the cross be my [Music] shall find your rest [Music] in the crosstalk [Music] my [Music] r praise the lord amen may it never become common to us as our brother said i enjoyed so much the reflection the reminder of what god has done for us but the present tense impact that i have has on us today it wasn't a reminder for reminder sake it was a reminder to refresh in us the reality of what today is what was purchased for us what was accomplished at calvary is being manifest out today it's a living reality of what god has done for us so many things that were impacting me all over again as he began to speak is the crucifixion displays the cost of sin the required punishment for failing the word and jesus took the required punishment the wrath of god was poured out upon him because man had rejected the word of god and we had rejected the word of god we had failed on the word and so he took my place the crucifixion displays the cost of sin but at the same time it displays the value of god's elect because the value of something is the price you're willing to pay for it and what was the price that god was willing to pay for his lost children his own death on calvary sort of two things it displays the cost the grievance that must be paid for in sin but also the value that god esteems on you and i that the blood of his only begotten son would be shed in exchange for the purchase price of my soul that makes us more than just the dirt that we dwell in but it makes us purchase dirt something of great value to god and i was reflecting on the statement brother brenham said that tree of life was cut down out of the tree of life would come the bride tree and the bride tree fully matured would be the tree of life restored back to him again the seed that went in the ground would grow back to become the bride tree and the bride true would be the tree of life restored back again christ in you the hope of glory another thing he said is the resurrection power is in us now if the resurrection power the same the same spirit dwell in us that dwell in christ that raised him from the dead it'll quicken your mortal bodies and brother branham did not make that a future tense scripture he made that a present tense scripture he said it'll quicken your mortal body he said it's already begun you used to smoke you used to drink you used to lie you used to lust what was that that changed all of that it wasn't your willpower was the quickening power of god the same spirit that raised him from the dead is the same spirit that raised us out of dead denominationalism and false understanding of the word and all kinds of infractions and penalties in the sin and the flesh so if he's already done it and he's already done it in us then the change in the body is a foregone conclusion because he changed me from a life of sin to a life that serves him he changed me from habits i couldn't overcome with willpower he took away sinful desires he quickened me out of dark denominationalism it gave me eyes to see amen the body change is a foregone conclusion i'm not worried about the body change it's already changing [Music] that's what calvary has produced for us it's a sure thing it's not a guess it's not a hope it's faith it's something that's already been accomplished it's something that's already working i'm not worried about what will work i'm looking at what's working and what's working will produce everything i appreciate brother steve his wife being here i want to say god bless him god bless him for taking the time to remind us of what's been done for us and what it's producing now and what it will produce in the future let's pray for our brother that god will bless him amen let's just bow our heads and praise we're dismissed lord jesus we thank you father for god when we were unable you did for us what we could not do for ourselves lord you foresaw lord all these things and knew what they would be and you had a conclusion already in your mind it was an accomplished work before it was ever acted out god in the acting out in the display of what was in your mind we saw how horrible sin really is when we saw what a horrible death our savior died we can look and we can realize the cost of sin the price that had to be paid displayed how horrible sin is but also god that you would stop at nothing to redeem back your chosen ones that you wouldn't leave us lost lord that you wouldn't leave us in a fallen condition but you intended lord to raise us up for your glory god i pray that the reality of that would be a living reality in our everyday life that this flesh would be taking on the reality of that quickening power that's within us that would change us into the likeness of jesus christ from glory unto glory day by day lord decision by decision may that spirit working in us keep quickening these bodies until the last final quickening changes these atoms for we believe it lord we see it we're realizing it it's going on all through us well thank you all we can say is thank you lord we appreciate it we're grateful lord we're so blessed lord by what we've been reminded man may we never forget it lord or take it for granted but always with deep appreciation in our hearts look to calvary lord with a with a warmth inside knowing that you paid the price and we are redeemed and the work is finished and i can rest in that and may you today lord with your quickening power that's in your bride may you finish the portion of the work that you left to do in and through your bride and may you do it now through me lord through my brothers and sisters by the quickening power may you bring every spiritual reality to light in our flesh may you have that great victory that you saw before the foundation of the world when the final victory death is put under your feet when these bodies change born while we ask that you would bless us as we go from here as my family and i part and separate lord it's always difficult for me to leave the assembly even for a vacation but god they're your sheep not mine these are your people lord your children god and we trust you with each other as we take this little trip and come back together lord we look forward to the trip but we look forward to coming home being united together again with the congregation i pray to bless us each and help us to grow lord day by day hour by hour by the revelation and the knowledge that is in you may your word lord become more alive to us every moment of every day may we look more like you every moment of every day we ask these things you're keeping for us lord in jesus christ's name we
