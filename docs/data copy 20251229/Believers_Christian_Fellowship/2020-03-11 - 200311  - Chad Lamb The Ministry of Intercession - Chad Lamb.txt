only in response to his love that came first praise be to god it's wonderful to be here with you this evening sure appreciate the atmosphere man let's just turn to matthew 22 together i'd like to continue on with some of the thought from sunday it just wouldn't leave me altogether so praise the lord we'll keep moving in that direction but i'd like to take the title if i could this evening on the ministry of intercession the ministry of intercession and we'll begin here matthew 22 this is a bit of a review we've read this sunday we'll go over it again matthew 22 and 34. but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence they were gathered together then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying master which is the great commandment in the law jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets praise god if we could just master these two things we've mastered it all praise be to god let's pray the heavenly father we thank you lord for your word well we just pray that you would have preeminence among us lord that everything we say and all that we do and lord to hunger in our hearts and to pull on the word and the speaking forth would all be done for your glory and be pleasing to you lord we pray lord that you would just take your time and speak to our hearts lord and deliver to us lord that which you have for us in this hour what we have need of to accomplish your goal and your purpose have preeminence among us in a greater way in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated let's turn from here over to matthew 12 and we'll pick up this same discord over here and a mark i mean i'm sorry mark chapter 12. it's the same question and jesus gives a similar answer but but i like the way he answers this over here as well in mark chapter 12 and verse 29 and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hero israel the lord our god is one lord and i shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this thou shalt love the thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these and so we we talked about that last sunday and we labored on that for a bit but but all the long the prophets hang on these two the first one is love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy mind with all thy strength amen with all thy soul and the second is likened to it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so the capstone is love the the the whole all of the law and all the prophets hang on these commandments love god and love your neighbor amen there's none other commandments greater than these and the capstone is the same thing and so we believe that the capstones come down and we're a capstone ministry is that right and so that this is the age for this this word to live in us and if it's in the scriptures and it's calling for it in this hour then we can have it it's available you know it may seem so far away we know our own temperament we know our own personalities we know our complexes and the things we've struggled with but this isn't the hour for complexes to come forth this is the hour for the word to come forward this isn't the hour for the genetics to take preeminence over the word but this is the hour for the word to take preeminence over the genetics but we get what we believe if we believe our genetics will override the word then that's exactly what we're going to get and if we believe that our complexes amen are stronger than the word then that's exactly what we're going to experience but if we can by faith say this word overrules my complex this overrules my hurt this overrules my past this overrules my genetics this word this this capstone of the capstone ministry this part of christ that he's displaying in this day the fullness has come and it's for me to display in this hour we've come to that and we have to hold that in our minds we have to believe it by faith in our hearts and we have to move forward amen with this before us this is the goal this is what we're walking towards and we have to believe that it's possible we have to believe it's what he wants we believe it's in his word but we have to believe it's what he wants and we have to believe it's possible and if we move forward that way we will get what we believe amen we're not expecting anything outside the word this is just the word let's go over to first corinthians while we're still in our review first corinthians 13. let's read we just read the first part of this but we're going to read the whole chapter i believe uh first corinthians chapter one amen i told you before when i spoke on sunday when whenever i would hear somebody start preaching on love because of the abuses because of the uh the unscriptural application i always recoiled inside because the the the teaching on love was always you know love everybody be sweet you know pass out candy everything's fine nobody's bad nothing's wrong but that's not love that's not god's kind of love god's kind of love is the rod there's the rod of correction that'll whack you on the tail when you're wrong and come along and comfort you and bring you back in line that's god's kind of love god's kind of love it brings the truth and brings it straight and brings it on us but also will advocate for you to get back in line amen so the god's kind of love is is a strong love it's a powerful love and it's not a tied just to our emotions and just to affection because emotions and affections they move around they fluctuate they go up and down but this kind of love doesn't move it's rock-solid amen it's eternal it's set it's not changing so this is you the capstone is love so we can't get away from talking about it but we don't want to talk about it in humanistic terms we want to understand it from god's vantage point uh first corinthians 13 1 though i speak with the tongue of men and of angels and have not charity i am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profits me nothing charity suffereth long now look at the attributes of this kind of love charity suffereth long it's long suffering is kind charity envieth not it vaunteth not itself is not puffed up this kind of love is not self-serving this kind of love is not self-focused this is a sacrificial love it doesn't envy it is not jealous of others than in the others it's not puffed up it doesn't try to vaunt itself and put itself forward this kind of love does none of that amen verse 5 it does not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things praise god this kind of love can bear through anything all the dirt and trash that the devil can pour on this love can bear through it this love can endure all things amen let's keep reading charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity praise the lord charity love is strong bears it endures not vain not puffed up doesn't think itself is sacrificial is enduring is firm is strong is powerful that's this kind of love i want to talk about intercession now this is this was a bit of a review from sunday but intercession the definition just out of webster's i believe it is intercession the action of intervening on behalf of another the action of intervening on behalf of another and so this kind of love doesn't seek its own but seeks the better of another and we talk about the ministry of intercession the action of intervening on behalf of another and and i say this way when you get nothing out of the deal god not for game not for notoriety not not just just intervening on behalf of somebody else and with to go back and talk about moses when moses stood in the gap amen and he and he told god not to do away with israel and then he you know not to do away with the nation and and he went down and and executed the judgment of god and calling for the levites to come stand by him and they slew three thousand of their brother in that day and demolished the golden calf and made him drink it and all of these things but but then he went up on the mountain the next day to make an atonement for them to what stand in the gap for them and look at what he says he says father forgive them of their sin and if not blot my name out of your book moses was not going up there and standing in the gap to get anything out of this deal he was willing to lose all for the sake of somebody else and so it this is in and brother venom told us he said i never could understand how moses could have a better idea than god because but then i realized it was christ in moses that that's what god was looking for he needed somebody who would stand in the gap somebody who would stand in the breach because god was going to destroy them all had not somebody had not moses stood in the breach so somebody amen under the anointing of christ had to stand in the gap and be willing to give up everything so somebody else could go free praise god so the intercession is the action of intervening on behalf of another let's go and look at ezekiel 22 together and we'll spend a little bit of time here in ezekiel ezekiel 22 and verse 29 ezekiel 22 and verse 29. and the people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have vexed the poor and needy yeah they have oppressed a stranger wrongfully and i sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land and that i should not destroy it but i found none therefore have i poured out my indignation upon them i have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have i recompensed upon their heads saith the lord god so they had done wrong they had oppressed the poor we talked about this at the very end of the service last time they were guilty they were done wrong but before god poured out his wrath first he was looking for a man that would stand in the gap somebody that would take up the hedge that would stand in the gap and say father don't do this don't do it oh god don't don't cross over me to hurt them i'm standing here to guard them to shield them to block them he was looking for somebody that would stand in the gap and take up the hedge and when he found none he poured out his wrath and right now the bride of jesus christ on this earth is standing in the gap because if it wasn't for her the wrath of god would already be poured out with no restraint with no restraint until it completely destroys and brings in a millennial reign so so now we find out that there's somebody standing in the gap but he was looking for somebody nobody was there so he went ahead he said therefore verse 31 therefore have i poured out my indignation upon them i have consumed them if he had found a man who would stand in the gap it would have stopped the destruction but because he found none the destruction came now we're looking at that for the whole land and i talked about the position of the bride but what about for a brother or sister what about for somebody else i mean are we willing to stand in the gap to make up the hedge amen are we willing to stand alongside or intercede amen for somebody else an action of intervening on behalf of another but i remember talking about when your brother he's done you're wrong done you're really wrong you know he's guilty as guilty can be amen you go you stand shoulder to shoulder with that brother what are you doing you're interceding for him you're not just saying whatever i don't care what happens to him no i care what happens to him i don't want anything bad to happen to him if i've got a desire for evil to happen to him there's something wrong with my heart if there's a desire in me that something evil will happen to him just because he did evil to me then there's something wrong with me amen because christ was willing to throw himself in the breach to those who had done him horribly wrong amen we've got that we've got we've got to say god you've got to break down all of self amen so i can get to this place that i my life matches exactly your word and your character to where if somebody's done me wrong i can stay there and say god i'm hurt by what they did i don't understand why they've done but lord would you heal me and would you help my brother and brother ma'am you stay there and then god begins to talk back to you it begins to show you what your brothers went through and show you why he's done that and then you start feeling sorry for him what happens compassion starts to come in because you recognize your brother's in the condition he's in because of something that he's went through or something that's happened to him and then you begin to intercede for him say god let him go i forgive him i pray you forgive him now let's go back here to ezekiel 9. let's go back earlier in the book of ezekiel ezekiel 9. let's look before he poured out his destruction this is earlier on ezekiel chapter 9 and we'll begin at verse 1. he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lie toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer's ink horn by a side and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar and the glory of god of israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writer's ink horn by his side and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in mine hearing go you after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house so he's going to bring a destruction he's going to bring a correction amen but he's got the man with the ink horn and brother benham talks about this in in a couple places we'll read it here from leadership 1965. now look at yourself really are you a genuine bible christian full of love of god remember the bible said the last days when his times take place he said a marking angel went through the churches went through the cities and sealed only those who sighed and cried for the abomination that was done in the city is that right ezekiel 9 we know that's the truth the marking angel went forth and put a mark on their head forehead sealed them them that sighed and cried after that came the slaughtering angels from the four corners of the earth which is coming right away we see it coming war is moving right in that'll kill the whole earth off there was nothing that they couldn't touch but them that had the mark now back out is your heart so concerned about the sinners and the way that the church and the people are doing until you can sigh and cry about it day and night if not so i'm wondering that's the scriptures brother branham i mean he makes a high standard when he starts to talk about this he starts to talk about you know we ought to have this kind of experience of sighing and crying but when you look at ezekiel amen he was sighing and crying over the sins that were done in the midst of jerusalem in the city which is the church and they were grieved over what was happening in the church and there's people sighing and crying over what was happening in the church in the midst of jerusalem amen who who was it that was crying out for the sins and the abominations that were done in the church you know that was the city that was jerusalem that was the church and brother bannon says what about the sinner what about the church who's sighing and crying about that because you know there's a heaviness that comes when you start to see brethren doing wrong you know it wasn't that those people they could say well that one's wrong and that one's wrong and that one's wrong and that one's wrong and that one's wrong and that one's wrong but i'm right and walk away satisfied that i can identify error and somehow makes me feel justified that i can identify error and now i feel good about myself i must be right because i have the ability to identify error you know who else can identify heir the accuser of the brethren the accuser of the brethren is gifted to identify error is that right and you don't want to be in his camp amen and you want to just take up his side and become an accuser of the brethren but yet these people who were sighing and crying over the abominations that were done in the city that were done in jerusalem the holy city of the holy people amen they could identify the wrong absolutely or else they wouldn't have sighed and cried over the abominations they could also identify the wrong but they weren't as the accuser of the brethren they were taking the part of christ and they were sighing and crying say oh god forgive us oh god help us oh god bring a change open the eyes of my brother open the eyes of my sister change this circumstance they were sighing and crying for the abominations that were done in the midst of the city you know it'd be a shameful place amen for the bride of jesus christ to get into a place where she becomes the accuser of the brethren [Applause] without the capacity to sigh and cry things go wrong sometimes people do wrong things happen that are wrong is that right but who is interceding who is it who's out there that's not happy that something's wrong who's grieved over the sin and the abomination that's done in the midst of jerusalem who's grieved amen when we when we see you know when we see our brothers and sisters some of us going the wrong direction when we see worldliness and worldly entertainment creeping in in a family or in a brother who's excited about that the accuser of the brethren and you can't help when you see it there's an honesty that comes with this kind of love it's true and it loves the truth charity loveth truth amen and there's a real truth to say what that that's wrong that's not right that's the truth amen but at the same token just as soon as that that charity can recognize that's wrong the truth is that's wrong charity also can intercede for the wrong and say god forgive my brother forgive my sister and can enter in because this is one holy city of jerusalem and can enter and say god forgive us for our wrong brother branham could do that he could stand at the at the pulpit and he said god forgive us for our sins could enter right in with the brothers and sisters right in god forgive us for backbiting god forgive us for all the transgressions god forgive us for all of these different ways there's got to be somebody because if there's not somebody to stand in the gap god will pour his wrath out upon it and i don't want to see my brother and sister under the wrath of god's judgment i want to stand in the gap and say god forgive them i need them they need me we all this this holy jerusalem's got to be right it's got to be purged it's got to be clean it's got to be correct and i'm not happy when i see abomination and i'm not satisfied like just my little corner is going to be fine my little corner is not going to be fine till the whole thing's purified things are not going to be right till everything's right it behooves all of us amen to intercede for one another amen because really we all have a time we need somebody to intercede for us because there's things that all of us have weak spots and blindness amen and things that we can't see but other people can see it so clear amen we're always blind to our own condition but can see another but if i amen if i can just throw myself in the breach for a brother or sister then there's a brother and sister that can throw themselves in the breach for me [Applause] amen if i take up a critical spirit and i start to become the criticizer of the accuser of the brethren there's going to be another brother that becomes the accuser of me and i can't afford that i'm too weak and too needy i'm too flawed and have too many problems amen i need somebody to intercede for me and how can i ask somebody to intercede on my behalf until i'm ready to intercede on somebody else's behalf amen you know we've started the prayer time on friday and saturday amen and there's such there's such an atmosphere in the sanctuary if you've had the opportunity to come you know what i'm talking about when you enter in it's an absolute brokenness that you hit no pride no arrogancy but an absolute anointing in the sanctuary that just breaks you down i tell you that's the time to intercede let's use that time wisely when we come here on friday we come on saturday let's start interceding and say god would you help us all help your bride we're not in the condition we should be can we do that can we throw ourselves in the lump because there's only one bride there's not two there's not ten there's only one bride of jesus christ so whether we like it or not we're in the mix and if there's abomination in the bride it's affecting you and i it doesn't matter if it's the pew next to you and if it doesn't matter if it's on the other side of the globe if there's abomination in the bride it's affecting you and i we are linked through a mystical link and it behooves us all to intercede and say god you've got to help us rise above this global seeing condition you've got to help us lord not cut all the world off of us lord don't don't sit in the house of the scornful and sit up on your pedestal and say god if you could just bring everybody up to where i am that's not the way to intercede the way to intercede is throw yourself on the floor face down and say woe is me i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell amongst the people of unclean help us all god we all need your help i need to go higher we all need to go higher we need the world cut off more and more and more amen we need to be clean we need to be purified well you need to have a greater preeminence among us than what you have now we're all in this thing together man there's no no no place just to point fingers and we see things we see things in one another that's grieving we see things that are just grieving and just they they're devastating to us because we know that they're wrong see it in your family you see it extended family you see it here you see it other places you'll see things that are wrong the question is why did god let you see it and why did god give you the discernment to discern that that's the wrong spirit that's that's not right so you can criticize or so you can intercede you know if if god opens your eyes and you can accurately discern a situation and say this isn't right what that family doing is not right what that young person is doing is not right what's happening here or over there is not right amen if god has opened your eyes and you can see that you can accurately discern it by the word that means you're the one to intercede that means you're the one who can stand in the gap because god's given you by revelation and ability to see and in in and identify by revelation then you're the one to stand in the gap you're the one to fall on your face you're the one to take your brother or sister with you amen before the throne of god and say god i'm here with my brother amen and i'm asking that you help us i'm telling you use that terminology amen get get away from help them and help them and help that and start using the terminology of one bride and one body amen and say god help us amen if i smash my finger amen i'm not saying god would you help the little tip of my finger the last two quarter or last half of an inch or quarter of an inch no i say god help me i'm hurting because it's all me every part of it's me amen and every part's linked to another part can we get to the place where we can intercede that way when we see something wrong amen we can take amen spiritually we can take in in our own hearts that brother that sister to the throne of god with us and stand there with our arm around them shoulder to shoulder and say god we need your help right now and my brother for some reason has got caught in a trap or some circumstances got him derailed or are on the wrong track i don't know why but god i'm asking that you help us help us oh what what language friends what language pride is not not part of love love is not puffed up it's not vaunteth itself doesn't envy says this is a strong kind of love this is a powerful kind of love let's look at romans chapter nine i referred to this but we didn't read it sunday but i'd like to read it together romans 9 and verse 1 i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart the apostle paul is going to start talking about his brethren the jews i'm going to ask you who was it that mistreated paul the most his kinsmen his kinfolk the jews they mistreated him they abused him they mocked him they lied about him they beat him they he was he was evilly treated by his own kinsmen but here he says i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh that's somebody who knows how to stand in the gap that that's a challenge to me that attitude that approach is a challenge to me you talk about setting a high standard you talk about perfect love you talk about something that you'll never attain to with humanism or carnality or the carnal mind you're never going to get here with a humanistic way amen but if we're ever going to get to this place it's going to be christ on the inside amen christ taking preeminence in us but he says i i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for i could wish that myself were a curse from christ for my brethren he said i could you know he can't change what god has done any more than then moses could make god blot his name out of the book god said no i'm not going to do it but he had this sorrow in his heart this heaviness that if it was possible he could wish himself wish himself a curse from christ for his brethren's sake i'm telling you that's the nature of christ paul wasn't going anywhere god had already wrote his name in the lamb's book of life he was predestinated it wasn't changed condition but he had such a heaviness such a sorrow such a love such a desire that he could even wish himself a curse from christ for their sake if it was possible knowing that it wasn't possible i tell you friends there's there's something tremendous about this kind of love to where we want others so bad to be right to be saved amen to be born again we want it so bad that we become heavy and with sorrow in our heart because we're longing for things to be made right oh i tell you this is what i want this is what i want so bad when i say god you've got to build this in me i'm not where i need to be but oh praise god for opening our eyes we can see how short we are and when we recognize how short we are intercession's not a problem anymore because somebody's going to have to intercede for me because i'm not where i'm supposed to be somebody's gonna have to say oh help my brother chad amen help him to get over himself and get past himself so he can get to this place we need each other the apostle paul just like just like moses was willing to throw himself in the breach was willing was willing to be lost so that somebody else could be saved so god help us brother branham in the message questions and answers 1964 he's referring back to what we read about ezekiel mark those who sigh and cry says the sign cry for the abominations that did in the city where do you see that i can show you ten thousand speaking in tongues to one that's really burdened for sin listen to this listen to this because the pinnacle of christianity is not a dynamic display of the spirit [Applause] amen but the pinnacle of christianity is jesus christ nailed to a cross saying father forgive them they don't know what they're doing the pinnacle of christianity is selflessness giving yourself away for the sake of somebody else the pinnacle is not a dynamic display of power or dynamic display of of the presence of the spirit that's not the pinnacle the pinnacle is being able to be spit on mock scourged made fun of rejected by everybody you know strip neck and nail to a cross and still say father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing if you get to that place you've got to the pinnacle of christ-likeness amen we put the wrong emphasis on the wrong thing for far too long but to have the spirit of christ is to act like christ so to have the holy spirit will bring the nature of jesus christ upon us till we get to that place when we're riled up on we don't rile back it's not dynamic show it's not what's seen amen in the dynamic exciting thrilling powerful move of a spirit and a service that's not the pinnacle the pinnacle is in the face of rejection and mockery and scourging and all of those things to still be able to have the nature of jesus christ in the midst of that rejection and hatred and say god i love my brother would you forgive him god i let him go brother branham said in shalom he says i see him walking arrogantly walking away from the truth and i recognize they're under darkness they can't help that i forgive them and i say god please forgive not only to brother branham forgive them he was able to intercede for those who were walking away arrogantly from the truth of the message he was bringing and he was offended by their rejection he preaches it standing in the gap we talked about it sunday he was himself personally offended and he had to get over himself he had to die to himself and get over himself till he could get to the place in shalom amen he was preaching in june of 1963 standing in the gap now in january of 1964 six months later he's come to the place where he can say it's not their fault they're under gross darkness they can't help it i forgive them see the growth and the maturity and the prophet of god what should be happening to us friends the same kind of growth and maturity amen i want real christianity i don't want a sunday show and a wednesday show i'm looking for the reality in my life i want it monday morning and tuesday afternoon and wednesday i want it friday when everybody it works against me i want the real deal in my life the real life of jesus christ on display in me i'm not looking for a program i'm not going to sunday to get pumped up and get excited and say we're in the right we're in the truth no i want the truth in me and i want to if they shut the church down i still want to have the same life we're not coming for a pep rally we're coming for instructions in righteousness we're coming for correction and reproof why because he's stripping away and stripping away and stripping away until he finally gets the image of jesus christ and the bride that he's been looking for what's he doing sunday and wednesday he's beating the gold and beating the gold and turning it over and beating the gold until he gets his reflection yeah when's it going to be over brother chad until you perfectly reflect the life of jesus christ because judgment begins at the house of god brother baby said this is the judgment seat where he comes in and shows us your backside why because you know it doesn't do us any good to come here every sunday and every wednesday and say your everything's fine you're the bride you're predestined everything's okay oh praise god god loves you so much everything's going to be all right well that's the truth we know that but how's it going to be all right when he beats out this this dross and this part of the world and cuts this off and shaves that off what's he trying to do he's trying to make the second part of the masterpiece which is the masterpiece bride united to the masterpiece groom amen to show what he intended to be in the garden of eden from the very beginning and in order to get that he's got a knock pieces off and knock pieces off amen yeah you know where we're here we're in the studio we're in the art studio and that chunk of marble was happy until he got in the studio and then the artist begins to talk to the marble i chose you out of every other piece of marble i chose you and the marble's like he chose me i plucked you out of the quarry i pulled you from all the other stones i set you on this pedestal and i'm going to make you into a perfect image of what i had in my mind from before the foundation of the world amen and all the sudden the marvel's hallelujah having a revival i'm chosen he's going to make me perfect and then the first hammer blow strikes bang what did you do that for the first major trial the first time he pulls the rug out from you as a new believer and you fall flat on your face amen he answered your prayer and answered your prayer and answered your prayer and all of a sudden i'm going to go through a season where i'm not going to answer any of your prayers what's he doing he's taking the chisel and he's taking the hammer and he's knocking himself away he's knocking immaturity away what's he trying to do he's trying to get the masterpiece formed and we just want to come to church and say i pulled you out of the quarry here and no we're here amen so that he can knock pieces off amen so that he can shape us into his image so he can polish us down amen what does he use to polish us down something abrasive sandpaper or or some sort of polishing compound amen and when when he gets you close he's knocked the big pieces off and you see him put the hammer down oh praise god he put the hammer down then he gets out of sandpaper constant irritation constant there's this spot there's this one spot that he just won't leave alone [Applause] oh we all got him i got more than one he goes from one to the other to the other but what's he trying to do friends he's trying to get that gold to reflect his very image and when we go to church amen and you see him take out the hammer again oh my god why because he loves you because he chose you because he pulled you out because you're more special than any other stone because he's got a plan for you from before the foundation in the world and he's not going to let you go on in imperfect condition he loves you too much you're not like all the other rocks out there you're different and because you're different you don't get away with anything [Applause] he'll harp on your entertainment he'll harp on your thought life he'll hop on the motive behind your action [Applause] [Music] amen what's it coming in your eyes what's coming in your ears what you're mulling about in your heart through the day amen he's coming down he's getting inside of you he's getting to the deepest parts because he's wanting to pluck everything out that's not like him and then he you know things are going good and now now it says now you got to get to the place where you would wish that you could be a curse from christ for somebody else to be saved it's impossible if it wasn't for the master's hands if it wasn't for his skill with the engraving tool if it wasn't for his desire for you to be a masterpiece greater than your desire to be the master you would have quit if you had the option to quit you didn't have the option to quit he comes in for more he comes in for more and all along the way he's telling you you're going to be just like me amen you're going to be perfect the whole world's going to see a display of what's been in my heart the christian life isn't an easy life it's not it's not easy it's not meant to be easy it's not always jovial it wasn't meant to be jovial the life we live especially as we near as we near that great catching away we become a whole lot more introspective a whole lot more thoughtful because when we first started this journey we were worried about getting things right because we wanted to be pleasing to the lord so i remember when i cut the cable to the cable tv it was a major victory in my life and i look at that now and i thought that was kitty stuff that was kitty stuff compared to what he's trying to get out of my life now you know i remember we threw away certain garments of clothes and we quit going to certain places and watching certain things and you know i really thought i mean i'm coming into the image of christ but the graving tool just keeps going deeper deeper deeper because he's going to root out selfishness he's going to root out self love self preservation self self self he's cutting away itself until there's no more you and it's only him and he gets down to not what you did but he gets down to the reason you did it then you get to the place where you walk away from a conversation and there's nothing wrong with the conversation but all of a sudden he starts to dig down in your heart and says you know did you really mean what you said or you just say that to make them like you better that graving until goes deeper and deeper why he wants an honest heart he wants a pure life and guess what he's going to get it because he's the one holding the engraving to him all he's asking for us to do is stay in the studio and trust him don't run away just stay put and trust him trust that he knows what he's doing trust that his hand is sufficient to shape trust that he knows how to use every tool in his bag trust him stay put trust him relax everything's going to be all right he's going to finish the work that he started he's not going to leave it off but he's going to complete what he's begun and you and i and he had in his mind what he wanted of us before we ever came to this earth before the foundation of the world and he will have it we just need to relax and let him have his way back to this quote questions and answers it says the sigh and cry for the abominations that did in the city where do you see that i can show you ten thousand speaking in tongues to one that's really burdened for sin that even that can't even pray a hour but did you know that the bible said to mark only those who signed cried for the abominations in the city how many ever read it sure that was the holy spirit come forth to mark the people and said to the destroying angel go forth and destroy everything that doesn't have the mark upon them and the mark of god is the holy ghost is a seal of god now where is them people that's that interested i can show you people that jump up and down and cry in a church i can show you people that shout and run all over the building i can show you people that prophesy and it comes to pass i can show you those who speak in tongues and run up and down the building and say things that actually interpret and it comes to pass but where is the person that size in christ for the abominations that did in the city where's that burden soul now remember when we go back to ezekiel what was the city jerusalem the church who is sighing and crying for the abominations in the church are we just happy that we have a church are we just excited we have a church or we can or we can have demonstrations or excitement enthusiasm and run up and down the aisles and jump up and down amen and have things happen are we excited about that and then who's out there that's signing and crying for the abominations that's done in the city amen who's sighing and crying amen for the worldliness that's in the bride amen for for who's sighing and crying for the fussing and fighting and the strife that's in the bride who's sighing and crying for that are we just happy we've got a church to go to and it's exciting we heard something good and we run out and that was exciting that was a good service hey we got a good church who's sighing and crying for the abominations that's done in the city there's got to be somebody that does it it's not right that things aren't right i mean that's a self-explanatory statement but when you say it you realize it hits you with impact it's not right that things aren't right said sunday you only have one choice or you have a couple choices but you you're gonna have to either recognize that the bride's got to come up higher as a whole me included yes or if i don't want to go through the work of interceding for their behalf and if i don't want to be burdened enough i don't want to be tearful and if i don't want to sigh and cry and pray then i'm going to have to say they're not bride to let myself off the hook of intercession because i want to be a lazy christian i don't want to be in that category my brother's my brother my brother's my brother if he believes the message he calls himself a brother my brother's my brother and i'm not going to call him something else but if i see something that burdening and grieving my soul i want to have something in me that will sigh in christ say god help us all help us we're not where we should be amen there's too much of the world amen i mean there's too much churchianity there's too much denomination there's too much strife and indifference there's too much separation god help us can we can we be a people that can sigh and cry for the abominations that's done in the city i'll tell you what i'll sign and cry for you if you sign and cry for me because i need somebody to stand in the gap for me he's not done with his engraving tool on me yet stan let's stand for one another friends let's go to genesis 18. genesis 18 and 16. genesis 18 elohim comes to abraham god in flesh comes to abraham and brother benham types this with his ministry three came two went down to sodom which was oral roberts and billy graham one stayed with the elected group you know the seat of abraham so he has this meeting and abraham confirms the promise and and tells him that in in this next season of life you're going to conceive you're going to have a son and he goes through all of this and then verse 16 it says and the men rose up from thence and looked towards sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him so now abraham has received the promise he's been given a promise he you know he he's met god but now god has showed up in flesh this is the type of brother branham's ministry showed up to the elect seed you know he had just changed their names he's got to give him a new identity he said i no longer call you church i call you bride he comes and he promises that you're going to receive the promised son it's time amen for for the bride to be impregnated it's coming time now all of this has happened and now as soon as that happens amen they stand up to rise the two go down to sodom and and he goes with this one amen this god in flesh is elohim and he walks with him and and god begins to reveal to abraham what he's going to do next and he says because you're special because i know you and i know you'll bring up your household right i know amen do you be true to the promise you'll be true to the word amen i know you'll be true to me because of that i can't hide from you what i'm going to do so you see yourself can you see yourself in here verse 20 and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrs is great and because their sin is very grievous i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked who's he talking to he's talking to god i mean how can you ask god a question like this he's talking to god amen god knows everything and everything god does is right but now he is he's confirmed the promise to abraham name change i've told him that you're going to fulfill the word and you're special to me and i know you amen and everything's going to work out right but this is what i'm going to do destruction is coming and then he asks the question will thou also destroy the righteous with the wiccan per adventure there be fifty righteous within the city will thou also destroy and not spare the place for fifty righteous that are therein that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and the righteous should be also the wiccan that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right who's he talking to he's talking to god and he's trying to convince god god you're you're too good your reputation's on the st on the line don't i mean come on if there's right surely you won't all the god the righteous judge of the earth will do righteously will do right right what's he doing he's in the place of intercession he is now interceding god has come in flesh god has identified him told him it's time for the bride to be impregnated tells him that destruction is coming and immediately he enters into a role of intercession and he's saying god doesn't strike him dead for asking these questions because he's portraying something in the righteous seat of abraham that we should also have he's acting the part of christ whenever god comes down in judgment amen somebody has to play the role of mercy [Music] and now god has come down in judgment to decree judgment against sodom and gomorrh and judge them for their sins somebody's got to stand in the gap somebody's got to cry for mercy and now the royal seed amen abraham amen is standing in the gap and he's having a conversation with god and say god surely you won't god you can't do this oh god how could you do that you're righteous don't you know better than this and god didn't strike him dead because that's the role he was supposed to play god was playing the role of the righteous judge he was playing the role of the interceder interceding on behalf of the lost do you see your role do you see where we're supposed to be it goes on god answers 26 and the lord said if i find in sodom 50 righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sakes now god knows exactly who's there god knows so god can give him a correct answer if i find 50 i will spare it because he knows he's not going to spare it but he's not chastising abraham for standing in the gap abraham's doing exactly what abraham should be doing at this time and what do you think the bride of jesus christ should be doing amen not saying oh god bring your fire down and bring me to a millennium but oh god can you hold it off for another day i've got a family member i've got a loved one who was abraham looking at he was looking at lot down there he was saying there's some there there's a lot down there my family's down there can they come out first lord i mean do we have enough burden for our family to say god could you hold it off one more day you realize he's not going to hold it off one more day he's got an appointed time when the wrath will strike when he lifts his bride out of here but he's wanting us to intercede for somebody else so that he can move with compassion so that he can move with mercy can we have enough of the love of god and says say god i'm willing to stay in the condition i'm in one more day if you can get my son if you can get my daughter if you can get my parents if you can get the ones who've left the church if you can get the loss that's out there if there's any more seed or anybody that can come to life amen would you get them lord i'm willing to stay longer in this horrible dark world i think that's the attitude that bryce supposed to have don't worry he'll pluck you out when the right time is to pluck you out but can we have enough heart to say i'm willing to endure satan's eden a little longer because there's people that i want to see saved there's people that i want to see with an opportunity at least to do good to the bride at least can we extend time a little longer at least to let them give a cup of cold water to somebody that they might receive a reward god because i care praise be the god that's the attitude i want to have i said god help me verse 27 and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord with him but dust and ashes. you don't come to god with pride and arrogance you don't come to god and say now you know you said i was perfect and you told me you know me that i'm going to do everything right and so i know they're bad but no he comes to god and said i spoke to you and i'm but dustin ashes per adventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous will thou destroy all the city for lack of five and he said if i find there forty and five i will not destroy him and he's spaking to him yet again and said per adventure there be forty found there and he said i will not do it for the forty sake and he said unto him oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak per adventure there shall thirty be found there and he said i will not do it if i find thirty there and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord abraham is working with god to intercede for somebody else it wasn't a quick god could you help him you know brother ted said and yeah i'm willing to stay here another day he was back and forth with god laboring i mean could it be 30 i mean how he was working in the realms of intercession and he said behold now verse 31 i've taken upon me to speak unto the lord per adventure there shall be 20 found there and he said i will not destroy it for 20 sake he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once per adventure 10 shall be found there and he said i will not destroy it for the tense sake and the lord went his way the lord cut off the conversation because he already knew in his mind what was going to happen abraham had played his role and now it was time for god to end the conversation the lord went his way and as soon as he had left communion with abraham and abraham returned into his place you realize when when haman in the book of esther when haman's plan come unfolded it was the bride amen it was the rise of the bride and the bride moving into position that that unfurled haman's plan but when the king discovered haman's plan amen he went out into the garden where did haman go for mercy amen not to the king haman threw himself down on the queen's bed amen and started asking for mercy of esther and before esther could say anything to the king the king come in and took care of business right then and because who knows what esther would have said but he come to esther not to the king because whenever there's time for judgment somebody's got to play the part of mercy but when god decrees that there's no longer time for mercy he takes matters into his own hand he doesn't ask the mercy part to do it for him god knows what he's doing and when he's going to do it he does it his way and god knows when it's time to say no more i'm shutting off the conversation you did your part you played your part and there's coming a time when the bride will have played her part she would have done what she's supposed to done she's held back the wrath until everyone amen had an opportunity that needed to have an opportunity and when that part is done amen he's going to stop the conversation and he's going to take her away because the scripture says he who now let us are holdeth back he who now let us brother ben said that's a holy ghost but where is the holy ghost it's in the bride he who now let us will let until he be taken out of the way when is he going to be taken out away the brother bam tells us at the rapture of the bride when she leaves here the holy ghost will be taken out of the way amen until that time amen we're here imploring for god to have mercy god i've got a lot down there i've got somebody over here that's on my heart i mean who do you think was on abraham's mind when he was wrestling with god he had somebody on his heart he had lot and lots family down there on his mind amen and he was imploring with god because of somebody that was dear to him can we do the same thing can we have the we're a royal seat of abraham you believe that then abraham set the example for us he's the father of our faith and this is how the father of faith acted can we act the same way let's go to acts 26 acts 26 and verse 27. paul is in chains been arrested he's went to jerusalem and a great riot broke out over him being in the temple they've taken him away to save his life over to caesarea and felix is there and agrippa comes to see felix and they have an audience with with paul and paul begins to preach to them now remember we've mentioned this before but paul is in prison there's a great trial going on they've come up and they've they they've made accusations against him he's given answers to agrippa agrippa doesn't know what to do about this and he's not sure how to handle paul because paul's a bit of a problem because if he lets him go then he's got problems with the jews and but he knows he's not guilty paul is in prison he's in chains and he's bound but whenever he has an audience with felix and agrippa and candace the queen he doesn't ask for mercy he doesn't ask to get off on good behavior he doesn't ask them to let him go or deport him to antioch or he starts preaching the gospel every time because paul cares about souls not about his own neck he's not just he's not paul is not saving his life paul is giving his life for somebody else to be saved they would they would stone paul and paul would go right back at it amen they would there'd be a great riot amen trying to shut him down and he would keep preaching i mean he could have saved himself paul could have went away into the mountains years ago and just started writing letters and having messenger boys carry out his letters amen but that's not what he was called to do that's not what was in his heart his heart was amen to get the message out to get the gospel out no matter what it cost paul personally and he's in prison amen he never employs for implores for his freedom whenever he gets a chance to talk to him he talks the message he tries to win souls and here he is verse 27 king agrippa believeth thou the prophets i know that thou believest then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuades me to be a christian he wasn't trying to get off on good behavior almost that persuades me to be a christian and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day we're both almost and all together such as i am except these bonds [Music] i wish you were a christian i wish i wish whatever was in my heart you had in your heart and i wish you were in the same condition i am except for these chains i wish you were better in a better spot than me i wish you had all the love in my heart and all the truth and revelation and you were free to roam around and he would be willing to stay there in chains to get that result [Applause] amen this is what god's calling us to friends this is a higher life to live than what we've lived before but this is the life of jesus christ let's go to second corinthians chapter 5. ii corinthians chapter 5 and verse 18 and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation to it that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us how did god beseech them first inside jesus christ right inside jesus christ let's go back to 19 to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself but hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us now he did it in jesus christ but now he's doing it by us we pray you in christ's stead [Music] we pray you i'm imploring you i'm speaking to you instead of christ in the place of christ in christ's dead now i am trying to give you the word of reconciliation god was in christ reconciling the world to himself but he's given us the word of reconciliation we're as ambassadors and god is now speaking to you by us and i implore you in christ's dead amen be ye reconciled to god what was the ministry be reconciled to god and paul recognized his position i'm standing in the place of christ god is doing it by us he's trying to reconcile you to himself that was his ministry amen let that be our ministry revelation five let's grab a couple more scriptures here revelations five revelation five and eight revelation 5 and 8. and when he had taken the book the four beasts and 4 and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth thou hast made us we're going to reign on the earth but now you've already made us kings and priests brother benham said in the church age book it says he hath made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the lord all of grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are kings spiritual kings oh we're going to be kings on the earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual kings and reign over a spiritual kingdom skip down another paragraph he says right now we reign with christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is christ in us willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in heavenly places in christ so we are seated in christ and christ is seated in us he is in us the willing and doing of his good pleasure and made us priests yes priest unto him offering the spiritual praise of sanctified lips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worship worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning priests and kings in our god no wonder the world does not appeal to us and we are peculiar people zealous unto good works we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father he is now in us he is in us willing and doing of good pleasure and he has made us priests now spiritual priests to offer praise sacrifice of praise sacrifice of our lives but also to intercede and petition so part of our priesthood now is intercession and petitioning interceding for others and petitioning the throne on behalf of others god would you forgive my brother god would you forgive my sister god would you change this circumstance god would you help us in this area we have a priesthood now we are a spiritual priest christ is in us finishing the work and we have been given a priesthood and we've been given the ability to intercede and petition let's not waste our opportunity let's not just rejoice in being a priest i'm a priest what's a priest do why are you a priest we're kings and priests but what does a priest do what's a priest supposed to do well the priest in the temple was always helping the people connect with god and always taking the person's sacrifice and helping them make a sacrifice so that they could be reconciled to god they had a ministry of reconciliation the priesthood had a ministry of reconciliation we're priests praise god i'm priests i'll put a badge i i'll put that another sash on my arm a priest i'm a king child of god but what does it mean what am i supposed to be doing as a priest what rights and privileges and responsibilities do i have i've got the right to go before the throne of god and take my brother along because i'm a priest and say god i want my brother and i to be reconciled together and i want us to be reconciled to you interceding and petitioning is part of the royal priesthood let's go to luke chapter 10 and i want to finish with this parable luke chapter 10. i was talking to brother joriah one day and he told me something brother benham said about this the story of the good samaritan and i had never known brother brenham said it when he said it it just blessed me so much and i've been chewing on it since and i went back and i looked at it and it was it was really good amen not just because dry i said it because brother branham said it angeria said it amen but in fellowship we just feed off one another amen there's 1200 sermons brother madam said so much not one of us has it all but we need one another to feed each other amen and i was feeding off brother jeriah luke chapter 10 verse 25 and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life and he said to him what is written in the law how read us thou and he answered and said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all my strength and with all my mind and thy neighbor as thyself. hey this guy got it this is what jesus when they ask jesus the greatest commandment this is the answer jesus gave and he said the second is like to it love thy neighbors thyself amen and now this is not jesus saying it amen this is one of the lawyers saying it he got it verse 28 and he said unto him thou has answered right this do and thou shalt live so what can i do to have eternal life just keep just keep the word that all the law and the prophets is based on and keep the commandments where there's no greater commandments than this just do that amen but he willing to justify himself unto jesus and who is my neighbor so he asked jesus a question who's my neighbor and jesus answer said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and he went to him and bound up his wounds and poured into oil and wine set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spend us more when i come again i will repay thee which now of these three thinketh thou was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said he that showed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do likewise which one was a neighbor the one who showed mercy who's my neighbor maybe the one who needs mercy shown to them here's what brother branham says this is very interesting in the message blind bartimaeus from 1954 but this poor blind man sitting outside of the big wicked city he's speaking of um blind bartimaeus down in jericho thinking of this wicked city as far as i know still a wicked city in the bible it's represented as the roads to hell going to jericho jericho was cursed it's a rose to hell any come yet jerusalem sets on a hill jericho sits in the valley and the good samaritan found a man coming from jerusalem down to jericho when he fell among thieves think of it he was backslidden coming from heavenly to the cursed jericho is a cursed city jerusalem is a blessed city and he was on his road backsliding when he fell among thieves and robbers that stripped him and that's when you fall among thieves and robbers when you start backsliding away from god just expect the enemy to be along the road now all of a sudden the story changes this is somebody who's falling from jerusalem into jericho they're backsliding they're going away from the things of god they're moving away amen and they fell among thieves and robbers who stripped them and beat them and left them half dead brother ram goes on to say in the lamb and the dove 1957 you know i think these meetings are when we catch the sinner you know jesus found a man one time in a parable was on his road from jericho or from jerusalem to jericho it showed he was backsliding he was going from up high going down low he was backsliding and he met him on the road and the enemy had beaten him and robbed him and left him half dead that was physically alive spiritually dead the scripture says he's half dead brother branham said physically alive but spiritually a dead when jesus christ found me amen i was somewhere between heaven and hell i was on the road down going the wrong direction amen and i'd come into a laodicean condition amen where i was stripped naked i had nothing i'd fallen among thieves who stole me of my covering robbed me of the word rodney of the joy robbed me of the life through denominational systems and i was half dead physically alive but spiritually dead amen this is the condition amen the good samaritan was jesus christ and he found all of us in this condition and he brought us out of this condition he poured in the oil and he poured in the wine and he clothed him he bound him up and he took him into the inn brother brendan says the end is the church and he gave the innkeeper money to take care of him he brought him to the church and the church was supposed to bring him up jesus christ found him but the church was supposed to bring him up he said when i return i'll repay you because there's going to be a judgment of rewards i'll repay you it says robbed him left him half dead that was physically alive and spiritually dead the priests the levites and so forth passed him but the good samaritan as jesus taught it picked him up poured oil in and whined and taken him to the end now there's the place i want to get to get to you he taken him to the end and said to the caretaker take care of him give him a couple of pennies or whatever it was to pay his way and said now if he needs any more just go ahead and take care of him i'll make it right when i come amen the samaritan was half jew half gentile or one where the middle wall of partition's been taken down either jew or gentile and jesus christ demonstrated for this but when jesus christ found me how did jesus christ come to me he came in a body of flesh and somebody brought me the word what was it it was jesus christ in his earthly body the bride amen and that's how they ministered to me and poured in the oil and poured in the wine and brought me to the church because when he when he gets to the bottom of here in verse 37 he said any and he showed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do likewise now jesus rescued you how did he rescue you amen he sent somebody along it was christ but he was using another vessel amen and he poured in the oil and wine and used his own beast to carry you to the end and there they took care of you and tell you you got strength back now you go and do likewise now he says let's go back to the parable and look at it let's go back let's go to verse 30 again and jesus answered he said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way the priest was backslidden too he was following the same path a backslidden priest can't save anybody he's moving from the heavenly from the word from truth and going down the road to hell amen that kind of priesthood couldn't do anything but it was the rejected samaritan the one that was the outcast who was pushed away that was the one who had a different kind of priesthood he was moving possibly the scripture doesn't say but possibly he was moving in a different direction we know the priest was going down the same way he couldn't help that man going that way but oh the levite come along and he was in the same condition going the wrong way but the samaritan he's the one who could help he had the oil in the wine before you can help you've got to have the oil in the wine he had the oil and wine he knew how to bind up the wounds and he knew where to take him praise god that's the role that we're supposed to be playing it's jesus christ in you and i the ministry of reconciliation he's doing it we are in christ's dead imploring people be reconciled to god amen he's working in and through the bride to finish his work to finish his work of reconciliation can we stand in that place second corinthians 1. second corinthians chapter 1 verse 3. blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort who comforteth us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god so why did god ever help you in the first place so you can help somebody else why did the samaritan rescue you and bind you up and take you to the end so that you could bind somebody else up and pour oil and wine in somebody else and take them to the end because jesus looked at that man and said go and do likewise it wasn't just for him to do it's for you and i to do it too god blessed be the god of all comfort who comforted us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of of comforted of god let's look at luke chapter six and that's the last scripture i want to look at musicians if you can make your way on up luke chapter 6. i want to finish on this luke 6 and 37. judge not and you shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give unto your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again that's just not about money you realize that that's not about money let's go back and read it and erase money from your mind it says judge not and you shall not be judged remember the last statement is the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again so now let's go back and read it judge not you shall not be judged condemn not and you shall not be condemned forgive and you shall be forgiven give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down shaken together running over shall men give unto your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again if we stand in the seat of the scornful somebody will scorn us with whatever measure we meet it will be given back this is a law of god forgive and it'll be forgiven to you judge and you'll be judged condemn me you'll be condemned give and it'll be given back to you god is teaching us a principle if i want somebody to forgive me and overlook my faults then i've got to forgive somebody and overlook their faults if i want somebody to intercede for me then i've got to intercede for them if i want somebody to stand in the gap for me i've got to stand in the gap for them because whatever measure i meet out is what i get back and if i meet out an accuser of the brethren all i'm going to get back is an accuser of the brethren if i've got a critical nature critical spirit and i'm criticizing criticizing criticizing i ought not to be too offended when i get criticized back but if i can show mercy somebody show mercy on me if i can give forgiveness somebody get forgiveness from me if i can if i can cover a sin with love somebody can cover my sin with love if i can intercede for somebody somebody can intercede for me because there's never a time that we've got to a place we no longer need something we're always going to need something amen and sometimes we don't even know what we need but this person next to us may know what it is we need yesterday amen and sometimes i see what they need and they don't even realize what it is i see a complex that they don't see i see a need in their life that they don't realize they have and why can't i just intercede for that implore god and take him before the throne because they can see something in me that i can't see let's cover for one another amen let's not expose each other's sins let's cover each other's sins let's not let's not criticize amen let's hold each other up let's not point out the bad point out to good it doesn't mean that we put truth aside truth is truth wrong is wrong amen we've got both sides we've got to be straight on the word but just as soon as we're straight away that's absolutely wrong but i don't know why my brother did that if i knew why i would probably understand so i'm going to assume that there's a reason why and i'm going to ask god to fix the wrong wrong is wrong we'll always be wrong but can we have a heart of compassion i've done wrong before not even knowing i was doing wrong [Applause] i've done wrong before knowing i was doing wrong and i still needed somebody to correct me and love me there's times i knew i was wrong and what i needed was somebody to come and tell me i was wrong but love me enough to say but i'm sticking with you anyways but i love you and i'm telling you this because i love you not because i'm mad at you i love you and i want you to know and i'm willing to pray with you and stick stick stick through this with you and i haven't already told half the church i've only told you praise the lord amen oh if we could just act like that what kind of church can we have what kind of bride can this be i mean if we just root out all the works of the devil amen and we get him out of our midst and get all this selfishness and pride and arrogancy and envy amen and strife and get it out of what kind of manifestation and power would be in the bride if you shut off the works of the devil man that's why he's given us the word so we would know how we're supposed to act and when we're falling short we know exactly how to pray god you've got to help me come to this place i want to intercede for my brother not criticize him and if i see something wrong then i should be praying the most help us lord god is good let's stand praise god how many of you believe you're getting a body change then we've got to change if we're going to get a body change we've got to change because we're not where we're supposed to be we're not we've not yet arrived friends we've got to mature we've got to grow more christ's life amen i want to be more like him day by day by day let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father i thank you lord jesus for your word and god though it cuts lord and it cuts deep but it's good lord there's some things i need cut out of me lord and there's some things that are in that need to come to expression lord i know it's in there because i know you're in me i know lord that i'm part of you but oh there's still something plugging up the channel i pray god that you would remove it lord give us a heart to intercede for one another give us a heart to stand in the gap give us a heart to love one another for love coverth a multitude of sin god help us to lift one another up not push each other down help us to get everybody into their place let us go lord the extra mile to get a brother in a better spot to get a sister into a better place lord let us lord extend ourselves give of ourselves sacrifice ourselves to see a brother in a better place i love your god forgive us lord forgive us for our failures forgive her for our complexes bring us out of this lord bring us out of this into a higher place of living to live like you we see it in your word we know it's available and we're asking you to give it to us lord to make it come to pass in our lives wash us fresh clean us out make us pure lord knock off all the rough edges that are keeping us from manifesting we give you our lives ask that you have your way with us lord in jesus name we pray amen god bless you let's sing that song flow through me
