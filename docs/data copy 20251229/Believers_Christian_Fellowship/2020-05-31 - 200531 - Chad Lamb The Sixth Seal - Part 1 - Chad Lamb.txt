[Applause] oh [Music] consider my servant consider my little righteous in all of her ways leaning believing in the sacrifice no matter what evil be tights no matter what anyone says she shall never let go of the truth i know the way that she takes her life is in my hands i know the end from the beginning and no matter what the trials no matter what comes her way she shall come forth as gold [Music] in his mind from before time even began he foresaw my whole life he knew the choices that i would make so i don't need to worry and i don't need to fret for he knows he sees and he cares he knows the way that i take my life is in his hands he knows the end from the beginning and no matter what the trials no matter what comes my way i shall come forth he told me who i am and that i belong to him so no matter what the trials he said my bride shall come forth as gold [Music] he knows the way that i take my life is in his hands he knows the and no matter what the trials no matter what comes my way i shall come forth as gold yes i shall come forth as gold and you are so praying [Laughter] [Music] to me and here i am [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] oh [Laughter] yesterday lord here i am [Music] here i am again [Music] praise the lord it's good to worship the lord man certainly good to be with you today we counted a great privilege and an honor amen we're going to ask you to be seated for just a minute i just got a couple quick announcements uh we're going to do something a little bit different at the end of service today and we're going to the the deacons will open the door at the end of service but we're going to allow you to dismiss yourself at the end of service like we did before instead of the deacons dismissing row by row we've had some time now to get accustomed to the way things work and everybody's got an understanding of the way stuff works so just be conscious when you're leaving that we don't get plugged up anywhere along the way but as we're worshiping at the end and and we're dismissed you can dismiss as you feel to go amen we felt like there was just you know too much restricted worship at the end and now everybody understands what to do we can dismiss as we'd like to dismiss so once you dismiss just be conscious of that the one thing we'd like for you to remain uh careful of is to just pass quickly through the four year out into the parking lot because the doors will be open and people will be inside worshiping and praying and we need to keep it very quiet and that's coming in and going out everybody knows how to come in we all know how to set ourselves seat ourselves now we know the arrangement we know how we need to leave but coming in we got to remember to be quiet too because the doors are open and people are inside praying before service so we must keep it really quiet so just pass quickly through the foyer to your seats leaving's the same way when we're dismissed you can leave at your discretion when you feel that you're ready to go after you worship you can stay in worship you can go however you need to go but just be conscious just just be aware as you leave so that's going to be a change also we're going to start before service unlocking the two doors down here by the east parking lot so it's easier to get in especially if it'd be a light rain or something like that you can come in that way and then you know they'll be locked during the service but they'll be unlocked before so those are a couple changes also i wanted to give a congratulations to our graduates this year this is a strange year to graduate no ceremonies so far no open houses nothing like that but but uh our high school graduates are brook lamb sam pitzenberger emily sam martin and joshua small amen let's just let's give them a round of applause and say congratulations this has been strange times some of them had virtual graduations and all kinds of different things and i know many of them maybe all four of them will have some sort of open house later in the summer as things get a little bit easier so we'll announce that as those come up and then we have three college graduates abigail mcnulty blake lamb and emily preston so i'm going to congratulate them as well so you guys all graduated during the great pandemic of 2020. you'll never forget it amen praise the lord so it was odd and it was unusual we don't want to miss the chance to say congratulations god bless you all and may he continue to bless you all also i want to give a special thank you to brother rich levy he came in friday and he took apart the overhead projectors he's been working on for a little while took him apart cleaned them and cleared up everything so we have very clear overhead projection now so god bless you brother rich and thank you very much amen it's nice to have technicians people know how to work on lab equipment amen i guess it translates to overhead projectors too so we're blessed and we thank god for that all right let's stand and we'll get right into the word amen i've got a lot of things that i want to share and i don't know how i feel like this is the this is the way it's been for me for quite some time it's always too much never too little in the the vessel that god chooses to use is very inadequate and incapable and but we have faith in his way not in our ability so i just pray that you would stay with me and pull on the gift amen let god do what he wants to do and say what he wants to say i don't even really know you know myself how things will go together there's a lot of information a lot of material a lot of things on my heart that i want to share but we're just trusting in the lord to bring out what's important amen what matters most let's look in the book of revelation together revelation chapter 1. i realized wednesday i said genesis 1 then went to revelations 1. i saw everybody laughing and turning their bibles but i thought i'm not even going to address it we'll just keep moving amen brother ben said take me for what i mean not for what i say you guys know me we know you we love one another anyhow that's real love when you love one another anyhow praise be to god revelation 1 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show into his servants things which much must shortly come to pass and he sent signified it by his angel and to his servant john who bear record of the word of god in the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand how many can say amen for the time is at hand amen more so than ever before let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for this word we thank you god for the privilege of being able to gather into this place today of being able lord to worship you in spirit and in truth we thank you god that we have bibles lord in print that we can read them in our own language and we've got a message lord and audio and we've got an in text lord and you've given us so much but go to all of that all that you've given us it won't work unless you come and make it work yourself by divine revelation we need we need you lord to come and turn the key in our heart lord to give us the revelation of the word that we might see what you're trying to share with your bride in this hour what your prophet brought what he was trying to get the bride to see open our eyes that we might see it lord give us that eye salve that we might see the word the way you see the word lord the way you want us to see it in the hour that we live i pray to take control and have preeminence on everything that's said and everything that's done bless the speaker bless to hear help us to receive your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated and we'll turn to the book of ecclesiastes together i want to preach on the sixth seal and so i just titled it the sixth seal but i just there's some things that i want to look at and try in line with what we've been looking at through the book of revelation and some of the things the prophet has shared with us and i just want to take a look at it from this angle and and just focusing just on the sixth seal if we can exodus or i'm sorry ecclesiastes one and nine ecclesiastes 1 and 9 the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun is there anything more of it may be said see this is new it has been already of old time which was before us solomon lays down a really good principle here amen this is not new amen this has been before even the spiritual battle we find ourselves in between two opposing forces the antichrist spirit and the spirit of christ it's an old battle that started way in heaven it's not new so these things that are happened have happened before and brother braham says in the message i will restore 1954 now all these things that we see happen today is nothing on the earth that is new everything has been before and if you'll notice the day that we're living in different days of cultanisms and so forth those things are not new they've always been they've been in different forms so whatever we're facing whatever we're finding it's been here before brother baby said spirits don't die amen they just continue on they just change places so whatever spirit was here amen in the book of genesis is the same spirit that's here amen in the book of revelation now he says in the message handwriting on the wall but now while we're speaking on this it come on my heart that this would be a very unusual but a timely message for the people and now any bible reader here knows that all scripture has a compound meaning every prophecy some most all of it a duel a time there or two times or more so the same scripture that that brother bam is now showing us the same scripture in prophecy can happen one time two times dual meaning two times or more he's not limiting the use of scripture because the scripture is eternal the word is eternal and all these things have been before and shall be again so he's not brother is not limiting the scripture one of the huge problems that we've done with with a human mind and denominationalism is we've limited the scripture and we've pigeonholed the scripture that this means that and we put it in this whole and we won't let that scripture mean anything else right and so and so now what brother branham was really good at doing is he was good at really messing up our denominational understanding because he'd take the same scripture and he put it in this hole in this whole and that hole over there and you're like well which one's the truth you don't have to pick which one's true amen they're all true because what he's doing is finding the same scenario playing out with the same spirits and he's grabbing the same scripture and he's applying it the same way to the same scenario in another form so the word is eternal and we we we got to get away from the idea of this is already interpreted and put in here and this is already interpreted and put in here because if you do that with the prophet of god you're going to run into some major problems because the prophet of god will use the same scripture two different ways and two different seemingly applications and then then if we have to pigeonhole it and we have to define it then we're going to have to decide which one's true and which one's not but i think that's a foolish way to look at the message for a human mind to try to determine which one well brother he said this one last and then he said this one more times because he said this more times or he said this this the last time he used this quote and he said it this way oh we're going to get in big trouble doing that just let the prophet be the prophet just let him use the word he's the one gifted to do it and let him place out the scriptures and just say how can they both be true i don't know but they're both true and if we can take that attitude and look at the scripture that way all of a sudden many things begin to unlock because we haven't locked ourselves down to a carnal understanding see we know by time space and matter we understand things i've used this analogy before but we say this is here right this is just how we live our human life this is there and now i move this from here to there now it's there and for us humans this can't be here and there at the same time is that right we're limited by time space and matter it can't be here and there at the same time but god is not limited by those laws god can be here and there at the same time because jesus christ can be the son of man that's come on earth who's now in heaven and he can talk about you and say that you're now seated in heavenly places in christ jesus but standing on the earth so you can have the same application that jesus christ did when he was on earth speaking to them and he's saying now you know this is going to blow your mind but i'm here but i'm there i'm come here but i'm there and he looks at you amen in the scriptures and says you're here but you're also there but we would say i'm either here or there or i'm here now and later i'll be there later what's later mean to god later means nothing to god everything is now to god you're here and there you're like brother ted what are you talking about i don't even know because i've lived in this dimension all of my life all of my human life amen but i've got some part of me amen that was not bound by these laws there's something down in my soul an attribute of god amen that was in god before he created the laws of the universe the natural laws and there's a part of me that's not bound by the natural laws so that i can say i am now seated in heavenly places in christ jesus and i am now standing with my feet upon the earth and there's no problem in my heart you see there's got to be we've got to free ourselves from the limitations of carnality and be spiritual minded people and so brother madam i mean he just he does like every other prophet he totally destroys your thinking thank god for the destruction and the tear down of my carnal thinking amen so we want to make sure that that we don't pigeonhole anything we look at these things coming through a revolving history a one time a dual time or more times a spiritual application in a natural application or how about this a natural application that turns to a spiritual application that goes back to a natural application is in the bible it's there but i thought once it we'll know it's just natural and spiritual so it goes natural to spiritual and it's done no sometimes it goes natural spiritual back to natural natural israel spiritual church back to natural 144 000 israel and the prophecy moves right along boom boom seed of abraham praise be to god amen i love the word now i'm gonna look at a quote of the seventh seal brother bram says now the eighth chapter only reveals the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed now nothing is not revealed in the seventh seal i say that quote and i smiled every time i love it nothing is not revealed on the seventh seal that means there's something revealed it's just not told nothing is not revealed in the seventh seal now has nothing to do with the seventh chapter of revelation it's the revealing of the seventh seal is perfectly mute and if it only had time i'll try a few places to show you all the way back from genesis this seventh chapter this seventh seal is spoke of so now this is the seventh seal brother branham said the settlement seal was totally mute nothing's not revealed in the seventh seal it's totally mute nothing's even spoke of it and now he tells you all the way back in genesis the seventh seal spoke of praise be to god just not in the way we were looking for the revelation of the seventh seal but it's laying there amen because the seventh seal is christ it is jesus christ it's the revelation of jesus christ it's the coming of christ it's however where you want a word it's the opening of the word which is christ it's christ amen and all the way back when god first speaks his word he takes his thought and turns it into spoken word and then when he speaks now that becomes the anointed word and the anointed word is christ it is the seventh seal it is christ the mystery of god revealed so where do you have it all the way back in genesis in the beginning there you go all the way through now he says now to show you all the way back from genesis this seventh chapter the seventh seal spoke of from the very beginning in genesis these seals move right up now he's not just talking the seventh seal he's talking all the seals all the way back from genesis these seals move right up why because when he comes to the revelation of the seventh seal it's the revelation that tied together the whole bible when those seals were loosed it loosed the whole bible they said this bible was wrapped with these seven seals so these seven seals loosed loses the whole bible and now you can go back and see those seals coming up all the way back from the book of genesis but if we're now limited limiting ourselves in the scriptures by time space and manner now we say no that the first seal means this it's it's this it's the first church age it's when the nicolaitan spirit began and it means that and nothing more are you kidding do you think that the white horse wasn't writing in genesis do you think deception didn't come looking in a religious form when cain was brilliant cain was hey cain was coming under the first seal amen under a religious deception nimrod was coming amen in the first seal under a religious deception amen no no it only means this because it was revealed at the end time and in late means this brother bannon says those seals unlocked the whole bible and they've been coming up from genesis that you can see the white horse rider has been writing since there were men upon the earth amen there was a serpent that came in amen that was looked like human but wasn't human so close but not the same thing and he brought a deception by the word amen praise be to god the seals are coming right up so once once we're once we're allowed to believe that the bible gets so much more fun to read because the seals unlock the bible let's go to the sixth seal revelation chapter six together revelation chapter 6 verse 12. and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and low there was a great earthquake and the sun became black a sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth even as a fig tree casteth their untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand praise god brother bam says in the sixth seal he says this paragraph 144 he says we know that the sixth seal is the judgment seal so now he's bringing it right down to the sixth seal is the judgment seal it's the mystery in the sixth seal that it's a judgment seal and the number of man is six and man is fallen and therefore must be judged right so the sixth seal is the judgment seal is the judgment meal exactly what it is now notice for the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word that just opened up a lot it's not just a judgment seal the end time but it's the judgment seal of the word and all the way through it's the judgment seal further and further down in the sixth seal message he says he's fixing to take the 144 000 out for redemption out of the book of redemption and that's under the seal of redemption in the sixth seal so now brother baum gives two labels to the sixth seal the sixth seal is the seal of judgment and the sixth seal is the seal of redemption praise be to god because that's where he work does his redemption work is through the six seals and the seventh seal reveals the one who's been doing the redemption work so through the sixth seal his redemption so the sixth seal is the seal of redemption the sixth seal but it's also the seal of judgment let's go to genesis chapter seven genesis chapter 7 and let's look at the very first destruction after the genesis 1 account genesis chapter 7 verse 5. now we know that god comes down and decides that he's got to judge the earth because violence filled the earth man did that which was evil continually and all the desires of his heart he did and god's going to pass a judgment amen but at the time of judgment there's somebody that finds grace in the eyes of the lord and that's noah because noah is the elect seed so now he comes to noah and and it says in verse 5 and noah did according to all that the lord commanded him and noah was 600 years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth six you catch the 600 you find this laying all through the bible the number six is associated with man it's also associated with judgment it also has something to do with redemption because in this flood is coming at the 600th year of noah and at the 600 year of noah you're going to see the earth go into the sixth seal because part of the sixth seal is the destruction of the earth right so as part of the destruction of the earth amen it's it's a purging seal it's a judgment seal it's a purging seal and a destroying seal amen because the 144 thousand are purged under the sixth seal and the foolish virgin are purged under the sixth seal so that means when you come in contact with judgment of god there's two outcomes right when you come in contact with the judgment seal you have two outcomes you're either purged or you're destroyed there's nothing in between and i say god let that sixth seal when i come in contact with it let it purge me god let me be purged when i come in contact with that sixth seal and i recognize i'm wrong amen may i find grace in your eyes and be purged not destroyed so now under the judgment seal and noah's 600 year there's going to be a judgment of flood that's going to destroy the earth and destroy the inhabitants of the earth but it's also a seal of redemption because there's going to be eight souls that are going to be redeemed off the earth through the ark so at the same time judgment striking there's also redemption taking place this earth is going to be judged the world is judged there's a judgment coming because of the fall of humanity because what happened in the garden of eden there's been a judgment cycle coming but through the judgment there's there's those that find grace in the eyes of the lord and they're purged through the judgment seal and they come out purged and they come out redeemed and that's the position that i want to hold brother bam says in the sixth seal so now remember we've seen jesus saw it that's right jesus saw it and now we find others saw it we find it typed out in jacob he's referring to the sixth seal we find it typed out in jacob we find it typed in egypt we see it typed out at the cross so now brother i'm showing you there's a sixth seal type in jacob there's a six seal type in egypt and there's a sixth seal type at the cross and so this these seals have been coming right up do you believe that these seals have been coming right up we see the six seal and jacob under jacob's trouble amen when he starts to have tension we talked about this before he comes under tension with laban's sons because he's got a money-making scheme because he's a shyster brother said he's a money grabber i didn't say it brother branham said it he said the jews always been that way and i i'm not saying that brother bram said he's a shyster he's a money grabber amen he'll get it anyway and cheat you any way to get it and here comes jacob to scheister he cheated for the birthright he cheated for the blessing right he cheated for the birthright cheated for the blessing and now he was cheating for the cattle for his wages amen and he was increasing his wages through deception and through trickery and now all the brothers of laban get upset with him and now he's under pressure amen and now he decides to go back home and as he's going back home he's got to encounter esau and he saws another one who's who's fell victim to his tricks his tricks and he knows that esau is going to judge him and he's deserving of being judged and it puts him in desperation and when he gets in desperation he crosses the river and goes by himself to the other side amen because this is the key to the sixth seal amen to get you by yourself in desperation so that you can come face to face with god and jacob wrestles with a man through the night and the wrestling with that man under his sixth seal of desperation puts him in contact with god and god will touch him through that period and it will change his walk from that day forward he'll halt upon his leg he'll never walk the same way again that's the sixth seal experience that we want to have and then he recognizes now that i've met god face to face who's god the seventh seal so these seals have been coming right up so now he says he typed it in egypt down in egypt when moses goes as a prophet to deliver out of egypt the people are once again in tribulation and they're in trouble they rose up a pharaoh who knew not joseph and he begins to bring he begins to become a cruel task master amen and begins to punish the jews severely amen and and moses shows up as a delivering prophet but as a delivering prophet in the time of trouble he brings plagues down upon the gentiles which is the same thing the two prophets are going to do moses and elijah through the tribulation period they're going to bring plagues down upon the gentiles what brother bam said so he typed it all the way back in egypt and they come out of egypt under the sixth seal and then he says then he we see it typed out at the cross and i want to look at that one for a minute together let's go to the book of mark mark chapter 15. so brother i'm still talking about the sixth seal typed out at the cross it's amazing i told you before but i'll repeat it here again that jesus passes through the sixth seal and you say but he never did anything wrong he was virgin born he never sinned but the sixth seal is a judgment seal but also has a redemption seal and when jesus is going to pass through the sixth seal he's going to redeem through the sixth seal and by the purchase of his blood he's gonna redeem back all the lost children of god so it's a judgment seal and a redemption seal so mark 15 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets nope sorry i'm in matthew mark sorry i started turning then i started talking and i quit turning all right mark 15 and verse 24 and when they had crucified him they parted his garments casting lots upon them what every man should take and it was the third hour and they crucified him and the subscription of his accusation was written over the king of the jew written over the king of the jews and and with him they crucified two thieves the one on his right hand and the other one is left so when we come to the crucifixion and then jesus is is nailed to the cross at the third hour of the day now the day starts at 6 a.m so the third hour of the day would be 9 a.m so at 9 00 a.m they begin to crucify him and and then let's pick it up here in verse 15 or chapter 15 verse 33 and when the sixth hour of the day come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eloise lama i think which is being interpreted my god my god why hast thou forsaken me so now he's totally forsaken by god because upon him was put the whole sin of the world amen and god had to depart from him so that he could judge him because going through the sixth seal the judgment seal would bring redemption to all the seed amen because it wasn't jesus that had needed to go through the sixth seal it was me that needed to go through the sixth seal and it was every one that would be born wrong amen through a sexual birth amen they would need to go through the sixth seal so he came as a perfect lamb and in him inside of him within him he was the fullness of the word amen and if you're a sieging of god with the attribute of god you are part of that word amen so if he was the fullness of the word and i am part of the word when you collect the fullness then i'm there i was there amen so that means i also amen was in the sixth seal with jesus christ that's why that's why god cannot let this bride go through the tribulation period because she's already paid for her sins when did she pay for her sins when she was with him when he was reckoned we were reconciled with him in the body of his flesh remember we were reconciled we've already been reconciled to god when were we reconciled we were reconciled in the body of his flesh because the word was made flesh and i'm part of the word amen if you're part of god you're part of the word if you have a c gene of god that's word amen where is the word laying down in your soul that's the word and if he was the fullness of the word you were there and the word bled for you and the word died for you and you already suffered your punishment there so he goes through the sixth seal for the elect seed is redemption for those who reject it it's going to bring destruction but but you see brother franco can you turn on my whiteboard i want to draw a picture i like this i told somebody i said i don't know if it does anything for the congregation but it sure helps me because when i sit and talk to people and say i would prefer to do all of this across a dining room table and then i pull out a paper i'll grab a napkin and i start drawing pictures and scribbling i turn it around by the time we're done with the discussion nobody can discern anything on the napkin but it helped me through the whole discussion but jesus comes to calvary and he's nailed to the cross at the third hour of the day and then at the sixth hour darkness falls what happens when the six seals open darkness falls what happened in egypt under the sixth seal darkness over all the land darkness the the sun turned to darkness the moon turned to blood amen which is an eclipse amen and sun turned to darkness darkness moon turned to blood and an earthquake all happens when jesus dies because jesus dies amen under the sixth seal i hope you understand me enough to understand what i'm saying until the ninth hour of the day the night that this is 9 00 am this is noon and this is 3 pm if you look at the period of time he was on the cross he was on the cross for six hours why it's the sixth seal it's the judgment of man it was a man who could stand in the place for all of mankind amen when somebody had to come and take the book in revelation chapter four it couldn't be an angel a seraphim it could be it had to be a man amen and six is the number of man and six is the number of judgment and here jesus christ comes he's on the cross for six hours and in the sixth hour of the day it turns to darkness so that we will see that this is the sixth seal three p.m 3 p.m is an important time because this is the afternoon amen before passover and the passover the jewish day is not like our day we go midnight to midnight right but the jewish day goes sundown to sundown right so your day starts when the sun sets so passover was going to begin at the sunset on the day jesus christ was crucified that's why they come to the pilot and they asked pilate amen could you hurry this thing along and get these bodies down before sunset before passover because it was a holy sabbath unto them and they had to get them down that's why they went and broke the legs of the other two amen because when you're nailed to the cross amen you slump down you're you're nailed to the cross you slump down and it cuts off your air passage you can't breathe and as you get weaker you keep you keep whatever called exficiating or whatever that's called you can't breathe for us common folks and so they would push against the nail between their legs and rub their back up against the cross to get a breath and fall back down and they would keep themselves alive amen and this was the whole point of crucifixion it was supposed to be a horrible death and it was a horrible horrible way to die and so they would keep pushing up so now they've got to get these bodies off of the cross before sunset so they go and they break the legs of the other two so they can no longer push themselves up and they suffocate to death and die but when they came to jesus they found him already dead because the scripture says not one bone will be broken everything is orchestrated by the scriptures and so now that there was in the temple worship tradition the lambs were killed before evening and during during the the before the evening time before the sun sets before the passover starts they would kill the lambs so in temple worship on the day before passover before passover starts at sunset just before that they would slay all the lambs for passover and guess what time they would slay the lamb for passover they would slay the lamb at 3 pm and so at 3 pm jesus gives up the ghost and he dies because he is the ultimate passover lamb he is the final passover lamb where the head of the household god himself took his lamb and offered his lamb for his whole household for a deliverance and he showed that this is my sixth seal my requirement is now met through the sixth seal and it's going to bring redemption to the seed but there's been judgment upon this vessel and he is the passover lamb and he dies at 3 p.m and the same time jesus is crying out and giving up the ghost the priests are slitting the throat of a paschal lamb at the same time remember how brother branham said they're in the temple singing the psalm and they could look out the window and see him and the one that they're speaking of is nailed to the cross well it gets worse than that because the very the very thing that moses told them to do was showing that this one would come and they so rejected him they wanted to keep their traditional form of worship and while he's becoming the passover lamb they're slaying their own passover lamb because they would rather have the tradition than have what god sent and that's been the problem all along and it's the problem in the message it's the same way we'd rather have the tradition than have what god sends we'd rather stick with what we've always stuck with amen because this looks too radical jesus looked radical the things he said the scriptures he used amen the things that happened all around him the crowd that he attracted it was completely radical and it couldn't be because they had got it in such a way with their own denominational mindset they got it in such a way in such a form of thinking amen that they they couldn't they couldn't allow it wasn't supposed to be this way it wasn't supposed to this wasn't the way it was supposed to look like and you know it was supposed to be different and we were supposed to be included us pharisees and high priests and and you know what and they had the opportunity to be included but they didn't want to be included because they love the praise of men more than they love the praise of god but now they god sends a perfect lamb a man virgin born they deny his virgin birth virgin born lamb of god and fulfills the scripture to the letter but because he fulfills it in a way they didn't expect see this is what brother branham did and this is the way that he was so rejected at the end of his ministry because they didn't expect the fulfillment of the scriptures to be that little humble man from kentucky with the seventh grade education and the little bitty old church building at the corner of eighth and penn street they didn't expect that that was going to be the manger where the lamb was born amen and that's why he was so rejected amen he was he was showing plainly amen that this is the ministry of malachi 4 this is luke 17 30. this is the fulfillment of scriptures amen and they couldn't accept that because it wasn't it wasn't in concordance with the idea that we already had and i say god break that thing out of me thoroughly and i say it again and again because no matter how much we think it's broke it ain't broke yet friends we still have a tendency to go back to carnal understanding and carnal thinking and old denominational teaching and here they are the very hour he's giving up the ghost they're slitting the throat for another lamb and now it's pointless before it was right it was the thing to do at 3 p.m on the eve before passover slay the lamb keep the word keep moving forward amen you know what they were supposed to be place holders on the word to keep the symbolism of the word moving forward till a prophet could come and tell them what it all means that's what's happened to the church ages keeping the word see this much holy see this much holding there's nothing wrong with holding it that's what they were supposed to do the jews were the oracles of god they were supposed to hold amen what had been given to them from moses and hold it until a prophet could come and say this is that this is that this is that but they got so much in love with holding amen the symbolism and when the reality came they wanted the symbolism and not the reality praise be to god say god help me i want your reality help me to drop the symbol every day for the real amen that's what i want so jesus died 3 pm 6 hours on the cross and it turned dark at the sixth hour of the day these things are more than coincidence they're beautiful the word is beautiful brother benham says on the sixth seal again it's in matthew 27 let's see what he did there here matthew the 27th chapter now remember his son had been beaten and had been troubled and they had made fun of him and he was now hanging on the cross at three o'clock on good friday afternoon just about to take place matthew 27th chapter 45th verse i believe it is from the sixth hour there was darkness over the land until the ninth hour what's brother branham preaching he's preaching the sixth seal he's putting this in the sixth seal because he says it was typed out at the cross now notice just exactly what he did back here on this see and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal low there was a great earthquake and the sun became black a sackcloth of hair and the moon and the moon became his blood blackness darkness egypt blackness darkness he see what brother brahm's doing can we see what he's doing brother ben is now preaching the sixth seal he's going to calvary he's showing at the six-hour darkness sets in and he says darkness blackness see egypt he's going he's going right for brother branham it's all the same thing he's not going well this was scriptures for egypt and this is scriptures for jesus crucifixion and now there'll be scriptures for the tribulation period he's not doing that in this sixth seal he's showing you now he's showing it to you in matthew 27 at calvary now at the six hour of the day it turns darkness see darkness blackness see egypt because brother branham sees the seals through the whole bible the mystery of redemption has unlocked the entire bible and you can lay that pattern of redemption over the bible here and here and here and here and it works all through so so the sixth deal has been in effect all along praise be to god that might stumble somebody but it's the truth from the sixth hour that there was darkness blackness darkness egypt darkness darkness god delivering jesus at the cross just before he brought him up from the resurrection first darkness sun went down the middle of the day stars wouldn't shine two days from then he was going to raise him up with a mighty triumph and after the sun and moon and stars and everything in egypt all feasts take place he delivered israel to the promised land he's running back and forth between these two parallels so much he's jumping to where you're like what do you mean he comes up in the resurrection and he took egypt to the promised land what is coming up in the resurrection having to do with bringing egypt to the promised land it's the same story in another form it's the same seal in another form it's the same redemption in another form and brother ben has no problem jumping back and forth from egypt to the cross to egypt praise be to god that's the way i want to see the word where it all links together telling one story one story the bible's not telling 66 stories the bible's telling one story one goal one thing god wanted to achieve in all the scriptures and he did it in a three-fold purpose what's that the one thing he wanted to do the one objective he's had the mystery that's been in the back part of his mind and he wanted to achieve and the whole bible's been telling of it and what's that mystery get preeminence in a man he did that in christ jesus preeminence and and a people he's doing that now in the bride to restore them back to eden that's been the whole purpose of the seals the whole purpose of the bible the whole purpose of everything is that one purpose and when our revelation of the word can't match that one purpose we need to throw away our revelation of the word until it can match that one purpose let's look at this in matthew 27 let's turn there together the scripture that brother brahm's referring to matthew 27 and we'll go to 45. trying to hold myself back and go slow because i tend to just go too fast and we miss all the scriptures and the meats in the scriptures and i don't want to buzz over it i just want to really look at it matthew 27 and 45 now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice that was to say my god my god why has thou forsaken me some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man calleth for elias and straightway one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on the reed and gave him the drink and the rest said let it be and see where their lives will come and save him jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was written twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks ran and the graves were open and many bodies of the saints would slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now when the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of god so now you look at a sequence of events under the sixth seal and under the sixth seal oh praise god under the sixth seal jesus he gives up the ghost amen judgment is now completed and and there's darkness right darkness and and the moon became blood became dark and there was an earthquake now there's one more thing that's interesting to note when you get over to acts chapter 2 when when peter begins preaching to the jews on the inaugural day of the church he refers them to joel's prophecy and when he refers to joel's prophecy he says the sun will be dark and the moon turned to blood though he says in and if you look i've went and looked at it if you look on nasa's lunar chart and you type in that date april 3rd ad33 you find out that there was there was a full moon that day in egypt that was viewed from jerusalem and there was a lunar eclipse that day and if you look at the it was a partial eclipse it wasn't a total eclipse it wasn't a total blackout but if you go back and you run the charts if you watch the way that the moon rises that night you know 3 pm jesus dies time of the sacrifice of the passover lambs they take his body down and they get him buried they got to have the body off the cross before sunset right from the third hour of the day to the ninth hour from noon to three pm there was blackness that covered everything then when the sun sets after the sun sets the moon begins to rise over jerusalem and as the moon begins to rise it's in a partial eclipse and the part that's coming over the horizon is a blood moon on the day he dies why because this is the sixth seal turned to darkness sun turned to darkness moon turned to blood and an earthquake and when he gives up the ghost there's an earthquake amen and when there's an earthquake the temple veil rinse in two and they can see the holy of holies and they can recognize now that there is no shekinah glory here anymore it's done it's a transition time so so now the the you have an earthquake you have the sun turning black and you have the moon turning to blood all part of joel's prophecy and all part of the sixth seal showing the sixth seal was in effect right there at calvary i love these things i absolutely love it amen because it just continues it keeps going and going and going the scripture just keeps tying together now let's go to matthew 28. verse 1 now in the end of the sabbath as it began to to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulcher and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it so there was another earthquake the earth the first earthquake when there was this first earthquake the temple veil was rent right and it exposed the mercy seat and now so what it what did the with the earthquake do it rent the temple veil it broke the seal because the holy of holies was sealed by this veil it was the 28 cubic curtain that hid the holy of holies from everybody else in the holy place and they couldn't see it so there was a seal there was a seal that had to be broke and under the sixth seal there was an earthquake that broke the seal and then three days later there's an earthquake that breaks another seal and brother bam said it broke the roman seal and then you had the mystery of the resurrection now christ comes forth what is it it's the coming of the lord he came back he came out of the grave amen under the seventh seal so now i want to i want to keep i went through all of this to show the sequence of the sixth seal but i want to now take a turn and look at matthew 24 because we're still in the sixth seal message brother brahm talks about all this in the six seal message when you when you study the sixth seal it's important to recognize too uh some things brother ben is preaching on the sixth seal he picks it up in questions and answers the next service the next morning and again in the seventh seal so if you want to read it all it's in the sixth seal it's in questions and answers on the seals and it's in the seventh seal but i want to look at matthew 24 now when we get to matthew 24 verse 1 it says then jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the building of the temple and jesus said unto them see not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him and privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and in the end of the world so brother bam is very clear and he says they asked three questions this is not all lumped together in one thing when will these these be when will not one stone on the temple be left on another what will be the sign of your coming and the end of the world so jesus is going to answer three different questions and if you don't recognize that and lump it all together that's why we'll have people teaching post-millennialism and all these other things because they see something in the scripture what they see is true and it is genuine and it exactly matches the word amen but they didn't realize he's answering three questions not one so when will the temple be torn down what will be the sign of that coming end of the end of the world so he goes from there and brother bam takes us right down through the uh the seals the first five seals and then we get then we get over here and he's gonna get to the sixth seal and he picks up the sixth seal over in verse 29. over in 29 he picks up the sixth seal and he says immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the star shall fall from heaven and the powers of heaven shall be shaken so when when the prophet of god comes through matthew 24 he shows the seals now he comes to the sixth seal and he goes to verse 29 and he says immediately after the tribulation of those days now the question is what tribulation of what days and he answers the question he says in the sixth seal he said we look at that and there's nothing in the world i don't believe but that bunch of jews has went through a pre-tribulation period when during the time of this last wars they they're they're got to be hated by everybody and eichmann killed millions of them in germany you just heard the trial millions of innocent people slain jews just because they were jews no other reason so he says what is this tribulation he calls it a pre-tribulation or an amateur tribulation but he ties it to the tribulation of those days he ties it to verse 29 and it's important to know where he ties it and where he places it amen because it makes everything else matter so it's really important to understand that let's turn hold your place in matthew 24 go to revelation with me revelation 9. revelation chapter 9 and verse 13. i know this is slow it's a slow this is slower than i like to go but i want to stay i want to i want to take our time here for just a few minutes and the sixth angel sounded this is the trumpets and the six angels sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altars which is before god saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for the slay the third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them and thus i saw the horses in the vision them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and adjacent and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths that should fire smoke and brimstone by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire by the smoke by the brimstone which issued out of their mounds now brother bam comes to this and he says those were not natural chargers he says they were demonic spirits they were demon powers that were released and he said where did they go they went into the armies of hitler mussolini and stalin to bring a bitter persecution against the jews so we know he says the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet open at the same time is that right and then in matthew 24 when he goes to the sixth seal he goes to verse 29 which says in the tribulation of those after the tribulation of those days and he ties that scripture back to the persecution of the jews at world war ii so we know where we're at right and he says they were they were not natural they're supernatural powers and in verse 18 by these three was the third part of men killed now brother bam tells us exactly where those demon powers go they go into a bitter persecution against the jews and it says a third part of the men were killed amen because during the holocaust pre-holocaust numbers of jews worldwide was 18 million but they killed six million jews during the holocaust one-third of all the jews and brother venom they already told us that that that is the persecution against the jews when they come out and bring a persecution against the jews and it says in the scriptures a third of the men die and and you can read it in the news you can read it in the history one third of the population of jews worldwide is wiped out and still has not recovered to that number yet so brother brahm is is he's placing us placing us right in the scriptures so that we won't miss it he further on in the sixth seal he says now the sixth seal is the one we're coming to matthew 24 29. and 30 24 let's get 29 and 30. here we are now now we're going to get also revelation 6 12 and 17. he's going to put those two together the sixth seal and revel in matthew 24 29 and he starts to read now listen to this now it's what jesus said in matthew 29 24 or 24 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days when this tribulation this amateur tribulation they've went through there the sun shall be darkened the moon shall not give her life and the star shall fall from heaven and the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven then shall be all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in clouds of heaven with power and great glory then again he says in the sixth seal a little further on it says now perfect turn right back over see what jesus said here now matthew 24 29 after this eichmann case eichmann was the one that was in charge of the of the holocaust he was the mastermind behind it that had all the jews killed so brother man when he says to see this eichmann case he's specifically placing amen this fulfillment of scripture right in for him which was very recent history just 20 years before the holocaust amen was going on from 1941 to 1945 amen and so here brother branham is coming in 1963 and he's pointing right back and saying that was it that was this tribulation that was the tribulation of those days that's it right there and that's the fulfillment amen that is a fulfillment of the sixth trumpet he said this tribulation this amateur tribulation they went through here the sun shall be darkened the moon shall not give her light now he says matthew 24 29 this eichmann case and so forth he reads it again and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and they shall see then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and glory and send forth his angels and so forth with the sound of a trumpet and shall gather them the four winds drove together see just exactly comparing what jesus said in matthew 24 and what the revelator here opened up in the sixth seal is just exactly and jesus was speaking of the tribulation period he's speaking of a tribulation period and there's coming a tribulation period but he in brother baum is speaking of the pre-tribulation or the amateur tribulation or the tribulation of those days amen which took place during world war ii there's a reason i'm saying this so hang with me we're going to get to it in the seventh seal message he says this time was between the sixth and seventh seal that he calls these people spoken of by jesus in matthew the 24th chapter the 31st verse so let's keep reading let's go to matthew 24 and go back to 29. immediately after the tribulation of those days when the eichmann group world war ii sixth trumpet sixth seal uh two hundred thousand thousand demons we got that we're on the same page immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be dark and the moon shall not give her life and the star shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken when brother man reads that he knows he's dealing with the sixth seal because it's the same thing and that's why he knew the cross was dealing with the sixth seal and that's why he knew egypt was dealing with the sixth seal verse 30 and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together as elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other so now let's go back to the quote he says now matthew 24 31 that send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet gather the elect from the four winds from one and of heaven to the other he said verse he said matthew 24 and the 31st verse that we've just read trumpets here are the two witnesses when the trumpet sounds it's the trumpet of the two witnesses of the age of grace for the jews one trumpet sound who knows one trumpet sounds he says and sound the trumpet notice over 31st and he shall send forth his angels he puts in parentheses not one see two of them it's plural two of them with a great sound of a trumpet what trumpet the great gospel trumpet the seventh seal with the great sound of a trumpet what is it when god gets ready to speak there's a sound of a trumpet that always his voice calling to battle god speaks these angels will come forth with the sounding of the trumpet so now i want to slow down just a minute i'm going slow but i want to back up and go slower i don't want to lose anybody because brother branham makes it so easy by putting these markers in these indicators and he's tying the sixth seal together with the sixth trumpet with matthew 24 which is the sixth seal and the tribulation of those days and he's tying and he's linking all of these things together amen and he's not doing it just for a history lesson although we love the history lesson he's doing it so we can see something because when he gets to verse 31 he says his sent forth his angels amen with the sound of a trumpet amen and brother man said a great trumpet amen one sound a great trumpet and brother benham says when those seven seals open there was one blast then all seven thunders uttered what was it he said it was the revelation of the seals it was the revelation of the seventh seal because the sounding fourth of those thunders consecutively in a row is the marking of the seventh seal and so now brother branham said when brother branham preached the seals amen he come he preached the entire revelation of jesus christ is that the complete revelation did brother branham leave out anything do we need another messenger to give us more on the revelation or did he complete the revelation so the revelation is completed christ is the mystery of god revealed amen and under the sounding of the seventh angel the mystery of god should be finished amen so brother branham tied together all the loose ends and after all the loose ends were tied together down comes an angel with an open book in his hand seven thunders under their voice amen it's the seventh seal and so now brother branham preaches christ the seventh seal christ the mystery of god revealed amen by taking the seals off the book and showing christ through the whole bible and then he says and christ is the mystery god revealed if you can't see christ in every line in every story he said go back and read it again because you missed something so now he takes the veil off and shows it's been christ in christ amen is the anointed word he said it was christ and moses it was christ in noah it was christ and david what is that christ the mystery of god revealed the mystery coming through the whole bible so now you have to say when that when it was time for the seven thunders utter there was one blast and brother branham said a blast that shook the whole earth because in the religious world that blast has shook the whole earth it was a blast that shook the whole earth and then the seven angels appeared amen then he got the revelation of the seven thunders and one blast seven thunders and so that was the great trumpet the great completing of the gospel the great wrap of the gospel that great trumpet sound of the great seventh gospel trumpet sounded right and brother man brought the revelation of the whole thing what would happen to the jews what happened to the uh the foolish virgin he brought the whole revelation who the elect are all of it so then when these two witnesses when they go to sound forth what message are they going to sound what will they preach do they have a different revelation of christ is there more is there something brother benham didn't cover we know that they're going to give the interpretation of what the actual trumpets were that brought them back am in the inn gathering but brother said that's for them that's for the jews but when they come to be introduced to christ the true sacrifice the living word amen where where did that message come from brother bam said they're gonna they're gonna receive the same message i don't know how it'll come i don't know how to get it i don't know if they used brother bennett's books i have no idea but the same revelation of jesus christ the same message the same revelation of the seals is what the 144 thousand what was that that was a great trumpet that was the blast that was the wrap-up that was the seventh seal that was the one coming who could unlock the mystery of the whole bible and now what are they going to do under that great trumpet they're going to reconnect the jews with their messiah and they're going to recognize come to the feast of atonement and recognize this has been him all along and they're going to take him from the sacrifice of goats and and and geese and whatever brother branham says there and they're going to connect them to the real living sacrifice the word so they can't preach anything else because brother branham already preached it so that great trumpet amen is the seventh seal the mystery of christ revealed so we know verse 31 we know who they are we know who they preach to and we know what they preach i don't need to be here to hear it i've already heard it have you been connected to the real atonement the bleeding bloody word amen so now i want to read through this again we know verse 29 verse 29 is the tribulation the pre-tribulation or amateur tribulation of the jews the eichmann case through the war verse 31 is the two witnesses to the jews so what's verse 30 let's start at 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her life and the star shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the son the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory i want to ask you a question have you seen the sign of the son of man coming have you seen that cloud amen have you seen it it's shrouded by seven angels where did you hear brother branham say that they told me to turn it to the right he says i'm looking at it right no turn it to the right oh what is it it's christ he said what is it it's our lord up there it's the sign of the coming of the son of man so in between amen the pre-tribulation period aiming to the jews and the witness of the two prophets this has to happen verse 30 and praise god it's happened amen we've seen it we are standing between verse 30 and 31 we know where we are in the scriptures we know who we are we know what our ministry is we're standing between verse 30 and 31 and matthew 24. i hope you're standing there i hope you're standing amen amen oh praise god i hope you're standing in revelations 10 8-11 prophesy again i hope you can go past that into revelations 11 because in revelations 11 john is given a read now and john is going to measure the temple and the altar and the true worship and the gentile court that's given outside because something's been given to john he's been giving a measuring tool that he can measure by and now john which is a type of the bride can take the measuring tool of the open book and can describe amen to true worship the true place of worship the true altar of worship and who's on the outside where are we at friends amen at the end of the end of the end for the gentiles we've come to the very end can you find your scriptures can you find your place in the bible do you know where you're at or do we just have to sit down and say well you know i know the message is true and it'll all be solved out later brother branham already solved it out we just got to take what he says and say if he says it's the eichmann case it's the eichmann case if he says it's the two witnesses it's the two witnesses because brother branham will tell you amen what's happened before and he'll tell you what's happened after but he's told to be mute on what's happening now because he's not allowed to tell the third pull it'll be a total secret so he can show you verse 29 and he can show you verse 31 but the bride's got to catch the mystery in verse 30. he'll show you the second pool he'll show you what the second pool is he'll tell you what's coming next to the two witnesses but he won't tell you what the third pool is when it comes time to tell the third pool he starts telling stories because he can't tell it he can tell you what the first pull was he can tell you what the second pool was and then when he gets done with that he says now and the seven city says now i feel to stop right here but he says remember that vision i had about seven years ago of that big tent in the little room and remember the pool and remember remember the baby shoe remember the sword in the hand he said now that tent that 10 when i saw that 10 and those going in one by one in that little room and they're coming out changed amen and the pillar of fire was down in there he said that what says that will be your third pool that will be your third pool and you'll tell it to no one. then he's on in sabino canyon he lifts up his hands the sword hits his hand somewhere early in 1963 and he's nervous he looks at that and the voice says that's the same the sword of the king he says oh a king so he said not a king's sword the king's sword and he says he knew it was the word coming into his hand because he's a prophet he's got to give out the word amen because brother brenham told us that mighty angel come down with a little bo tore off the seals amen sent it down to the seventh angel that's on earth and he turns around and gives it to the people which is the word in the hand so the word come to the prophet's hand but the word coming to the prophet's hand wasn't to stay in the prophet's hand but he was to give it to the people and he says now when he's holding the sword the voice says this is your third pool that will be seven years ago but at the end of a seven year cycle now we've come to completion that will be this is and it'll be a total mystery where's the mystery between matthew 24 29 and 31 he'll come to the sixth seal and he'll explain under the sixth seal when the sixth seal and the sixth trump would open the same time persecution brought broke out on the jews so now you know you're under the sixth seal and he'll tell you where that's at then he'll tell you also under the sixth seal it's two witnesses through the tribulation period that'll bring plagues down on gentiles is that right but he's not going to tell you what happens in between because that's the mystery for the bride to catch oh i love the word so much i'm just gonna drop something in here just for fun brother branham takes the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet it says they open at the same time but he shows that the sixth seal opened in egypt and he also says that that was the trumpets calling them out to the homeland back in egypt the exodus journey so when brother graham says the sixth seal and the six trumpet open the same time it doesn't mean that they can't open again because they've opened before but brother brims in his ministry under his ministry under the seventh seal ministry the ministry of the end time he's pointing to this opening that was happening in his lifetime so the 1606 trumpet amen and we know it's the second woe which is world war ii world war ii starts in september 1 1939. right but on january 24th 1939 you have a massive earthquake in chile an 8.3 earthquake so the year opens with an earthquake because there's an earthquake at the opening of the sixth seal not a little earthquake not a 4.495 an 8.3 earthquake in chile a major earthquake the year 1939 starts with an earthquake because you're going into the sixth seal and then world war ii goes till september i think this is amazing second 1945. that equals six years exactly why why was jesus on the cross six hours why was world war ii six years why because it's the sixth seal it's everything's laying there for us to see the pattern here and here and here and here and brother branham has no problem seeing in egypt seeing it in calvary seeing it in jacob amen and seeing it in his day and then he can see in the tribulation period he said after the rapture of the church when the bride's done gone amen he says then these two witnesses will open up that sixth seal that he says but he already told us the 60 open with the sixth trumpet it was world war ii persecution to the jews so is it open or is it not open is it open or not because he says it opened up amen in that pre-tribulation amateur tribulation to the jews so the sixth seal opened with the sixth trumpet but he says those two witnesses amen moses and elijah to the jews they'll open up the sixth seal who opens it let's just put it this way like he says prophets the six seals opened by prophets brother branham opens it to the gentiles them to open it to the jews there's no problem with that see i want to do two other numbers and i'll stop in 1960 when in 1960 i don't know what day 1960. yeah it's may i remember now may 1960 now if you remember 1960 is an important year 1960 at the end of the year is when brother bannon's going to start preaching the revelation of jesus christ he's going to start going into the book of revelation and really interpreting the book of revelation all right so 1960 is a big year and in 1960 brother benham shows how the ten toes come together on the two feet the east and west this all happens in 1960. they decide to make an agreement amen they're going to try to bring peace and bring some resolutions that'll move peace and in the cold war amen so there's a 10 nation committee on disarmament and they bring five nations from the western uh uh western nations five from the eastern nations and they're going to come together and all of this is transpiring we went through it carefully all through 1960 early in 1960 and he says look at those two big toes the two big toes was eisenhower and khrushchev eisenhower means iron khrushchev means clay and brother brown says see the iron and the clay they won't mix together because the scripture says they'll intermingle but they won't mix so he says they won't mix but what were they trying to do through this committee they were trying to mix together eisenhower and khrushchev were becoming friends khrushchev had been invited over to earlier in the year had been invited or no i'm sorry late in 1959 had been invited over to the usa they showed him a good time they started this peace deal then right after the first of the year starting in march and then they started this 10 nation committee on disarmament they went from march to april 29th and then they had drawn up plans then there was going to be a peace summit starting i believe i didn't believe it was may 17th there was going to be a peace summit and may 17th in paris where they got back together eisenhower and khrushchev but just between that first session of the ten nation committee on disarmament and the peace summit in paris the russians the soviets shoot down a u-2 spy plane on may 1st and when they found out u.s was still spying on the soviet union khrushchev was infuriated it broke down all the agreement it broke down the the peace process he comes may 17th and he blast it was either 16th or 17th he comes to paris and blasts eisenhower blasts america calls for a public apology and the talks crumble they try to start it up after that it crumbles and from that point on there's never been a ten nation committee on this armament there's never been five west and five east come together with two big toes where their names mean iron and clay it only happened then and it hasn't happened since that crumbles when may 17th may 22nd may 22nd is the largest earthquake ever recorded in the history of mankind why because whenever there's a prophet on the scene and things are opening there's earthquakes after the ten toes are declared they make themselves visible the two big toes khrushchev and eisenhower after all that the largest earthquake ever recorded in history is recorded the great chilean earthquake at 9.5 and after that earthquake brother branham then he sees khrushchev in in october 12th of that same year take a shoe off and beat his shoe at the u.n and brother bram said see so that the world wouldn't miss it he beat a shoe on the table and the world missed it why a shoe because he said he's drawing attention to the feet so that the world wouldn't miss it we've come to the feet of this image gentile world powers is now at the end of the toes it's finished and when the when the talks disintegrated there was a largest earthquake ever recorded and meant by humans ever recorded on the face of the earth was recorded right then and by the end of the year brother branham now is moving into the book of revelations to what to start unveiling the book of revelation and he keeps moving through the book of revelation then the second largest earthquake that was ever recorded takes place good friday 1964 when there's a prophet on the earth who takes a little stone and throws it in the air starts a whirlwind that goes up and nearly sinks alaska what had happened between 1960 and 1964. between 1960 and 1964 brother branham moves into the book of revelations and goes all the way through to the end of the seven seals and you have the largest earthquake ever recorded in human history at the beginning and you have the second largest earthquake ever recorded in human history at the end i think god is drawing attention all of these things are for a reason there's earthquakes all through the bible and they all mean something friends and many times under the seals amen under the sixth seal when there was an earthquake there was a great earthquake when jesus died and the veil was rent so what so you could see he's moved from the churches now there's another earthquake that breaks the roman seal where is he going he's going from one place to another he's moving temples he's no longer in this temple but now he's in this temple it's marking a transition it's marking a change now he's no longer amen he's no longer in the churches he's no longer in the church systems but now he's in the bride and the veil was rent and brother bam comes and he preaches several messages on this and he starts showing god's provided place of worship and things like that he starts shut that veil of denomination is now rent amen move beyond that veil it's re it's open in plain view that that's not the place to find him anymore that was okay in a previous age but now there's been the second crucifixion of jesus christ the word has come the word has stood the test the word has been proved perfect and the word has been crucified and when you see the second crucifixion of jesus christ and now you recognize he's not there him and he's moved to another temple and now he's in his bride and now you know the proper place of worship is in him and i'm in him and he's in me and now we've found the proper place of worship which is what the bride knows in revelations 11 verse 1 and 2 the proper place of worship and the altar she knows the measurements of it because she's been given a measuring tool it all links together friends praise god when brother branham through that i don't know why i'm going into this but i love it when brother ben threw that stone and started that earthquake that was the first of a series of three earthquakes if you follow the message follow really close he throws that stone in the air there's an earthquake the next year 1965 on good friday there's another earthquake in seattle washington and brother branham comes down and starts preaching choosing of a bride and he mentions that second earthquake but if you listen to dawson reilly's testimony dawson reilly will tell you that just before that earthquake brother benham threw another stone in the air and and dawson said he's talking about dragon this is dawson riley's testimony he's talking about a dragon and a tail and he goes i have no idea what he's talking about he said but then we were up hunting then we come down the next day or day or two later because i walked by and i saw a newspaper seattle earthquake he goes then i knew what the dragon's tale was and brother ram comes to choosing of a bride now there's a prophet on the scene earthquake good friday 1964. earthquake good friday 1965. and he's talking about this and choosing of a bride and do you remember what his opening scriptures were for choosing of a bride eleazar fetching a bride for the father son isaac and his second scripture was the third one of the seven vile angels was one of the seven last vials come and said come and see i'll show you the bride the lamb's wife and he's preaching choosing of a bride amen in l.a on the west coast at the end of civilization and religions followed civilization at the end of civilization and at the end of religion there's a vile angel standing in los angeles that had already thrown a stone in the air and created the first earthquake on good friday the next earthquake on the next good friday he's talking about it choosing him a bride they're asking him if it will ever happen in l.a and he says i don't know maybe some say it will some say i don't know if the lord ever tells me i'll let you know you listen to choosing of a bride then he comes to the end of choosing of a bride he says oh capernaum capernaum how oft thou that calls thyself exalted thyself as the city of that thou shall be brought down what's he doing he's prophesying now of a giant earthquake and he said california is going to break off a huge second break off and slip into the ocean and want a giant earthquake amen because when the seventh vial was poured out over in revelation 16 there's an earthquake amen an earthquake such as was not since men were upon the face of the earth so mighty and so great was the earthquake what happened when brother man threw that stone he was what do you say judgment striking the west coast he says now we're under judgments why because he's opened the sixth seal he's a prophet oh for the gentiles open the sixth seal and he's calling judgments to strike judgments to strike and he's also the seventh vile angel pouring out the seventh vial showing that there's going to be another earthquake strike i'm way off text can i show you something else go to the book of revelation we'll see if we can never gather ourselves back together let's go to revelation 17. now i know there's a lot of details but they're all telling the same story if we could just let that tell us the same story revelation 17 1 and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials huh wonder which one this is and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither i will show unto you the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters i want to ask you a question who is the great that sitteth upon many waters rome catholic church vatican city she sits on seven hills how will the vatican city be destroyed a nuclear bomb russia will drop a bomb on it right how do you know that who told you that where did you hear that you didn't hear that there's only one place to hear that and that's through brother branham who in the bible shows you the destruction of the who shows you the destruction of the one of the vile angels shows you the destruction of the [Music] and he says what he says they'll be the the it's babylon it's babylon he said in babylon will be destroyed and he comes over here in chapter 18. verse 9 and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lay them in her when they shall see the smoke of her burning standing afar off for fear of her torment saying alas last that great city babylon the mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment come and brother banner said they stand a far off fear of torment from nuclear fallout from a nuclear bomb that fell on the vatican and her judgment came in one hour where else have you heard that who in the bible shows you the destruction of the great it's one of the seven angels having one of the seven vials i wonder what number you would attribute to that one furthermore he goes on in chapter 18 verse 20 it says rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets and god of the vengeance and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea saying thus was violent shall that great city babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all he shows you the destruction of the vatican and the destruction of los angeles like a millstone cast into the sea who told you how that was going to happen it was the prophet of god but he was he had many titles but his greatest title was the seventh angel and one of the seven angels having the seven vials is the one who shows you the destruction of the and also shows you amen the destruction of babylon amen that's cast into the sea like a millstone amen friends this this whole bible is to be open to the bride open it and open it and open it up so he he goes through the series of earthquakes but he has poured out another vial in 1965 in los angeles in choosing of a bride and that will be fulfilled it will happen praise be to god and the vatican will be judged by a nuclear bomb and mystery babylon los angeles all the filth that has moved all the way to the west coast and bumped all the way into los angeles he says now this is the headquarters of satan that's what babylon is the headquarters of satan los angeles has become the headquarters of satan has become a babylon well you can't have two brother chad he said the vatican's babylon who says you can't have two where does the bible say you can't have two amen you have the religious system amen and then you have the vile outcropping that's coming out of los angeles through hollywood that's polluting the whole world and who showed you the destruction of it what you could say brother branham but if you're going to be scriptural you'll say one of the seven vile angels is who told me that if you want to be scriptural praise be to god i love the lord and i love his word can i go through one more thing praise god you know i love you guys but i'm so full of this i it's not brand new stuff but it's just clearer you know it's the same thing clear it's it's god is it's like he's focusing the binoculars you know you see two you see i i see 21 angels right brother graham says he says you three see three gods father son and holy ghost he said you just need to dial in the binoculars so they become one and i see three angels in the church there's seven ages church ages seven violent angels seven trumpet angels i see 21 angels it might be time to take the binoculars and just dial them down a little bit amen praise be to god amen there's nothing wrong with the binoculars and there's nothing wrong with what we're looking at but we didn't realize we've had it out of focus and all it takes is just a little adjustment and that little adjustment is the adjustment that brother branham told us himself when we adjust it according to the message all of a sudden it gets clearer i see now what we're supposed to see praise god let's go back to matthew 24. let's read a couple scriptures so matthew 24 we went down through one we showed the questions in verse three three questions he goes down and starting in verse four he goes down and answers through ten uh the five seals and then he picks up the sixth seal over in verse 29. but there's something that happens between that that brother is going to talk about he's going to show us and we'll pick it up in verse 15. it says when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand then let them which be in judea flee into the mountains let him which is in the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes and woe to them that are with child unto them that give suck in those days but pray your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day for there shall be great tribulations such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever shall be and except those days shall be shortened there shall be no flesh saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened so you come to this period and he says there shall be great tribulation and whenever he makes that all of a sudden you're tipped off to the sixth seal you're tipped off to the sixth seal and so now let's go over to luke 21 and read from luke 21. luke 21 verse 20. and when you shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh then let him let them which are in judea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let let not them that are in the countries enter therein too for these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon the people and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive unto all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled and there shall be signs in the sun and the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your heads for your redemption draw us nigh so we've read these two scriptures they tie together brother branham has asked a question and questions and answers in 1964. and in 19 in this questions and answers question number 236 says what does this mean matthew 24 19 woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days it says matthew now matthew 24 19 jesus had had been asking three questions in these questions was that when will the time be that there won't be one stone left on another what will be the sign of the coming of the end of the world and the three different questions he was asked and he answered it in three different ways answering each question when will it be when there won't be one stone upon another and what will be the sign of your coming what is the sign of the end of the world and he answers it in three different ways he tells them when the time will come when there won't be one stone on another what will be the sign of his coming then at the end of the world and many times if you don't watch closely now how he answers you'll get it mixed up and throw it all in one time and then you're all mixed up now further down he says that's under the time that there won't be one stone left upon another woe into them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days because a mother that is with child it would be hard for her to run to those that are giving suck to their babies to pack them because they had to come from jerusalem out of the city and up into the mountains of judea and now i could just stay all morning on that one thing there just to make it clear wow that's a big statement but i'm just going to try to hit the high spots that i can and get it to the people and then go to the next question now jesus had told them when you see jerusalem compassed about i went to that in luke that was luke 21 20. jesus is tying that together with matthew 24. now jesus had told them when you see jerusalem compassed about with army then let him that's in the field don't return back into the city get a coat take anything out of his house don't return back into the city at all but flee into judea for there will be a time of trouble not since the world began and that all came to pass in the days when the roman general titus besieged jerusalem burnt the city there was and there's only and killed the people till the blood flew out of the gates and rolled out and out the street he beseeched it don't know just how many years it was that he just took his armies and came up and just camped right around the city and even the people the women boiled their own children and eat them eat the bark of the trees the grass off the ground that was for rejecting the word that's what caused it so you want to know what caused titus taking jerusalem they rejected the word and it was a horrible it was a horrible act in history a horrible battle and a horrible scene that took place there but because in jerusalem was the ministry of jesus christ and in jerusalem he was crucified and so the wrath of god was poured out because they had an opportunity like no other place on the earth had an opportunity there was no other place that had the opportunity they had and you want to know why russia is going to drop atomic bombs on america because no other nation had the opportunity that america had while the prophet was here and they rejected jesus christ and the son of man ministry and there's nothing left for america to become ashes and debris border to border coast to coast for what rejecting jesus christ the word praise be to god he says now those who had received the word now listen those who had received the word as joseph as that great historian writes he says now those people the reason pray that your flight not be in the wintertime judea was snowbound see christmas now how was how was jesus born up there and then snowbound hills pray that your flight be not in wintertime neither on the sabbath day because on the sabbath day the gates were shut and they'd be caught right in their trap if titus got there on friday afternoon there was besiege in there for the sabbath because the doors was closed the gates was closed on the sabbath and don't open there's no coming and going out of the city on the sabbath day and now you see what happened woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days because fleeing and running and according to the history there wasn't one of them that believed in jesus and believed the word but what was watching for that to happen and they escaped went from jerusalem into judea and fled for their lives not one of them because they were worn by their shepherd and was watching for that hour to come when they heard titus was coming they took off run for their lives and got out of the city now this sounds like history but it's not history remember everything that has been will be i i remember last year i was in poland for meetings and they took me over to auschwitz concentration camp and that happened under the sixth seal right and and i was in auschwitz and you see all the horrible things that happened to human beings and it was somber and they take you through and explain this and this and what they do here and here and as i was leaving auschwitz there was a thought that was moving me more than what i saw in auschwitz and the thought that was moving me was that everybody thinks this is history and they don't realize this is the future they made it a museum they look back at the atrocities and they want to keep it going there's a memorial so that this will never happen again but they don't realize amen the same events that cause that to happen are the same events that's taking place daily around the globe when they reject the word that the bride is carrying and what they think is history is the future for a huge number of people because there's nothing that's now is that hasn't been before and what is shall be again amen these things repeat under a sixth seal and a sixth seal and a sixth seal and a sixth seal prophet of god there was a sixth seal open in his lifetime and he explained it to us and the demons coming out and the persecution and throwing the stone and earthquake and all these things but he says those two prophets are going to open up a sixth seal they certainly will it's going to be horrible everything that's been shall be again so when we look back at this don't look at it by what's been this is going on now brother brahm says the whole nation had to be brought into judgment because it happened about 80 70 when the great roman general titus besieged jerusalem about 80 70 with his army from rome and there they paid the price for rejecting him now brother braham goes on to say in uniting times and sign he said before titus united his armies together israel united themselves together and banded themselves and they would not believe jesus to be the messiah before before titus united his armies together the religious system had to unite against jesus christ what has been will be again they rejected him and turned him out and crucified him you might say well i don't reject jesus christ if you reject the bride of jesus christ you reject jesus christ because she is he was the word made manifest she is the word made manifest she is him how uniting themselves together to reject the message of the hour they had to do that and when they did that that national sign come in the nations began to unite themselves together and titus brought this great army of romans and greeks encompassed the walls of jerusalem pin those people in there now and they starve to death they ate the bark from the trees josephus the great historian tells us they eat the grass off the ground they even bored one another's children and eat it see as they were met mad people and when they finally titus he was setting back up on the hills and around jerusalem and those people in there thought that they were doing the will of god when they saw those armies marching in they had refused to hear that great master lord jesus tell them that there wasn't one of them christians caught in there for they saw the sign and moved see they said let them that's on the housetop come not down or him that's in the field go back take any coat but flee into judea pray your flight be not in the winter time or the sabbath because the in the winter time the hills will be full of snow and the sabbath the doors will be closed and the gate that they caught in the condition we want to get on that pretty soon how god does those things lord willing now notice they prayed now they wouldn't be that not be that way jesus told them to pray for that and they never caught one of them in there they were gone because they looked at the sign and they were gone that's all there was to it oh how the churches today ought to see the sign of the time that we're living in flee as hard as you can to calvary for life not in some church but to jesus christ unite yourselves with him and not with some organization or some church creed unite with christ and be sure that it's him that's good advice unite with christ but be sure it's him what is him who is he he's the anointed word made flesh in your day you can't just take anything you've got to be positive that it's him what a time of union then i'm going to read just a couple more to set the stage and then i want to explain this and and god being misunderstood from 61 brother brahm says it's a question brother bantam and daniel the 11th chapter of the 31st verse teaches us of the day take away the daily sacrifice and the abomination that make desolation would you please explain that what these are he said oh he says the 70 weeks of daniel and i might just say this your most precious brother that signed us here which is a dear friend to all of us the abomination that make a desolation in matthew 24 spoke of the abomination means filthiness that maketh desolation the abomination was a muslim mosque of omar that was built on the temple ground where the holy place stood in 1896 titus came in and captured jerusalem and burnt the temple and they built the mosque of omar the muhammad religion right on the temple grounds and still stands there to this day and it will stand there until god returns to the jews and the abomination that is the mosque of our that makes desolation of the holy place standing in the holy place jesus referred to it and said in parentheses let him that readeth understand therefore he give us so many days from that time to after the prince and so many days and so forth and we'll get into that next sunday and trying to the best of my knowledge to get that in for you next sunday but the abomination is the mosque of amar that took the place of the temple the reason i say that is is because many people look at that brother in matthew 24 he says when you see the abomination that make desolation he says the mosque of amar and then in luke 21 he says when you see jerusalem compassed about with armies flee and he puts these two events together but those two events took place about 600 years apart because the mosque of amar really isn't the mosque of ammar it's really the dome of the rock that big golden dome that you see on the temple mount it's called the dome of the rock they didn't happen at the same time but brother bannon puts it to the same time the same thing because it is the same thing it's the holy temple being desecrated amen and something taking its place on top of the holy mountain so he can come in and in 70 a.d under titus it can be leveled in 600 and something a.d the dome of the rock can be built and brother branham links them right together and say it's showing the same thing it's showing destruction under the sixth seal it's showing judgment and now that dome of the rock proves that you're under gentile rule until that until jesus returns and presumably that thing goes i'm not going to go too far down that road so you see he links those stories together because they're interlinked together because if titus had never come and tore that thing down amen the muslims would have never marched in afterwards and built the dome of the rock one thing leads into another and leads into another and so now you see you see uh uh the the temple mounts been polluted by religion that's what the dome of the rock represents and the muslims is a religion like the jews because they both claim they come from abraham only abraham has two sons ishmael and isaac only the muslims and the took the opposite view of the jews the jews were descendants of isaac and they believed the promise went with isaac amen the muslims are descendants of ishmael and they believe the promise came with ishmael what do you got you've got twins again and you've got twin religions again and now the twin religion the false one is the one that's dominating the landscape with a mosque with a temple the dome of the rock up on the temple mount showing that the true religion has been abased amen and the false vine now is ruling over the old church see all this stuff means something friends and it means something to you and i amen because when when titus comes rolling in he comes rolling in in fact afterwards they tried to give titus awards and accolades for what he did and titus wouldn't accept it he said i was only a tool in the hand of divine judgment how did he know that i don't know but he said it why because he was a tool in the hand of god for divine judgment because when god came in the flesh they rejected him and when you spurn mercy there's nothing left but judgment and that's why this is a sixth seal it's right in between the fifth seal and 29 where he says the sixth seal and the tribulation of those days for the jews in world war ii but there was another six seal encounter that they had in a.d 70 when they rejected jesus christ and just a few years later not one stone was left upon another titus rolls in whose titus rome who does all of this rome it's interesting to know rome was even the originator of the muslim religion so it's still rome it's a still false religion it's the twin now jerusalem was the brother i said the most holy place the headquarters of true religion the old church he calls out all these things and in the old church in the headquarters of true religion amen jesus christ comes right to the church and the church refuses him and when they refuse him he did all the signs he did all the scriptures he did everything he was supposed to do he never failed once the failure was was on their end and when it came time if and for malachi 4 and luke 17 30 to reveal the coming of the son of man he didn't fail on one scripture the failure was not him the son of man the failure was the churches because he did everything that the scripture said that he would do but now titus comes rolling in and he's going to surround the old church and i've got an article here of the siege of jerusalem i'm going to read one small section now that says in april 70 ce about the time of passover huh about the time of passover isn't god just in everything he does when was jesus christ rejected and slain passover they rejected the messiah the true passover lamb and now their destruction is going to start at the time of passover about the time of passover the roman general titus besieged jerusalem since that action coincided with passover the romans allowed pilgrims to enter the city but refused to let them leave what were they doing they were using religion religion to create a trap i want to ask you what is rome doing today rome is using religion to create a trap and they know under the religious feast of passover you have pilgrims that come from all over and return back to jerusalem because they're told to in the law of moses so now the population they said went up josephus estimates there was 1.1 million people in the city when titus besieged it but it was way more than the normal population because titus knew that if we get all these people in amen they'll deplete all their food stores and they'll starve to death faster these pilgrims weren't soldiers they were women and children and men with families and the elderly and so he creates a religious trap and in the religious trap he lets them all come into worship because you can come and worship praise be to god it's the same thing rome's always done is the same thing rome's attempting to do now through the world council of churches and all their ecumenical move let's just come together and have worship you can come together and worship and what are they doing they're trying to get everybody behind the walls of the old church trying to get the old religious system amen and trying to get everybody to move in behind the walls of the old religious system and it looked good it looked nice i mean they're here they're going to set rule and order but they're letting us come and worship anyways they're only trapping you in a religious system and when he got when he got everybody in there and jerusalem was about to pop they couldn't get anybody else in the gate he tightens his noose and now he besieges the city and he builds another wall around that wall and now the safety of the old church becomes the death trap this is why the old traditional understanding is a death trap the old church is a death trap i don't care what they say i don't care what anybody else says amen this church has got to be a church that's moving forward in the resolution of jesus christ because the dog to go back will always equal death always so now so now he brings him into this death trap amen and then he builds a wall around them and cuts off their supplies and now he starves them to death oh rome hasn't changed their tactics at all let's get everybody agree we'll come and worship protestants and catholics it doesn't matter if you're lutheran doesn't matter if you're protestant it doesn't matter come into the old system we'll tighten it down and we'll cut off your spiritual food no revelation no word no ministry of a prophet all you've got and now they start eating grass because they got no spiritual food now you wonder why rock and roll comes into a church amen they start eating bark and grass because there's no more spiritual food to eat you got to give the people something to eat and that's how a program comes in and a youth this and this that and a single's this they start eating the bark off the tree they start taking the dirt they start feasting on their own children [Music] nothing's changed nothing has changed get them in the system tighten the noose down cut off all spiritual food and weaken them and weaken them until they're willing to eat anything just to survive that spirit is still alive because spirits don't die what has been will be again and under a week in condension they start to beat down the walls they beat down the walls and they make their way into the temple mount when they make their way into the temple mount they burn down the temple destroy it and the blood flows out of the temple gate and down the temple stairs because they rejected the blood of jesus christ now their own blood is spilt on their own temple it's not a kind thing to reject the word it's a serious thing they openly and defiantly and on purpose rejected jesus christ nicodemus comes and says we know that you're a man set from god for no man can do the works you do unless you be of god people will tell you i love the way you live i love the i love the way you raise your family i love how respectful your kids are i love how sincere you are people know it's the truth they just don't want to make a sacrifice to believe they know it's the truth why do they show you respect why do they show you kindness why do they make good comments about you and your household and your family and your church why because they know it's the truth and they knew jesus christ was a man sent from god and they wouldn't reject the old system to take him but if you're going to have christ whatever day you're living in you've got to reject the old system to have him even today see after he destroyed the temple they burn it out why the mercy seat was destroyed because there was no shekinah glory of god there anymore then at the east side of the temple he offered an ox and a sheep and swine's blood on the east side because the temple was destroyed and he offered it to the roman gods what'd he do he made abomination that maketh desolation what was that the sixth seal breaking out on the jews what happened after that conquest after conquest after conquest finally somebody comes in and builds a dome with a rock which is just a symbol of what's going on over there it's the abomination that make a desolation that started all the way back in titus that actually goes back to the greeks to uh antiochus epiphanes it's the same cycle repeating through history but let's not let it repeat to us let's not get brought into some system of some man there's all kinds of systems we have all of our own systems we love to come up with well i'm going to stay right here because this is safe remember what i said about the light shining brother talked about the light the man was down there in kentucky he shined that light and he told brother branham i don't believe in revelation or something like that and i only believe in what i see and brother branham asked him about his home or something like that when you go up to the home he says i don't see your home. he says it's right over there how do you know it's there oh i know it's there well how do you get there you can't see that from here see there's a path there well how do you see the path i don't see the path said i got a light he said that light's only good for one step at a time amen so you hold that line up and brother bam said that's when he said well take this light and walk in this lie and stick with it and stay with it and watch it unfold itself the problem is this is what human beings do this is what you and i do don't point the finger to anybody else this is what we do we'll hold the light up and we're amazed at what we see look at this there's a treated bush there in the house there and there's a well and and we start describing everything in the peripheral and within the limits of the light and then we get comfortable with where everything's at the well's here the house is there the chicken coop's over there the path is here and we just keep rehearsing what's in the light and talking about what's in the light and reinforcing what's in the light and making flannel graphs on what's in the light and teaching the kids what's in the light they understand what i'm saying but right at the edge of the light there's something intriguing and it's right in there in that spot you can make it out you can see it you can see there's something there but it's not like super crystal clear what it is but there's something there and you spend some time looking over there you're like there's something there and i think i think that might be a further step in getting home are you sure i'm not sure but i'm pretty sure i've been watching it for a while and every once in a while in the later moons i get a little more light that's this message friends i get a little more light and but how do you know you're right well i don't know i'm right well how do you know you're right i've got to go stand on that spot oh but what if you're wrong why don't you just stay here amen in the new system of the lantern line we've got everything mapped out we know where it belongs we've talked about it for decades our children know about it we know this is this and this and that and we've already pigeonholed all the scriptures you don't have to think you can buy the book we've got to color in fill in the blank for you you know what i'm saying is the truth because we're all guilty of the same thing we want safety and security and the very thing we do to create safety and security is the very thing that destroys us because everybody started a denomination to protect their truth and in protecting their truth they lost the truth every time and in the message if we try to protect the truth i'm only going this far i won't be going beyond these bounds this is all a safe area we know all of this we've known all of this we can prove all of this in the bible we know serpency we can teach our kids our kids can teach theologian serpency water baptism in jesus name all of these things the church ages we've mastered it but remember this light is supposed to get us home we got to go home this light takes us home friends and i haven't gotten home yet because a hybrid condition in my flesh my atoms have not changed that means there's more progress to make [Music] not a new message but no fear and venturing in the message that's been given to us and we'll stand within the walls because we've done a lot of battle over these truths [Music] we fought for serpent seed fought for water baptism in jesus name so we started building walls we've got this scripture in this scripture and history i got an eight-foot wall right over here by water baptism in jesus name i got a good one over here on servant seed and oneness of the godhead and before too long we've walled ourselves in trying to be safe but show me one prophet that stayed safe with the word show me where jesus christ the safest place to be is moving when the light moves you know what happens when the light moves on when we build a wall we got ourselves on the wall city we plug in the electricity click and now you've got man-made light the definition of denominationalism and where everyone guilty of it but you know what i'm going to have to do if i'm going to make it home i got to have enough courage to look at this thing and say ah there's something pulling me to that there's something there i can see it's not like walking in the blind there's something you actually there there i see the quote i see it in the scripture there's something there but i don't fully understand it the key to do is take your light and walk over there and stand on that spot and see if the message won't illuminate that amen and when it illuminates it you say wow i had no idea all of this was over here too all i knew was water baptism serpent seed godhead the seven church ages i had no idea he told us about what was going on in heaven before the foundation of the world i had no idea that he was telling me amen all about the other dimensions because he was afraid to move then you bump out and it moves and praise god sometimes when you get over there and you bump out and you move you realize no that's not the path but what's wrong with finding out what's over there now you know this ain't the path praise god let's go find where the path is let's not build a walled city amen and wall ourselves behind generational truths but let's let the generational truth be a foundation that we keep building on as we go higher and higher in christ we're not going to reject any of those things those are the very things we're standing on so that we can see over the wall amen it's the very thing that lifts us higher and higher and higher and so let's not wall ourselves in but let's build ourselves amen a little higher in christ edify the body of christ get clearer vision let the lantern go just a little bit further move out and explore just a little bit everybody be hungry be careful be careful i saw somebody walk over there before and they fell off a cliff they believed in tucson and they believed in thunders and they believed in i saw somebody go over there and they never came back that's no excuse for not exploring the message that's no excuse for not digging a little deeper and then going a little farther and finding out if it was wrong then what's the truth of it because you can't teach anything in error unless it's founded on something true so instead of run away from the whole thing let's find out what was the true part is there truth there i want the truth i want all the truth i want the truth that's been tainted if there's truth there i'll dig the truth out and leave the rest thank you i'll go over here if there's truth over here embrace god by the grace of god i want to dig the truth out here and leave the rest over there i don't want nothing that comes from a man but i want the truth that's been given to us by this message and i want every drop of it and i'm not going to praise god run into some walled city and worsen that build a city myself because that's what rome wants rome wants you to build your own church who built jerusalem the jews who built the walls the jews who trapped them in it the romans who built the denominations the protestants who built the lutherans who built the the wesley wall who built the pentecostal wall the protestants who's going to trap them in the wall the romans and i don't want to get trapped in some message wall because the message isn't a walled city the message is a path home it's the new jerusalem it's the heavenly city that's come down from god and i want to explore all of its gardens all of its rivers and i want to get all the way to the top well starve me out you see people are starving for some fresh manna from heaven starving and because there's no fresh man coming from heaven because we stay in the safe calm veins of our lamplight they're starving now and the children are running to entertainment children are running to sports and running to this and running to that why because they can only eat grass for so long let's feed on the fresh man and come keep in the journey stay with the light don't be afraid even if there's something there go stand on it and if you find out you were wrong say i was wrong i don't know what the problem is no but i learned a whole lot by taking a venture over here and digging around the message and find out if this is true or not and i found out it's wrong this isn't the path to walk but i tell you what i learned a whole lot on that little trip titus come in built a wall around their wall and trapped him but all those who had heard the message from the great shepherd not one of them were trapped behind that wall i want to ask you friends have you heard the message when you see this ecumenical council begin to tighten up when you see this world council of churches when you see the stagnation and fear to move flee from the city run away titus is on his way when you see him encompassed about with armies run that's when it's time to run stay free stay on the move not one was trapped behind the walls and i say let's stay free keep the lantern in your hand and keep walking and stick with it and don't move no matter what anybody else says and then you'll see it'll reveal itself brother brahm said walk into the light and walk out and some more will bump out use that term bump out how do you get the light to bump out not by sitting right in the middle of your walled city afraid to move but you've got to be pressing the darkness and getting out there and exploring the edge of the light and when you do more will bump out if more doesn't bump out go try someplace else because you can't bump it out but if we have the right attitude and the right approach as children amen exploring you know i don't think god put adam and eve in the garden of eden to sit down right in the center of garden eating afraid to move out because they're not so sure what's out there the garden of eden was an expression of his thought and he wanted his children to understand the expression of his thought and i think he liked it when they explored i think they liked it when they asked questions amen i'm sure adam liked it amen because brother said adam the first day that the woman came forth adam took his wife and he went walking through the garden and says let me show you this and let me show you this and let me show you that what was it adam was a god on the earth and in his territory was the garden of eden and when his wife come along his side he couldn't wait to show her what was all in the garden and i named it this because of this reason and i did this because of that and i moved this over here for this reason i think adam would have been awfully disappointed and she'd be like ah i'm just not interested can we go back to where the kumquats were i'm just going to stay right there i think it probably this is just brother chat i'm probably wrong to say poor brother he don't know nothing but i imagine if if eve would ever ask adam a question adam why did you move this tree from here over there i don't understand i'm sure adam got pretty tickled because everything he did was for a purpose and he probably says oh i've just been waiting for you to ask that question there's a huge revelation behind that why did you name that animal that oh praise god because it matches his characteristics god why did you put the word here like this why did brother branham put these two scriptures together why did he use those two opening scriptures and choosing of a bride why does the bible say that one of the seven violent angels shows the destruction of the and brother branham showed us how the will be destroyed why did you do that what does that mean i don't think god's upset i think what bothers god is when you're not interested and we don't care to explore his wonderful garden that he's put us in called the message of the hour and he put us here he gave it to us let's enjoy it amen let's run all through it amen let's run and try this and try that and sample this and ask this question and discover this let's not get behind a walled city and let the roman spirit come in now you say no well we're not dealing with the vatican and i know better than getting council churches i'm not signing no papers if that's what you think this is going to be like you're already deceived it's a spirit that creeps in subtly that you don't notice it it's not i'm not signing no papers and if the government causes me to register and i've got to register under some new movement i'm i'm i'm wary to that i'm not going to sign my name on a paper we're not signing our church up for that my goodness you're already too far gone when you get to that place that's not what you watch for you watch for that subtle spirit coming in trying to make you afraid of the very word that he's given you trying to cause fear to explore the guard in your place to trying to create safety nets to protect what we have i'm just going to stick with this and i'm only going to stick with that amen don't worry about signing on the dotted line don't worry about that worry about that subtility of the serpent that's coming in and saying yeah brother venom said but he also said that's the slick tongue slicker you got to watch out for and that one's talking in your own head i mean it's the roman spirit trying to trap the people trying to get us amen get us trapped to reject the word to trap us down to fall under the sixth seal but praise be to god i've already went through the sixth seal on calvary i was there and i'm here and i'm there and time means nothing to god when was jesus christ crucified amen you say 2 000 years ago you missed something because from for us it was 2 000 years ago for god he's always been the lamb crucified when was i saved don't say 30 years ago don't say 20 years ago you've always been saved in the mind of god you always have been always where were always will be it's eternal and he's the eternal lamb slain and you're eternally seated with him in heavenly places you were eternally with him then you will eternally be eternally with him forever you're with him now how does it work what's the physics i don't know the physics i just know the truth out of the bible and i believe it let's not get hemmed in by our own thinking let's not reject the word and push ourselves into judgment but let's stay free and outside of walled cities because i guarantee rome's coming rome is coming rome is here rome is on the march and stay away from it and if you think you got to go kiss the pope's ring to somehow bow before rome you're wrong you can bow before it every day by taking that same spirit of denomination to protect the truth that's given us and the fear to move forward for fear of being wrong and i would crucify that thing and tell that serpent to get behind me satan but i'm going to enjoy this garden that god's given me full of perfectly good food brother banham was told to cancel his overseas trip and do what store up the food and there's a storehouse full of food and i'm going to eat it all when i go down and i get a tape like feast of trumpets and you crack that seal and you spin that jar open you look at you like what is that what is that i don't know but if it's in the storehouse it's good just start eating it because it'll digest it'll give you nourishment it'll give you life amen and god will will reveal it to you when it's time don't be afraid of the food don't be afraid of the food in storehouse don't be afraid of the message don't be afraid of brother branham's quotes don't be afraid of contradictory quotes don't be afraid to let the scriptures flex say brother chad it's the scriptures i know it's the scriptures but jesus flexed the scriptures i don't believe you jesus took scriptures out of context and out of place changed the wording and used it in another way why because he was the word and he knew what it meant and he knew that that prophecy is a dual fulfillment sometimes two sometimes more sometimes spiritual sometimes natural sometimes natural and spiritual at the same time sometimes natural and spiritual then spiritual than natural you get my point in a revolving history as it unfolds because he knew the word was eternal and the word would always match the situation but he had no problem with taking something that david was speaking about about a current event pop it out of what david had said change the wording and reapply it to his day and he was right and guess what the apostle paul did the same thing and guess what peter did the same thing they would leave parts out they would add parts they would take two scriptures and put them together oh praise god now we're getting to some good stuff because brother branham did the same thing why because he knew the word and he knew what he was talking about let's not be afraid of the word friends let's keep moving forward let's all stand i got off on a tangent but praise be to the lord somebody was pulling in a certain direction i think maybe we'll come back and finish this up wednesday but i just want to say i love you guys god bless you let's keep marching forward let's not be afraid of this word it won't hurt us this message won't hurt us don't be afraid to explore don't be afraid to ask your husband what is this why is that there why is it like that i think he likes it i think he likes it let's just bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father for this day you've given us lord i'm a long ways from where i intended to be but i believe i'm exactly where you want us to be god you have control over all things you control your gifts and you control your people lord and we want you to have absolute control over us lead us and guide us by your spirit lord god i pray that you'd break away from us any iron curtain any denominational idea any wall that we've built lord give us the grace to tear that thing down help us god to have courage to move forward in your word lord let that light shine just a little farther lord that we might see something that'll take us to the next step in our journey god i pray that you give us the courage to walk there and stand in it and let the light illuminate that for us god let us keep moving forward where you want us to be in the path that you've chosen for us let us never grow stagnant lord or weary of the journey but let us enjoy lord what you've given to us to enjoy god bless your people help us to grow in revelation keep lord keep on opening our eyes to your truth keep rubbing that eye salve in our eyes lord that we can see clearly where we're standing and what's going on all around us we love you lord we ask your blessing as we part keep us lord by your grace and use us to be light into this world and may somebody see the beacon light and come to you lord that's our greatest desire is to see a soul saved to see somebody come to the light in the mystery of their life to come unraveled under those seals we pray that lord is there still one there that you'd bring them in we love your father and ask that you'd have your way with us in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you brother come away [Music] my love come away my love i have waited for this day when i could give to you my name eternity awaits us my love i have waited for this day when i could give to you my name each eternity awaits us come away i have written my love secrets in that book you know so well just look a little closer and you'll find victory over hell and

dismissed as you'd like to be if you want to sit and pray you want to stand in worship do as you like just be conscious as you go and keep quiet get through the four year quickly and out to the parking lot and say god bless you we love you amen my spirit free that i might praise set my spirit free to worship set my spirit free that i might worship please set my spirit free that i might
