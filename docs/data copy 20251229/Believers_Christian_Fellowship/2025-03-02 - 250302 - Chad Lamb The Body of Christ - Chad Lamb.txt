amen and God bless you we're going to ask you to have your seats for just a moment thank you musicians I have a an announcement to make I like making announcements but I'd like to announce the engagement of brother Alex Bartram and Sister Amy Preston could you two stand for us am amen congratulations amen we're very happy and excited for you all it's one of my favorite things to make good announcements amen I'd love to do that and I I want to beat social media every time you know how hard that is but they were engaged Friday evening and so we're very very happy for them uh just wanted to remind you real quick that brother Gabe is in Pittsburgh this morning ministering for brother Jean so he traveled there yesterday he'll be traveling back this afternoon so remember to keep him in prayer also I was grateful to hear sister Rachel's testimony they called and I talked to her and brother John as well and it what amazed me was that she was having pain because of the pain she went in and found out she had minor there minor small blood clots in the lung that the doctors believe will take care of themselves that it'll it'll be resolved on its own but because of that she went in to find out that somewhere along the way she had a brain bleed and she never knew it and those of you who know that can be quite lethal it's very deadly and they don't know if it was at the time of the accident or after all they can say is that she had a brain bleed but on its own it was self-contained and stopped bleeding and she's not in Risk right now and I just thank God that God took her through that process to show her I've been taking care of you all alone God be praised like brother Blake said we don't know sometimes what God is doing for us and how much he's protecting us and watching over us but there's times that he gives us a glimpse and we realize how special his care is for us also yesterday I got a really wonderful uh testimony from Sister Jose paac she's in Quebec Canada right now visiting her mother and uh she told me that um I think it was yesterday morning she went to move her car they had got a foot of fresh snow I would love to be in Quebec I love snow a foot of fresh snow overnight she went to move her car so that this plow truck wouldn't block it in and when she went to move it she found she she didn't have her key she couldn't find her key she looked all over and she remembered the day before she was out cross country skiing and she remember she fell down at one place in the trail and she thought maybe her keys could have fallen out well she was CrossCountry skiing on top of two foot of fresh snow they had gotten before then the night after another foot of snow fell on top of it so she prayed and she went to the spot she fell down and she dug down and in a very short amount of time she found her key fob hallelujah amen praise be to God she needless to say she was very excited and she called it a miracle amen a miracle cuz she hadd been out on her mother's 29 Acres out there and who knows where but God knew that's more than a needle in a hay stack F we thank God for that amen if you would let's all stand together just want to remind you that today we have communion and feet washing uh this afternoon also want to uh give a greeting to brother cus cob God bless you brother cus he's been here for over a week and I forgot to greet him the last two Services he's actually fing home tomorrow so please take your greetings back to our greetings back to your family for us amen it's been good to have him here amen amen let's turn in our Bibles to the book of Colossians the book of Colossians chapter 1 in Colossians let's go to chapter 1 verse 21 he says in you you that were sometimes alienated in enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight amen thank God God bless you as you take your seats keep your Bibles open there and we'll take a look at this uh I'd like for a subject to take the subject the body of Christ and uh as many times we go back and we review something again these are things we'll talk about today are things that are quite common to us but always God has a way of adding some brushstrokes to the picture adding some color and it just gets more vibrant and clear and so we love to Circle back around and look at these things as God deals with them in this and and brother brandham made this statement the God of this evil age he said in God's Own thinking God the great spirit in the beginning before there was a beginning he was God and did you know you were in him then if you are a Christian now you was in him then and then if that be so the whole godhead bodily shaped up in the person of Jesus Christ and when Jesus died at the cross I died with him for I was in him then what a statement for he was the fullness of the word manifested knowing that we would be manifested later and we was at Calvary with him listen there's there's there's no time that I know of in history just I haven't been a huge study of history but read many times and uh biographies and some sermons of and who who told us these things before now who told us that when he was on the cross we were with him then that we were we were there and obviously we know we weren't there in this flesh body it was not the flesh element that's born of man and woman the the the 46 chromosomes that come 23 from Mom 23 that wasn't what was there but that Eternal piece of life that attribute of God that was meant to be us that's the true us that's the reality of God of God's family of God's children that that's in us now was in him then because he was the fullness of the word and we're a part of the word but all the word was gathered up into him and the Word was made flesh and so at this end time the the prophet begins to to the take the veil away and begin to open up to us the realities amen of the word and when we look at this in in uh chapter uh 1: 21 he says you that were alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled and if you look at the end of the word reconciled there's no punctuation there's no calmer there's no period there's there's nothing it goes right from this to the next verse Amen in the body of his flesh through death so how did he reconcile me in the body of his flesh because he was the word made flesh and so where was I I was there I don't I don't have any remembrance of it brother benam said no recollection it it's not like amen it's it's not like what what sometimes we think of humanly but that part that was to be me was there amen so we were reconciled in the body of his flesh and so so Christ the anointed word had a body and that body was Jesus Christ and and we were there amen and sometimes we say you know in in what way we understand what the prophet say we repeat the things that the prophet told us but these little Minds can't comprehend it like we can't I can't explain it but something down inside says amen amen amen and then can you explain that to me how that worked what part what was the chemistry what was the mechanics and I say brother I can't tell you I have no idea but how do you know you were there because I don't know whenever brother Brenham says it something in me starts jumping up and saying that's the truth amen so we were in that body and Christ had a body the body of Jesus Christ but then we know that after that that body was crucified and he became the propitiation for our sins amen that and and and brother bam tells us that that body amen went on to Heaven he still has a body on Earth and that's what we want to talk about let's turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 together 1 Corinthians chapter 12 1 Corinthians chap 12 verse 12 for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ so what do you mean so also is Christ it means Christ is a many membered body that's what the scripture is telling us for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink unto one spirit for the body is not one member but many now let's go down to verse 27 says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular so Christ is now a many membered body he has a body on this Earth that he's working in but that body is not the singular form that we saw uh in the man who was nailed to the cross but now it's his church it's his redeemed people born again by a spirit they are now the many membered body of of Jesus Christ and ye are the body of Christ but members in particular so I may not be all of it but I'm part of it amen I may be a tiny listen I may be a tiny part of it but praise God I'm part of it part of the body of Christ amen uh brother bam said now if I told you the truth Jesus Christ will work in his church you and I just the same as he did when he was here on Earth in a physical body how many knows that his his physical body sits on the throne of God in his Spirit returned to the Earth to live in the church to energize it as a vine to the branches certainly then he has no hands but mine and yours he has no eyes but mine and yours and brother remember is not saying he has no that body went amen as a propitiation the high priest went into the holy of holies in the Heavenly places for us amen but but he has no eyes but mine and yours no uh hands but mine and yours no mouth but mine and yours that mean doesn't mean his disappeared that he's talking about here on Earth now in this dimension in this manifestation if God if Christ is going to work he's going to work through his body he needs a body to manifest himself and that body will manifest the life that's in the body which is the Life of Christ and so now we he he is the the the the vine we are the branches amen and now the life is coming out of the branches but the life's coming from from the vine it's his life in us so he is a many-membered uh body let's go to Ephesians now I'm laying these scriptures down just as reference to to lay a foundation Ephesians 5 this we're going to get to a scripture in this reading here that's absolutely it's a bit shocking to me as we as we take the full impact of it in let's just begin in chapter 5: 22 and we'll work our way to the scripture I'm talking about wives submit yourselves un your own husband as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject into Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the water washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself I think this is interesting he's saying we should love our wives as our own bodies as the same body just the same equal to my body amen because that's the way it was in the beginning and that's the way it is with Christ and his bride he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones that is the scripture that I find shocking that is the scripture that that that actually takes it away from a metaphorical idea and brings it right down into this tangible presence because we're part of his body of his flesh and of his bones amen I I when when I mean I've read that for many years but in in the last few years it began to have impact on me that that he actually wants this body of Flesh to manifest himself through amen and so he says now we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church so that means we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones that to me seems pretty tangible Amen in the message Christ is the Myster God revealed he says he is the head of the church which is his body and he wants the preeminent is listen now listen close while we're going he is to be the head of the body his bride's body which is taken from him flesh and Bone like in Adam see the bride so he's taking us back and typing us all the way back to the beginning with what God is trying to do uh here what he's trying to manifest in the end time is he's trying to bring into light what he's been trying to do all along and if we go back to Genesis uh we can turn to Genesis but we're just going to uh uh uh let's turn to Genesis 5 but while you're turning there we'll re we'll just remind ourselves of the time when God is making man and he first makes man a spirit man and he he says let us make man in our image and he makes him a spirit man and then in order for that Spirit man who had control over the Earth and brother Benham said that Spirit man had control over the Earth like the Holy Ghost uh brooding over the Earth so he was in spirit form he was controlling the Earth but the Earth his subjects of his brooding could not interact with this spirit in a tangible way so he took that life and he put it in the flesh so that in the body of of Adam's flesh he could express the life that they couldn't touch before that they now could touch and interact with in a different way so the body was meant to express the life amen amen so then God finds that the man is lonely so he takes this he says not good that man shall dwell alone and brother bam said he was lonely because God was lonely so God is just manifesting what's in his mind he's working it down and everything he's doing everything that God is doing is is is telling us the mystery of his mind yeah amen and it laid in mystery form for so long until a prophet could go into the back part of God's mind and then take the works that he did and attach it to the thought of his mind and then bring a clarity through the entire Bible showing us what God was trying to manifest what he his original desire was he began to work it down and as the great sculptor began to display his Masterpiece he was showing us what his great desire was amen and so then he sees that the man is lonely amen and he and he takes from that man a a portion of the man to make a help meat for him to make the woman amen and when he makes the woman a a brother bham is very specific in the fact that she was flesh of Adam amen she was Spirit of Adam she she was uh uh she was Adam reproduced in female form amen so we find that go you know God wants to make a help me can't find a suitable help me this is in Genesis chapter 2 he tries bringing up the animals he tries everything and nothing's found suitable amen so what God does is lays Adam down and says the only suitable help meat for you is something that comes from you amen so he took portions off of Adam Amen to make the woman and then he United him back together and after United him back together he looked at all he had done and all he had made and he said behold it is very good and then what did he do he went to rest why did he go to rest because his work was done because his Masterpiece was finished his his his mystery of his mind was now on display so he went to rest but I want to look in Genesis 5 at just one scripture here because this will be uh to me this is a a really important scripture and it's worth noting Genesis 5 verse one this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day God created man and the like Ness of God made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created we going to go back over this slowly this is the book of the generations of Adam and the day God created man in the likeness of God made he him so man was made to reflect God amen amen then that reflection of God because he was originally Spirit form was placed in the flesh so that in this dimension there would be a reflection of God and then he made them male and female he created he them this is plural and blessed them and called their name Adam this is singular in the day when they were created amen and from this story I would like to propose to you that Adam lived in two bodies amen I hope you can see that in the scripture because when you look at the body of the male what when we come to Genesis chapter 5 when we come preall what would you call that body you'd call it Adam but when you come to the female what would you call that body you would call it Adam there's nothing else you could call it right because it was Adam it was Adam it it was Adam reproduced in another form amen and United back together amen it was Adam male and Adam female I hope I hope that doesn't throw anybody I I hope we can put our spiritual jackets on but what God the work that God did amen is he split Adam into two bodies and so Adam now dwelt in two bodies I know it sounds odd I mean I know it but but but it's the truth friends yes in the message Oneness brother Venom said and if you'll notice how that Eve was United with Adam she became part of him God did you notice in Genesis 1:27 he created man male and female created he them both male and female when it come to being in the spirit of feminist and masculine then God took from his side a rib did you notice the body part was a byproduct but not the spirit the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished God took from the side of Adam a rib made a woman but not the spirit the spirit was part of Adam for he was both man and woman spiritually speaking both masculine and feminis now don't you see the great picture we in flesh are different we are like a byproduct a created being by holy wedlock but in spirit we are Sons and Daughters not some other Spirit but the spirit of the Living God we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the Living God because we become Sons and Daughters not separated but the Same Spirit the same God the same person joined in wedlock to Eternal see how God planned it that we should be not a different but him not some other being of some other tribe but a real Union and offspring of the almighty done by a holy union now the body comes from mother and father but the spirit comes from God God separated himself as Adam was separated on the day of Pentecost we find the the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire separated itself and setting upon each member of that church God putting himself together why by the spirit amen by his spirit amen now coming back upon the attributes of his his sons and daughters and what was God doing he was putting himself back together on the day of Pentecost then when the group of people together what does it do it brings back the unified body of the Lord Jesus coming together amen so as Adam as as Adam was taken uh was Eve was taken from Adam she was she was she was Adam's spirit because he said he split the feminist Spirit from the masculine so that was all Adam's Spirit yeah and he took a a portion of that Spirit to feminine and placed it into another vessel amen and so now the life that was in that vessel was Adam's life yeah amen and it was called woman and before the fall before the separation they were both named Adam amen right these are things we understand amen I'm going over it slow amen for a reason because you know we get to know these things like we know them but then they have to be known amen it has to become more than knowledge because knowledge doesn't change our life amen but when it becomes a living reality to us it begins to change the way we conduct ourselves the way operate the way we view the world around us when this thing becomes a living reality to me amen it'll change my perspective on everything around me amen so we have to go go over these things and understand them and put them in the scripture and in the context of the message so that we understand the living reality that we are a part of now we can't look at this body and listen it's not that I could say this body I is is Jesus Christ because this body has to be made over amen right right but this body God redeemed and he and he sanctifies the spirit inside then fills us with his own spirit so that he can use this body to dwell in to manifest his life in this Dimension so that he can once again become tangible prise God Amen so we we know that in order for this to come to Perfection our atoms have to change absolutely and so this thing is still corrupt but even with it corrupt that the price of redemption was paid and the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost comes so that he can use a perverted body to still manifest his life all right brother uh when we when we look at Genesis 1:26 I've quoted it to you he says God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so what was the purpose of God creating man God created Man In His Image to reflect his image amen and then God took him and put him in flesh so that in the Physical Realm of this Dimension there will be a reflection of the life of God in this Dimension all right we're all on the same page I hope and then brother M goes on to say and now remember you Christians were his thoughts before there was a world and you are the manifestation of his thinking before there even was a world you were in Christ amen in God in the beginning that makes you then you see his subjects and the whole thing is God himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled hey that is an absolute that's a mouthful and it's something beyond our thinking but it's nothing but the truth amen and God the whole thing the what is the whole what is the whole mystery of God what is the whole Revelation 10:7 what's the unveiling of God all about it's about this truth amen the whole thing is God himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled see seen and so forth and that's what God is the whole thing amen oh praise God so so we see that that God wanted to materialize himself God's original plan was have an earth inhabited with sons and daughters and have Fellowship as a brother B said as a family upon the Earth that's what God want to do portion himself out into a family amen and have a whole earth inhabited with his sons and daughters and be in Fellowship all together as a family of God upon the Earth that was the original intent that's what he created man for that's why he told him to multiply and replenish to bring forth amen the god seed the race upon the Earth for God to Fellowship as a family amen and it's not if we could think of it this way I I hope I can say this right listen I get so nervous sometimes when we go to talk about supernatural things because you're trying to use human language and I don't want to put your thinking in the wrong spot or cause you to think in error because I don't even know how to explain some of these things that are realities to us but I'm depending on the spirit of God to make it real in your soul amen you Lord because it wasn't as though that God and and and and if we could just think I don't even know how to think of this right but God wanted to become tangible and he wanted to Fellowship as a family upon the Earth so it wasn't so much that God wanted to come down to fellowship with his family on the Earth but he wanted to Fellowship as a family on the earth amen so what did that mean that means if we would have come forth the right way if we would have come forth amen without the fall without the curse and we would have we would have come the right way then when I fellowship with you and you fellowship with me it'll be good God fellowshipping as his family am God fellowshipping with God why because you're an attribute of God I'm an attribute of God I'm an offspring of God you're an offspring of God I'm part of God being tangible you're part of God being tangible and and and when my hand and my hand have Fellowship together amen it's it's my it's Chad having fellowship with Chad that's God fellowshipping it's not a separate being wanting to come down and and just have no God wanted to he wanted to be in Fellowship as a family upon the Earth amen praise be to God let's go to John 14 so the the thing in all of this that we laid this Foundation I want to highlight that man was created to manifest God cuz he was made in God's image then he was given dominion over the Earth then he was put in flesh upon the earth and the whole reflection was to reflect the life of God in John 14 let's turn there John 14 verse 8 Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us Jesus saith unto him have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me Phillip he that has seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believest not that that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake so the eternal spirit of God God is the eternal spirit he cannot be seen by man that's his original form brother B tells us and in Christ came from the light which no man can approach unto and no man can see no man can behold no man has seen the father but the Son and whomsoever the son will declare him to so Philip is saying well show us the father I want to see him and and Jesus is saying Phillip don't you know me when you've seen me you've seen the father now now it's a head scratcher what you looked at when you looked at Jesus was actually the son he was the son amen but he said when you see me you see the father he was the son in a form of flesh but God in his original for form is invisible spirit that no man can see amen so what was Jesus Christ he was a reflection of his father who was made the word made material put here on Earth so that it could reflect the life of his father so that when you see the son what you really see is a reflection of the father so he was a reflection of the father in the flesh form of son and we know it's God's body it's the god that body built to dwell in but that that body was actually form of sun yeah and he says when you see me you see the the father why because it's the father that's in me manifesting out through me and when you see the manifestation of the father through these elements what you're seeing is the life of the father you're seeing his life amen you're seeing uh elements of the earth created Earth amen that's been put together to make a body but really what you're seeing is you're not seeing the body you're seeing the life behind the body as the life animates the body and that's the father amen praise God in the leoan church age brother bram's making a statement and he's talking about godhead the subject is godhead but and the Oneness of the godhead but I pulled a statement out and i' I've read it to you before but I want to pull the statement out because it it it's it's been highlighted to me in my own Spirit as I look at this he says the New Testament does not reveal another God it is a further revelation of the one and same God Christ did not come down to make himself known he did not come to reveal the son he came to reveal and make known the father he never talked about two Gods he talked about one God so brother bman this subject is talking about the Oneness of the godhead that's his subject but the the what what stood out to me is he did not come to reveal the son amen but what was being revealed was the Sun what was the manifestation son what was the body son what was what he came to be the Son of God Amen we understand that amen but the Son of God coming to Earth Jesus Christ didn't come to manifest son he came to manifest father even though he was in the form of son amen this is so important hey it's going to come right to you and I some of you already made the jump but this is absolutely pertinent to us because we're supposed to live that same life that was in Christ is supposed to be living in us that means we did not come to manifest ourselves we did not come listen we did not come to manifest bride even though we're in the manifestation of bride even though we're in a Min membered bride body our job and objective on this Earth is not to manifest bride not to manifest self but to manifest Christ amen the same thing Jesus did amen so now we want to get to the place and I pray that God by his Spirit brings us to the place where you can say Amen show me Jesus Christ and we can say have we been so long with you that you don't know us when you see me you see Christ amen not this thing right here but there's a life that's animating this be the life Behind the Veil The Veil is just what happened when my mom and dad come together and put elements together and then I ate the food of the earth and the elements of the Earth come together to make a Veil amen the veil amen is not I I'm going to say this wrong but I the veil is not God the veil is not Jesus Christ right amen the veil is the Tabernacle the temple that he's redeemed back that he's purchased so that he can clean so that he can step behind that Veil and manifest himself until where the world doesn't they see a veil they see Bride form they see a church they see a bunch of people gathered together worshiping under the the truth of the hour but what they're supposed to see what's supposed to be displayed is not the bride but the husband amen the bridegroom praise be to God he says brother bam in this message the identified Masterpiece of God said he came to reflect the father and the father was the word now I feel real religious he came to reflect the father's word God said he would be here there and there he was the perfect Masterpiece of God's Great handiwork he was the perfect reflection of him amen and if I could say this way it was the perfect reflection of him in a body of Flesh taken from the earth I could say it that way in the message things that are to be he said now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by creat s we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be the word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living so I want to know what's different between this and the manifestation through Jesus Christ because he was the fullness of the word all the attribut of God bundled up into one body of Flesh and he came to manifest the father he come to manifest the word not himself amen and now all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into his bride what is the bride what is the word bride he said what is the word bride and amen it's that portion of the word God's allowed to be manifest in this day but what is the bride supposed to manifest she's not supposed to manifest herself she's in Bride form yes many member body but she's supposed to manifest Jesus Christ his life not ours see we we we know these things this this is not I'm not bringing to you anything that's brand new this is like a review but it's a review that I hope has impact on us because we've known these things but we've taken it as concept and it's a concept and it's a beautiful concept and it's exciting and I'm thrilled to be part of it but I want to be more than a concept I want it to be more than than than than a correct teaching I wanted to come down to where this actual flesh of Mind actually becomes a manifestation a temple a vessel a a tangible part of the earth that he can get control of and manifest himself yeah not me so I stopped thinking about me remember brother brandham said if I can get William brandham out of the way he can come and do things William bram's never thought of that is what I'm longing for friends I'm longing for God to come and do something that's not my agenda my mind my idea my concept protecting myself or promoting myself or or showing myself I want to get beyond that friends I want to get to the place where I can just surrender to the spot where it's not me where I can really come to the place not because of religious terminology and say well it's not me that did it it was Christ in me that did it but where I can really get to the place where listen brother I'm as shocked as you are that that just happened do we get to the to the reality sets in not religious rhetoric but we get to the reality that says listen there was no way I and myself could have done that that wasn't me that was him when you saw that that wasn't me that was the father that was my bridegroom that was Jesus Christ and then we can be honest the other way when we blow it we can say that wasn't Jesus Christ that was me like do where we get to be real that's what we want he says in the message identification again he says then see God come down came down and the character of God was Christ he was the reflection he was God made visible notice God made visible in the beginning was God he wasn't even God then no God is an object of worship only thing he was was the Eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were expressed to words and word was made manifest what is it it's all God becoming tangible you are a part of God when God wanted to make Man In His Image he made him male and female and that expression as it came down through wound up in two bodies the man and the woman and their name was Adam reflecting what God was going to do in Redemption where he once again was going to reflect himself on Earth and a body amen and that reflection of himself was going to be in two bodies the body of his son and then from his son was going to be taken a spirit and that Spirit was going to enter into his bride body amen and it wasn't going to be a different life it was going to be his life in her amen so that now he would dwell in two bodies amen do you ever feel like it's do you ever feel like it's beyond our understanding do you ever feel like do you ever say something like that and you're like how can I say that amen happens to me all the time how can I say that but it's the truth it's it's odd to the normal run of the Gospel it's different to the way people normally talk about it but it's true to the scriptures because it was Paul who said we are his body his flesh and his bone we are one and Christ is a many membered body so it's it's Christ life in his in his body manifesting himself brother B goes on in Christ is the mystery of God revealed to tell us this but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way he could express it was to become a son of man that's the reason Jesus kept saying son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it see he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great three-fold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal hisself in Christ secondly to have preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in people now he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back again that's what God could do in Adam and Eve what what could he do he could manifest himself he could manifest himself tangible in human beings but sin separated it so he had to work a Plan of Redemption Amen to redeem it back to what his original plan was and when the the previous quote that we read he said in him was attribute and those attributes are thoughts and those thoughts are expressed to words and word was made manifest see it's all God becoming tangible and you're part of God why you're part of the word if you're part of the word you're an attribute and an attribute is part of God so when we talk about the seed that's inside of us brother BM said that was meant to be you as God would portion himself out to be a family upon the Earth so really that attribute was meant to be which brother B said is the true you is actually who where did that attribute come from it's an attribute of God Amen it's God wanting to manifest himself and display himself on the earth as a family so what right do I have to make it all about me I have an attribute I have a seed I'm a seed gen of God I'm elect that just means you're a part of God you're an attribute of God that God wants to express on this Earth that this is why brother B says you have no thought coming you have no right to your own thought you have no right to hijack this great Plan of Redemption and make it about yourself or me make it about myself because it's not my life it's not my attribute it's not my word it's not my thought it's his and he's so wonderful that he'll share his life with a family and we can become part of that expression and part of that family but it's all him it's all him it's all about him it's all him connecting dividing himself and then connecting himself back together as a family and when I realize this then I realize that that it's not about me this whole thing is not about me and when I say me I'm talking about whatever came together and made chemistry in my mom and dad and an Earthly Spirit God gave to it at Birth and I've identified that as me all of these years it has nothing to do with that it has everything to do with this life of God down on the inside and it's all about him amen and so when that when that true concept comes down then I realize I didn't do anything I didn't earn anything I I I I can't lose anything I didn't start anything I'm not going to be the one that finishes anything it's going to be his life bringing forth his word in his season according to his thinking yeah amen so now I can't if if I get the real revelation of this I can't get puffed up amen only a false revelation of this can get me thinking I'm Elite in some way but the true revelation of this will take the me that has conscious thinking the me that came from a union between Mom and Dad and that me part of that me part of me yeah not the original me part god part of me but the me part of me amen can just say oh God this is why we can feel so grateful this is why we can we can receive Grace and that we can say oh God I'm so thankful that you chose me and listen you can say God I'm so thankful you chose me and we say why me and I can't believe it's me and all of that well the Original Seed part of you doesn't think like that the Original Seed part of you was with God from before you're not so that seed's not surprised it's part of God it's redeemed it's a child of that seed is not but it's this other part of you that's looking at this great plan say God oh how can this be this is most amazing and then and then we can then we can surrender this outside part to the inside part because we realize it had nothing to do with this part of me this was the what was meant to be me which was actually God being nice enough I I hate to say it that way because that's that's bad language that's that that I don't even know that it properly expresses what God's thinking but God being nice enough to say I'm going to share my life in multiplied form amen so that I have an expression of me but that expression of me will be joy and pleasure as it expresses to one another and then we can separate what's real from what's the veil amen praise be to God now brother B tells us uh when in the when he had the experience of the Angel time to pick up his pen and write he wrote some things and it wasn't brother brandham it was his hand and it was his pen but it was another power that was writing so when we get to this section of the scripture we can't even say brother bam said yeah can't even really say brother Benham wrote although he wrote but I think that's such a clear picture of what the whole message really is the whole Bible yeah men of old as they were Anointed with the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible am so who wrote the Bible Well men of old no the Holy Ghost yes he just used the hand of men of old that were anointed of the Holy Ghost yeah oh if this could become our reality if this could become what's true to us and if it could become the manifestation of Our Lives God will finally be accomplishing what he set out to accomplish remember God's three-fold plan God had brother B tells us that this is a Christ of the mystery of God revealed God had one goal one thing he wanted to achieve in all the Bible and all the characters of The Bible and all the stories are declaring that one goal that God had and then he comes and tells us and it comes in a three-fold manner so one goal one ambition one desire everything he's been doing has to do with this one goal and in the three-fold plan the first part of it is get preeminence in a man because he was started with Adam remember amen but Adam he lost the preeminence when Adam left the word yeah so then he'd been working back through his Masterpiece and he finally gets the preeminence back in a man when he creates his own body and he lives in it as son of man Jesus Christ and he finished that part in Jesus Christ and the second part is to have preeminence in a people in a body amen and brother R said and he's doing that now right when brother R say he's doing that now I say Amen he's doing that now right I I may be a long ways from where I ought to be but the prophet said he's doing that now and this is doing that now in me right and so but that plan now is to get preeminence in a man then to get preeminence in a body upon the Earth of people which would be bridegroom and bride male and female and restore back lost Eden amen so the whole Bible has been godone working this plan so what does God want God wants to have preeminence in a body yeah the Son and the son's wife the singular body in the many membered body Al together to make up the body and and you think what is a body a body is a dwelling place for a life so that it can be expressed in this earth amen I hope that makes sense you have a life inside of you and that life is more than your body because when that life leaves the body we can still touch your body we can see your body your body can be moved you you you have a recognition your face stays the same your body can remain after the spirit in you leaves amen but then it's not animated it's not doing anything it's just laying there lifeless amen so what was the body for the purpose of the body was to manifest the life that was on the inside amen that's why he has to get preeminence because preeminence means he has full control when he has full control he can manifest through the body the life that's behind the body but when he doesn't have full control the manifestation is not pure because it's mixed our life mixed in with his life and all of a sudden we begin to display something other than the word amen that's why he must get preeminence in a body of Believers again so that it can be just his life so that we can get to the place where just like Jesus was when Philip asked him show us the father amen where we get to that that place and listen friends we may never get to the place where we just run around and say that I don't I don't I don't mean we should get to the place where we say hey here it is you've been missing it all your life but to where that reality is still a reality in our lives even if it's not said right amen amen so he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them and when he comes to pick up your pen and write he says the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God but she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to die so we go all the way back to Genesis where we were God made man the reason he made man he made man in his own image and now this man was controlling the Earth but he was in the image of God so he's reflecting back to the Earth the life of God they put him in flesh so that those that he were ruling over could see who was ruling them that's what brother tells us amen but then he realizes that he's lonely he's not supposed to be alone and then he makes help me so he takes his life and he makes another body for the life that's in Adam and now Adam is split between two bodies come back to one to be one flesh and two forms one flesh but the reason that the woman was even created and given to Adam was to reproduce Adam amen not to reproduce herself her whole purpose her whole purpose was to express Adam's life and and God for whatever I don't want to say for whatever reason I I don't I don't know why but I just feel like when we get into some of these Mysteries I want to be careful with my language am but God for a reason that was in his mind for a reason of of depiction God would not let Adam reproduce himself by himself he was going he was going to create a mechanism where there had to be another part of Adam and two coming together would be a reproduction of Adam again so Adam could be reproduced because God is trying to show what his great plan is amen so that has everything to do now you want to know what the bride's purpose is we can go back to the beginning and find out what the first bride's purpose is so that means the bride in this day she is not here Amen to declare herself amen she is not here to promote herself she's not here for herself she is a vessel that has been placed here to reproduce her husband Amen to reflect him him on the Earth again so what caused Eve to fall is when when a Temptation come along and caused Eve to use her own reasoning her own ideas and her own lust to do something her own way for her own Reason by her own intellect amen that's not preeminence yeah right that's her injecting herself into the equation and she wasn't supposed to inject herself she was supposed to surrender herself and she was supposed to reflect or reproduce the life of Adam upon the Earth again and so when she began to by the Temptation of the serpent in the in the garden she began to reason she began to deduce she began to have desires and now these were her desires and we know it was based on a truth she wanted to to keep the word of God but she started wanting it her for herself she wanted to do something her way for herself amen something she could do or something she could accomplish and that Temptation for her Amen to to to do something of her own mind of her own way of her own thinking of reasoning is what caused the fall amen same thing that caused the fall in every Church age right he goes on and and pick up your pen and right he said the second son Jesus also a spoken seed word of God was given a bride like as was Adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like Adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of God and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with the Beloved bride she is Virgin of his word she is Virgin because she knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin The Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but the Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest amen so I ask you Luke Chapter 2 is it about Mary or is it about Jesus amen amen yeah it's not about Mary it was never supposed to be about Mary he said a virgin shall conceive and and a son will be given and and it's all about God God see God keeps working his plan the same way he keep what he started with is what he he keeps showing us something every time so when it came time for him to get preeminence in a man and represent himself on Earth and a body of Flesh so that we could see a perfect reflection of the father he came and he didn't just gather up molecules and dust and everything and pack it together and say this is it but no he came and formed it in the womb of a woman so now he needed another vessel and that other vessel was going to produce himself on the earth amen because it was part of the promised word so then I I I ask you this question what did Mary do to reproduce Christ on the earth amen what works did she do what part of the Bible did she study what what effort did she listen she she had I don't want to say she had nothing to do with it she did have something to do with it and we'll get to that in a minute but but when when the fall in the beginning happened it was because that vessel that was meant to help reproduce Adam upon the Earth that vessel started wanting to get ahead of God's program and figure out a way and find a way and take their own idea and do something and then she was trying listen the eve wasn't dirty and bad and wicked Eve was trying to accomplish the plan of God Eve was trying to do the works of God but she she I don't know if she got nervous I don't know if she was worried about the time element I don't know if she just got overly eager I don't know what the motivation was behind it but she was tempted and tempted by her own lust and she decid or she was trapped and tricked into the in the in in the thinking that she had to do something and if she would do something it would further the plan of God and in her doing something to help the plan of God she ruined the plan of God yes because God didn't need her to do anything he just needed her vessel amen now when he comes to the Virgin Mary amen what's he going to do he's going to reproduce himself upon the Earth Amen in a son that's going to be a perfect reflection of his life and what does he need he needs a vessel but he doesn't need a vessel with an idea he doesn't need a vessel with a Works program he doesn't need a vessel amen that thinks she's something special right so what he does is he sends the angel Gabriel to a little virgin from an outway Place who's nobody amen and what does he do he tells her hey thou are highly favored well hey that was a shock to her I mean she probably figured her family likes her and Joseph likes her but she didn't know she was highly favored in heaven right and she was a chosen vessel and all of these things that was a shock to her she hadn't earned her way to it worked her way up to it become super good that she could be part of it she was part of the predestinated plan of God and what he needed was a vessel that would stay out of his way and believe his word amen all he needed there was only one thing God needed from Mary only one thing he needed her to accept his word to her and surrender her her life and let the word do the work inside of her amen that's all he needed he didn't need he didn't need her to go on a preaching campaign he didn't need all he needed was a vessel that he had chosen amen not to hinder what he was going to do because there was nothing that Mary could do but nothing would have happened if Mary didn't accept his word to her so what did he need from Mary he needed Faith he needed somebody who would believe the message of the Angel and Mary believed then he needed somebody that would just surrender and that's what he got she said be it unto me according to Thy word not my thinking not my idea not how I thought this was going to come to pass right amen but be it unto me according to Thy word yeah and when he got a vessel that would believe the Angel's message which was the word of God and would surrender herself to that message without injecting her own thinking then he had a vessel that he could use to reproduce himself on the earth do we get the picture amen so in pick up your pen and write the angel of the Lord guides his hand to write that through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the virgin what was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin it would be the manifestation of the son who is a reflection of the father amen praise God Amen he says the Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but the Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest want to ask you a question has the Word of Promise come to us through an angel like visitation in this thing what is that Word of Promise That Word of Promise is himself to be made manifest what does he need us to do friends what does he need you and I to do he needs us to say I believe that's the truth amen not that we don't ever ask any questions Mary said how can this be seeing I know not a man like I don't understand how you could do this I don't understand how it can be me and then the answer he gave her was quite simple he said the Holy Ghost will overshadow you well that I mean that doesn't really explain how she's going to conceive knowing no man but he said it's not going to be your power it's not going to be any Man's power it's going to be my power for how is this going to be done the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you and the thing that's formed in you shall be called the son of the most high and then she just said be it unto me according to your word she yielded her life she yielded her body she yielded herself and the power of God under the anointing of the Holy Ghost took over and formed inside of her a life and she gave herself over to that life and that life began to take control of her life began to grow within her and began to demand certain Cravings certain foods it began to take up all of her territory amen amen begin to change the way she walks the way she talks the way she thinks amen everything began to change because of the life that was growing inside of her and she had no power to make it happen she had no power to reproduce it she had no power in herself all that she had was a seed Gene of faith that could say be it unto me that's the truth I accept it now be it unto me and when she stayed out of God's way but believed God's word and surrendered herself to it God came down by the Holy Ghost and did everything that needed to be done to reproduce a son on the Earth you know when she accepted the word to her when she accepted the word to her from that moment on brother B said she began to testify of what happened before she felt one thing so her faith wasn't based off her feelings or what she felt changed but it was faith based off the word of God solidly based off what an angel told her and she just accepted it all that would do us a world of good friends amen because we've accepted this message but so many times we start looking in the mirror looking at capabilities or or incapabilities or faults or failures and we start thinking Well it can't be me for this reason it can't be me for this reason and I don't really see any great changes in my life yet I still kind of have some of the old Cravings I had and I I still struggling with some of the thoughts I struggled with oh my goodness I wish I could get to that place where Mary was where I could run and say listen to what the angel said about me this I'm part of that word and it's going to be in me and I'm part of the end time plan and God's going to reproduce himself in me amen and no matter how many people look at us Crossways and said God's going to manifest self in you I know you I know what you're like I know what you're doing and I know what you said five minutes ago amen but none of that matters because he's not depending on me doing anything he's depending on me not doing anything he's depending on me getting out of his way he's depending on me just accepting and when when Elizabeth began to prophesy amen she she when when when when Mary goes to Elizabeth and begins to announce unto her what happened amen the life that was laying dead in the womb of Elizabeth sprung to life which was John the Baptist amen by the Holy Ghost amen at her salutation and then Elizabeth began to prophesy and her prophecy under her says all of these things will come to pass because you believed because not because you did anything but because you believed how is it that this bride is going to reproduce Jesus Christ on the earth not because you did anything not because you prayed harder fasted harder studied more no it's going to happen because you believed and surrendered to it and it doesn't matter for her the changes weren't immin immediate the changes weren't felt instantly amen but the faith that she had in that message told her that it was going to happen exactly the way he was going to he said it was going to happen amen and I friends I'm here to declare that that I believe with all my heart that Jesus Christ wants to reproduce himself on the earth and manifest himself through you and I amen and I I there's not a thing in this world I can do to make it happen and of all of our attempts to make it happen have been disastrous that's right what I need to do is have confidence in the message he gave me to believe that message of the angel the angel that he sent in this end time that angel of the Lord came in this day the seventh angel Amen to call out a bride to tell her you're the bride you're the one Now's the Time the prophecies to be fulfilled at you and all that he needs from us is somebody that can say I believe it and I surrendered to it that's it listen we don't know there's a lot we don't know you know I told you before I have a pile of questions I don't know if I go to the Millennium with the same kind of mind I have now which probably won't happen but if I do I'm just going to go around asking people questions all the time Moses when you did this what were you thinking we don't know if she had morning sickness we don't know if she threw up we don't know if she felt great we don't know if she had odd Cravings we don't know if it became difficult for Joseph def find what she wanted to eat that day I mean didn't brother Brenham showed us that Elijah was a man of like passions as we that life is life and normal is normal we don't know what persecution she got brother R told us she was she was mocked and persecuted and accused of having a relationship with a Roman soldier yeah right you know it wasn't easy it wasn't meet an name Ang believ the message run off and everything was great yeah we don't know what family members rejected her we don't know how she felt we don't know if she became uncomfortable we don't know if the last few weeks of her pregnancy she could barely breathe we don't know if she had to lay in a certain position or we don't know what it was like we don't know the whisperings that went on behind her back when she walked to the market we don't know whether she was sick or not we don't know any of that but we can only imagine we know she suffered persecution but the only thing that could get her through the difficult times was the Angel's message and the life inside of her she knew it it may not have been always easy it may not have been convenient it doesn't mean there was no trials it doesn't doesn't mean there wasn't hardship attached to it doesn't mean there wasn't difficulty but she had two things she had the Angel's message and she had the life inside of her amen friends can we walk with confidence through difficult times because of the Angel's message and the life inside of us the life that's growing in us and taking over our life can we can we just hang on to the Angel's message and knowing what happened inside of us and face down whatever persecution or difficulty or hard circumstances that come along because we know what we heard and we know it was true and we know what resonated inside and we know what's growing inside of us and then have confidence in it brother bam goes on and he begins to say begins to write and pick up your pen and write many things but he comes down to the end he says those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride where is he's going to do his work through US how's he going to do it not by our strength and not by our effort or intelligence he's going to complete this work himself she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he would now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time so now there's a work that needs to be accomplished in this hour that we live in but I want to say like this it's not our work it's his work but he's going to do his work in his bride body which we're a part of so are we a part of that work yes but I'm not the one working he's the one working I'm just the one yielding and sir we would see Jesus brother says well that's the same thing the great Holy Spirit Messiah the anointing comes upon us today and it produces exactly his life just the same as Beethoven would produce Beethoven again if the life of Beethoven lived in me why why I could compose songs if the life of John Diller lived in me I would be a criminal if the life of some other person whatever it was that would be in me in my life and if the life of Jesus Christ is in you that's just what you'll be see that's exactly you'll do his Works Jesus said so so what do I need to accomplish this work I need his life in me amen I I just need his life in me he says in they identify Christ of all ages that so he gets the eternal spirit his attribute displayed in that body then like any picture in its negative form it goes into the dark room there it's developed it comes out to the perfect picture and we go in the dark room but to come out after the negative has been perfect a perfect picture in the image of Christ we go into the dark grave into the dark room for developing it takes death to develop it and so he's showing us that there's going to this this Earthly vessel is a negative form of what God had in his mind but death will bring us at some point Amen to the perfect picture of what he had and the the Dark Room of death brings development now I know I'm dealing with some of you who have never seen negative film before I don't even know how to explain this friends long long ago we used to take pictures and there was actual film there was nothing digital and when you open the shutter certain light came in and Light impacted a chemical on a on a film and it and it left an imprint or a picture but that picture was in negative form so there's a positive picture that's taken from there's a real image then you get a negative picture then you go through the dark room and you you you lay this in trays of chemicals and it begins to develop and all of a sudden you can see the image and you get a reflection of that image so the original image is in the mind of God but then he's going to give us a body that's a perfect reflection of that image but doing so he brings us here in this body which is negative form and we go through the dark room process amen till we come into the development and we come into the picture of what was in his mind the mind is the real yeah amen the picture is the reflection yeah so brother bam tells us that's going to happen to us but then he brings it down to today and he doesn't just leave it as something that's going to happen that's for this outside body but now he says just like it takes death to yourself to develop the picture of the image of Christ The Life of Christ in you amen you have to dump your own out so that Christ can come in you have to die to yourself just like death will eventually bring us to a new body which is the the the the the developed picture but now to develop the picture that God had in his mind of us being a many-membered body of Jesus Christ reflecting the very life of Jesus Christ to this world in order for us to do that we have to go through a dark room process process in this life and that dark room process is death to ourselves to where we can lay our life down so that he can have preeminence and then when we die to ourselves then he can through the process of our death he can bring out the picture and what is the picture supposed to be Jesus Christ Jesus Christ only now instead of the the One Singular vessel 2,000 years ago now it's in a many-membered body but it's the picture of Jesus Christ that's what's supposed to be developed he goes on in the same quote he says so does your physical being die to be formed and molded into the image of him but there is still that attribute that cannot be destroyed it can never be destroyed it's God in the beginning it's God above us God With Us God in us and it's all the attributes of God eternal life to the sons of men God wants to develop the picture but in order for to develop it we've got to go through the dark room process of death and surrender I know that's what all of us want because we keep coming back we keep coming back to hear more but there's areas in our life that will die and then we realize something's still alive and that needs it's a process of this dark room God's taking us to so that we can become a clearer and clearer reflection as we go through the dark room process now listen I've never I've been in a dark room once and it was a field trip when I was a kid and so I don't really know how it works that's what I'm I'm just prefacing I'm no expert but as you go through the process more of the image comes out in each tray there's several trays and through this process of life we should be looking more like Christ and more like Christ and more like Christ we may be in first tray we may be in second tray I don't know how many trays there are and we can get discouraged about the tray we're in But realize friends we're in the process amen even even Mary reproducing Christ a body for God to dwell in was a process of 10 months yeah this us amen reproducing Christ is a process and I don't know how long the process will take but listen we have to believe we're in the process we've got to stop thinking I'm not in the process I don't know if I'm in the process maybe I'm in the process I'm not in the process I used to be in the process now I'm not in the process that kind of thinking is never going to produce anything there's got to be something that strikes our heart and puts a stake down and says I'm not going to let the devil take away what the angel told me and what happened inside of me I may not be to the end of the process and the image you got now might just be a little awkward looking outline of something I can kind of tell I I'm not as I'm not what I used to be I'm not what I ought to be amen but I'm right here I'm not happy with what I am because I know what the picture should be I'm not happy with this stage but friends let's get excited that we're in the process that we're in the dark room that there's something happening to us that's bigger than us it's beyond us it's his work amen and listen it's never the picture that's doing anything to itself it's always it's always the artist that's behind it that is taking it through the developing process you're not dipping yourself in a tray you didn't take the picture you didn't come up with the image you didn't have a desire to reproduce on the earth that was not you that was him and he's the one moving you from tray to tray amen I I want to be thankful that I'm in the dark room I want to be thankful I heard the Angel's message I want to be thankful there was something in me that said it's truth I just want to be thankful and believe that that is enough that that is enough that's all I need because if that life came in me then that life in me will do the same thing the Holy Ghost did in Mary and It produced amen the Son of God again and it come through the process and manifest upon the Earth and I believe that this Angel's message coming to him elect predestinated seed who has something inside of them that say be it unto me according to your word amen is just as much in the same place as the Virgin was with the same promise for us and we got to just rest friends the whole Christian walk is based on rest and brother B said I know a Christian's always tore up wanting to know that he's in the will of God absolutely we want to make sure that we're doing what God wants we're lined up to the word but when it comes to whether or not I can reproduce anything let's just rest because the truth is I can't reproduce anything amen I'm wrestling with my surrender not wrestling with my Works amen I hope that makes sense amen I'm not wrestling to produce something I'm wrestling to get this flesh out of his way so he can produce something I'm wrestling this mind and this these lust and these desires and these thoughts I'm wrestling them into subjection to the word so that they can stay dead and out of the way amen so that he can do what he wants to do praise God am he says in the and Christ is the mystery of God revealed this quotes become so precious to me he said it's not expressions in some church that we should Express something it's a life that you don't live yourself but he comes in you and lives by himself and you become a prisoner to any human intellectual being at all you're led by the SP spirit and how do you know praise be to God it's I want to read that again it's a life that you don't live yourself praise God it's a life that you don't live yourself remember brother bom said if I had the life of Beethoven in me I would write music well if you had the life of Beethoven in you you wouldn't strain to write music you would just write music you wouldn't have to put forth effort or strength you wouldn't have to you you understand amen and he also said that the life of John dilig was in you'd be a criminal and you wouldn't have to put any effort towards it I mean how to rob a bank or how to rob a train would just drop in your mind you would get the inspiration CU it's not your life it's another life amen this isn't a life that we live ourselves Eve was never intended to reproduce her own life yeah amen she was intended to reproduce her husband's life yeah she was there to receive his life and yield herself so that his life could come through her vessel to reproduce himself on the earth amen we're not here to live our own life we're not here to try to live the life of Christ I hope that doesn't stumble you but you're not here to try to live the life of Christ because if you try then you're a human being tried in living a supernatural life because it's not a life that you live yourself it's a life he comes in in life he lives himself that's the only thing that'll work if we try it won't work because we can't do it but if we just believe and surrender then if that life is in us it will do it amen and I know how discouraging it is to live a human life I know how discouraging it is to still have a cck bur nature I know how discouraging it to still realize there's a black dog super discouraging but don't let the discouragement of being in a perverted form and living in a natural life don't let that Rob the truth out of our hearts because if it does we lose all hope we lose all faith we lose our rest yeah amen amen in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 let's turn here together I just referenced this but I would like to read it together 2 Corinthians chapter 10 yeah 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse three says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations in every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ what is this friends this is our wrestling match this is where we wrestle with our surrender to bring every thought says every I I'll read this again uh casting down imagin ations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ Our wrestling is to not allow the whisperings of the enemy in our own nature to take the leadership yeah amen but to let the word always have leadership Amen to let the headship of Christ the anointed word always be in leadership and know other thoughts so now we must capture every thought that comes into our mind and bring it captive arrest it and bring it obedience to Christ which Christ is the anointed word and so now what are we here to do we're here because the greatest battle ever fought is fought where in the mind and we're here to take these these thoughts Amen brother B said he can't he can't read your thoughts but he can put thoughts in your mind the enemy right amen and we're here to to take all these imaginations and cast them down anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God even the wrong ideas the devil gives you about yourself you've got to cast it down because what the word says is what's true amen because when we start to entertain negative thoughts about oursel that's contrary to the word amen L we're going to wind up defeated all over again because it's not the word that vain imagination is contrary to the knowledge of God and it must be cast down amen amen because if we receive the Angel's message and we receive the life in us then the things the devil's telling us about ourselves is not the truth amen and then every other thought we bring it captive in obedience to the word of God so that the word of God has what preeminence what is it he's looking for in the second fold of the threefold purpose preeminence how is he going to get preeminence when his word has preeminence what's the headship the headship is the word which is Christ is going to have preeminence in the body amen as we as we capture all of these thoughts and bring him subject to the word if Eve would have done that in the beginning there wouldn't have been a fall amen if she would have just took the thoughts that the the devil was putting in her mind and lined it up with the word amen she would and and how was he deceiving her he was deceiving her by the word multiply and replenish and started telling her well this is how you have to do it and this is how you do it the problem is listen here's the deal God had never never yet told her how to do it he only said that you will do it amen and now she was supposing maybe we're going to figure it out on our own yeah yeah amen what was her job her job was to believe the word to believe the promise and wait for God to give further instructions yeah amen amen Hey listen we've got Bridges to cross we've got things to manifest there's things that the prophet said was going to happen in the end time and and I don't I I don't even presume to understand what they are be able to lay them out I just know things that said statements that he made and the question is how are we going to produce that and how are we going to produce this I have no idea my job is not to produce anything my job is to believe that it will happen exactly the way the prophet said happen and wait for further instructions amen cuz if Eve would have waited for further instructions she would have brought forth Christ brother renam said amen so we don't have to feel insecure that I have to have all the answers Eve didn't need all the answers that's an insecurity in ity that we have to figure everything out and when somebody says well what did Brother BR mean by this and all of a sudden we have to come up with an answer that sounds good listen sometimes it's better to say I don't know what he meant I don't know how it'll happen but I believe it and I'm waiting for further instructions I'm waiting for a revelation from God I can't inject my own thinking and make it happen brother B said and it is the message it is the rising of the Sun so no wonder he said fear not for now notice we are Redeemed by him and now risen with him that's what Easter means to the people risen with him notice now we have his spirit in us the abstract deed fully paid no you don't say well I hope I make it you've already made it amen you know how foolish it would have been for Eve to say or for Mary to say I hope I deliver this baby do you know what I mean I hope that it's a healthy baby I hope that I have a full pregnancy I hope that there's no complications I hope that the baby's born and alive do you understand do you know no matter what thought entered her mind she should never entertained any of those because she already had a promise you're Pro a promise that there's going to be a life that comes that's a which is God With Us amen for her to doubt that no matter how logical it is yeah no matter how logical that thought would be maybe she didn't feel the baby move for two days and the devil began to whisper in her mind no matter how logical the thought would be amen she's to cast down all reasoning how foolish it would believe that God would send a messenger to tell her who she is to bring a life inside of her to begin to Quicken a life and bring a life inside of her just to wonder and worry if he was going to be able ble to bring a birth and bring a life and fulfill the promise but that's exactly what happens to you and I am me we've got to go back to the original Faith amen that original thing that sparked inside of us and say I don't know how I don't know when amen but everything he promised to me is going to be manifest and everything he's promised to do he's going to do and then when he needs to use me to do the supernatural he's going to do the supernatural praise God you don't I'll read that again you don't say I hope I'll make it you've already made it and then listen next statement not I will make it I've already made it amen listen to the next statement I never made it he made it for me the works were finished before the foundation of the world everything that he wants to do through your body of Flesh was finished before the foundation of the world what does he need us to do maybe to not worry about it maybe to not stress about it but maybe just to believe Amen to rest brother the whole Christian Life is based on rest do I struggle yes but I don't struggle whether or not I'm one of them I don't struggle whether or not he's going to produce his word I struggle on all these thoughts going through my mind and all these Desires in my flesh that's where my wrestling match is yeah amen but whether or not I'm one of them I settled that long ago whether or not he's going to produce what he promised to produce he promised it he'll produce it that I'm not struggling with he made it for me not me him well brother said I don't care what they say here he made it for me that's all I want that's all I'm caring about I just want to I just want to see him manifested how can you do it call him down no he's in you amen see he he's in you well then Lord if I can get myself out of the way you can manifest see how can you do it because you ordained it so all that the father has given me will come Glory Amen in in the book of Zechariah there was prophecy to zerubabel and it says he says this not by might nor by power but by my S Spirit sayeth the Lord What Spirit have we received What Spirit has come on this message what what has God returned to us he's returned his very life to us and if the life of Beethoven's in you what are you going to do compose songs now hey the life of Beethoven may come into you and it may it may take you a little while to get into the Rhythm you may still be trying with your own life to write a song and it's going to be pretty messy when you can finally figure out what's going on and get out of the way and let what's inside just flow you'll write a nice song it's taking us a long time to figure out what's going on Amen it's taken us a long time just to realize he's not asking me to do anything he's asking me to surrender he's asking me to yield he's asking me to believe when it says when the son of man cometh will he find good works on the earth when a son of man cometh will he find a church in perfect order that wasn't the question when the son of man cometh will he find Faith amen all he needs to move his program forward is somebody that believes his word and will surrender themselves to his life so that the Life of Christ can come through Romans 8:11 says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by a spirit that dwelleth in you if you look at the context of that scripture and the way brother brandham used it is not just speaking of quickening after death are quickening in the Rapture he's actually talking of making this body live that word he will Quicken these mortal bodies who will do it when you try a little harder brother when you just knock it off and try a little harder and quit fooling around no if the same spirit that raised him from the dead dwell on you it'll Quicken this body to the word amen not my life his life it's not a life I live myself it's a life he comes in and lives his son what does he need he just needs room to work just needs room to work friends brother B made the statement he said I don't remember what message I was just reading it he said God can only use what portion you surrender to him right he was in reference to Samson he said Samson gave his strength to God but he gave his heart to the Lila and God could use his strength but what God wanted was his heart he wanted all of Samson God will use God's a gentleman he doesn't take God Only Takes what's surrendered and God can use anything that you surrender to him so I say oh God help us to surrender everything to him Amen brother B says this is a dying spirit and a dying body now you can't be in two bodies at one time but there can be two Natures in you at one time now the nature of the spirit of the Lord when you're born again you're not born a physical like the baby was but what's happened is the spiritual Birth has come to you he brother B says that there can be two Natures you still have your own nature but you have the nature of God because you've been born again by the spirit of God and he told us we' we've read this before but the white dog and black dog it depends on which one you cater to which one has strength and I want him to have room to work inside of me so I want the other one to stay dead and stay surrendered I want it to be his life in me in the patas vision from the church age book prophet of God makes this statement he says have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world he's going to begin to talk about ball games and all that and he's going to talk about getting in the spirit but but before that you if we just think about like he said you you can't be in two bodies at once but there can be two Natures in you at once if you think about your own physical body you have a body and that body is there to manifest the life inside of you and there's a life living inside that's animating the body you're moving according to the life that's on the inside the spirit that's on the inside but there are sometimes other lives come into our body have you ever experienced that has anybody had the flu another life came into your body yeah and began to manifest itself and certain parts of your body you lost control of did things you didn't want to do amen I won't be any more descriptive than that why because another life was using your body for expression yeah another life needed a body to manifest itself whether it was germ life or it was cancer and a cancer begin to grow and begin to rob from your life and your bloodstream and it begin to affect you and you get weak and you start to lose control of certain parts of your body what did that it was another life using your body for manifestation so to me what is the battle over the battle in me is over expression which life is going to be expressed cuz there's a war there's a battle over expression God created man in his own image because he wanted to be a reflection on the earth of God he he was in his image he was going to reflect God but what was Satan try to do Satan tried to find a way to inject himself into the same vessels amen so that he could express his life from the very day one from the very beginning the battle has been over which life is going to be expressed in these Tabernacles amen amen so we understand this that another Spirit can come and that spirit will manifest its own life whether it's flu whether it's pneumonia amen whether it's cancer whatever it is that Spirit or even demon possession it would begin to manifest itself amen so there can be another life come in to manifest itself yeah well the body of Christ amen doesn't need any other life manifesting itself what it needs is just the Life of Christ manifesting so everything else has to go we only want one life I don't want my personal life manifesting I want his life manifesting and what's the battle over expression there's life there's Spirits friends there's Spirits all around that want to be expressed and the spirits will come and influence your human spirit and your own nature and what is that spirit that Spirit needs to have a vessel for expression remember when God came to Legion amen uh at the Sea of ganar and and there was a legion of demons for their many and he cast them out and he said don't send us to the abyss but send us into the swine why those Spirits needed a body to manifest themselves and all the spirits that are around us not just sickness but lust Spirits demon spirits of every kind what does it need it needs a body to express its life through and it's trying to take the same place that Christ has taken cuz that's what happened in the Garden of Eden and I don't want this vessel to manifest another life another Spirit anything but the spirit of my bridegroom amen amen have I failed I failed friends I I've I've been seduced by Spirits I thought they were right I've done things I shouldn't have done and I'm regret and I'm embarrassed of but I'm still casting down every reasoning every thought every thought that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought into The Obedience of Christ I may have failed yesterday but that doesn't mean I've got to fail tomorrow mean I'm not moving from one trade to the next cuz he's going to develop this picture amen praise be to God so because of that concept we've got to be wary of what Spirits we allow to use this vessel yeah because remember this is the only place Christ is going to be manifest on this Earth in his predestinated vessels so where is it the devil wants manifestation same spot and then brother man begins to tell us about being in the spirit because I want that Spirit to fully possess me he says have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ball games they sporting events and their dances they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like a Wallflower old dried up sticks they enter right into the feeling of things and become a part of things but oh how they hate the Christians for getting into the spirit of God's word they call us Fanatics and holy rollers there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that you can expect it knowing where it come from just go on and get in the spirit of worship remember starts to tell us and he has different places that he describes this but he says you know how they go to a ball game and and the ball game is no fun unless you get in the spirit of the game you can be the guy sitting there trying to read a newspaper and then you know everybody else and they look at you like you're the odd duck and what's wrong with you this is why I don't get invited over to watch football games nobody invites me over because they'll be watching the game I'll be like what's happening and I don't I mean I used to be way into it but that's completely gone out of my heart and my mind now and they'll be like this player this and he did this and he's drafted from this and he's going there and for me there's just an absolute I don't care amen not that you're evil if you care I'm not saying that but I'm no fun at a ball game cuz I'm not going to get into the spirit of it amen but if you're going to get into the spirit of it you've got to enter in yeah you've got to know who's playing on the field yeah amen like you can't enter in unless you know what's going on unless you you you've been involved unless you entered into what's happening and you know the rules of the game and you know you know the odds are the favors this and this and blah blah blah and this is an old rivalry that goes like 30 years and when you get into it it gets more exciting and more exciting and more exciting then all of a sudden you can have grown men amen they see a man men carry a piece of leather with air in it across the line and grown men jump up in their plate of nachos and chips and everything goes flying all over the place I mean that doesn't happen every time you sit down to dinner you don't just jump up and throw your food everywhere what happened they got into the spirit amen and that Spirit took control yeah and began to express itself through their vocal cords and through their body if that can happen at a ball game can it happen about the word of God can we get so in the spirit can we get so engrossed in what God's done in this age that we read about it we study about it we talk about it we Fellowship about it we go to church we sing songs about it we worship about it until somebody will come to the pull pit and read a scripture and read a quote and say a statement and you'll jump out of your seat and say amen that's nothing but the truth if you had nachos and hot dogs in your lap guess where they would be amen because we've got to get into the spirit to let the spirit take control and let the spirit have expression and move every other Spirit out of the way I want to become a fanatic for one thing and that's for my bridegroom for this message of the hour which is the anointed word which is Christ himself coming to manifest what was the Word of Promise to Mary it was he himself coming to manifest himself what is this message friends it is he himself coming to manifest himself in the Virgin bride amen and it's not about me it's about him it's not my life it's his life it's not what I do it's what he's already done I want to get into the spirit of it I want to get excited when I hear preaching I want to get enthralled every time every time friends I open up a new message book every time I open up a book I'm excited on the inside because I don't know what God's going to show me this time around yes when I read my Bible there's anticipation when I come to church I want there to be that same anticipation I want to get into the spirit of his Spirit as his spirit's moving and I want to be so in the spirit that the spirit has so much of me that is just manifesting itself all the time Galatians 5:116 says I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen are you struggling with lust of the flesh are you struggling with things that you can't overcome here's the secret yes amen because you can try a little harder and come back to me in a week and give me a report on that how that worked but really if you can ignore that life that's trying to control your flesh and focus on the life that can give you Deliverance amen and get in the spirit and walk walk in the spirit means to Fashion your life over or move your whole being and this manner if you walk in the spirit of the message and become totally engrossed in the message I promise you those things will go away amen right amen amen how do you know they'll go away listen when you watch the ball game everything else goes away yeah your worries even sometimes your symptoms you had a bad headache but now there's no headache no more why when we focus on the spirit of God the life of God can overcome every obstacle in our life and begin to manifest its own life in US amen what's the key for overcoming lust walk in the spirit what's the key for everything walk in the spirit become absolutely enthralled dive into the message with all your heart read it pray ask God to give you Revelation upon Revelation and that the Revelation would thrill your heart talk about it sing about it Fellowship about it read about it listen and you'll you'll notice things will start to just move out of the picture the message Christ is Myster of God revealed again he says oh if God can get him prisoners like that now that's when he can express the preeminence you see he's got the man or the person that he knows nothing but Christ you get what I mean that's secondly first to express himself completely God in Christ second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them fellowshipped with them and now sin and death had separated them from this presence in his entire expression but God is bringing us right back to it friends what is Christ need in this day he needs a body what did Adam need he needed another body to what reproduce himself in the days of the Virgin birth what did God need he needed a body and today to reproduce the Son of God to reproduce Christ on Earth what does he need he needs a body and I want him to have mine and I want to be part of that body and I want it to be his life living through me let's turn to Philippians 1 this is the last scripture we'll read together Philippians 1 Philippians chapter 1 verse 20 says according to my Earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death what was his greatest hope that whether he was going to be executed or whether he would remain a little longer because that's what he's talking about whether he'd go on or whether he'd remain that either way his great desire is that Christ should be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for me to live is Christ and to die is gain verse 21 I want to become my verse I want it to be for me to live is Christ if I remain in this earth and I remain on I don't want it to be my life remaining I want it to be Christ so for me to live I want Christ to be magnified in me and for me to live I want it to be Christ and if I die it's gain but if I live I want it to be Christ Living in me Amen brother brenon made this statement this the last thing I want to share with you in the message Paradox so the thing of it is he done it because because he could go in the name of the Lord God only needs one man in his hand he can do the rest of it talking about Moses talking about other great great what we call Heroes of the Bible said God only needs one man in his hand and when he says one man in his hand he's talking about a man that he has complete control of and he preaches about this and and Paul a prisoner Paul was bound by chains of love to Christ he had surrendered everything and given everything up and counted it all his dung that he might win Christ and he was in the hand of God and God could turn him any way he wanted amen Moses after all his beatings and all his sufferings he came into God's hand amen and all God needs is one man in his hand he can do the rest Amen brother said he went down and took over the whole nation with a stick in his hand that wasn't Moses that was Christ in Moses because after all his failures and his beatdowns and there was a meeting at the with a pillar of fire at the burning bush that told him who he was and what was going to happen and if he just held on to that God would finish the work and he finally got Moses in his hand man we may have been around this message all of our Lives we may have heard about it known about it we may have been in and out and up and down and right but I want to be found in his hand I think it's time to get in his hand amen amen I think it's time to stop with our own agenda our own ideas our own wishes our own plans our own whatever I think it's time to stop with that and just get in his hand and he can do the rest I believe Mighty things are coming amen but I do not believe Mighty things and manifestations are coming unless we're completely surrendered to Christ and we get over ourselves and stop injecting ourselves and stop wanting to be important and wanting to be special and wanting be seen in wanting to get credit I don't think a thing's going to happen until that attitude washes out of us am till we get to the place where I have no thought coming I don't know what's going to happen I don't know how to do it but I know he'll do it and I didn't do it he did it can you imagine somebody walking up to the Virgin Mary amen years later and said oh thank you so much for bringing forth Christ he say are you kidding me I had nothing to do with it it just something he did in me I was just there when he did it oh can we get to that place where we don't inject ourselves or take some pride and oh that was that was a wonderful Miracle yeah I had been praying three days before I just kind of felt that there was stop all that nonsense and just be real and honest and say listen I had nothing to do with it that was all God and if you were praying three days before it's because God moved moved on your heart to pray not because you knew anything we got to get to the place where we're just an empty vessel just to empty out and brother B said The more we can empty out the more he can fill up and I want more than little petty trickles of little special things that I try to get special credit for listen if God will use whatever you surrender to him but I want him to have the whole vessel so that he can do things that we've never thought of and then when he does it we'll be like wow that was a amazing Amen brother B comes to the end of preaching the seals he says now don't say thank you to any man amen and listen I'm grateful to him for staying in the little room and waiting for the truth but brother B said don't say thank you nothing he said that wasn't a man that didn't come of my own mind that wasn't my doing that was God I want to get to the place where we can say don't say thank you not that we don't appreciate each other we should do that but with our mind we understand I'm thankful that that came through my brother but that was God Amen that was Christ my brother can't do that I mean I like him and he's special and all but he can't do that he can't live that humble he can't live that surrendered he can't have that much wisdom he can't remember that many Bible verses that was God I don't know about you but I want to empty out and I want to surrender let's all St stand I find it the greatest privilege of my life to be counted a member of this body the body of Christ and I want to be faithful to what he's called me to do the only thing I can do to be faithful is not inject myself and just stay out of it stay surrendered and have confidence that God really never asked me to do anything he just told me to believe him he would do it and I believe he will so I want to walk forward with confidence not arrogance not superficial just confident that I don't know what's going to happen next and I don't know how to solve the problems I don't have the answer but I'm confident he'll do something because he made promises and I'm doing what he called me to do the best I I know to do it and I'm confident that he'll work the rest out all he needs is a man in his hand he can do the rest you believe that amen you believe he can do the rest amen oh God take me in your hand take me in your hand let's bow our heads together dear Lord Jesus we're so thankful Lord for this message God there's no way we could have known these things until this hour and we could have never known unless you and a prophet and we could have never heard that Prophet unless you gave us ears to hear if you hadn't Lord ordained it we would never know we would we would just be marching on in life as anybody else is marching on in life doing the best we know how to do lost and confused but God by your grace you made us part of your plan God I just want to say I'm sorry Lord for injecting my known thinking so many times I'm sorry Lord for trying to help I'm sorry for trying to accomplish sorry for wanting credit sorry Lord for all my Humanity but God I ask that you would just take me in your hand Lord just take me according Lord to the way you called me well when you called me I knew nothing I had no ability I couldn't do a thing and you called me anyways and you told me that I was yours from before the foundation of the world and you told me you wanted me to be part of your bride your body on this Earth Lord I knew I had nothing and could do nothing and was worth nothing God help me to stay in that frame of mind help me to stay surrendered and humble subject Lord to your every word God the battles that rage in my mind the lust of the flesh the the the thoughts Lord the carnal thoughts help us by Your Word to win that battle give us greater revelation of your word that we might overcome The Temptations in the wilderness by it is written God give us a greater Clarity a greater Vision a greater revelation of your word so that we have the the we have the armorment we have the Weaponry Lord to fight off all the thoughts of the enemy so that we can bring captive every thought and bring it into obedience to you Lord so that we can stay surrendered and we can stay yielded and our faith can stay planted upon your word on the promise you made us may your life live itself inside of us may we be recipients Lord if there's anyone here who has not just surrendered completely and open their heart and let you have full access I pray they will this morning Lord that they'll just open up and say Lord I've tried I've put it off I've tried to work a Reformation process and reform myself but it won't work so God I want to open My Heart Lord and ask you to come Lord Jesus God if there's anyone Lord who wants a full surrender here this morning I pray you'd fill them with your spirit Lord according to your promised word may they receive the gift that you promised for them and it may be as simple as them opening their heart and receiving it Lord and giving you access may we all Lord find a way to empty out more than we've ever emptied out before May everything that hinders be poured out of this vessel so that you can fill it with yourself God I know there's Mighty things that you want to do there's manifestations and demonstrations and there's a life that you want to live you want to live it in each one in great ways and simple ways in small things and in big things and we want it to be all you not us help us to be just like the Virgin Mary simple enough to believe your word humble enough to surrender to it patient enough to let it come to pass on its own Lord let that be our testimony for God it's the desire of our heart we love you we thank you for your grace for your great love towards us to show us these things and now may you strengthen us that we would continue to fight the good fight of Faith as we surrender and yield bless your people Lord encourage them Lord give them strength give them stability give them Faith to keep moving forward so that they can overcome by your grace we love you Lord Jesus and ask that you would help us with all these things in Jesus Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you Saints I just want to remind
