green vegetation we got back here friday afternoon and it was 46 degrees and it wasn't lush green vegetation but i like fall so it's good to be back it's good to be here it's good to be in the sanctuary again man we certainly appreciate your prayers we had a wonderful time the lord certainly blessed us we were able to disconnect for a little bit and connect to one another and enjoy each other and enjoy just some time away but it's good to be home it's good to be back and we appreciate those brothers who took the services for us while we were born appreciate for the kyle brother jean kadema we appreciate that and then brother nathaniel for coming down we were grateful for that so i haven't had a chance yet to watch the services so i've been focusing on this one so maybe monday i'll start catching up but praise god i hope all is well with you all is well with us man we're going to start this morning off doing something we love to do we're going to dedicate a little baby so brother ben and sister amanda want to bring up little banaya ray little banaya ray sibolt benign means built by god amen that's a good way to be built and ray means advisor or protector and this little boy he's going to have to live up to his namesake he didn't kill dear banaya then he went down in a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion brother so this boy might do you up amen praise the lord amen it's such a blessing to hold this little baby in the know what god has done for this couple who was told that they couldn't have a child that to be a miracle she became pregnant and in three years three babies i told sister amanda when god fixes something he does a good job and this is bower heads and pray lord jesus we thank you so much lord for your goodness to us for this little life that i hold in my hands lord if you were here you would take the children into yourself and bless them by standing here in your stead as your prophet told us to to take this little child lord and bless it well we pray as mother and father have come down lord not for a tradition and not for a show but they've come down in sincerity lord to give this life back to you that you've placed in their hands they're merely stewards over this life i pray you'd give them wisdom that they'd be faithful in their office as a mother and a father over this little life that benigha would know what it's like to feel the presence of the holy spirit in his home where he would dwell in a place lord where your word is upheld and guarded that word would find place in his heart while he's young lord that he wouldn't have to go the way of the world and suffer the god that he would know you from his youth on god we pray you bless mother and father with wisdom ability strength and blessings and bless us as we stand by them to support them as they raise this child for your glory in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you amen praise the lord i hope i'm not losing my touch with babies he was a little fussy let's all stand and we'll go to the word amen i pray that you guys bear with me brother branham said preaching something you got to stay with and you get you get out of it when he said that he had been i think two or three months without preaching i've been two weeks but i was nervous in the back and i said my goodness i'm always a little nervous but now i feel like i forgot how to preach so you're going to have to pull and i have extra sympathy for the brothers i remember the day when you would preach and maybe go weeks or months and preach again and always are you ready you're not ready and then you're called upon and you thought you had plenty of time to get ready and you had a month or two and then all of a sudden there's never enough time and then i feel the same way and then when we went away we were able to just completely disconnect and we listened to some services and i read some in the breach which we'll talk about a bit today but i was just preaching for pleasure not for study and so yesterday i had to switch gears and i was like whoa that's a different gear all together so just pray for us let's turn to second timothy chapter two and we'll begin reading there together i also want to remind you that today is a communion service sunday so we'll be coming back this afternoon for communion and so it'll be a pleasure to take that together this afternoon second timothy chapter 2 verse 19. ii timothy 2 and 19 nevertheless the foundation of god stand ashore having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his oh what a scripture friends let's read that again nevertheless the foundation of god stand asher having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his let everyone that name with the name of christ depart from iniquity let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word lord it means so much to us and god we're so thankful and grateful that we can gather back together like this having my family and i've been separated for a couple weeks notice we come back together lord defeat upon your word with a full heart and happiness lord with joy that we get to gather together with the saints that we hold so dear that we love so much we pray god that you would now lord in your love for us feed us from your own hand your own word lord that we might be strengthened lord by it that we might journey in this life in a way that's pleasing to you give us i salve to see in hearts to perceive and understand all that you have for us in this hour that we live we ask your blessing and your preeminence in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated and today i'd like to talk on the topic the subject the purpose of a seal and maybe take it from two different angles we'll see as we go on but when we look at the scripture in ii timothy he's saying nevertheless the foundation of god saying that sure having this seal amen and the word seal here is very similar through all the usages in the new testament this is where seal is simply just a seal a seal placed on a book or on a scroll or or any document uh a signet ring because the signet ring oftentimes is what makes the impression on the seal that seals it so it's the article that makes the seal or the impression on the seal or the seal itself and also the inscription impression made by a seal and then the last definition that they put here in the concordance that by which anything is confirmed proved authenticated as by a seal a token or a proof so it's something that has been sealed sealed by some body sealed by a signet ring or something like that it's something that's sealed or preserved or kept or or locked in held in confidence but it's anything that is confirmed authenticated as by a seal so nevertheless the foundation of god stands as sure having this seal having this confirmation having this authentication that the lord knoweth them that are his amen and he'll not lose on one of them this is the seal this is the the seal that we're under is that god knows us and god's always known us before the foundation of the world when we come to this life with spiritual amnesia the foundation of god was sure having this seal this affirmation this authentication that he knew you it wasn't about what you knew amen because all along he knew you and at some day in a given point in time when god declared he would allow you to know him also amen but he knew you and that's the authentication what is my authentication he knew me from before the foundation of the world i mean let's look at a couple other seals let's go to revelation chapter five and we'll look at the sealed book this is one of my favorites and the subject that we can never get away from because this is the day we live in this is not a subject that we get away from the book of redemption the lamb taking the book and breaking the seals it's not a subject we move beyond it's not a subject that we're done with this is the subject for the day that we live in revelation chapter 5 verse 1 and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elder stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book and the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people a nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth so we see we have a sealed book and these are things that are so very familiar to us we're not looking to launch into the unfamiliar but we're looking to to to enjoy the familiar but the the there's a sealed book amen that is signified in heaven and we realize and we look at the book of genesis and also the book of revelation these are books of symbols and so we don't want to if we get too fixated on symbols and hold to the symbol when brother branham begins to change terminology about that symbol we don't catch the change because it has to be you know if we look at the book of redemption this is just for an example if we look at the book of redemption and we take what brother brahm says and what we see here we see seven scrolls rolled together our brother bam says six books scrolled together either way you see these scrolls rolled together and you see a seal fixed to one amen another one rolling and another seal and you break one seal and roll one and you break a ceiling you roll another and then you get in your mind that what is actually in heaven is paper rolled up with seals put on it and then when brother branham says what is those seals he says what is those seals those seals are christ then he says what is that book that book is the bible no it's six rolled up pieces of paper we said no amen this is symbology brother branham's trying to show us that there's a mystery hidden there's something that's been sealed from the foundation of the world and that mystery whatever is on that book whatever is on that document whatever mystery whatever truth is laid behind that seal is waiting for certain conditions to be met amen that's shown by the seals and looking for a certain one in this passage that's been found worthy because the question is what man is there a man found worthy man who is worthy to open the book the cry went out who is worthy to open the book and no man in heaven no man on earth no man under the earth showing that the only one that could be worthy had to be a man because this was a book that was given to man and brother said this book went back to god to the original owner amen but the book was intended to be in the hands of man and you know adam long brother said adam lost this title deed he lost this book but adam was not walking around the garden with a book under his arm he realized that he wasn't walking around the garden and watching after his book and holding his book and tasting of this tree and and then and naming the animals with a book under his hand so when he lost the book and it went back to the original owner it's been in the hand of the original owner amen it's not talking about transfers of paperwork but it's this truth that's been hidden it's this reality of god this mystery of god that god had had in his heart amen adam had it and adam lost it and when adam lost it it went to god waiting for a man who could redeem back what adam lost because what adam was given was total dominion over creation as of god on the earth and that was lost and it was an exchange of paperwork amen it was the it was the it was the mystery of god that was in adam and adam's wife had been lost by the fall that mystery went back to god and it went into obscurity as man tried to make his own way and find god through his own devices and and some could wait for revelation others started forming religion and it got obscured and it got muddled and it got mixed until it was obscure amen but there was a book sealed and then from the very beginning that had seven seals on it that held the mystery of what was in god's mind from before the foundation of the world amen so that the truth would never get lost no matter how many ideas man came up with no matter how many religions he formed no matter how many towers he built no matter how many worldwide religions he came up with amen there was a truth that was holding in the hand of god god was not going to lose this mystery truth he was not allowed he was not going to allow his great plan his great heart desire his great mystery to be lost he held it in his hand until there was a man who could come and take it out of his hand because god was going to make sure this wasn't lost and so there was a man amen christ jesus when god came himself in the form of a man and then he became his own son and he came and he lived this life and then he died amen to pay the price of redemption and it's why when he calls for a lion of the tribe of judah to prevail he sees a bleeding lamb because that's how he overcome that's how he prevailed by paying the price of redemption to buy back amen the right to this book now realize we're not talking about paper this is symbolism symbolism let's turn to revelations 10. revelations 10 verse 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as a pillar of fire and he had in his hand a little book open there was a book closed and brother ben said this is the same book it's closed in chapter five it's open in chapter 10. so now there's an open book and he says and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with the loud voices when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders under the voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not so here we see another seal only this seal is not written on paper because he wrote them not so there's there's seven thunders and those seven thunders uttered something and we know what the seven thunders uttered was the revelation of what the mysteries were but john heard it and john understood it and john was going to write it but he was told don't write it but seal it up so how do you seal it up if it's not written we're not talking about paper because he would have no paper because he was told not to write it but yet to seal it up amen now he told him to seal it up not throw it away this is so important to seal it not to discard it to seal it because when something is sealed amen the fact that it's sealed denotes that there is a time for it to be unsealed or there's no reason to seal it because if you don't ever want the contents to ever be revealed you would just bury it burn it destroy it get rid of it but the fact that you seal it is proof evidence that there's a reason that you're holding this information special and sealed authenticated and then sealed treasured kept whatever you wanted whatever term you would like to use there's a reason that whatever was written down here or whatever was spoken and understood but not written because you seal things that sometimes are not even written the seven thunders if you seal it then you've guaranteed that there's a reason amen for it to be preserved or else there's no reason to seal it that's why when you say well it's sealed up it's not for us to know if it's sealed up it's for somebody to know that's reason there's a seal upon it amen well it's sealed up you know don't try to go there it's sealed up uh that's not for you to know oh then who's it for to know because the seal means it's for somebody to know it's like of a man he writes down some last wishes and and some things he would like to to have done with his estate when he dies he may write a will he may write some letters to some family and he seals in an envelope and he seals it on the outside he denotes amen that this is a sealed envelope do not open till my death well if he didn't want anybody to know what was in there he would have just burnt the document not sealed it he sealed it because it's meant for somebody to know what is inside that envelope and god amen sealed the mystery because there was going to come a time that somebody needs to know what's in this book it's not going to forever remain sealed amen there there's a time for the sealed book to open and friends i personally i know because of what the prophet said but god never intended for that to be sealed and held and never revealed until after we get a body change and we come into perfection and we're known he's never known and we go into heaven amen and then god's going to tell us what he wouldn't tell us on earth well what's the point we've already arrived amen it wasn't sealed up for then amen it's sealed up amen it sealed up for it was given to adam not when adam was an attribute in god it was given to adam not when you know not when he was just a thought in god it was given to adam when he come to the earth to rule and reign upon the earth so this book has something to do with creation and this book has something to do with with god amen in creation god's sons in creation so it's not just for the heavenly realm it's for earth as well that's why i don't think it's just for when we get over there then he's going to open that book and show us the contents i'm already there there's a reason that it's sealed let's go back to daniel if we could go to daniel chapter 12. daniel 12 and we'll start at verse 8. which means i have to turn the page daniel 12 8 and i heard but i understood not then said i owe my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end hallelujah so daniel also saw something daniel also heard something but he didn't have the revelation or the understanding and he asked for it he said daniel go your way it's not for you this will be sealed up until the time of the end so at the end time amen whatever was sealed amen is going to be unsealed there's a seal affixed and the seal is affixed for a time but there's a time appointed for the seal to come off amen and when the seal comes off amen it it's for a purpose it's for a reason he said verse 10 many shall be purified when at the end time and the time of the opening of the seal many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand so even when the time when it comes time for the time of the end for the time that what daniel was not permitted to know what was sealed up into the time of the end when it comes time that end time for that seal to be whatever was sealed to now be unveiled or open or known amen it's going to be the same time that many are purified and made white and tried tested refined but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand this is interesting but the wise shall understand why because he's going to open the seal at the time of the end what was sealed up to daniel is going to be open and when it's open amen when it's opened it's still hid because none of the wicked will understand although it's open [Music] so amen it's sealed it's unsealed and at the same time it's unsealed it's still sealed this is why god operates by revelation because by revelation he can clearly say something amen and only the ones who are intended to hear it with a spirit in them to receive revelation will know what he says the rest will remain in darkness same thing happened when jesus christ was here in flesh amen he was here and he would speak something and he would say it clearly amen only they would not hear it they would not understand they would hear it but they would not understand it amen it was still sealed to them even many things he said to his disciples remained sealed to his disciples until after the resurrection and then with the gift of the holy ghost they remembered what he had said and remembered the scriptures because it takes revelation amen it takes revelation to understand what's laying behind the broke seal the wicked won't understand but the wise they shall understand brother branham and the mess in the breach message he says there's three things that that a seal denotes there's three things that a seal denotes and i'm not going to do them in the order he does them in the breach but i'm going to rearrange it my own order the first i want to talk about is ownership in the breach message he says another thing a seal signifies his ownership see the seal has a mark on it shows ownership when you're brought bought by the blood of jesus christ and sealed by the holy ghost you are no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to the world you are owned by god but brother branham now when he starts talking here in the breach he's going to talk about these three things that a seal denotes and he's going to be speaking uh on two levels he's going to be talking about your personal seal when you're sealed by the holy ghost in the new birth but he's also going to be referring back to this book that's sealed because if you understand in the breach he's talking about revelation chapter uh four moving into chapter five talking about the breach between the seven church ages which is revelation chapter two and three and the seven seals which begin in revelation chapter six and he's talking about the breach which this is these verses in between primarily chapter five so when brother is talking about revelation or the breach he is talking about this sealed book he's talking about this scene in heaven where a lamb comes and takes the book the book that's sealed that no man's worthy to touch it or to look there on amen but he's been found worthy that's what brother brahm's talking about so now when he gets into seal when he starts talking about these three things that a seal denotes he's talking about you individually under your seal of the holy ghost but he's also talking about this book so i'd like to talk about both as well let's go to acts chapter 20. i want to read several scriptures so keep your bibles handy and get your fast flipper on and we'll go through several scriptures here acts chapter 20 verse 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves until all the flock over which the holy ghost has made you overseers to feed the church of god which he purchased with his own blood so so a seal denotes ownership amen god amen god created the blood the blood of jesus christ was the created blood of god that's what scripture tells us and god purchased us with his own blood amen and now he put a seal upon us in the new birth and that seal denotes ownership who we belong to let's go to first corinthians chapter 6. first corinthians chapter 6 and verse 19. first corinthians 6 19 what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and you are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods so a seal the seal of the holy ghost denotes ownership let's go to revelation 13. revelation 13 and verse 8. and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so this book has a title but it's an interesting title the book of life of the lamb or the lamb's book of life but i like this the way it's worded let's just take it exactly the way it's worded and not change it in our minds let's look at this again in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so is this book about the lamb's life it's the book of the life of the lamb brother brown tells us that this bible is the the entire revelation of jesus christ he tells us that title deed book amen is the revelation of jesus christ the book that's in the hand of him that sits on the throne making that book and this bible the same thing and it's all about what jesus christ so it's the book of the life of the lamb as that life has been coming down through 6 000 years let's go to revelation 21. revelation 21 and 27 and there shall no wise enter into into it anything that defileth neither whatsoever a work of abomination or make of the lie but they which are written in the lamb's book of life so this book is a book that's sealed but there's an ownership described to this life or or this this book this book of life is is about the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world and it's called the lamb's book of life showing that the book is about somebody and belongs to somebody it's amazing because it's the book of life of the lamb from same old from the foundation of the world the lamb's book of life and the lamb's book of life is the is the revelation of jesus christ and this book is a book of life and it's the revelation of jesus christ both books are telling the same thing let's look here in the breach so we're jumping between the book and you you're sealed and your seal denotes ownership god owns you by your new birth by the seal of the holy ghost to seal on your life shows who the owner is amen and so the book also shows ownership when it when adam lost it it went into the hands of the original owner but the original owner is not the intended owner the intended owner is the one who the book's about he's the intended owner amen and when he's finished the work of redemption he'll go and take his book he's just holding it god is just holding it for him waiting for the time for some who's worthy to come and take it he's just holding it he's not i should say it this way and remember this is all symbology amen we're just talking about symbology the mystery is just being holding the mystery that's held within god from the foundation of the world what god had in the back part of his mind while god is holding and he's waiting he's waiting he's waiting until there's a lamb who's accomplished redemption who can come now and take that book and loose that seals and what does he do when he loses the seals he throws it down to his seventh church age messenger that's on the earth amen in that church age messenger turns and gives it to the people this book is for the lamb this book is about the lamb this book is for the lamb amen and then why is it why is the lamb sharing the book with the people on earth amen the people that he's sharing the book with must have something to do with the book hallelujah because remember none of the wicked will understand seals are open wicked don't understand but the wise will understand okay in the breach he says and and revealed as the seals break and are released to us released to us then we can see what this great plan of redemption is and when and how it began to be done it's all hidden in this book of mystery here it's sealed up with seven seals and so the lamb is the only one who can break them now we realize now if you'd like to look in the scripture you can get it over in jeremiah and find out there where he was when he was going into captivity of the land you know he they brought his uncle his uncle's son some property and he went through that ceiling and brother bran mentions this several times throughout the seal series is look at jeremiah look into jeremiah if you want to see this look in jeremiah and you go back and read in jeremiah you find out that jeremiah was right just before they were going to be led into babylonian captivity which is a type of the false church amen and he takes and he buys a portion of land he he he purchases he makes the purchase price for a piece of land amen and he takes and he takes and he writes down that purchase the evidence of the purchase the price of the purchase whatever it is and then he seals it up and he places a seal on and he puts it in an earthen jar and he leaves it amen with the scribe amen because there's an appointed time for that to be opened amen and the appointed time for that to be open is when it's time for redemption claims to be made on what was purchased when they come back and jeremiah was not going to be the individual to come back he knew they were going for 70 years but he knew his heir the one who come from him his heir would come back into the land and when they come back into the land amen they had a rightful they had a right to redeem this property because it was already paid for and the seal underneath the seal was all the details they needed to make sure that the right inheritance went to the right person so he didn't seal it to hide it amen he sealed it to preserve it he didn't seal it amen he didn't seal it so nobody would know he sealed it so only the right person would know the one who had rights to what was under the seal and so he keeps talking about jeremiah jeremiah go back and look at jeremiah and what is the seal to know the seal denotes ownership jeremiah had sealed what he owned and remember this lamb's book of life was written from before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain and the mind of god before the foundation of the world because the price was paid before the fall the price was paid friends listen the price was paid by god before there was a need for a price to be paid that's how secure your salvation is that before you needed a price to be paid there was a price paid and it was recorded in a book and it was sealed amen so that when it come time that the children of god needed to realize what their inheritance and what the redemption claims were amen it was time now to take the book and open the seals amen not to hide it from them but to show it to them so that they would have the courage to take redemption claims so they would be bold enough amen to go and claim what's theirs they'd be gold enough to take the position that's theirs amen and realize that they're not treading on somebody else's land jeremiah's descendants that would come back they weren't walking on somebody else's pieces of property they weren't trying to take what didn't belong to them remember when they were calling for eternal life amen they were calling for their own inheritance when they were claiming this is mine and this is mine and this is mine they were only claiming what was rightfully theirs by a purchase price that was made [Music] before there was a need for there was a deed for the lamb to be slain the lamb was slain and it was recorded and it was sealed and it shows ownership jeremiah owned that land because he paid the price of redemption silver redemption jeremiah owned that land and because jeremiah owned the land he could share it with whoever he wanted to and he chose to share it with those who came from him his family that's who had rights to it that that i just i just say this way that's who was listed in that document that was sealed away and tucked away was was jeremiah's descendants and i i'll venture out on this and say jeremiah may not have known their name they may not have been born yet the one who can come and claim this but he put their name he put their name in there but it may not been the the letters that made up their earthly name amen their name that was in there was their position my children my grandchild the one that comes from my loins the one that have my blood in them the one that's come from me amen if there anyone that comes from that way in that position and that way they have rights to claim what's theirs and what was that their name was in that document and it may not been the name that they were called on earth amen but they were called by a name it was their position it was their position and inheritance it was their position in relation to jeremiah now he may have had names in there i'm not i don't know but i don't know if he would have had to i mean reading on in the breach he says and now we're going to see what the book says about how it became open it is not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals and opens the book see the lamb's got to take the book it's his so who does the book belong to it belongs to the lamb the lamb paid the price he paid the price before the foundation of the world and the mind of god he came down and he paid the price on earth in this dimension amen in a physical body paid the price of blood for redemption and he purchased back that book but he doesn't go to claim the book until he's finished a redemption cycle so he stays in an office of mediation and so but the lamb's got to take the book it's his so if it's his it went back to the original owner but it did not go back to the intended owner it's the lamb's book it was intended to be the lamb's book when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the original owner who created the title deed is holding the book in his hand not to keep it from man but to keep it for man it goes back the mystery is held in god's heart god doesn't let it go god never turns it loose god never forgets it he's holding it not to keep it from man but he's holding it to give it to man but he's got to wait till the conditions that are on the seals are met and when the conditions are met then the one who this was intended to go to which was his son can now come forth and take the book because it's his praise be to god friends praise be to god our position is so secure in christ if we can just really let this soak in and not make this a story not make it a parable not apply it to other people amen but bring it home and say that's me that man up there on that podium is talking about me amen i'm in that book i've come from god i go to god i've got a part in that inheritance i'm listed underneath those seals then you'll realize you were secure from before the foundation of the world you were secure from before the fall the lamb's got to take the book it's his now remember no man in heaven no man on earth pope bishop cardinal state presbyter or whoever he is can break them seals or reveal the book but the lamb and we have probed and presumed and stumbled and wandered and that's the reason we're all in such a confusion but when the divine promise that's in the book of redemption will be perfectly opened by the lamb and the seals thereof will be loosed by the lamb in the last day in which we're living now the purpose is not to be opened in heaven so you can understand the whole plan the purpose is to be opened here in the last day daniel was told it's sealed into the last until the time of the end now brother bam saying the lamb is going to loose the seals in the last day in which we're living now it is not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals because remember the book was being holden in the hands of him that set up on the throne and the lamb comes to him that sets upon the throne and takes the book out of his right hand takes the book he takes the book because it's his he doesn't take the book because he's doing anything wrong he takes the book because it's his but realize brother brahm said this has to happen at the end time and brother brahma said the time we're in now it's not for a future opening it's for the time that brother bannon said is now and he said it will be open and during the last messengers the last angel messengers ministry well then it has to be open it's a book that has to do with redemption of creation it's a book that has to do with sons of god it's a book that has to do with the life of the lamb and it has to be open at the end time not after the end time at the end time and the lamb is the only one that can open the book because it's his so if the book is opened the lamb's opened it there's no other option but remember the wicked won't understand you open it you read the contents and the wicked won't understand but the wise don't understand brother says the second thing that uh that a seal denotes is security the first thing is ownership the second thing is security back in the seals he says another thing is a seal is security seal means you are secured now you that don't believe in eternal security i don't know but now but a seal signify security to its destination woe into that guy that would try to break that seal and the holy spirit seal cannot be broken so brother man's doing the same thing he's taking these seals what they denote he's been bringing it to you personally but also to the book and we'll see that here in a minute but a seal means you are secured eternal he says then the the statement i just my marvel brother ben says you that don't believe in eternal security i don't know like he doesn't even know what to say because the seal means security you're sealed until the day of redemption that's ephesians 4 30 brother mary first he says and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you were sealed unto the day of redemption a seal denotes ownership and security god owns you and has secured you to your destination that's why the new birth listen the new birth is not something you take and put on yourself because it's a seal of god god has to be the one ceiling first he has to know who you are and he has to know that you're in that book amen and then he has to fix his seal and you're showing that you belong to me this is my ownership and you're secure unto your destination you realize then that makes the new birth not something you can press into not something you work up not something you can pull down not something you can manufacture not something you can fake not something you can copy it's not anything you can do because it's the seal of god and it has to be given sovereignly by god and god has promised to give it to those who obey his word he says brother brahman says concerning the new birth there's just a quote here i found that i just want to read in the message paradox he says for instance i believe that every born-again member of the body of christ is a paradox in themselves i believe each one of you methodist and presbyterian and lutheran that never had experienced the baptism of the holy spirit was in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine new birth and has now received the baptism of the holy ghost is a perfect example of a paradox because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is a miracle unless that happens you cannot be a christian listen it makes it clear unless something happens to you that changes your whole being that changes who you are an experience with god that changes you changes your course changes your thinking it changes changes you he said unless that happens you cannot be a christian there must be a paradox for you to become a christian because no one can change a spirit in a man and give him a new birth outside of god god alone is the only one can do it and it's a miracle how that god can take a man's thinking in his ways and his life and everything and change it from what it was to what it can be and what he can make it that's the paradox that's the new birth that's that that's the seal of security that's the seal of ownership that's the theo seal of authenticity you're an authentic child of god because god affixed the seal god brought the new birth god quickened the seed god brought the change not something you did something he did romans 8 31 says and why shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us he despaired not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is god that died ye rather it's christ that die ye rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall sep who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or neckiness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter and they in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord a seal denotes security what shall separate us he went through a big list and i don't think that was an exhaustive list i think you can keep adding to that list nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of god that's god's grace his love for us which is in christ jesus our lord let's turn and look at two scriptures very familiar let's go to the gospel of john john chapter 10 i want to read these two scriptures and then move on john chapter 10 and verse 27. now don't forget i'm talking about you but i haven't stopped talking about the book that's going to become clear in a minute i'm talking about you but i haven't stopped talking about the book i hope you catch that say it one more time i'm talking about you but i haven't stopped talking about the book because i'm not talking about two different things john 10 27 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand for my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them pluck them out of my father's hand i and my father are one the seal denotes security the seal comes upon our lives because our names are written in the lamb's book of life so it will secure before the foundation of the world it'll be secure when this world burns over it'll always be secure let's go back to john chapter 6. in verse 37. boy i just got a scare this clock says 12 49. don't worry all is well we have lots of time john chapter 6 verse 37. all that the father giveth me shall come to me and listen this isn't this isn't a statement that has any hope attached to it whatsoever this is an emphatic statement this is an absolute statement all that the father hath previously hath beforehand hath past tense given to me shall future tense so this spans time friends all that god hath given me in the past shall come to me jesus was not even talking about something that was presently happening he was talking about something that has already happened and will happen this is how secure we are under this seal and i say this is how secure we are in the sealed book amen because the seal on your life of the new birth is only declaring what's already in the sealed book john chapter 6 i want to finish reading here all right all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out for i come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day why why would we lose nothing because it's already sealed in that book amen that adam lost but was holding in the hand of him that sat on the throne hey listen it's not it's like i said it's symbology so don't get caught up in the symbology amen god is holding the mystery within him but the mystery wasn't for him alone he wanted to share this mystery with his attributes he wanted to share this mystery with his children so that he would hold it he would hold it in mystery form until it was time for the lamb to come and take the book and break the seals and reveal the mystery that god had been holding in his heart all along not about paper it's not about somebody sitting in a chair somebody holding a book and somebody else walking up to somebody with a book amen it's a mystery that god had held dear to himself and he had sealed it within himself amen he wanted to show the mystery and adam and adam and he had come forth with adam a son of god and out of adam he took a wife amen what is this this is the seventh seal coming right up from genesis and he brought the woman that came out of the man back to the man and he called their name adam amen he took the two and made them one they were one and they were one in origin they were one in union and then and then that image fell that great masterpiece that was reflecting what was in god's mind fell amen and so god amen took the title deed from adam oh if i could just explain this the way it's in my heart adam didn't give up a piece of paper back to god amen adam lost the whole purpose and intention and revelation and understanding of what he was on earth for he he couldn't go back to the tree of life now he was driven out and cherubim's replaced with a flaming sword to drive him away to keep him from taking of the tree of life what is the tree of life christ what is christ the word what did the what did the woman leave she left the word the tree of life to take the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so when adam lost the title deed what he lost is he lost the revelation of the word i hope you understand what i'm saying not a piece of paper he was driven away from the tree of life which is christ which is the word and now there was there was a flaming sword a man keeping the way of the tree of life not to keep man from it forever to but to keep the way to make sure that there was a way back to preserve to keep the guard the way back but certain conditions had to be met first brother emanuel was here a couple weeks ago and he said remember him he read that quote where he said now that flaming sword will not be sheathed air was bloodied by the blood of the lamb and then the sheath was the the sword was sheathed and now those cherubims were ushering men back to the tree of life because the price had been paid adam didn't lose a piece of paper and adam didn't just lose it wasn't just it wasn't that he just lost the right to say tree pluck up here and move over there because in the grand scheme of things that's quite trivial i mean i don't mean i'm not mocking in any way but in the grand scheme of things what would you rather have in all of your life would you rather have the power to pluck up a tree and move it over here or would you rather be declared absolutely innocent and virtue in the eyes of god sinless and guiltless and free from all fault which means more to you which means more to you the power or ability amen to move to hold a son in place or the revelation that you're a son of god and come from the mind of god and going back to the mind of god going back to god which is a greater thing amen the revelation of the contents of the title deed or the power to reconstruct nature so he lost more than just the ability to say sun stand still or tree pluck up and move or wind stop blowing he lost more than that friend amen he lost his innocency he lost his access to the tree of life christ the word he lost his position in christ i'd rather have my position in christ secure than all the powers that are on this planet the third thing the third thing that a seal denotes is a finished work now he's talking about you but i never stopped talking about the book a seal denotes a finished work in the breach mess he said like i used to work for the railroad company we'd load box cars with cans and different things from the canning factory but then before that car could be sealed the inspector came around to see if that car was properly loaded if not the first time it rammed together something it'd scatter the stuff and break it and the railroad company was responsible and the inspector would test everything to see if it was properly in place if it wasn't he condemned the car then we'd had to do it all over again until the inspector was satisfied and when the inspector's satisfied he shuts the door the inspector shuts the door and the inspector places a seal upon it and then no one can break that this seal until it reaches its destination so remember brother said it's secured to its destination it declares ownership and many times he's talking about this seal in the boxcar he said he used to work packing the box cars and you had to get them just right because they couldn't jostle them out and break so it had to be inside had to be secure before there was a seal put on the outside and he's typing in with you inside there has to be a security amen that comes from belief in revelation in a new birth amen by my by the holy ghost quickening a seed the inside has to be secure and then he puts them outside a seal you begin to live the life of jesus christ for all to see and so he started talking about this and he's typing you but he's going to take the same analogy two paragraphs later or three paragraphs later and he's going to start talking about the book and i want you to think about this the rail car was packed amen it was packed correctly all the contents were put in place in the rail car when everything was put in place and everything was correct and everything was there amen there was a seal put on it and when the seal put was put on it that seal showed who owned it that the contents inside were secure and that nobody had the authority to open this until it got to its destination this is my favorite part i said everything i said before to get to this brother further in the breach paragraph 70 says seal signifies now this is words i got from the dictionary seal signifies a finished work and when the seventh seal is broken the mystery of god that's sealed in these mystery mysterious seals is finished until the day that the seal is broken then it's revealed what's on the inside of it if the man's wondering what's in the box car you say it's supposed to be such and such they're supposed to be he's presuming but when the seal is broken and the door is open we see into it then then and see exactly what's in there you see it and that'll only be done at the end time but the man's not talking about a boxcar now he's talking about the seal that's on the book amen when it gets to its destination listen you gotta you gotta hang with me for a few minutes when that boxcar finally gets to where it's supposed to go it's been traveling down the line for six thousand years but when it finally gets to where it's supposed to go when it reaches his destination there has to be one with the authority to break the seal amen when he breaks the seal he can't break it till it's at the destination when it's made the destination then he can break the seal we know that the contents are secure it was secured before the seal was put on amen praise god amen your security goes all the way back before your natural birth goes all the way back before adam and eve on this earth your security goes all the way back when that book was written the lamb's book of life was written before the foundation of the world that's in your security that's when the boxcar was packed friends what boxcar the boxcar of the life of the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world when that boxcar went everything every attribute every part everything was packed in that box car it was secured it was sealed and it was headed down the line for a destination and god knew where it was going to wind up he knew when it was going to wind up and he knew everything that was going to be in the boxcar when it got there that's what the seals show us friends that before the foundation of the world god had already chosen who would be in and who would be out god had already packed the boxcar god had already written the names in the lamb's book of life amen he had already sealed it amen he had already sent it down the line and he already had a destination in mind and he already knew what the conditions would be to have to be met to open that seal and when he opened the seal it wasn't just for the eyes of him who opened the seal but when he opened the seal and threw open that door it was forever he for whosoever he invited to look therein and you could see what was on the inside of that box corn and brother said that'll only be done at the end time which brother branham emphatically declared that in his day 50 some years ago that it was the end time brother branham was not looking for a future end time he showed us that the end time had arrived it's been the end time since brother branham declared it to be the end time and it is during that end time that the seal is broken that the lamb takes the book and the lamb breaks the seal the lamb opens the book the lamb reveals the contents and the lamb invites those who are part of inheritance to see what's in the in the boxcar or in the book hebrews 4 3 says for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world if they'll enter into my rest but he already knew he'd enter into the rest the works were finished from the foundation of the world see as the boxcar or the lamb's book of life is moving down through history everything is written present tense everything is spoken present tense and everything is spoken present tense for free moral agency so it's always would if you would come to him if you believe if you see come now come now but you realize it was sealed before the foundation of the world it was already there in the land's book of life no names are being added to the lamb's book of life all the names that were ever written were written there before but as the lamb's book of life is moving down displaying itself i hope you understand what i'm saying portraying itself displaying itself in types and in moses and abraham and noah as it's moving down through in types it's always present tense whosoever will if you believe come into the ark the door is open rain is coming destruction's falling come into the ark amen anybody it's always spoken present tense and it's always spoken free moral agency 120 years he preached about the coming destruction and the safety in the ark but the only people who wound up sealed in the ark were the ones who were already predestinated to be sealed in the ark but it's always because god is a righteous judge he always gives the opportunity like he did to cain knowing cain had nothing to receive the revelation from so as the book of life is moving down through it's always present tense it's always the opportunity you have to come to the light to come to the truth and what is that light that light is christ whatever light is presented in that day the light that noah preached the light that abraham preached the light that moses preached the light that david brought amen the light that solomon brought it's always the light the light and what is it that's christ it's christ this book is moving down through and it's always you can get on board the boat amen you can always get in the ship but you don't realize part of you is already in the boat amen already in the boxcar already in the book you're just playing out god's great drama on this earth and now you're in time taking your position that was already predestinated before the foundation of the world and something now is striking you in an element of time something is awakening something inside of you in an element of time and we think that we're making choices and and there's a degree of choice making a god god grants us that amen but it's not us choosing christ it's christ choosing us all our choice is doing is reflecting what's already been in his mind it's reflecting back to him from from a part of him that's already within us and so now this book moves down through amen we we we see the displays and and the displays of the light and the displays of the life amen and those who are able with something inside of them to contact that to say there's something real about that i believe what noah was saying i believe what abraham's saying i believe what moses is saying something in me registers with that something and he clicks with that amen amen what is it i think i'll choose to believe moses good choice you did a good job all you did was yield to the life on the inside the plan of god what god had already determined when the light struck the sea it begins to come to life quickly but as it's moving through it's always spoken this was the mystery through the church ages it was always i mean there was such a mentality to go out and bang on doors and convince people and shake them and make them come in and get them to sit in the church and baptize them and make them sit there and if they won't sit there start some programs get some entertainment go and get some programs because if we keep them in the church we keep them in christ because the confusion about making your choice and coming to work they're not realizing that you already have to be part of the lamb's life to be in the lamb's book of life and whenever the lamb's life is presented that part of the lamb's life that you are connects to the part of the lamb's life that's being presented and the two are magnetized to one another praise god god is good friends a seal denotes a finished work that lands book of life from the foundation of the world was in the hand of the original owner and it had on its seven seals which means from the time adam lost the title deed book and it went back into the hands of the original owner nothing's changing inside the book nothing nothing's being added being removed being rearranged nothing's being changed whatever's there has been there since before the seals were put on and the removing of the seals will change nothing of the contents of the document the removing of the seals will only reveal the contents of the dock nothing's changing only only things happening is it's being revealed but it's not changing brother memphis said in the message things that are to be therefore the bride and the rapture will come forth and there is all pre-planned by god all backed up from the beginning he knowed every man every place who would set all about it it's all pre-planned god knew it would be there be here and when he made it that way so that when we get there he's gone to prepare a place for us and when we get there it'll all be prepared just like even this night is prepared like this hour's prepared yes his great foreknowledge tells him all these things by foreknowledge so god is not learning and adding to his understanding and to his knowledge he's not adjusting his plan based off you know what somebody will decide he's already he's already knows the works from before everything was decided before acts 15 18 says known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world god knew what he was going to do we get down in the questions and answers on the seals brother brown says in paragraph 188 now remember the bible said the lamb's book of life was written before the foundation of the world and your name was put in was in that book when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world to redeem every name that was written in the book see you got it now see there ain't nothing out of order it's working just exactly like god's big timepiece like a clock moving right right around your name was put in there before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain to redeem what was what was in the book and now he comes forward and takes that book to claim his redemption now he's transitioning he's going to take the book and open the seals there's no question about the opening of the seals the seals have been opened the only one who can open them the lamb the lamb has to take the book and open the seals and when he takes the book and open the seals he's he's changing in his ministry because now he's coming to claim what he's redeemed or to possess his redemption let's keep reading and then we'll hopefully the lord will help us to see this clearly the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals he says now notice now this book is sealed and you are sealed with the book i thought i was sealed at my new birth well you already were sealed therefore you could be sealed you were sealed because you were sealed when the book was sealed you were sealed with the book and because you were sealed with the book you could be sealed praise god you see how the two go together in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says and the body must follow the head as the wife follows the husband being that adam was not deceived he walked out with eve he was deceived she was in the transgression or the entire resurrection of the whole body would have come forth at the day of the lord jesus when he come forth from the grave but he he had to redeem her which is his body she has to be redeemed in order to come to him do you see it oh my see it couldn't have happened then the redemption is going on now you see the seals now you see the seals when he was in this mediator work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him i'll just hold up the visual because the visuals help but we've got to get away from paper in somebody's hand he said someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in the book would be him so the book is the entire revelation of jesus christ the book is all about him it's the book of the life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world right the lamb's book of life so it's all about him it's the entire revelation of him is in the book right do we agree the book is all about him christ the lamb the book of life of the lamb the lamb's book of life it's all about him the entire revelation of jesus christ someday he comes forward to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him amen all of a sudden he did something super interesting there he made the whole book about the lamb but then he made the words in the book the believers [Applause] so the whole book is the book of life of the lamb the lamb's book of life it's all about eternal life it's all about the tree of life it's all about the word it's all about him he comes to get the book and the book is all about him all the contents in the book is him but when you look at the words in the book when you start to separate pieces of the body amen what are those those are the believers so what are the believers the believers are the word what is the word the word is him amen you are the book you're part of the book amen the book isn't paper the book is the life of the lamb amen it's christ as he comes down through it's christ in noah christ and moses christ and abraham christ and brother branham christ in you the hope of glory and if it's christ in you then you're the words in the book your name is in the book maybe not the name that you have now brother branham said but who you are your position your identity is found in this book and how does he call your name by revealing the mysteries and the revealing the mysteries is calling the name he didn't say chad they say bob then say mary what did he say he said what happened in the garden the reason for a blood sacrifice the reason jesus needed to be born virgin was because of adultery in the garden and you said that's true what's he doing calling your name what's your name your identification he's calling your identity because it's christ calling to christ it's the word calling to the word and the only thing that can call the word is the word the revealed word called the predestinated word for that day and the two are magnetized to come together some hear the doctrine of serpentine saying that's weird you heard the doctrine in a serpent seed and even if you said that's weird something inside started turning and you may have said that's weird i don't know i never heard that before but all of a sudden you get an uncomfortable feeling inside that this is might be true oh god help me i remember that feeling friend something in me my brain was saying no my heart was saying yes my intellect my reasoning my logic my training my teaching my past history my years in a formal church we're all saying no way no way no way but something inside began to pulsate and the heartbeat got stronger and stronger and the more i heard it the more i knew it was true until one day god just dropped the revelation in my heart and i said that's nothing but the truth what was he doing he was calling my name how is he calling my name he was revealing the mysteries of this book amen what was the mysteries of the book it's a book of redemption and then he's starting to show you how you got into the condition you're in and how you get out of the condition you're in because that's redemption you're in the condition you're in because you need redemption because of a fall but but redemption brings me back to the place i was intended to be and that's what this seven seal mystery is all about and brother bam said now he had to redeem a bride i asked you why did he have to redeem a bride because adam had to redeem a bride he declares the end from the beginning so in the beginning god made a son of man a son of god a man a son of god he pulled out of him his bride and united the two together that was his masterpiece image that masterpiece image fell god we preached about this several weeks ago but just just stay with me don't let me lose you and you don't lose me let's stay together god when he made that image he was working six thousand years labor work speak the word let the word work work work work created man on the sixth day created the beast created and man said well it's not good that man do it alone bring up all the animals out of the garden for him the name he names them all no suitable help me so the only suitable help me will be one like him one that comes from within him one that's part of him same nature same life bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life that's the only one that'll be a suitable mate what is god doing he's showing the great desire of his heart in his masterpiece painting what's he doing in his masterpiece his great masterpiece he's showing his inspiration because you can't make a masterpiece without inspiration and he takes out the woman and he brings the two back together and what brother bam calls the crowning act of all of creation and then adam says this is woman for she's taken on a man she shall be flesh of my flesh she's flesh in my flesh bone of my bone she is me that's what he was saying when he says she's flesh in my flesh bone in my bone the two shall be one he's saying she is me and then when that was done god rested i assure you god would have never rested unless his masterpiece was done but his rest was interrupted his rest was interrupted because that man and woman did not fulfill a thousand years because in the day you eat there of the day you die and they never finished their thousand-year day but in that day when god was resting that the masterpiece was marred by the lie of the devil by reasoning by lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and pride of life and that image was marred and god if you just allow me to say it this way god arose from his rest because his rest was interrupted when his masterpiece was marred and god arose from his rest and started over again rebuilding the masterpiece and god will not rest until this masterpiece is done god built through the patriarchs through the prophets through the psalms the prophet was he doing he's building back adam the bible calls jesus the last adam the last item this interesting term the last adam i want to look at a quote here actually if you let me i want to finish the quote i never finished and then we'll move on but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that's all that's in that he come forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb and here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there she can't recognize another headship no sir there's no bishop no nothing she recognizes one headship that's christ and christ is the word oh my oh i love that yes sir he's showing that the headship is here now listen it's not a partial headship because it's not for a partial union but the headship is the full revelation of the word it can only come at the opening of the seven seals so if the headship is here the seals are open the seals are open the lamb took the book loose the seals the headship has come the full revelation of jesus christ has come and now that headship came to do one thing that headship came to unite in an invisible union with a bride that's what brother brahm taught us now she accepts no other headship but what the word no creed no denomination no reason no lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life no self-reasoning no self-interpretation of the word she's got the correct interpretation of the word with divine vindication it's the headship returned back to the body and the body and the headship have united and she'll accept no other headship but christ the word then he says in the rising of the sun he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals i just want to stop for a minute he is the book he is the seals and you're the words in the book so it's not about if i could just come back to this it's not about paper it's not about clay impressions because he is the seals that's not clay impressions friends you're the words in the book that's not ink on paper that is the life of jesus christ an attribute from father god that's on earth now quickened to life by his spirit what is that that's the words that's in the book of the life of the lamb that was slain he said he's the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ so the whole word of god is christ the whole bible is the entire revelation of christ the seals is christ when he opened the seals he revealed christ you realize it's all the same thing you're the same thing he's the same thing the book is the same thing the bible's the same thing the seals are the same thing it's the same thing it's the word it's the word of god coming down through attribute by attribute word by word person by person amen coming to manifest that life he's predestinated it for amen that what is that that's the book coming manifest on the earth but it was sealed it was hidden there was two vines intertwined and then it was hidden in moses it was hidden in david it was hidden amen down to the church ages by these two false vines they thought it was one church they didn't realize it was two different groups it was all there the book was being made manifest the book was being read before the people but they couldn't read the book it was all confused and it was all modeled but at the end of time the lamb would come the light would come amen and he would bring illumination by the opening of the seals and shine the light on the word so you could look back down the trail of the word and you could see the trail of the lamb and the trail of the serpent two trails all the way down through the bible do you see it it's not about paper it's not about clay it's not about who's sitting where it's about the living reality of god wanting to become tangible upon this earth god wanting to be known in his attributes god be coming and the mystery of that was sealed in these seals and the message shalom said god took thousands of years to fulfill his promise of a coming savior but remember he knowed it all the time when it was coming there were many people rose up and tried to be messiahs many churches tried to produce messiahs but god had the time set for his messiah he was in no hurry see and during the time of this he showed many types of messiah he showed it all the way from adam to messiah first and last adam and one of them of the world and the other one of heaven one earthly and the other one heavenly one come down from heaven the other one come off of the earth but promise the messiah he took thousands of years to fulfill him showed it in joseph exactly what he was joseph betrayed him david betrayed him when david was rejected king went on top of the hill and looked back and wept over jerusalem as a rejected king that was jesus in david 800 years later stood upon jerusalem as a rejected king and said jerusalem jerusalem how oft would i have hovered you as a hen does her brood but you would not you see it's all it was jesus in david it was the life of the lamb that was sealed in the book the mystery was hid they didn't understand what it was when he says uh when he when he stood up on the mount of olives and he wept over jerusalem they didn't realize he was it was only christ the word in david foreshadowing what was going to take place and many brother bam says he tried moses and he failed and he tried this one and he failed realize as the book's coming down it's always speaking in present tense and free moral agency he tried moses and he failed for what the restoration of adam tried joseph he was perfect but one little scratch david had an immorality all of the prophets failed everybody failed moses got drunk or noah got drunk moses was lifted up in self-will and struck the rock twice david had immorality joseph had one little scratch trying to get his father to lie he couldn't he couldn't complete the first part of his masterpiece although they were all typing it foreshadowing it building building building to a great crescendo and jesus would come and he would wrap all the pieces that they were building into himself and he would stand there the full word on display what god had done on the sixth day when he made man and it was smart he had come back to that place but in him was you and when jesus died you died in him that's what the scripture says and and when he rose again you rose with him because your flesh of his flesh bonus bone life of his life but he had to finish the masterpiece on this earth on display so when jesus come forth he couldn't take all the attributes although your bodies were already laying here in the elements but each one had to come forth in god's great drama and portray their part in time and display of free moral agency as the book of life was being read do you understand what i'm saying i'm using terms i'm taking liberty to use terms to bring understanding don't pin me down to those terms the book of life being read it was sealed no it was being read but it was sealed nobody knew what was happening nobody knew what was happening when the when the ephesians church began to grow cold and formal and fall they didn't know what was happening but the mystery was telling what was happening because that tree had to go into the ground and die and bring forth god's law has to continue to unfold god's way has to be made manifest so god all the way through try to moses fail trying and joseph failed tried in this one and this one and this one and this one and finally he restored the masterpiece man he got jesus christ the word on display the full word made in flesh and he got that part of the masterpiece but when he died and rose again amen he could not bring forth the whole resurrection he had to wait till each of those attributes that came out of him that came from his life would be brought up out of the earth and displayed and the seed quickened the life and take their position in the great drama in the great book and the great story do you understand and so he had to wait wait wait and wait he couldn't take the book he had to wait and wait and wait and he had to wait until a cycle of redemption completed until he came back to a bride that was restored to the faith of the fathers see brother branham was here calling out he was eliezer calling out of rebecca for isaac he was calling her out of denominations out of creeds out of dogmas out of false understanding what was he doing he was gathering for isaac the bride pulling her out and showing that she's been coming up through luther she's been coming up through wesley she's been coming up through pentecost but when there finally came the second part of that masterpiece a bride that was restored back to the original teaching the original faith of the fathers when he finally got a bride on earth that believe serpent seed water baptism in jesus name that would accept the ministry of malachi 4 that would accept the son of man ministry that would that would accept healings and miracles and when to accept all when he finally got this trick and pulled him out of here and shook off the false teaching and brought him back now the headship could come to the body now the invisible union could take place couldn't do it in denominations couldn't do it with the pentecostal church couldn't do it with the wesley church couldn't do it with the lutheran church he had to wait till the end time and at the end time he would send a ministry of eliezer and eleazar would call out of all of that and bring them back to what bring them back to the word and when they could receive the word it was now time to receive the headship and he was going to take the bridegroom and unite him with the bride and until until he was done with redeeming through the church ages covering through the sins of ignorance covering for all the false understanding of false teaching he had to stay there but when this prophet come on the scene with the son of man ministry they could restore the word amen when he could restore the word amen now amen the bride began to move to the word and now jesus can move he can now do what he can now claim his possession he can now he's sitting in intercession there's a dip in the holy spirit a portion of the holy spirit why because the word is not in fullness when the word is not in fullness the holy ghost is not in fullness because the holy ghost is the life of the word so without the full word there's not the full life amen but now he brought a prophet down amen and christ is sitting here working media mediatorial working intercession covering for the sins of ignorance why he's redeeming a bride redeeming a bride redeeming a bride but when the bride comes from the feet to the legs up through luther up through wesley up through pentecost all the way up to now i mean she's receiving the mind of christ and the revelation of the word what did he do he built back a bride for christ through the church age then brought her out of all the churches and brought her to the word and now it's the great time that the lamb can stand up and take the book and what is he doing by taking the book and losing the seals he is claiming his possession what has he always wanted the last adam has always wanted the bride from his side but he couldn't take her and irenaeus he couldn't i mean he couldn't take her and sardis he couldn't take her through luther's age he couldn't take her couldn't take her couldn't take her until finally she's prepared under a prophetic ministry she's prepared and now he can come and claim the book he didn't take a piece of paper and tear off clay what he did is he took the people on the earth that would believe his word and he claimed them and he possessed them because the full measure of the holy ghost came back to the church what was it the headship uniting with the body the word the word head coming to the word body in an invisible union and they could not take the book until there was a bride who'd received the malachi 4 ministry to turn back to the faith of the fathers when he saw that now he could come claim his possession and in claiming his possession he could whisper the love secrets to her that was kept for six thousand years and now at the end time he's revealing the seals what's he doing he's saying darling i always wanted you i've watched over you for 6 000 years it's more than just you as an individual this is god's whole plan you're standing here as an individual representing the whole bride representing the whole thing all the way down through but you had the opportunity they didn't have you have the opportunity to come to the word untainted by man to come to christ himself and unite with him brother brown says in in the message there is only one provided there's only one way provided by god for anything he was god's word made manifest he was god's promise vindicated he was he was god in a flesh form the bible said that god was in christ that great jehovah that created heaven and earth was made manifest in a body the lord jesus and in that one man he could achieve he tried it through moses he did it in jacob and and he did it in joseph but he yeah he tried it and moses he did it and jacob means he tried it in jacob he did it and joseph means he tried it in joseph but he came in his fullness in the man christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily where god could express himself and he said who can who can accuse me of sin sin is unbelief if i haven't done exactly what the scripture said i would do then who can condemn me and say where i failed in any way see it's god's provided way he says in the masterpiece from 1964 now for nearly 2000 years god has been again making him a masterpiece because he struck adam to get a piece off of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect masterpiece that he struck at calvary he got a piece off of him it's just a new testament that's all he fulfilled the old testament now it's the new testament another piece to be fulfilled that's why she's turned back to the original faith of the fathers back to paul's teaching back to the new testament it had taken the new the taking the old to foreshadow the new christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece is in making as it taken him four thousand years to make his masterpiece now he's been for nearly two thousand years making another masterpiece a bride for christ another masterpiece in so doing it he does it by his never-changing method the same way he made the masterpiece his word that's the way he makes his masterpiece because he can only be a perfect masterpiece when it's the perfect word brother brandon says i don't want to go too far here but i want to read this what would god call a people out of his evil age for i'll read that again there's a parenthesis in there but i'm going to do the whole sentence what would god call a people out of this evil age for his name he's saying why out of this evil age and he preaches the god of this evil age satan's eaten showing that at the end time we've come to the pinnacle of satan's eden he said why would god call a people for his namesake out of this that's what the prophet's saying but it's for a purpose friends now listen i i i've told you how he went through the old testament he built up and he built up and he built up and he got adam and then he struck a blow to the last adam because he's got to create a bride for adam because he foreshadowed it in the beginning he's got to finish the work now he's been building a bride for nearly 2 000 years and when the bride comes on the earth pulled out of denominations united to the word the headship comes and unites the seals open the revelation of the mystery but now he's got a bride amen just like adam had a bride but there's got to be a reason that he called a bride for his name in this age he said the reason it is is to try her his bride see god intends to win god intends to overcome all evil god intends to reverse what was done in the fall god intends to have an absolute victory in satan god intends to win the battle and god is going to do it he he won through jesus christ but he's got to win through christ's female form he's wanting him he's got to win in her because she is him flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life spirit of his spirit she is him and why would god call people of this evil age for his name the reason it is is to try her his bride when she has made manifest been tried been proven proved to satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end as the seed starts in the ground it comes up through carriers the life of them but it ends up the same seed that it was when it went in the ground and the same way the seed of deceit fell in the ground in eden is the same way it ends up in the last days just as the gospel was when it fell in the denomination that nicea roman ends up in a super organization just as the seat of the church fell back there with the signs wonders and the living christ among them it ends up in the last day under the ministry of malachi 4 and restores back again the original faith that was once given we find now this evil age is to prove to satan she is not like eve that she is not that type of woman and she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise oh friends what the prophet says next is amazing to me because he doesn't say you'll not surely die he doesn't even go back to that scripture he goes to a totally different scripture this is going to be amazing now listen we realize he come up and he restored the last adam he struck a blow took out of the last adam the ingredients to make the last woman and he's been building her for 2000 years till he finally gets her and he can bring a union a spiritual union if he brings the invisible union there must be a pride that's restored back to him there must be a headship to unite with they've come together and now what what's been going on for the last 50 some years what's the point amen because he let her come up amen he let her come up in this evil age in satan's eden to do what to prove to satan she's not that type of woman just as when adam amen was given a bride given eve then eve had to go through her testing time and in her testing time she failed christ has now been given a bride amen and she has to go through her testing time in satan's eden and she's got to prove that she'll not fall what is your life about what are you doing every day what does god want from you amen he's showing satan that no matter what conditions no matter what the world is saying no matter what's going on around you you'll not back down on the word you're not the kind of woman eve was for 2 000 years failed on the word failed on the word for 6 000 years failed on the word failed on the word fed on the word but he's brought back a bride united to christ and she's going through her testing time now and she's going to prove she's not god is going to prove she's not like eve she's a different kind of woman she's the one that was ordained for this time she's the one that i have claimed she's the one that i have redeemed and i have claimed and now i'm coming down to possess in preeminence it's his claiming ministry now it's a possessing time i want to read this again she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise you'll not surely die no all but confused on one promise he's the same yesterday today and forever why would brother branham go to that scripture when what eve was deceived on the word was you'll not surely die but god knows you'll be his god you'll be as gods on the earth knowing good and evil she wasn't deceived on that scripture jesus christ the same yesterday forever today and forever she was deceived on a different one when brother branham said she was she she believed all adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever we can't get confused on this promise what he was before the foundational world he is today he's the same yesterday today and forever he is the word made manifest he was a word made manifest yesterday he's the word made manifest today he'll be the word made manifest yesterday she was confused on that who christ was she was confused on the word when you're confused on the word you're confused on christ you're confused on who he is today see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she used to come in contact again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word the redemption cycle is brought back in adam the redemption cycle has brought back an eve and now she's in her testing time by the word why because god's going to prove to satan she's not like eve in god's power to transform from 1965 he says where that seventh morning when god looked upon it in the creation and he said it's good i am pleased with it i'm glad i did it it's all now under control and i put trust in my son and his wife they will make make them head of all of it that they will watch over it all and see that it's all right that everything will bring forth of its kind now he has the power to do that god then said well if it's all so good and it can't be anything else because it's my own desire it's the way i want it and i spoke it that way and my words has brought it just exactly the way i want it and there it is it's all good so the bible said god rested the seventh day from all his works god rested and he entrusted it to his son and his son's wife and while he entrusted it to them she got deceived by the word she got deceived about christ being the same and and was confused on the word and fell and then god come out of his rest and he began making the second masterpiece which he's working on for six thousand years but when this last eve when this bride when every member has come in and stood the test and proved that she's not like eve then we go to the next step what is the next step friends the millennium when once again god's son and his son's wife fulfill what they did not fulfill in the original they did not live one day with the lord they did not fulfill the thousand year reign and now when this bride stands her test and does not fail like he fell then we get to go to the next step and that next step is the god's son and his wife will fulfill the day he says so in rebel in the revelation of jesus christ from the church age book he says we then see that when these lasts of israel have been joined to love to the lord and the enemy has been destroyed god will prepare his holy mountain his new garden of eden for the bride and his and her attendance for the thousand-year honeymoon upon the earth as adam and eve were in the garden and did not finish out the thousand years now jesus our last adam and his eve true church will fulfill all the plan of god god wanted to take his rest for a thousand years and leave and trust his creation to his son and his son's wife but it was marred but god what is the book of redemption redeeming back to that what is the seal's been hiding the whole plan of redemption the whole plan of christ from that time on and before what's he been hiding the fact that he went right to work for 6 000 years building it back he built back adam he struck adam he took out of him a bride he's been building the bride he's got the bride now united with the groom and now she's got to take her testing time when her testing time is done then we'll go back for the thousand year rest where god once again entrusts his creation to his son and his son's wife to rule and reign for a thousand years how many wants to get there if we want to get there we have to first pass our testing time when you'll be tested on the word tried on the word deception will come your own self will your own self lust your own self desire will come in from within yourself your own wrong thinking the influence of friends the influence of the culture your own nature is going to try to take the word and taint the word amen but we've been given a vindicated word so that we can stay with the word not fall like he fell by reasonings and lust and desire amen but now we're going to slay ourselves and take that word over everything else over my own desire my own thinking i know prophet said this but i think this i'm going to get rid of my i think this and take what the prophet said the word says this i'm going with the word and getting rid of my thinking eve couldn't do that she went along with the reasoning but this bride is not like eve i want to get to the thousand year reign i want to rule and reign with him i want to fulfill god's purpose for that original creation which was marred we're here now to fulfill that but i've got to go through the testing time first and i've got to leave my lust of the eyes my pride of life my lust of the flesh out of this if we want to get there we've got to pass through the testing time first every idea even about this message will creep up every thought every deception but don't worry the train car is sealed to its destination the bride will not be deceived may be distracted but not deceived may be detoured but not lost amen may be corrected but not cast away are we doing friends we're in our testing time we're looking for that last one to come in unite with christ we're looking to stand the test of the word and not fall like he fell but to stick with the word let the word be right and everything else be wrong if we can finish that purpose that god had what eve could not accomplish we are here today to accomplish what eve could not accomplish and we're not going to do it of our own strength and of our own thinking of our own will but he who was holding the book had the mystery and he was holding this book but he was holding this book for you so it wouldn't be lost to you so it wouldn't be kept from you so it wouldn't be marred from you he was holding this book till there was one worthy to take the book but the one who was worthy to take the book was your husband and when your husband took the book and loose the seals guess what it's your husband's book if it's your husband's book it's your book if it's your husband's life it's your life because you've been declared by a prophet of god bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life and spirit of his spirit god was holding you in his hand so that you wouldn't get lost god was holding he was bride in his hand so that she wouldn't be tarred so that she wouldn't be made so that she wouldn't be separated from his great mystery from the mystery that was inside of him he was holding her he was holding christ he was holding the word he was holding the whole revelation in his hand to make sure that at the end time when it was union time when it's time to stand the great test he could take that book and give it to his son and his son could take it and give it to the seven church age messenger and that messenger could give it to his bride and now where's that book that he was holding in his hand that book is in the bride where is christ in the bride where's the word in the bride where's the book in the bride where's the revelation in the bride you and the seals have united you and the book are one you and the revelation have become one and now there's no more deception to the bride if she'll stay with the book stay with seal stay with christ stay with the revelation let's all stand musicians if you come blake if you'd come this book that was in his hand is called many things it's called the lamb's book of life it's called the book of redemption it's called the bible it's called the complete revelation of jesus christ it's called your marriage certificate it's called the title deed of all creation and what is the book the book is christ and what is the believers the words that are in the book you can't miss it you're not going to miss it you're not going to be excluded cast away cast down run out run away the train car is secure it was packed it was packed tight before that train ever left eternity and that train's been traveling down through time and as it traveled through time it's been displaying it's been displaying the life that's on the inside but at the end time when the lamb took the book he opened the seals and he showed what was in the train and you realized i'm already inside i've been inside from the beginning every one of his children had been inside from the beginning no one was lost nobody could be lost amen they fall into a lost condition needing redemption but he already had it worked out in his mind before the foundation of the world he already had the plan he already knew what he would do and as it came down through time in each season he was working redemption redemption redemption redemption cycling it all back and where was i the whole time i was in his hand he revealed christ to me and we revealed christ to me he revealed me to me because we're part of christ we were in him where was i at calvary in him where was i in the resurrection in him where was i in that book i'm the words in the book and he is the book and he is the seals oh friends it's secure it's safe it's predestinated it's for ordained it's eternal it's secure it's safe and now all we have to do is rest in what god's giving us and withstand all the wiles of the devil and not give any place not give any place to our own imaginations and the wiles of man let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you for all that you've given to me lord for what you've done for us as your people lord we could have never done this in this day we could never know these things we could never talk about these things we could never discuss them in our imaginations of our mind we could not even explore these things but god you brought them to us through a prophetic ministry you yourself come as the son of man and you begin to whisper love secrets to us to tell us what happened lord the rebellion in heaven the fallout in the garden amen the rebuilding of the image you begin to tell us all this you whispered in our heart all these love secrets all these truths these mysteries because you want us to know who we really are so that we could withstand in this day all the fiery darts of the enemy god i pray that you would just help us lord to see
