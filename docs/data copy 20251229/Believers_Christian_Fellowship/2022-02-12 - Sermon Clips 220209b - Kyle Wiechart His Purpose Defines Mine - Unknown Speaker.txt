========================================

so i cannot pursue my will and his will at the same time i'll be unstable in all my ways i have to put one purpose before me and i have to make sure that i block everything else that tries to stop that to see that come to pass i have something i've got to do every father in a home knows this situation you don't just sit back and and trust that everything in your home goes all right every father has to stand up and be a man take control of his home and say this isn't according to god's will this this situation how we handled this with the children that wasn't according to god's will i have to take control of my own home with my own children and if anything goes wrong in my own home guess whose fault it was mine so a father has a responsibility to his wife and to his children to see to it that his home is reflecting christ the way christ would want it to be reflected right a young man would have to live his life he knows how to has to be able to control his life and control his desires in such a way that if god looked into the secrets of his life he could say this is a young man that's reflecting me the way i want to be reflected you can look to a wife and say hey here's an unbelieving husband but this wife is so purposed in her heart to see christ reflected in her that now she handles her husband in the right way though he may not be serving god it doesn't matter you're serving god the wife serves god the wife reflects christ the way god christ wants to reflect regardless of the husband's situation you know she has to purpose in herself to do that you see what i'm saying nobody's off the hook everybody has a place to play everybody has uh everybody's a wash woman somewhere with a purposeful washed woman somewhere god has a custom-made circumstance and situation that he just so placed you in to see the glory of god manifested in you maybe you're the only one that can do it maybe you're the only one that could really reflect christ in the situation you find yourself in to the the way he would want it to be reflected
