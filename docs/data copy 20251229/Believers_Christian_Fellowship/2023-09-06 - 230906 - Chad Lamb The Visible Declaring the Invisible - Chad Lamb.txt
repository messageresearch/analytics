for these things you've given to us we look forward to this time and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this evening while we're standing let's take our Bibles and turn to Hebrews chapter 11. amen I want to say how much we appreciated the Labor Day picnic and thank you to all those who made it possible and who worked and provided the place and God bless you and return unto you tenfold 100 fold what you gave out we had a wonderful time also want to remind all the young adults the 20 and up young adults that we have a young adults meeting this Friday at our house 6 30. remember doing questions and answers so I've gotten some really good questions and answers but if you forgot to get yours in you still have a chance so you can just give them to me after service email text however just give me your question and we'll go through that I also want to remind you I forgot on Sunday but if you have a special for the retreat please contact brother Ben colei and let him know so he knows how to arrange that so we're looking forward to that as well let's look here in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 3. it says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen may God bless you as you take your seats may God help us as we look into his word so we looked at this on Sunday and I'm continuing on from Sunday I'd like to title this the visible declaring the invisible so if you remember Sunday we talked about the invisible is the real and then we want to talk about the visible declaring the invisible is this the next step in in my thought but we go back here to Hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 and it says through faith we understand that the worlds were refrained by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and when we talked about Sunday is the things that we see everything that we touch and see they were made of things that don't appear so the things that don't appear are a substance they are a reality and it's the reality that made what we call real is sub real that that's an odd thing I don't even know if that's a correct term so just stay with my thought and what I'm trying to say because if this Rio was made off something else that something else is more real than this real so this real what we know to be real amen the things which appear were made of things that do not appear so the things that do not appear were the substance before this was substance and this substance was made of that substance amen but it was an invisible substance amen but it's a substance nonetheless it's a reality nonetheless so it it you know the the odd part is about the way we've grown up the way we've understood things through this Natural Life we've understand a natural world through natural life through natural bodies through natural senses amen we we begin to get the idea that the things that are not tangible and the things that are not measurable are not real but the things that are not measurable and not tangible in this Dimension are the things that are more real than the things that are measurable and tangible amen remember there was a time when X-Ray when gamma ray when infrared was not measurable by man you know science had not progressed the understanding of men and not progressed so the invisible light waves that were always present amen were absolutely unknown to mankind he didn't know they existed amen at first they were a theory and then they had instruments and ways in which they could test the theory and prove that it was there and measure how much ultraviolet light there how much gamma ray is there how much of this and that is there and all of a sudden they begin they begin to make it tangible they begin to make it measurable but because it became measurable didn't make it real it was real before it was measurable amen so we've got to get away from this idea that this is real and that this is all the real there is that's real amen that's why I say this is sub-real this was made of something else that was real and that was real first so it's not that this isn't real but it's sub real until you keep going all the way back to where things came from amen where did the things that do not appear came from amen they they you go all the way back and you come back to God when God was alone with his thoughts and there was nothing else that was made that was made and that's why that's what I called the real real or the only real the original real the originator of all real and everything is a sub-real off of that reel praise God so like I said I don't know if my terms are correct but I think you get the thought amen that's the whole point now let's go over to Romans chapter 1. now you can see why this world we live in that's why faith is the faith is the substance faith is the evidence amen it doesn't have to be measurable by any other device or any other sense faith is the sixth sense that proves that it's there faith is enough amen it doesn't need anything more than faith in fact faith is it's not just that it's enough faith is the only thing that will allow us to tap into that reality is by faith it meant so faith is God's secret weapon for the believer and we know that faith that we have is God's faith and it's a gift so Romans chapter 1 verse 19. because that which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God hath showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even as eternal power in Godhead so that they are without excuse amen because that when they knew God they glorify him not as God neither we're thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened so I'd like reading this because it says we'll go back to verse 20. for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seeing being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power on godhead so God now begins to make a creation and and we know brother bam said that he believed the first thing that he made was the Angels amen because God was he wanted to be God an object of worship but in the beginning he wasn't even God yet because there was nothing created to worship him he was Elohim the great self-existing being the person God Amen but he he now evoked upon himself the title of God when he created the heavenly host and now they could worship him making him God but he was always the great Elohim the self-existing one he needed nothing else for existence that's why he's the original amen but in him were thoughts attributes amen and these were come into expression and as he began to express he expressed a Heavenly Host he he expressed a Heavenly realm he expressed that an Earthly realm and now the things that are are invisible are seen by the things that are made so the things that are made are to reflect back or point to something that's invisible not so that we would see what's made and stop with what's made but this what what God was doing in creation was beginning to express what was in The Invisible Realms begin to express what was in his mind and so when when he begins to express that amen we are not to stop at the expression and say this is it this isn't it this is reflecting what's it we're supposed to go beyond and look at this and see God and move past it to God Amen that's why it this modern humanism and this scientific age amen that that makes uh makes themselves people make themselves God Amen and they take the world and they manipulate the world for their own purpose amen that's a work of Cain amen Cain took the creation of God and began to manipulate the creation of God for his own purpose and this whole scientific world that's why brother bear says Hey amen we're not going to have a a scientific age Sciences of the devil Amen brother Benham is not saying discovering and experimenting and knowing the world is devilish that's not what he's saying but if you look at the difference between Cain and Seth and they're two lines amen Seth amen followed the flocks around amen and he lived with nature and with the land then he followed the flocks and they grazed and they moved about on God's Earth amen but Cain Cain was a tiller of the soil amen he was moving the Earth and tilling the soil and working in creation and he was extracting out of that things for his own self for his own Glory and how do we know that because when he separated from God and went to the land of non amen he had a son and after he built a son he builted a city where did he get the material for the city he got it out of the Earth right and that that's this whole scientific notion amen man becomes his own God and begins to manipulate everything God made for his own self for his own purpose for his own Pride for his own establishment amen but that's not why God gave it God gave it to declare him not to make man their own Gods amen and proud and arrogant and repurpose everything God made for their own purpose that's not why it was created it was created to declare God that's what's wrong with science and the message Harvest Time brother mayor said God the great creator let's try to speak on the form of nature pick him up in the nature first to bring it back to the word now nature runs just with the word because God is a creator of nature when you see the way nature Works find out that's the way that's my that's my first Bible was to find find out how nature find God I found God in nature so brother Benson his first Bible was nature because it was created to reflect something about God amen even the heavens the whole Heavenly Host amen God wrote his first Bible in the heavens amen so creation was there to declare the glory of God God created it and he spread it out to tell his story amen so man would know God and that's why he he put the heavenly host in place amen so man is missing the invisible he's missing what this visible is to declare and the message things that are to be he says now but remember these are only temporal gifts in time now we know that Moses in building the Tabernacle in the wilderness are preparing it he said he made all things after the order of what he saw in heaven so the Earthly things only express what the Eternal Things Are into this Earth that we live in today being so great as we love it and love to live and breathe the air and see the flowers and things if this here is the expression one that's dying is only expressing one that's Eternal when you see a tree struggling pulling trying to live that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do that when you see a man here struggling to live somebody in a hospital or on a sick bed or an accident struggling and the death rattles in their throat and pulling and crying and screaming for Life what does that mean there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that it just doesn't do it now there they are temporal gifts to us these things only expressing that there is one where it's the Eternal one that's what Jesus has gone away to prepare of the Eternal one for us now they only express there's a greater of the same kind because these are a same kind so now if you see a tree struggling to live there's a tree somewhere that doesn't struggle this world is only to reflect that one amen and and that one is the the original real or the more real praise God so let's go to John 1 1. trying to lay down this thought here let's go to John 1 1 and begin looking here no in John 1 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and brother Brandon tells us uh it says he asked the question what is a word a word is a thought expressed so it's the expression of a thought and brother Frank if you could pull up the white board I'm going to write this down on the Whiteboard so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God why is that because the word originated as a thought the original form of the word is a thought Amen in the word is a thought expressed amen so it's it's in line with the thought so first you have first you have thought then you have word right so a a word is a thought expressed so what's the original form of word it's the thought that's where that's where the word came from it came from the thought that's why the word was with God and the Word was God that's right so when God begins to express amen what's in his thinking what's been in the in the mind of God the way he expresses that is by a word and the word is the thought now expressed so if I want to go beyond word I go back to thought that's the original amen praise be to God so then says it in the message Christ is identified the same in all generations said God like in the beginning he was just God well he wasn't really God he was just the Eternal our English word god means an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him he was self-existing Elohim so there was nothing to worship him so he was just the great Eternal but in him was attributes an attribute is thoughts just like you have to think of anything before you speak it then when you speak it becomes a word and then he and then he is the Eternal and in him was attributes and he spoke it and it was the word and the word is made manifest and as the word is made manifest it's God becoming material praise God so now the word where are we here now the word expressed uh sorry f manifest or manifested so the the the thought is the original from the thought comes the word and when the word amen is materialized it's manifested and when it's manifested it's now the thought manifested and brother bear said it's God becoming material amen oh praise God it is God why because God was alone with his thoughts his his thoughts I I don't know how to say this because you know my whole dilemma with language right language is a problem but when you think about God Alone with his thoughts then God wasn't alone he had his thoughts and so God I say if you can say it this way God is the summation of his thoughts you say that those are his attributes or our characteristics of himself are part let's just say like this the thoughts are particles of God and all the thoughts of God are God that's right so when the thought now comes as expressed as a word amen that's why that's why the word was with God as a thought amen and it was God but now that thought is moving into an expression and becoming word all right and it become it can become just one of those I say particles or thoughts or genes or attributes there's so many ways that we try to describe this depending on how we're describing it but it's the same thing something amen from the the mind of God God's thought amen has now moved into a state of expression and now that's word amen and then that word when it becomes manifested or materialized it is God becoming materialized because God is the thought the thought is God they're one in the same amen so I want to I want to look at something else here if I can we say this thought God was alone with his thoughts I'll be just be patient with me as I teach I don't want to breathe through this I just want to take some time and it's not new territory we've been through this but it's so important because this is so contrary to our human thinking it's so opposite to the world we live we live in we have to really stop amen and really listen to what the prophet's trying to teach us and see it in Scripture so we say God's thoughts are eternal is that right are God's thoughts eternal okay but brother Adam said God is the only thing that is eternal so if the thought is eternal then the thought is God if you're catching this so if the thought if if the thought is eternal the only thing Eternal is God so the thought is God so if one of those thoughts God had was about me coming into manifestation It's actually an expression of God coming into materialization as God becoming material and so it's eternal right so then when we look at these thoughts this is the part that's challenging so the thoughts of God are eternal so God we know before he created anything he he had a a thought he had a concept he he wanted to be expressed this is what God's desire was to be expressed and and We Know by by the message that God wanted to express himself and he wouldn't Express himself as a family of God upon the Earth and he wanted to express this great invisible being who was alone with his thoughts he wanted to express himself so he'd bring his thoughts into materialization and that would be the family of God Amen and that would be God materialized or the family of God and fellowship and expression expressing God all right and and we we talk about that like we know it and I mean we I think we barely know it I think we barely have a fraction of the understanding of what that really is so even when you say it I'm like I'm afraid to say it because I'm probably saying something wrong but that's the best I understand so then you say Well when God thought in the beginning he had a plan and in that plan he was going to express all his attributes so part of him was to be a Healer part of him was to be a savior we know that so in order to be a Healer something had to be lost in order or something had to be sick in order to be a savior something had to be lost to be a redeemer something had to be lost so we know that when God thought of this plan of the way he would Express himself he had to think of the Fall is that right because there had to be a fall for these attributes of God to be expressed so if God thought of a fall he had to think of Lucifer and they had to think of Lucifer falling and Lucifer becoming the devil because he knew the end from the beginning God's had no new thought I'm in the Lamb's Book of Life was written before the foundation of the world and Jesus Christ was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world is that right so that means God knew that we would need a sacrifice he knew he would come in flesh Amen to be that sacrifice that's part of expressing his attributes is that right so then I asked you is not the fall part of God's thought is not Lucifer the devil part of his thought yeah but Lucifer is not Eternal because we know he'll be annihilated are we on the same page so this is just this is just the best I can do so just hang with me and try to understand what I'm saying don't cabbage down on definitions of words because that's going to get hard but when God was alone with his thoughts and those thoughts were Eternal and those thoughts were attributes those were a specific kind of thoughts not everything he would ever think as he devised his plan but in the original the thoughts were the thoughts of himself I hope you're catching what I'm saying the thoughts that are Eternal were the thoughts of himself how he would manifest himself how he would display himself how he would materialize himself these are the Eternal thoughts of God and in order to make this manifestation he would have to think of a Plan of Redemption and a fall in the backdrop of black now those thoughts are secondary thoughts I hope you understand and listen I don't think God thinks like we do either I mean we're human beings we're thinking oh I had a good thought now I have another thought I don't think it was like that I don't know how else to explain this but we know that if the thoughts of God are Eternal then those are the thoughts of God about himself amen and if we are seeds of God if we are children of God then we had to be part of that thinking in the beginning when God was thinking of himself manifesting himself and all the ways in all the attributes and all the all the particular ways he would manifest himself we were part of that thinking making that Eternal thought and that thought about us making part of us part of the Eternal making us part of God praise God so I hope I hope that clears some things up and doesn't muddy anything up for you amen so let's let's read this next quote in future home brother Ben says so God in the beginning when he thought of you and thought of others like that thought of himself thought of himself of being tangible so what was God thinking he was thinking of himself being tangible that's what I say the Eternal thought of God is God thinking of himself becoming tangible that was his thoughts so he expressed his thoughts by word so what was his thoughts his thoughts were himself the thoughts of himself about himself how he would declare himself and how he'd manifest himself how he would show himself amen so let's go back if I can all right we'll go back to this okay so now let's go we were in John 1 1 let's read that again in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now you can see now you can see why the word was with God and the Word was God it was there as a thought now the thought is expressed amen and and it's amazing that when God Amen when God the brother bam tells us the first thing that come out of God was the word and it took on the form of logos or Pillar of Fire or lie amen and all the attributes all the thoughts all the word of God was there amen and he called that son because it came out of him amen and it wasn't different than him it was an expression of him and that expression of him he called it son so now the word was the word was with God the Word was God now the word has an expression okay and that's gone but it still doesn't change the fact that God ever Remains The Invisible unchanging Elohim this is a way he's expressing himself but it's still him it's got the fullness of him because it's the full thought of himself amen so in that in that uh logos were all the thoughts of God all the word because that was the word so that means you and I were in the logos amen that's why we eventually will come forth as little clinkers off of the Sun praise God all right so now let's go to verse 14. and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and now the word that was in logos form now it comes down through time and it's made flash so all of the thought that moved into the logos which was the fullness of the thought amen now that moved down in in God built a body of Flesh and that moved down into flesh and that was Jesus Christ the word made flesh amen now let's go to verse 18. no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him amen why because the word declares the thought and God is the thought he's the summation of his thought of himself amen and now that thought took on word and that word took on flesh and now the son declared the father amen so now when you want to know what what the thought was look at the look at the sun the sun is declaring to you what the thought was that God wanted to become flesh that was the thought praise God the Bible also calls him the image of God and the express image of God that's who Jesus Christ is let's go to John 14 while we're here in the Book of John John 14 verse 6. Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you hadn't known if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it suffices us Jesus said unto them have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me Philip he that has seen me have seen the father and how saith thou show us the father believe us thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake so Jesus now is is the word made flash into one Among Us and in in and Jesus is telling them that I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh into the father but by me so you always have to come by the word if you had known me you should have known my father why because if you know the word you know the father because the no the word is the know the thought that's why you can memorize your Bible but that's not knowing the word amen that's being able to read but that's not knowing the word the word is the thought expressed amen and if you can read the word but you don't get the right thought then you don't have the word you have you have literacy you have the ability through education to read but just because you can read it doesn't mean you know the word because the word is the thought expressed so in order to know the word amen you have to have a revelation that takes you back to the original thought so that you know what that word is meaning that's why Jesus said now when he was the fullness of the word bodily when he was the fullness of the godhead bodily when he was the word made flash he says if you've seen me you've seen the father of course amen if you knew him you would know the father if you understood what this was you would know the father because he was the full thought of God standing in flesh why because it's God's desire to become tangible amen so let's go down a little further now in the the in the church age book in the Sumerian Church age the prophet of God says according to Romans 4 16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself in all believers under that designation because he says Abraham who is the father of us all now the Apostle Paul is doing something interesting here and and I mean it's amazing that brother Branham can come and pick these things up I don't know I I I'm more amazed all the time the more I study the Bible the more I study the message the more mesmerized I am that God could take brother Branham with a seventh grade education out of the hills of Kentucky amen and he could explain and he could preach such deep mysteries of God I mean it's phenomenal and the more I study the Bible the more I realize that man absolutely stayed True to this word in every way even when I was confused and what he was saying I was confused because I didn't have the right picture of the word I was reading words but I wasn't catching their meaning and here God by my by a gift in the men and by Revelation he has him being able to preach Amen in such and such such a simple man such such profound things that we're still trying to just get a hold of Amen they're so deep and they're so unbelievable that we're still trying to get our fingers wrapped around what the prophet brought and that's like the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul now he's starting to talk to Gentiles and he's starting to tell Gentiles in the Gentile church that we are the Seed of Abraham we're Abraham's seed amen and now you talk about mind-blowing to Jews Jews are looking at natural lineage by a progression of Abraham who fathered this child father this child father that seed that's everything that they've known as seed amen but Paul now is all of a sudden he's going to strip that title away from the Jews amen and he's going to give it now to Gentiles who have no no no direct lineage they have no uh Blood of Abraham they have no genetic material of Abraham that they can trace inside of them and he's saying you're Abraham's seed how in the world are they Abraham's seed he said because the promise amen was not to Abraham in the flesh it was to it was to the spiritual real Abraham as the gene of God that's who that promise was too amen is there an effect on the flesh yes there's a promise also to the Natural Jews amen but the real promise that comes down to the reality is the real Abraham who was the Abraham on the inside and that can't be passed by a bloodline that's why he would come and call us the faith Seed of Abraham your Seed of Abraham if you have the faith of Abraham so if you have the same Faith Abraham had who's the father of us all then you are the Seed of Abraham why because you're come down through the lineage of Promise amen why see Gene see Gene lineage so now what makes me what what vindicates or confirms me to be Seed of Abraham because if I'm Seed of Abraham that means I get the promise of Abraham and the promise of Abraham is to inherit all the Earth and have God as my personal God so to get that promise I have to have something that confirms me a Seed of Abraham what confers me the Seed of Abraham is Faith genuine true faith faith in what faith in the word which is expressing the thought this is what Abraham had and so then Paul this is this is now listen we're not even talking about what brother Branham does with the word we're talking about the Apostle Paul you talk about you talk about theologians and Paul's days arguing with him over this statement right I think they had something to argue and then and then Paul does something else Paul takes circumcision which was the seal or Vindication or confirmation that you were part of this promise and he takes he takes their circumcision and he does away with it he says now it's the circumcision of the heart it's a new birth experience amen where the fleshly heart is cut away and all of a sudden their minds are blown because for hundreds and hundreds and thousands of years they've known that that the promise was to Abraham see they're thinking natural and the confirmation was a natural confirmation through circumcision and the Apostle Paul picks it up and he says the reality goes beyond the flesh the reality is spiritual this is why sometimes when people want to criticize amen those in the message of taking things through spiritual Paul was the one who stepped it up a notch to spiritual taking it from natural to spiritual and so then he comes and then he makes another step then he says now the promise was to Abraham's seed but not as many Not seeds as many he's not talking about a diverse lineage but to Abraham's seed as of one and that seed is Christ so now the Seed of Abraham is Christ the promise seed all right now it's completely Stripped Away from flesh it'll be expressed in flesh but it's completely Stripped Away from flesh now that seed is Christ and you are Abraham's seed if you have the faith of Abraham and if the Seed of Abraham is Christ and you're Abraham seed by faith then you must be also a part of what Christ who taught us this William Branham no the Apostle Paul brother Branham just reminded us of what Paul taught because here was a man with no theological training and a seventh grade education and I would venture to say his seventh grade education was not even the most robust of seventh grade educations and here he is taking us back to what Paul literally taught us amen and so now I'm going to continue reading here in Smyrna Church age Paul puts himself in all believers under this designation because he says Abraham who's the father of us all when he goes on not only to narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promised as having to do with election or the choosing of God and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are of the royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated foreknown of God and we're in the mind of God and His Thoughts do you believe you're one of them that puts you in the original in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a mini-membered body whereas once God was manifest in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ that was a mouthful I'm gonna go back and I'm going to repeat the last line so we don't miss it we the true bride of Christ was in the mind of Christ and the mind of God eternally but then there would come a time that we would be expressed in the decreed season the season that God wanted each attribute expressed and each member came forth and became expressed and took its place in the body right so thus the bride is literally the spoken word seed right the bride is literally the spoken word of God the seed of God coming to manifestation and though she's feminine in designation she's also called the body of Christ so what is this bride the body of Christ that's flesh body your flesh body the many membered body becomes the body of Christ or Christ dwelling in a many-membered body so it's Christ and flesh again I'm going to read this last line she's called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God and in many many membered body whereas once God was manifesting one member even our Lord Jesus Christ my where did Brother bam just put you in your original form we've got to look past the natural and go beyond that back amen in Isaiah 55 brother remember Isaiah 55 Isaiah says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it God says my word shall not return unto me void when I send it out when I send it out it shall it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in a thing where to I sent it and the question is are you a word of God are you a sea Gene of God are you one of the thoughts of God going to be expressed in this earth if you are the word then God has already said my word will not return to me void amen but my word will accomplish that which I please amen and it will prosper and the thing where to I sent it so there's two things if you're a gene of God if you're part of the expressed thought of God as a word of God Amen then there's a guarantee in your life that when you return back to God because he said my word will return to me my word will not return to me avoid but it will accomplish my pleasure what I please so in your life amen if you just stay surrendered to God there's a promise in your life that you will accomplish what God pleases amen that word is not you're not going to go back to God void having not accomplished what he intended to accomplish with bringing his thought into expression in your flesh but then there's a second part of that and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it whatever God sent you to this earth to do you will prosper in doing that if God sent you to be an expression he sent you to be a part of the body of Christ in this day amen and nothing can stop that expression nothing can hinder it but that will that word in you will prosper in the thing God sent it to do amen it's not a uh if I could if I could just uh picture it this way it's not are you trying harder and pushing and straining and working no the word is already in you it's the original you it's the you you and it will accomplish what God pleases and it will return to God not void but having accomplished that which God thought before the foundation of the world it's going to happen amen it's not you the outside man it's not your will it's not your strength it's not your mind it's not your mind none of that is what's going to accomplish anything it's the thought being expressed in your soul amen that's manifesting that will accomplish what God pleases and it will prosper it will prosper in the thing where to I sent it amen whatever God has determined for us to express we will prosper in that expression it will work God's word is guaranteed his thought is guaranteed now in the message communion I read this Sunday brother bear says what was it there was another William Branham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there so brother man takes the gene of God and he makes it the word of God placed in your soul from before the foundation of the world and that word won't return back to God void but it will prosper amen and the Rapture message he says then how do we get into this body First Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we're all baptized into this body by one Holy Spirit baptism that if you want to put that down it's First Corinthians 12 13. and by one Spirit we're all baptizing and the spirit is the Life of Christ is that right the Life of Christ and the life of any seed which he was the word seed brings the seed to life you got it you get it if that life is laying in the seed where now we're talking about the seed in your soul if that life that eternal life that that that that was before uh predestinated to be you if that life is laying in the seed and this baptism of the Holy Spirit comes upon it it's bound to bring that Seed Life listen it didn't say bring that seed to life bring that Seed Life whatever that seed is that's the life that will come forth listen you cannot you cannot plant an apple seed and expect to get pears but the life of the seed will come forth you cannot plant a pear tree and expect to get apricots but whatever the life is in the seed that's what will come forth well what is the life in your seed and the Sea Gene of God it's the life of God it's Christ amen and it will come forth when Christ comes to that seed that life in that seed Will Spring forth and bring that Seed Life what is that life it's the Life of Christ amen he goes on to say in the message it is the rising of the sun said Don't Fear anymore for every four ordained predestinated seed of God shall come to life when the light spreads across the Earth of the Glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that God ordained it to do in every age the light of that age will bring forth the crop that God ordained whatever seeds laying there when that light that is Manifest for that day hits that seed it'll spring to life he had raised from the dead I'm sorry let's read that again God shall come to life that seed of God shall come to life when the light spreads across the Earth of the Glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that God ordained it to oh what a wonderful thing this is I am alive or quickened the word means the word quickened the Greek word means that something that's made alive after death like the seed that goes into the Earth it has to die every bit of the seed it has to rot every bit of the seed and every bit of the life that was in the seed has to come forth again this is nature amen declaring something spiritual that seed has to run amen when you talk about when we talk about our soul amen this is why brother Benham talks about he uses terminology like the seed in your soul or the sea gene or or the soul he uses them interchangeably but when we talk about the soul we're talking about the essence of Who You Are we're talking about your core you amen and you come into this life amen and the soul is having an expression it's the it's the nature that's controlling the spirit and the spirit's controlling the body amen but there comes a time when you recognize who you are and you recognize what God's calling to you and you have to die to self all of self has to die amen the down to the core you have to surrender you have to die you have to give up your thoughts your wishes your dreams your plans you have to give up all of self and as you lose all of self and let self rot and die amen down inside of self amen is a sea Gene of God a part of eternal life and when the light of God strikes that it begins to grow and take over and it brings the life of the seed now becomes the life on display but you have to surrender your life I have to surrender my life I have to die to myself amen let's go to John 3. let's go back here in John to John 3. John chapter 3 verse 5. Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee accept a man be born of water in a spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again see this is why we must be born again because our first birth is a birth in corruption and we come with a corrupted nature you believe that you've raised children right you come with a corrupt in nature amen but we have to die to ourselves we have to die to everything that we are amen and there has to be a new birth amen and that new birth is when the spirit of God contacts that life that's down on the inside of you and that quickens that or brings it from a dormant State and brings it into life and brings it into manifestation Amen in that little part of life brother Brandon tells us that was meant to be you from the beginning God intended that to be you amen you've got the original intent was for that life amen to be you and all of you and around that life would be encased a theophany and around that theophany would be encased flesh and it would all be perfect but it couldn't come that way because it came through sexual Birth by sex desire and so now you came corrupted amen but that seeking is still there the original you what God intended to be you it's waiting there it's waiting for something it's waiting to come in contact with its counterpart with something that's the same that is life has to come to life word has to come to word and but we have to be born again this is our new birth when that seed Springs to life but I want you to look at what he says in verse 6. that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit if you've been born again what kind of being are you are you a spirit being or a flesh being read it again which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit if you're born of the spirit your spirit what life should we be living from what realm should we be living in amen not the natural our first birth amen stuck Us in the natural but our new birth lifts us out of the natural into a spiritual Realm where we come back in contact with the Unseen World amen that's why like we read last week that's why he goes on to say Marvel not that I say unto you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and now here's the sound thereof but can't not tell when to cometh and whether it goes so is every man that is born in the spirit what's he talking about he's talking about the real you is bringing to life it's invisible to people amen they see it expressed through this amen but it's not just this amen it's the spirit as bro the birth Amen to the sieging of God and now he that's born of spirit is spirit and what's he like he's just like the wind amen and it lists his words one but no man knows where it came from no man knows where it's going you can see the effect of it and you want to see the effect of the sieging of God you can see the effect out here but it's invisible so now the intent is that this visible amen will begin to declare the invisible life on the inside amen now let's go over to First Peter First Peter chapter one first Peter chapter one verse 23 being born again not of corruptable seed what is the corruptable seed that was your natural birth but of Incorruptible what's Incorruptible seed the seeding of God and the seed word of God not born again of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever amen praise God that's why we say it's a word birth when the word the life of the word comes and makes contact in you it brings to Life The Incorruptible seed that's the new birth amen that's why if you don't have an eternal seed Gene of God in your soul you can't come to the New Birth it's borne by an Incorruptible seed by the word of God Amen praise God now let's I'm going to look at something else for the next 15 minutes before we go let's go to Matthew 23 now I want to really get down to meat and potatoes we went from the real real all the way back and invisible now we're going to come all the way down to what we're going to do in the morning when we wake up Matthew 23 25. Matthew 23 25 says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess Thou blind Pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you are like unto Whited sepulch which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity I I am glad I was not one of them standing there that day because that's not a very nice thing to hear but he's declaring their actual condition you're he's saying you're working so hard to make the outside of you righteous he said but stop first you have to cleanse the inside amen not the outside but take care of the inside and what's on the inside will declare itself on the outside here they're making a declaration but Jesus makes another declaration they're declaring by their Works they're declaring by their dress they're declaring by everything that they are righteous and they are holy but Jesus Christ makes another declaration he declares that inside you're full of death amen full of dead men's bones you're like a Whited Sepulcher a grave that's painted pure on the outside but inside it's dead there's nothing there you don't have the goods you're trying to show that you do but you don't have it inside that's what he's saying what's he saying verse first take care of the inside and what's inside will declare on the outside and things that are to be he says that's the way this old body is it bore the image of the heavenly it's not you you are on the inside of that body so that's why they could decorate the body any way they want but that wasn't the reality the reality is what they were in the soul that was the reality the same thing is true today we can decorate the outside any way we want but the reality is the invisible what's in the soul you are on the inside of that body you the spirit of God is on the inside of that body that's what makes the outside come into subjection because the inside is pulling it see bringing it in line with the word of God you're inside you yourself your being so Brother Band is not making this outside you listen this outside is temporarily you I said this outside was given to you as a way for what's in you to express itself oh I hope you get that clear this outside is a way for the world to see what's in you this is why brother Graham teaches what he teaches on on faith and works amen he begins to teach us that faith is what God recognizes because God doesn't look to the outside God looks to the heart is that right God cares about the condition of the heart amen and we're declared righteous by faith if we have the faith of Abraham we're to we're declared righteous imputed righteousness just like Abraham had God's looking to the inside but brother Branham says but but man looks to the outside that's why works is Faith expressed the expression of the faith you have in your heart is what comes out on the outside and that expresses to the world the life that's inside that's why you can't separate these two and say well we just have faith so it doesn't matter what I do what do you mean it doesn't matter what you do what you do is an expression of what you believe don't ever kid yourself about that and don't ever try to make yourself say well I believe the message amen but I just can't live it no if you believe the message you stay there and ask God to change you until it lives itself in you the reality is none of us can live it none of us have been able to live it we were born in hybrid flesh with Twisted minds and twisted desires and animalistic sex drive and all of these things there's not a one of us can live it but if you're a child of God Amen there's a gene on the inside of you that if it Springs the Life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost it can live the word because it is the word [Music] amen so don't don't let anybody play Funny Business about it doesn't matter what you do and I can do this and I can do that amen what you do declares what's inside of you is gone and you're inside you yourself your being is what you are deep inside that's the reality the reality is in you and what's in you word what was that word originally a thought but the thought expressed as a word now that word has to come into manifestation and where will that come word come into manifestation it'll manifest in flesh amen praise God let's go to Matthew chapter seven let's go our 15 sorry Matthew chapter 15. go back just a few pages Matthew chapter 15. verse 7. ye Hypocrites well did Isaiah's prophesy of you saying this people draw nine to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching doctrines for the Commandments of men now all of a sudden they had they had worked on all the outside and all the picture getting all the pictures right trying to declare something that they really weren't and God cut through all of it and got down to the reality and we're going to look at how he does that here in just a minute but in the message Shalom the prophet says like in the physical body as we are now we are separated from one another but it's really this body is only is the only thing that identifies us to each other because we are bound in five senses see taste feel smell in here and as long as we can see or feel one another why we have evidence that we're here if you're blind and can't see then you can feel one another you hear one another and the Earthly senses declare one another but really frankly we have never seen each other did you know that we have never seen one another you hear something speaking out of a body here that impersonates whatever it's on the inside that's the reality amen praise God so that's why I can say this this body amen is here to declare me and to express me amen and I want it to express the right life the reality of what's in my soul not the influences of other Spirits not the influences of people around me not the influence of culture amen but I want to stay tied into God so that this thing is influenced by the Holy Ghost influenced by the word and begins to express what's deep down inside of me and I want to impersonate what's on the inside of me which I believe is God so this flesh needs to impersonate what's inside and so we've really never seen one another we've really never touched one another but then you say this is my body it is your body that's true is this your body yes is this the little tip of my finger what is that that's Chad amen this fingernail that's Chad this is all this is Chad but this is Chad's body this is not all of me the real me is down inside this is only me because I'm in it does that make sense so so it this is this is me not because this is me this is me because me is in it making this my body making this body Chad but the real Chad if that's even really my name is deep down on the inside amen praise God oh of that reality could just drive down it'll change so many things amen this way when this body feels something I don't care that's not me when there's pain when there's heartbreak when when there's discomfort when there's embarrassment so what this isn't me I'm on the inside of this amen so if you think something bad about this expression then that's fine amen it's just a clump of dirt anyways amen but the real me is down inside and then brother Brahm says in the message hidden life in Christ says see you're coming up to a place now you realize there's a hidden place in Christ where you can be hid that all of your enemies you'll love them there's something about it that you want people to love you you want to be lovely and if you want people to be lovely you have to be lovely yourself and you can't you you can't put it on it just won't work it won't they know it you can't put anything on Don't Make Believe that's what's the matter with our country today there's too much make-believe in just religious works there's too many people making believe trying to impersonate Christianity trying to do something to act like Christians that won't work friend God knows that the devil knows it and the people knows it you've got to be genuine you've got to be original God will honor it so what does God want he wants an original you he wants whatever is expressed on the outside to be the reality coming from your heart not a religious workup that's coming from the outside amen but he wants the reality from our hearts that's what's accepting now let's go to John the Gospel of John John chapter 8. and I think we're going to wrap it up here and John John chapter 8 verse 37. Jesus says in verse 37 I know that you were Abraham's seed so he identifies them they called themselves children of Abraham and he says I know that you're Abraham's seed now he's speaking on the level of Flesh okay I know that you're Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus said unto them if ye were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham now he said I know your Abraham seed that's natural he's not even denying that you come genetically down that line but now he's saying if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that had told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham you do the Deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication see they knew what serpency was all about we be not born of fornication we have one father even gone Jesus said unto them if God were your father now he's going Beyond Abraham if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word year of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speak of the LIE he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not Jesus now you know he's dealing with the Pharisees he's dealing with the religious of the day but now he's going down into the heart of the matter and he's beginning to expose they think they're Abraham's seed they think they're the Oracles of God they think they have it all put together and they've got all the law and all the traditions and everything all packed around they are religious and they're only living it outward there's nothing on the inside and Jesus is about to expose it and he's exposing it how he's showing you're not Abraham's seed and God is not your father they were claiming that but how is Jesus able to make such a statement well one is because he's Jesus but he's going to show him the evidence that he has and Evans exhibit a amen is you don't believe the word you can't I come from the father and you hate me you don't love me if you were of God you would love me because I proceeded forth from God Amen what proceeded forth from God the word the word proceeded forth from God Amen and if you love God if you're of God you will love the word if you are the word you will love the word if you proceeded from God you will love that which proceeded from God this is why John would come and say how can you hate your brother and say you love God who if you say you love God you've not seen and you can't love your brother who you can see why because if he's genuinely your brother he proceeded from God how can you hate that which come from God which is word if your word you can't hate the word if your word a child of God an attribute a seed Gene a part of eternal life then you have to love everything that comes from God all the word all the gene of God oh praise God so now he begins to strip away all the religion just tearing it down it doesn't mean anything in me inside you're full of dead men's bones If Abraham was your father but he's saying now he's saying Abraham is not your father but now he's saying your father is the devil how can he go from Abraham's not your father to your father's the devil he says because you seek to kill me why because the devil hates the word and the devil tries to destroy the word so if there's a spirit inside anyone who tries to destroy the word amen that's the devil amen the origin is the devil Jesus made it so simple right here amen I'm not talking about somebody who doesn't understand the word I'm not talking to somebody who doesn't see it there's lots of people who are not predestinated they can't see it amen but they don't hate it they don't fight it they don't try to destroy it they just say I don't understand it amen God will deal with them and there can even be a reward for somebody like that if they're able to honor the word in whatever fashion they can find it in or receive it in that's not what I'm talking about but Jesus come to people who were trying to destroy the manifested word trying to destroy the Son of God trying to destroy attributes of God and he says your father is the devil if God were your father you would love me because I proceeded and came forth from him amen that means if we proceeded forth from God everything that proceeds forth from God we love and you wonder why you love this message so much why do you love the message so much because the message is the word of God the message proceeded forth from God it was a thought in God's mind it was a secret in the back part of God's mind and it came forth as word amen and now that word is coming into manifestation and bride form amen and how could you not love it you have to love it if you came from God of God where your father you would love everything that proceeds forth from God this is why you know when people claim to believe the message but they don't receive what prophet taught they brother men will clearly teach things and he'll explain it he'll tell why it's got to be this way and people throw it away whether it's a marriage and divorce whether it's ministers must marry a virgin or whatever Prophet they'll throw it away and say I love the message but my goodness who do you think this was who do you think was preaching where did he get it from I mean what what is being taught what is being priests amen I want to throw this away and throw that away amen we don't even understand you find yourself fighting against the word of God the very nature of God Amen the word on display why and we claim to believe it we claim to love it we claim to love the message but but somehow we don't we don't like the way he taught about women's dress we don't like the way he talked about gender roles we don't like those things how could you not like those things that came from the messenger that came from God [Music] amen amen so we have to check ourselves and say am I here by religious order or am I here because my heart is engaged with the word because if you're here by religious order amen you can you can make the gospel of none effect teaching for Doctrine the traditions of man and that could creep back into the message because they begin to teach Traditions that made them more religious and they had workarounds for the word of God you realize that Jesus Jesus even begins to scold them because the word of God says honor your father and mother but you say if I take what I'm supposed to support you with and I give it to the treasury then I'm more blessed and they had a whole tradition to work around the Commandment of God is that right oh do you think that Spirit died in that day a spirit's still alive and I'm not even supposed to be preaching this right now there's something else I want to say but there's a reason there's a reason Jesus says if you if you if your father was God you would love me for our proceeded force from God say we love this message but I don't love this part and I don't love this part and I'm going to take some man's tradition mix it in and I'll find a church that suits my day I say let's go back to square one let's strip all of that down and say God you have got to change me and make me match your word you've got to Quicken something to me that will love all of the word all of the message amen whatever this Prophet taught amen there's a reason that it was taught and there's a reason you let it stand and there's a reason you Vindicated it there's a reason behind it there's a purpose behind it I'm not here to cut it in or cut it out I'm just here to say God that was you amen you've indicated you backed it up you didn't let any of his words fall to the ground how am I going to cut and dice and slice and remove D but I'm going to say God this proceeded forth from you and I'm accepting it and receiving it and if we can't do that we need to get back down on our knees and say God you've got to awaken a c Gene inside of me that'll love all of your word [Music] praise be to God praise be to God brother remember says in time tested memories of God he said you see a man's character is made known by his works whatever you are your Works prove what you are no matter how much you testify whatever you say Pro or con that has nothing to do with it your Works tell what you are tell us what you are inside we begin to manipulate by our own thinking the word it's beginning to tell a story we need to come back and say God I want to surrender more of myself I want to die more so that word can live more I want to read one more scripture together out of Romans chapter 10. Romans chapter 10. verse 8. but what says that the word is 90 even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made into salvation the Apostle Paul never makes salvation based on just your heart or just your confession but he takes the outward and the n-word and he makes them both together the same we cannot be saved just by what goes on on the inside with no outside expression whatsoever neither can we only have an outside expression with nothing inside but when the inside and the outside line up then we're talking salvation well the REM said in Elijah in the meal offering said oh there it was and when they walked into the fiery furnace under trial under a test they held true to the end but God was there just in a spare of a moment and he delivered them they know that they were prayed up their sins were confessed they know they'd met every requirement and yet he seemed to be silent he's only silent to test you to see really what you are what's on the inside of you see if you really mean from your heart what you're saying with your lips let that go deep we can say with our lips but is our heart saying it we say we love the message but is our heart saying it and if our heart's saying it is our life saying it they have to match you can't be disjointed amen brother member says and message influence the life that you live proves what's on the inside of you you cannot change that it reflects every person reflects outside what he is inside when Jesus came to Earth Jesus was was constrained by something and that something that constrained him was the will of God Jesus he had a human life he could make choices he can make decisions he could take actions is that right but there was something that constrained him and the thing that constrained him was the will of his father and he says in John 5 19 then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things so ever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise this is where brother Ben takes the scripture and says Jesus only did that which the father showed him he was led by Vision he didn't use his own desires he didn't use his own reactions amen but Jesus was constrained in what constrained him was the will of God and we know the will of God the word of God is the will of God now we come down to the Permian Church days because now I want to come down to you and I said notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the Father John 5 19. this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it well what are we to do we are to do the same thing Jesus did in Jesus being constrained by the will of the father made him the expression of the father is that right let's let's run that again the the father expressed his word amen and as it come out from the father it was a son he took that expression of himself and he made a body of Flesh and he stepped he put the word his expression of himself into bodily form the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the fullness of the godhead was bodily amen and in that bodily form Jesus was constrained by the will of the father and only did that which the father showed him in doing so he he was an exact expression of the thought of God all right do we understand what I'm saying God's thought expressed because he didn't take any other thought only what the father showed him and then pick up your pen and write the angel tells brother Branham he's writing this harmony is now to exist between Christ and his bride he shows her his Word of Life how did he show us the word of life he did it through a prophet in the end time He restored the word he shows us his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it and she doesn't just receive it she acts upon it she's constrained what is the bride constrained by she's constrained by the will of her husband so that she doesn't take her own will her own thoughts her own desires but now there's There's a constraint upon her and she has to have the same Harmony between her and her headship her and the bridegroom her and her husband Jesus Christ as Christ had with the father and that what constrains us now is the word that has been given to us and we receive it we never doubt it that's why listen to these last two quotes now an Easter seal 1965 he says this Messianic anointed one believes that what is the Messiah what is the messiah messiah is the anointed one and now if he was the Messiah by being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of God to be the Redeemer and the anointed one and God raised up that body his bride is the anointed one for this day he was the anointed one for that day now his bride is the anointed one for this day she's anointed to do what she's anointed to manifest the word and she's constrained by the word amen he says an invisible Union of the bride of Christ and Jesus the word took my place he become me that a sinner that I might become him the word Amen Let Me Hold true to it not the church the word oh the spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated oh praise God what day are we living in we're living in the day where that word that was promised for day is becoming flesh where is that word coming into manifestation it's coming to manifestation in his bride how because she's constrained by the word and does only that which your husband wants her to do if he said this is the way it is she says praise God that's all I want let it be that way in me let's all stand are we in the day of the invisible Union where will that invisible Union where will it be expressed it's invisible remember the title of the service tonight the visible declaring the invisible there's an invisible Union do you believe you're part of that invisible Union then the visible part of you is predestined to declare that Union and that Union is between a bride and her bridegroom between a woman and her husband the headship and she now is here to be the submissive wife to give constraint to her own thinking her own desire her own will and give herself over to the will of Christ and in doing that we are the anointed one for this day the word made flesh where is it made flesh oh God let it be made flesh right here oh God help me with a pure heart to surrender completely to your word help me to give up my will help me to give them all myself and everything else and let me lay it down amen and let me take that word upon myself and live it God come and live it through me let me surrender when we die to ourself and take the word we let the word live instead of us when we have a desire when we have a thought and all of a sudden the word checks that thought we have a plan a desire I'd like to do this I'd like to do that but all of a sudden we hear the brother Branham say we read in the Bible we hear somebody preach and all of a sudden this word checks this thought when we die to self we let the word live how do I manifest the word it's easy die to yourself surrender to the word and you'll manifest the word in every form of life when the word amen is a contradictory to self let self die the word will take its place and now it's not you living now it's Christ Living but every time we come and come back head to head with something the prophet taught us something the Bible says and all of a sudden amen through the traditions of manner through some reasoning we we take the word and lay the word to the side and take our own ideas we're now expressing self not the word and now this is not the word made flesh we're not in the purpose of God we're not accomplishing what God sent his word for I say God help me whenever it comes head to head with the word help me die quickly when I find out I've been wrong maybe I've been doing something wrong I've been doing it wrong for years I was ignorant I didn't know but all of a sudden God brings the word on the scene let me quickly say I die to myself so the word can take its place and now I can become more of the word made flesh that's the age that we're living in how are we going to do it how's the bride go up word by word how do you surrender word by word decision by decision day by day amen it wasn't one time at the altar it's all over now no it's every day I'm surrendering a little more every day I'm putting myself lower my desires my will my wants and I'm taking the word and letting the word be my my life letting the word be my decision what's your decision whatever the word says that's my decision what will you do whatever the word says that's what I do and that's how the word is made flesh sometimes we make things too mystical where the the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming the word you can say it's so mystical but there's no practical application you go back out and keep doing the same things we always did manifesting the same life it becomes so mystical now where there were the brides the word made flesh she will be the anointed one for this day if you keep it in the mystical Realms you'll keep living the same way we've always lived but when we bring it down to the practicality and say you know what every time I come into a headbutt a Crossroads with this word I am going to take the word and die to myself and put the word and that is how the word is being made flesh in our day that's why she's the anointed when she's anointed by God to lay down her life and let his life take preeminence that's how we are the anointed one and that's how the bride is the word for this day don't just leave it off mystically it'll magically happen it's magically happening when God convicts your heart when God brings you face to face with the word and something inside of you is willing to die that's that is the mystical part taking place right there that's the mystery becoming unveiled that's the mystical that's the Supernatural That's God dealing in your heart amen don't wait for magic potion and fairy dust and all of a sudden I step into a perfect condition no we're growing into it day by day we're surrendering more and more this is the reality praise God it's a lot harder than we thought 20 years ago we thought God would flip the switch and it's all done and I'm the manifested word no we're becoming word we're going up word by word as the word gets clearer I come in greater subjection as the word comes fresh I'm surrendering more as I see how wrong I was I see my wrong motives I see my wrong desire and also and I Repent I don't repent from doing wrong I Repent from thinking wrong anyway I'm not repenting from I'm not repenting from doing wrong to my brother I'm thinking I'm repenting of thinking wrong about my brother you see how the words bringing more a more reality bringing more manifestation no more white sepulchers but let it be true on the inside and manifest on the outside so that the visible becomes the manifestation of the invisible amen let's bow our heads and pray oh Heavenly Father let this Lord this evening this sermon these words let it become a living reality in US God I so don't want to just rehearse a service have a religious ceremony come and do do time and the sanctuary and go out having performed a religious Duty I so don't want that Lord I don't want this facility to be used for that I don't want to be used for that well we didn't come here for that we came here to be changed we came here to be shaped we came here to be corrected we came here to be taught we came here to be encouraged came here to be strengthened in the Inner Man God I pray that these words would bring a reality to our lives that we would surrender more and more every day God as you Reveal Your word more to us and you bring us deeper into your word may it bring a deeper reality in our hearts may it bring a Deeper Life may it bring more of a union with you more of a pureness in our heart a pureness in our relationship a pureness in our prayers of pureness and our meditations and God made that that Purity manifest on the outside so that the world can see that this word is becoming flesh the flesh is becoming the word for God you promised that you would have a bride without spot or wrinkle you promised that the bride would make herself ready by taking the garments and putting them on that garment is your word on May we put it on may your grace Lord take effect in Our Lives May the word that you sent out May accomplish its purpose in US God I pray that it would prosper in US Prosper to the Manifest manifestation of your word in US so that nothing would hinder it Lord you promised it it'll happen help us to surrender to it Lord we give ourselves afresh to you we love you Lord I ask God
