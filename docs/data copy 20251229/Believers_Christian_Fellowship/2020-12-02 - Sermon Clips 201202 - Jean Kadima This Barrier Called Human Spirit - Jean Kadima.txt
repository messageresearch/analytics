========================================

we always talk about sister ahati right we always say she say the right thing but sometimes we don't talk about before she said the right thing what was going on in your life for example we can see that the church was a building they're building a new place they they want to build a new building if i can say that and then since i had ride took five uh she took uh fifty dollars to give for the building and the deacons all the trustees say no no sister you cannot do that this is six months of your salary how can we do this she he she forced she ended up giving twenty dollars it's still a lot like two months of her salary she gave it for the building and and when brother brown heard it he had money in his pocket he want to give her back that money and when he tried to give to her god said don't you do that but that night he said the right thing amen oh we don't talk about that he was real that's sincerity god is moved but that that real life god is moved by it yes amen but when we do things in the group how can you obtain favor by just following the group i'm not saying following what the other people do is necessarily wrong but usually we find that is we taking other people's spirit on ourself instead of the holy ghost we taking other people's spirits on ourself and we don't have favors with god i found that every many things that we hear by the problem third pool this happened that's happened before that happened it is always something and when you watch it it's people being more real in the devotion passionate about god then god does it
