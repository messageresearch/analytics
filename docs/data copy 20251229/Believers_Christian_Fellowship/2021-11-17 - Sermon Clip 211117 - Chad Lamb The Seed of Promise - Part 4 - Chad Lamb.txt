========================================

so you cannot take that book away from me i have i've eaten the book amen and me and the book have become one i already have the same experience that's spoken of in the scriptures and what brother branham tells us so you can't tell me the seals aren't open but neither can i tell you that the seals are open we all have to go to the message and find out where we are we've got to look into the word and find out where we are amen we're beyond the time of trying to persuade people to see things and we're beyond the time of trying to convince people and we're also beyond the time of trying to feel con convinced ourselves when we can convince somebody else amen this is an individual revelation to one person not a church not a group of people but to the individual that's what brother branham is teaching us after the opening of the seals this is no longer church this is bride this is to one this message came to one it came to you and now i'm not going to get my security from you agreeing with me [Applause] that's where the denominations were and they all fell they all agreed and they all went off the word agreeing that they were right so my security cannot come from you agreeing with me because then we take back another denominational spirit my security can only come when i know that i've met the mighty angel with the open book and i've taken that book and i began to eat that book and it was sweet in my mouth and it was bitter in my belly amen but now there's something in me like a spring of living water flowing out to eternal life that that revelation of the book is coming out of my mouth amen placing me amen in revelation chapter 10 verse 11. you can't put me back in 5 because i'm in 11. i'm in revelation 10 11. you can't take me back to 5-1 now if you're in 5-1 i say keep walking brother there's good roads ahead amen you're on the right path you're on the right trail you're in the book of revelation you're moving down through if you've just come to the message or god's never opened this to you and you're looking at revelations 5 1 and saying we need a lamb to come and take the book i say you're on the right path keep moving down because as you move through that book of revelation in the message of the hour you're going to find that there's a lamb that's come forth to take the book and loose the seven seals thereof
