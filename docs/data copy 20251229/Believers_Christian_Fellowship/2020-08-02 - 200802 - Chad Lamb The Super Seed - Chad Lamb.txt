[Music] pray [Music] [Applause] praise praise you praise you praise [Music] hallelujah praise the lord god bless your friends let's take our bibles while we're standing and turn to galatians chapter 3 and we'll just launch right into the word amen thank god that we can be here together i pray appreciate the atmosphere i pray that god will have his way amongst us galatians chapter 3 verse 7. galatians 3 and 7 will read now ye therefore know ye therefore that they which are faith the same are the children of abraham so how do you become a child of abraham by faith by faith and want by faith in the word amen that's what abraham believed and abraham didn't believe uh he didn't just believe any old word or anything he believed the present tense word amen when god spoke to him he believed it when god's word was when it was time for god's word to be made manifest in that hour amen it was told to abraham abraham received it and he believed it amen making him making god impute righteousness unto him because of his faith and making him the father of faith and so if we can believe the way abraham believed amen you realize it's not so much just believe the same thing abraham believed in a way it is because it's all the word but but it's believed the way abraham believed and how did abraham believe abraham believed the present tense truth amen making him the father of the faith praise be to god so let's keep reading you know therefore that they which are of faith the same or the children of abraham and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying indeed shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham amen you get the same blessing abraham gets if you can believe the same way abraham believed and let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we ask your blessing over the reading of the word god i pray that you would come lord in your divine power by the anointing of your spirit lord you would take this vessel of clay lord and use it to preach your gospel i pray that you would hear through our ears lord and that that word would take root in our lives and bring forth fruit lord while we yield ourselves unto you we come now to hear from you and we pray you would speak clearly to us lord and may your children respond to your voice we ask your blessing over every part of this service that you would have preeminence in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated let's stay in galatians in chapter 3 here and return over to verse 16. now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not unto seeds as of many but as of one and to the seed which is christ this is such an essential scripture if we could just hang on to this for a minute and meditate on this for a moment sit down to abraham and his seed where the promise is made so so the promises are to abraham and to his seed which would be the seed line after him and brother ben tells us it is not his natural seed line not not isaac and and jacob and all of them but this is his faith seed amen abraham's seed which was faith and so now to abraham and his seed were the promise is made so now if you if you are faith amen you receive all the promises of faithful abraham if you're of faith amen so now to his seed where the promise is made he saith not and deceits as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ so christ was the seed of abraham amen so christ was that seed not seeds he's talking about not many he's not talking about many seeds or or or seed lines or diversity he's talking about one seed and that's the faith seed which is christ and all the promises are to that seed which is christ amen and if you have the faith like abraham had you are part of the promises that were to abraham and you become a child of abraham by the faith that abraham have and if you're a child of abraham you're part of that seed and that seed is christ not something else not something minor not something kind of like but it has to be the same thing romans 4 16. turn over the book of romans chapter 4. i want to lay in a few of these scriptures here and i got quite a few quotes i'd like to read if we can romans chapter 4 verse 16. therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all so is abraham your father amen that makes you abraham seed and abraham's seed was not seeds as many but as of one and abraham's seed is christ which is the faith seed and if you have the same faith amen you're part of the same seed praise god and that means all the promises that were given to abraham were given to you praise god colossians chapter 1. we know these scriptures well but it's just nice to lay them in right here in a foundation lay them in here together colossians chapter 1 verse 26. even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory who in you christ in you what is christ he is the seed of abraham and where is the seed of abraham he's with the faithful he's with the children of abraham because that's the seed of abraham which is christ and now and now the great mystery amen that was hid from generations and ages is now made known which is christ in you the hope of glory oh i don't think we understand it right i don't think we can possibly comprehend it the way that it ought to be comprehended because if we comprehended it the way it ought to be comprehended then all of a sudden we would realize i have no problems amen everything is fine amen god has chosen me before the foundation of the world and chose me to be part of christ amen and if i'm part of that i'm part of that promise i'm part of that seed and then everything he promised to abraham which was an unconditional covenant everything that he promised abraham abraham's promise was not like adam's promise on condition if you will i will but it moved into an unconditional promise and he says i will and because he could swear by nothing greater he swore by himself that he would perform his oath and so now we've got a sure promise being part of this seed that god will perform what he promised amen the inheritance will come amen despite amen our conduct our conduct wasn't our conduct and merit wasn't obligatory for this promise this promise supersedes that because he made the promise on his own amen by his own merit and he swore by himself that he would do it regardless of what abraham did praise be to god that gives me a whole lot of hope and consolation now i titled this the supersede and i was reading the message uh last night or yesterday the super sign brother branham titled the super sign but it just struck me about the supersede and i just want to preach on that this morning by the grace of god brother branham says in the message the super sign and he preaches this at the end of 1963 and it's november 29th it says oh god if the world could only see that that god and man are one the super sign the super sign when brother man is preaching super sign what's the super sign the super sign was the first man that god could come into all that god was he poured into christ now brother rem doesn't stop there he's talking about the super sign all that god was he poured into christ and all christ was he poured into the church super sign god and man together what is the super sign the super sign is god and man together oh praise god god and man together that was to be the super sign of the last day when the entire bible was to be fulfilled in the last days what was to be fulfilled in the last days malachi 4 revelation no the entire bible you realize brother man was not saying you know it's just this verse in this verse and we know the verses that apply to the day and age we live in we can pull them up amen and we talk about luke 17 30 and malachi 4. amen we talk about revelations 10 1-7 but but friends brother brennan said in the end time amen it's to be the manifestation of the entire bible because the entire bible is one story one goal one purpose that god had in his mind and he's been letting it out down through generations and down through the old testament amen to finally let it out let it out let it out until finally there was a man standing on earth that encompassed all that word and then from him was taking a portion amen that he could have a bride amen and over through the new testament he was letting it out building it up building it up building up until finally amen he would declare that she's on earth and the headstone now will come to unite with that bride that's the whole bible the whole purpose of the bible is god amen god god god god moving into flesh amen expressed as male and female united as one and put back into eden again so the end time is when he's going to fulfill all the word when the entire bible was to be fulfilled in the last days a super sign a virgin shall conceive and this conception when it's brought forth will be god manifested in the flesh a super sign they still don't believe it but it was anyhow it's still a super sign no to super sign they've got superman today they got fictions of superman all these other kind of super things but the church has got a super sign god back in the church manifesting in human flesh god united with man his sure super sign his sure super sign notice the eternal sign an unfailing sign it will never fail man and the word and man becoming one when god's word and man become one as saint john the first chapter says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us that's the super sign the super sign is when the word amen when the word is made flesh and dwells among us and we can see that amen in jesus christ amen when he come on earth the word was made flesh and dwell among us that was a super sign but when that prophet was here on the scene amen that was the word made flesh what word luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 amen malachi 4 it was the very word of god amen that was materialized amen through the flesh of a human being amen and when that word was being fleshed out luke 17 30 was being demonstrated and fleshed out amen that was a super sign it was god and man the word and men becoming one and manifesting the word was the super sign it's an eternal sign an unfailing sign the word and man becoming one oh if that was the super sign of that day when that same spirit that was on jesus christ comes into his church to manifest the written word for today that is still the super sign friends it's still the super sign amen there's no i mean there's no uh if we want to see a super sign there's no pointing back to something else amen because there's a super sign on earth today let's just keep going and talk about this for a little bit the same message that prophets prophets are the chief sign god's chief sign is a prophet and i'm going to speak a few minutes about that they are his word made manifest for the age and that's the reason the prophet is always god's chief sign he has never sent a judgment upon the earth without first sending a prophet you see and search the scriptures a prophet is the chief sign of god to his people that he has sent this person this certain person like noah like moses like elijah and the prophets he sends them to manifest the word for that age to give his people a warning so the the chief sign amen is is a prophet i mean we saw that chief sign and john the baptist when he came as a prophet to announce the forerunning of jesus christ and brother branham now became a chief sign to the age amen because he came to fulfill the word to take the word and make it live he became the word in this age what word luke 17 30 the revealing of the son of man what word uh revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel what word he actually took the word and took it on flash and fleshed out the word and that was a sign to this age and so in the same message super sign i'm going to read several quotes out of this message as we build this platform so watch let's take the path of abraham just for a moment a type of his seed abraham the prophet watch god had spoken to him in many ways since he had left the chaldea the city of ur he had traveled along and god had showed him many great signs appeared to him showed him all kinds of things that would happen told him what would take place all these things he has told him but before he received his promised son he was standing near the gates of the gentiles just above sodom and before he received his super son or a son that was to be born a super son of course before he received him not the royal one now but before he received him he received the super sign what was it god came down to him in the form of a man notice that man that talked with him that stood at the tent where he was at performed a super sign and when his super son came on the scene his super son performed the same sign to show that he was abraham's supersede glory and he promised the same thing in the last days do you see what i mean abraham before just before the promised son arrived as we're looking for now abraham's seed royal seed that was the natural seed this is the royal seed when the natural seed got their sign they rejected it so have we nothing but the royal seed still the church seed will still reject it again so when it come time for abraham to receive the promise remember we're benefactors of every promise abraham would receive and so he had a promise he was going to receive a promised son amen but before he could receive that promised son there had to be a super sign given and that super sign would be when god would come down himself and he would take material of the earth and he would build out of it a body a man that he could step into and brother baby said this man ate and this man drank and this man had dust on his feet abraham watched his feet he said it was a man amen he made a body a man and he came down into the flesh of a man and he stood there amen before abraham and what was the sign he showed he showed the sign of the messiah amen by discerning the thoughts of sarah and the tent behind him amen and so the the pattern is laid out amen before the super and before the promise can be fulfilled there had to be a super sign that come first and the super sign that came first was god and man becoming one now see god in that day elohim he didn't have a body that he could work through like that amen so he had the first he had to create a temporary body this was a temporary body he came to abraham in because after he left he said that body just went back to the elements of the earth it was a temporary body that he came in amen because the way hadn't been paved yet for god to come into human flesh but the next time amen that he was going to come and show a super sign it was going to be when jesus christ came on the earth amen in that body amen was a virgin born body there was no sin in that body and when he was born now there was a body that elohim could dwell in and now he come now he came and this time he showed another super sign and he showed the sign of god and man becoming one amen but now it was a body that had been birthed through a woman first it was a body that was created by the hand of god temporary faded away next it was a body that was created in the womb of mary amen that was actually birth he birthed his own body that he could live in a virgin birth a sinless birth he meant so that he could dwell in that and that vessel would become that it would be the lamb of god that would take away the sins of the world amen and so now at the end of time he promised that same thing would repeat again only now the work of redemption has so thoroughly been done that he can take a sin-born body of flesh and he can do the same thing god did and a hand handmade body of flesh had that handmade body of flesh that god made hadn't sinned amen hadn't been born hybrid hadn't come of a man of a woman he brought it up so he could dwell in it temporarily so that he could show the super sign amen and then he could leave and that body would go back to the elements but the next one would be virgin born amen having no sin so he could live in it but that virgin-born body would pay the price for all the rest of the seed and then at the end of time to prove how thoroughly he has redeemed his children amen god would do the same thing he did on the planet uh before abraham and sarah he would do the same thing that he did in jesus christ now he would do it the same thing from a man that was born in sin shaped in iniquity come through hybridization amen born amen in the lowly hills of kentucky why what's he showing he's showing how thorough the redemption is the super sign down is the same thing that it was when abraham here it was the same thing in jesus christ it's the same thing that's repeated again in this generation and it's proving the redemption process is complete oh hallelujah that should give us a whole lot of courage friends there was no body no physical body for elohim to step into when abraham was here when jesus came he had to come sinless but birth through a woman so that there was a body he could step into but through the process of redeeming his bride when he comes to the end of time he's going to do the same thing it's been done three times elohim and a handmade body elohim and a sinless birth body elohim in a hybrid body born in sin to show the super sign the super sign declaring the full power of redemption let's keep moving forward he says now watch the super sign god come down in the form of a man and performed a sign and his back turned to the tent and asked where sarah was and abraham said she's in the tent behind you now remember the gentiles were fixing to be burned just like it it is now the gentile world is to be destroyed by fire we know that so he come down amen brother baby says there was three angels that came down took on bodies of flesh amen as elohim and two angels and and one stayed with abraham the called out group amen but two and he types him with he shows them as oral roberts and billy graham went down into sodom and blinded them by the gospel amen brother ben was so clearly identifying the the the type in the shadow where we're at in time by laying it all out amen they're right there sodom in the sodom condition god coming down to judge sodom amen and it's repeated again in this day he says it says look at the track of the church it's coming up through luther through wesley through pentecost denominations we've had revelations and other kinds of things we've had speaking in tongues we've had gifts of healing we've had every manifest everything manifested but look right at the end time before the burning and the destroying the super sign mysteriously appears mysteriously right on the scene again before us amen god himself not a man but god made manifest a super sign an everlasting sign an eternal sign a super sign god manifested in the flesh same signs that his son did his super son promised the same at the end as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man the super sign will return you know brother ben's preaching he's preaching the super sign and he's preaching this and he's laying it out and it's not a long message he's laying out in shreveport and he's calling out to them to shake themselves away wake up to the hour that we're in he says you've been good to me you've fed me amen you fed my children you've clothed my children he says but you've got to wake up and recognize what's going on and he's laying it out so plain he's saying there was two that went there they were right there at the time at the end of the gentile world and sodom and gomorrh were going to be born burned and jesus christ said amen that day amen so shall it be as it was in sodom so and lot's day so shall it be amen at the revealing of the son of man he said what will he do he'll show a super sign again what he did then he'll do again and brother bam comes to the end of the sermon and he starts the discernment which is the sign of the messiah amen and he says so you'll know he said i'll turn my back he starts calling out people in the balcony and calling out people over here calling out people over here why he's trying to wake them up to the fact that the super sign is here amen god and man is connected again like he was when elohim came to abraham like he was when jesus christ was on the earth anything how how in the world can that be because we're come to the end of redemption for the gentile pride amen she's come through the cycle of redemption she's been purified and washed by the watering of the word amen so that he could come down and connect in such a way to prove amen that to prove the day and age that we live in praise be to god he says the super sign will return and the message this day the scripture is fulfilled it says that was the royal seat of abraham and here that royal seat of abraham which came because of that identification of that man sitting there with abraham come to prove it was the same god promised in this day as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when he is revealing himself as son of man this is the day for this scripture to be fulfilled brother man is making it clear this is the day for that scripture to be fulfilled when he says he says as it was in sodom this is what brother bram says as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when when he is revealing himself the son of man so i want you to see as as brother bram says over and over and over again you can connect the revealing of the son of man luke 17 30 the revealing of the son of man is the coming of the son of man it is his coming the coming of the son of man he comes and reveals himself the coming of the son of man is the revealing of the son of man amen you can't reveal who's not come and so brother branham is standing there showing amen that was what was in that man that talked to abraham is now come what was there in jesus christ amen when he met the woman in samaria by the well and said hey you know go and get your husband and she says i i you know she says i don't have a husband he says you've told the truth you've had five and the one you're with now is not your own amen what's he doing brother baby showing that same life amen that same elohim that was in that body of flesh is now in this body of flesh doing the same sign and brother man says you know that's not me he said a man can't do these things he said i don't know you're a perfect stranger to me who did you touch you didn't touch me you touched him who's him it's the son of man the revealing of the son of man is the coming of the son of man they are linked together and so we see the super sign of his presence the super sign of his coming brother bram says again in the super sign he says now you all can't be that one he's talking about the prophet he's talking about that that super sign of elohim speaking through flesh giving the sign of the messiah he said now you all can't be that one but you can be part of that with your faith i'm part of it i'm absolutely part of it amen because that amen that oh that revealing of the son of man showing the coming of the son of man amen was a part of brother ben's ministry was that of john the baptist to forerun his second coming is that true the four won his second coming amen but the second coming amen was so mysterious that the second coming came amen and demonstrated itself in the same vessel that was declaring his coming so when john the baptist was here declaring his coming amen when he come he come in another vessel and that vessel declared john's ministry to be correct but in the end time the one declaring is coming amen that that coming of the lord will also come down in demonstration and manifestation through the forerunner and prove what the forerunner was telling that's what the sign of the messiah does it's nothing more than jesus christ in flesh so now you all can't be that one but you can be part of that with your faith why am i part of that because that demonstration amen of the son of man coming the son of man coming did not stop with brother branham but he came and how did he come he come to unite with the bride he come amen this this second coming the coming of the son of man amen we see it and brother branham typed out demonstrated perfectly beautiful showing that he is here but when brother branham left amen the son of man didn't leave amen the son of man the purpose of of elijah coming was an eleazer ministry amen to take and unite isaac with rebecca to bring the two together so that what so that it can reveal the son of man again that's improving his word so how am i part of it i'm part of it because that son of man amen has come down to unite with the bride to be amen the bride coming of christ he's already come in his flesh body as husband and now he's come to be demonstrated in the body of his bride just like adam and eve adam had already come and adam was eve he had already come he had already had manifestations on the earth amen but god was going to lay adam down and pull apart out of adam and he was going to form amen the wife of adam the bride of adam misses adam i mean she was going to be upon the earth amen then he was going to rise up adam again and unite the two together what was the woman she was just a further expression of adam she was adam he was adam she was adam what was inside of her adam what was she made out of adam what life was in her adam what spirit was in her adam praise be to god that's how i'm identified with when i see that super sign that super sign indicates that there's a super seed and i'm part of that supersede i don't have to replicate what brother brenham did i'm part of it by faith because it was here proving there's a supersede on earth and i'm part of that super seed that super race brother bam says now i'll finish reading this quote before we move on now you all can't be that one but you can be part of that with your faith all of them couldn't be jesus when they was on earth but they could believe him and accept the message there was one moses one elijah one noah on down always been that but the rest of them could accept it and they could have had no ministry unless there had been somebody believe it jesus would have had no ministry unless somebody believed it paul would have had no ministry unless somebody believed it the holy ghost has got no ministry by the word today unless somebody is willing to get away from their creed and come back to the word again i'm part of it by faith and the message of modern events made are made clear by prophecy it says jesus when he when he come he was to be a prophet that's right and today before jesus comes again the full manifestation of the purpose of jesus christ is to be made manifest in flesh think of it as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed did you catch it let's read it slowly as it was in the days of sodom and sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed so the coming of the son of man is the day the son of man is being revealed praise god has the son of man been revealed has the son of man come this is the coming of the son of man and he's still coming but what form is he coming in he's coming in bride form and what is the bride form supposed to do reveal the son of man praise god what is revealed unfolded made known the secret had been brought forth revealed in the day that the son of man will be revealed the world will be in a sodom condition we've got it haven't we oh how many believes that in a sodom condition and that's exactly right look where it's sitting now remember there's always three groups of people and every bunch of people you gather that's make believers unbelievers and believers we have there in every group they have them they had them all in all time there was the sodomites there was the loddites and there was abraham and abraham was a called out group and he wasn't in sodom to begin with now watch their message they had been looking for a promised son looking for it for years god had showed abraham many great signs and wonders but here god came down himself like a man you said that was an angel abraham called him lord capital l-o-r-d and any reader of the bible knows that the capital l-o-r-d is elohim in the beginning god lord god elohim the all-sufficient one abraham call him the lord god elohim now notice there was two people that went down into sodom with the message and they preached the sodomites they didn't perform nothing but blinded them which preaching the gospel does blind the unbeliever but watch what kind of sign the abraham group received now we are supposed to be the royal seed of abraham isaac was the natural seed but the faith seed the faith in the promised word the promised word don't miss it was that royal seed that was the seed the promised word was the royal seed amen it's always been the word the royal seed is the word amen christ is what the word amen god is the word christ is the word the bride is the word the royal seed is the word amen christ is the word the word is god praise be to god was the royal seed that was that was the seed abraham's faith i want to go back and read that slow because at first it's easy to miss we are supposed to be the royal seed of abraham isaac was the natural seed but the face seed the faith in the promised word the promised word don't miss it was the royal seed that was the seed abraham's faith what was the seed abraham's faith faith in the promised word of god produced the seed we being dead in christ we're abraham's seed heirs with him according to the promise abraham's seed is christ and we are abraham seed are you abraham's seed abraham seed is christ we're abraham's seed we are christ that's a big statement to make but when you recognize it's not the hybridization we're talking about it's not the birth from natural parents we're talking about but it's that seed that gene of god that attribute of god down on the inside that is the word of god and that word of god has got to come into manifestation in this age and it's got to manifest what it was spoke for what it was placed for amen when god had a thought in his mind that thought had a purpose amen and that thought a word is a thought expressed so that means that attribute that's laying in us was a thought that was in god's mind and that thought was something he wanted to express the thought amen was something that needed an expression amen when it was expressed that's the word so what are the believers the word in the book what book the lamb's book of life who's the lamb christ so the lamb's book of life who are the believers the words written in the book that means we are the word the thought of god something god wanted to portray something god wanted to manifest was his thought amen so he recorded it in the lamb's book of life or i'll rephrase it and hopefully you don't think i'm sacrilegious the book of life of the lamb male and female your marriage certificate your book of redemption the record of the royal seed the book of christ the lamb's book of life the record coming forth of the seed again in super sign it says watch watch what the bible said what is the super sign is the word made manifest in every age is that right well why couldn't they believe jesus when hebrews 4 said the word of god is quicker more powerful than a two-edged sword cutting asunder that is when it's preached in its power it cuts right and left two edge cuts both ways what is it cuts plum to the morrow of the bone and what else does it do discerns the thoughts in the heart they couldn't believe him but he was discerning the thoughts in their hearts they they didn't want to believe the manifestation in this day coming through that prophet that forerunner amen they wouldn't believe it but he was discerning the thoughts of their heart but i want to bring it on down home because it's the word the word is a discerner of the thoughts intents of the heart and how many times have you sat in service here and had your thoughts discerned by the word what is it showing it shows that the supersede is here and the super sign is still here amen only it's not going to be one man and a prophetic ministry turning us back to the crowd it's going to be a man with no gift of discernment that has no idea what you're going through amen but we'll just take the inspiration of the word and the word will come down and be a discerner of the thoughts and intents in your heart and in your life and the discussion you had last night and the conversation you had with your wife this morning and the very thing that you've been hiding from everybody else and then god will come and bring his word and cut and separate the morrow and the bone and discern between the thoughts and the intents of the heart what is it it's the super seed it's this royal seed amen it's the word made manifest it's the same discernment that was there in another form why because the word is the discerner if we really catch that the word is a discerner and he is the word and the bride is the manifestation of the word she's united with the word and now she's preaching the word and its power and preaching the word and its power is discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart if we could catch it we would quit chasing after gifts we would quit looking for somebody to solve my problems somebody to fix this and so somebody to rise on the scene that can tell me all my problems we would quit looking for that and we would sit down and say god you have opened the book in this day you have given us your word amen and you're here amen you're here in your fullness amen to bring us the word i have a need there's something in my life and nobody else knows it but you're still the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart if you are the word and you're the living word and you're living in your bride then i can hear amen that word coming through your bride and the evidence that you're here is that word will discern my thoughts and intents in my heart that word amen will repeat the conversation in the king's bed chamber back to him again see god's doing it in such a way we can't all be that one we can't all be the moses we can't all be the jesus but we can believe it by faith but god in the transition he moved from forerunner and to the thing he forerunned which was the bride coming of christ and brother branham said well the bride they asked brother ben will the bride have a ministry he said of course of a ministry it's a great ministry it's going on now and it consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors and if we have the right attitude towards the word of god we realize it's not a man it's not this man that man this other man i mean forget the names it doesn't matter it's got to be the word we're going to look past the man amen and see that that's a vessel chosen of god to bring the word and the word is a discerner of thought the word is my husband the word is my headship the word is what i need brother branham came he showed exactly what was showed to abraham he came and he showed exactly what was demonstrated through jesus christ proving that the son of man was here but something else happened next let's go to isaiah chapter seven keep moving through this as we work our way down isaiah chapter 7. therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel which means god is with us brother branham called this an everlasting sign there's a sign god says i'll give you a sign and brother branham says it's an everlasting sign and that sign is a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and call his name god with us brother branham told us he said in this day this bride will fulfill all that was spoken of the virgin this day this bride will fulfill all that was spoken of the virgin what was spoken of the virgin a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and we'll call his name god is present tense with us which god the one that was in that body on the plains of memory the one that was in the body of jesus christ amen through the cycle of redemption amen has completed a redemption cycle so that he can come back into the virgin bride amen who's conceived on the perfect virgin word making her a virgin bride and what has she reconceived on she's conceived on the royal seed and what is she bringing forth she's bringing forth the life of the son what is it what is it what is she bringing forth emmanuel god with us what day are we living in the day that the virgin shall conceive and bring forth the promised sign and his name shall be emmanuel this isn't this is a sign but brother man said this is an everlasting sign what happened then is repeating spiritually now it was natural there it is supernatural now but the man says back in the super sign a virgin shall conceive and from that time god and man will be one united together an everlasting eternal sign a super sign an everlasting eternal sign a super sign is what god and man becoming one how did god a man become one when the virgin conceived and brought forth the son he said but the super sign still god ever remains true to that super sign it's god in man manifesting his written word friends what is the super sign i i i hope i hope that we can all move and transition in our thinking and move away from elohim and mamrie move away amen from from elohim and jesus christ move away from the manifestation in brother branham what is the super sign now the super sign now is god and man becoming one it's the super sign and it's so humble amen the world is missing the super sign it's so humble amen it's in a humble group of people amen brother branham amen when he come and preached the seals he said think something like that when i preached a week ago on sunday i mean god in simplicity how did i know it would be like that what was he preaching he's preaching the seventh seal he's preaching the coming of the lord he's preaching the whole book open so i know it comes in such a simple way amen through a simple preacher in a simple building to simple people and a little brick building on the corner of eighth and penn street in jeffersonville indiana what was happening amen the greatest thing in the scriptures was unfolding and in such a humble way people drove by people walked by people lived nearby amen had no idea what was happening but the mighty god was being unveiled the seals would be taking off and his bride was being called out and put on display but the super sign i'm reading this quote again is still god ever remains true to that super sign it's god and man manifesting his written word his word when he the holy ghost is come upon you he'll reveal these things show them to you and will show you things to come hebrews 13 8 jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever exactly in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says this is god's great mystery of love expressed that god and man became one what's the love story god and man becoming one it's the love story still today and it's a love story to you and i what does god want to do with us become one with us god what did he call us for what do you want us to do in this life are we here to support a church work are we here to are we here to just listen to tapes you go call us to listen to tapes they're going to call us just to say that brother branham was a prophet he called us for more than that he called he's calling for another super sign and it's going to take a supersede to produce the super sign and that supersede is christ the royal seed of abraham see whatever he is she is he came from her whatever he is she is can't be anything different if he's the word she's the word if he was immanuel she has to be immanuel if he was god with us she has to be god with us god and man became one see the whole thing is god and man one god and man was one there and god and man is one here really god of man was one there back when jesus christ was on the earth and god and man is one here what is it being filled with his spirit him having the preeminence that was god's achievement god's that's god's purpose to do that that he might be in christ in christ in us and all of us together one the holy spirit same thing it revealed it to christ reveals it here and supernatural and the supernatural creative power oh my the same god that could say that to moses let there become frogs the same one could stand up there let this water be turned to wine see amen is that right he's the same god the same one he might even be the same one that says let there be squirrels where there was no squirrels he just don't change it's god and man that's his manifestation that's what he's revealing that's what he's trying to do in god's own word revealing it shows that man cannot create god is the creator it ain't man no more it's god the creator in man which is his church now amen he's not mincing words it's god and man amen which is his church now the dispensation has changed further in christ as the mystery of god revealed you think i'm beside myself i'm not we've got the devil's answer not me that liveth but christ the word living in me it's not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he's promised it here it is he said it would be here and here it is we got his answer christ has risen has paid the price for our redemption want god in christ manifested he gave that flesh that in the blood then in the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed that god in his redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day he did it and brother branham brother branham had prophecy that he had to fulfill he had scriptures that he had to fulfill and he fulfilled those scriptures proving amen he was the word on display the word made manifest amen but those scriptures are not our portion of fulfill they've already been fulfilled but there's bride scriptures that have to be fulfilled today and that's our portion of the word to bring forth in this day as a bride amen we don't have to repeat what's been done in another day we don't have to repeat another work in other scriptures amen but the full measure of the words come to be displayed and christ united with his bride the two becoming one and going back to the promise we've got portions of the word to fulfill amen and he's going to fulfill that through us we are the vessels we're not looking for another vessel we are the vessels amen this is the display of god back in christ the mystery of god revealed again he says oh if i could get the world to see that why there you are there is the body of christ living standing redeemed redeemed oh my justified in his sight why why are we justified we are his victory the church is his victory he came forth in his last days with the glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory listen no matter how much you want to display christ he wants it worse see we've got victory when we overcome we have victory when but it's his victory we are his victory i mean we're proof of his victory we're proof of his life amen why why did he come and die he came and died he gave of himself so that he could redeem a bride amen so we are his great achievement we are his great victory that he would have a bride in this day that would stand on his word and display the full word that's his achievement that's his victory that's his goal it's not just something we conjured up it's not just something that that we want to do it's something he wants to do through us we just have to yield him to his hand and believe what he's doing and let him do the the work is his victory he came forth in the last days with his glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory i mean when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us that's right and we already potentially arise because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational creeds to eternal word of the eternal god which is him himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever and then the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that same word moves from the head as the day comes close down in the body down into the body vindicating that they are one they are husband and wife their flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of a spirit so how much different is she than him flesh of his flesh this is the day that the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh where pinch yourself if you're the bride of jesus christ if you're the elect pinch yourself this is the day that the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming the word what is that that's his victory not yours his victory flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of the spirit amen how do you know it bears the same record same fruit same word see manifest christ same life same god same spirit same word same book amen same signs the things that i do show you also oh hallelujah my notice the vindicated word in his body is his very victory and the reason of his death the vindicated word in me make it personal you the vindicated word in you the vindicated word in me is his victory and the reason of his death why did he die so that i would be here fully redeemed by the purchase of his blood so that he could live in me and live his life through me not to be a church member not to be but to be him on display in the way that he wants to display himself through me not the way i want him to display himself but the way he wants to display himself through me through every circumstance through every trial through every family ordeal through every misunderstanding through everything that we face he wants to express his word in every situation in our lives no matter how bad we want it he wants it worse see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell and preached to the souls in prison that right his face only died then he raised it up again and quickened it quicken means made alive his flesh which was his body and that's the word it's been laying dead for years guess this brother bam is talking about jesus christ the word it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation and now she is standing upon her feet what is it it's him but she's on her feet it's it let's read it again it's it's tricky what's he talking about he says quickens made alive his flesh which was his body and that's the word it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation and now she's standing upon her feet oh how i wish i had time to go back into ezekiel and pull out them dry bones and show you he said can these bones live again he said prophesy how can prophecy come only through the prophet it's the word of the lord here you dry bones the word of the lord and sin you skin came upon them and they stood up a mighty army and began to march toward zion glory to god that's him that's him the victory let's turn to ezekiel and read this he said oh how he wished he had time to go into it but praise god we got time we got time to go into it ezekiel 37 i just want to take my time brother brennan felt rushed i don't want to feel rushed pull your mask off and get a little oxygen to get the brain cells working again just pop it back on i was going to see if the trustees could put in oxygen little tubes so everybody can have oxygen so we don't get too sleepy you awake praise god let's go to ezekiel 37. ezekiel 37 verse 1 the hand of the lord was upon me and carrying me out in the spirit of the lord set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold they were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry they were they're not dry they were very dry they weren't dead they were really dead they were so dead they were back down the bones and them bones were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered oh lord god thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh you dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter unto you and you shall live and i will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that i am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when i beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then said into me prophesying to the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came unto me unto them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army we go back to the quote that we're reading from brother branham he's talking before this he said the vindicated word in his body is his victory and the reason of his death see he says quicken means made alive his flesh which was his body that's the word it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation and now she's standing on her feet he says oh oh how i wish i had time to go back into ezekiel so he's tying this with this happening in ezekiel about the dry bones because you realize before you can have dry bones in a valley of dry bones you had to have living beings amen the church had to be alive at one point there had there had to have been a an axe church there had to have been a church that was alive and been filled with the spirit of god amen but through four stages amen it's come down amen to bones a valley full of dry bones in the dark ages and it was dead and it was like it was dead and brother branham types it with christ the word amen which is his body and he said it laid like it was dead but now in the reformation and the reformation it becomes to come back again in in ezekiel when he prophesies after he prophesies there's three stages that the body goes through bones come to bones sinew grows on the bones and then they're covered in flesh justification sanctification baptism in the holy ghost but yet they're not living yet there's got to be a fourth stage not the three stages they were standing there they were standing on their feet again they looked like a church pentecost looked like a church looked like an army standing on their feet everything armor body everything but it didn't have the life of him yet amen had everything but he himself and he said now he says prophesy again prophesy again and call for the winds to come and he wrote and they come and they were a mighty a great army but i want to tell you friends that army wasn't a new army it was the same army that went down it was the body of christ and the body of christ is coming back and now represented in you and i because why the word has come back and where is the word come back to the word has come back to a people amen the word has not come back to books the word has not come back to tape the word has not come back to ink but the word has come back to flesh to be fleshed out in his body which is his church [Music] four stages of destruction four stages to come back and that last that last stage amen through the prophet was calling the the life to come back the wind the spirit amen and he's been bound the holy ghost has been bound for nearly 2 000 years at the at the river denominational rivers but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy ghost the wind the breath the life back into the church again to be what the same great army that went down the same thing that went down has called us back when when god came in flesh to show the sign of the messiah when he came to as elohim in a temporary body on the plains of memory when he came there amen he came and he showed a super sign of discernment to show him that there's a son coming but how was that sun going to come that sun was going to come amen when abraham and sarah were turned back to their youthful condition again when abraham amen typing the word when the word has come back but if abraham gets made young again amen there still will do no good because abraham needs a wife he needs a bride to reproduce himself so if you're going to bring the word back if you're going to bring abraham back to a young condition amen you have no option but to bring his bride back too so if the word is going to come back amen if abraham's coming back sarah has to come back to youthful condition too amen said that there can be a conception so that she can receive the promised son and the word is come back in our day amen but it doesn't do any good just to bring a word back in written form amen if you don't bring amen the bride back to receive that word to conceive on the word to bring forth the son of man again so these dry bones can they live thou knowest thou knowest prophesy how can they live only by prophecy how will they prophesy only with the prophet and we've had the prophet in this day amen to speak the word that'll bring life to the dry bones to bring it back amen to the place that it's fallen from to what to be a mighty army the army of the lord the flesh body of jesus christ on the earth that he's working through in this day it says in the message spoken word is the original seed now notice now in this god foresaw and predestinated a world of sons and daughters what did god want he wanted a world of sons and daughters that was his original that's what he saw that's what he foresaw that's what he wanted that's what adam and eve were supposed to produce they were supposed to bring forth christ now remember christ is that royal seed christ is that promised seed amen and if things would have been done correctly back then the child would have come forth would have been christ and then they would have had more and more and more so would the first one have been christ what would the rest of them been if they brought forth christ the first time the next time well that'll be christ he's the big brother everybody else is just some sub species no they would have brought forth christ and they could have called his name seth could have called his name abel could have called his name noah could have called him moses could have called it chad could have called it bob do you realize that's how we were supposed to come originally but the fall disrupted that amen broke it down but it's still god's desire it's still what he wants to have amen and all of his children together are the royal seed are christ we've come and fallen flesh we've come through hybridization but it doesn't change the seed that's on the inside amen the seed that's on the inside is still what it was originally meant to be in the beginning but now it has to come through a fallen condition and work its way back up that way it's like the pawn literally brother branham talks about born down in the mucking mire and pushes its way to the light and pushes his way to the light and finally breaks forth the light and shows what it is on the inside but you're not in your ought to be conditioned but in your ought to be conditioned you should have been born perfect amen you should have come forth perfect all the way back in the garden of eden because he wanted a world he foresaw a world inhabited with sons and daughters and he is going to have that world friends and it's going to be it's going to be the father amen and he's going to have his family which is christ male and female praise be to god notice now in this god foresaw and predestinated a world of sons and daughters he predestinated him to be there and because of hybriding disbelieving god's word caused the hybriding god has put it right back again that you don't have to be hybrid any more you can come right back to the original word and be a son of god just like you was supposed to be at the beginning oh friends this is so absolutely the truth amen i know we've got struggles and i know we mess up and i know we make our mistakes and we've got our fusses and we've got all these things that go on in us amen but we don't have to be hybrid anymore amen there's been a word that has come forth to wash away our hybridization and bring us back amen to bring that seed to life which that seed was to be you in the beginning that was what was supposed to come forth amen but now that seed come forth and the wrong kind of flesh amen and receive the wrong kind of spirit but praise god amen there's a word that's come to wake up the real you and bring forth that real you that will begin to take dominion over all of this false and we still got the troubles we still got all these things that that plague us and tempt us and trouble our minds and trouble our spirits it's still there but friends if we can keep getting under the washing of water of the word amen and keep bringing life to the seed life to the seed life to deceit it'll rise up in greater dominion and greater dominion until there's such a dominion it will change the flesh into what god's original idea was god made an earth to take you out of because his original idea was to have a world full of sons and daughters he put the elements on the earth and and on the earth for your body amen not to be corrupted and hybrid but to be perfect and this plan of redemption is taking us back to that idea that he had in his mind sons and daughters and glorified flesh upon this earth we don't have to be hybrid anymore we don't have to be in a hybrid condition anymore there's a word here to lift us out of that and keep lifting and keep lifting and keep lifting don't get discouraged because your flesh hasn't changed yet just let it keep lifting and keep lifting and keep lifting until it all changes he's changing us from glory to glory the inside has changed born again new birth changed and now it's working on the outside you don't have to be hybrid anymore you can come right back to the original word the original word the idea god had in his mind before the foundation of the world you realize friends we've been taken past oh i want to say this careful i'm so misunderstood sometimes we've been taken past the written word i don't mean we go beyond the bible we believe things not i'm not talking about that but we've gone past the ability to read and brother branham has taken us right back to the mind of god to know what he meant when he said that what was he talking about here what does it mean she was beguiled by the serpent what does that mean he's taken us back we've gone back beyond the ability to read gone back beyond the ability to pray and then we've gone back into the mind of let's god to ephesians chapter five ephesians 5. ephesians 5 and 25. husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for him that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish this is god's great achievement this is christ's work why did he send the word in this day so that he could take that word and wash us by the water of the word that so that we could work really hard and get everything right and present ourselves no so that he that he can come down through a super sign and say i'm here through a super sign amen he can say he can say it is i be not afraid there's a man here that can turn on the light who is brother branham talking about who was that man it wasn't brother branham it is i be not afraid it wasn't brother branham amen who was here he himself was here amen and he showed in a super sign that he was here and he could do like he did on the planes of memory and turn his back and say you and the balcony there you have this and that you're a stranger to me if you are raise up your hand showing that it wasn't that man amen but it was it was the son of man it was christ himself come down so that he could restore back to the original word because you can't take you can't take a contaminated word and purify a bride with a contaminated word so he's got to come back and show that i'm here amen this is my word to bring back a pure word that can purify a bride so that he he came brother branham didn't have any control over what was happening he didn't know he didn't understand he wasn't controlling anything it was controlling him what was it he was going to present himself a bride without sparta wrinkle if he was going to present himself as pride was he he had to listen friends this is his great achievement this is the purpose of his death this is his victory it's not your victory it's his victory the fact that he'll have a bride without sparta renko is not your victory it's his victory it's the purpose of his death and so now he is going to present himself by what by the washing of the water by the word that's why the word has come back in this day so that he can wash us from denominations unbelief all kinds of wrong ideas and misunderstandings and misconceptions about god and misconceptions about salvation and misunderstanding of who we are he come to wash us away from spiritual amnesia he come to wash away all man-made ideas amen so that he could present us to himself amen a spotless bride this is his work and his achievements see in the future home brother makes an outstanding statement and i got a couple quotes that's going to show this here as we wind down see god in the beginning when he thought of you he thought of others like that thought of himself being tangible let's read this again in the beginning way back when it when he thought of you and thought of others like that he thought of himself being tangible i want to read that one more time in the beginning when he thought of you and he thought of others like that thought of himself being tangible see god created a world to take you out of and he wanted a world inhabited with sons and daughters bunny when he looked in his mind when he thought with his mind if we could just say it like that with no understanding you know as a human could just use words when he thought in his mind he thought of a world full of sons and daughters and when he was thinking of that world full of sons and daughters he had to think of me because i'm one of them did he think of you were you in his mind then when he was thinking of this world inhabited with sons and daughters in flesh made out of material the earth not hybrid not broken down not found but eternal and perfect and beautiful with the right spirit that they had before the foundation of the world amen amen with with the with the c gene of god on the inside with the theophany spear amen with a with a perfect glorified body when he looked down at that he thought of me because i was one of them he thought of you you were one of them and he was thinking of that world when he was looking down at that world and he was thinking about sons and daughters on the earth he was thinking of himself becoming tangible what was it it was god god moving down amen god coming onto the earth to be sons and daughters god becoming tangible god having fellowship with his attributes god moving among amen why why is it that we love each other so much i mean we frustrate the daylights out of each other we still love each other what is the bond friends what is it that makes you want to come to church and hug your brother's neck what is it it's god seeking out god is god becoming tangible that's why you can't break up fellowship amen that's why you can't stay off by yourself amen because when god thought of you and others like you he thought of himself becoming tangible and he said how can how can you say you love god when you don't love your brother whom you can't see and you love god you can't see why did he say that why did he make that statement because your brother has god inside if he's genuinely your brother there's a piece of god inside amen and it may not be the outside exterior it might be you know it might be not the you know the man or the woman who sometimes says things a little rough or harsh that's not what you love it's the life on the inside that's trying to express through that flesh body that's what you love that's why you can't wait to say god bless you can't wait to shake their hand you can't wait to give them a hug you can't wait to get back in fellowship again you can't wait to sit down at a table and talk together what is it it's the attributes of god fellowshipping together again they were together in the mind of god they've been separated out and portioned down to come forth in their time in season and to be expressed in bodies and we know that these bodies are hybrid but it's still god is still cleansing that so he can express himself through it it is emmanuel god with us that's why we love each other you can't love god and not love your brother so simple the bible's so simple how can you say you love god and don't love your brother how can there be fightings and contentions and strife among us shouldn't be we've got to go deeper than the flesh and look at the attributes when god looked down and he saw he saw himself becoming tangible when i see you i see god becoming tangible oh that flesh it's getting older getting weaker at deteriorating but it's going to change we've got to see something more than that sometimes you see in your brother or sister a little bit of a rough exterior because of some complex or some childhood damage or something going on but somehow you love them anyways they're rough as a cob and you love them anyways and they hurt your feelings all the time and you love them anyway guys there's something else in there there's something behind that veil that's expressing something that you know deeper down that's god that's my brother amen and it's one attribute calling out to another attribute coming in fellowship together what is it it's god becoming tangible in his bride elohim the son of man in his bride let's look at romans 8 while we're on this subject lay this scripture in romans chapter 8 verse 29. for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of a son did he foreknow you did he predestinate you what did he predestinate you for to be conformed to the image of his son and what is his son the word he predestinated you to be conformed into the image of the word that he might be the firstborn among many brethrens this is his victory this is his great achievement this is the reason of his death remember he foreknew you you accept that he predestinated you he predestinated you to be it's not just generic predestination sitting over here on shelf sprint no predestination to something he predestined you to be conformed into the image of his son till you will be like jesus this bride is predestinated to be conformed into his image what is that a super sign the supersede christ giving forth the super sign when god who is his word and man become one but chad how can i express it if you're a woman don't cut your hair what's that god the word and man becoming one you understand because the scripture speaks against it it's simple friends it goes from the simple to the complex it goes from the mundane ordinary to the most supernatural thing all the way through is the word and the word god and man is becoming one what is it it's emmanuel it's god with us where is he he's in his bride because the bride has got the full word restored she doesn't have the full word restore so she can pick and choose she's got the full word restored so it will conform she'll be conformed into that image and whatever the word says she'll express and whatever the attitude the word brings she'll bring and whatever whatever the word calls for she'll call she'll do it she'll bring forth whatever the word is calling forth in our lives through our individual circumstances will be brought forth through our lives how is the bride and the word the same because the bride is expressing the full word raising children keeping a home going to work paying taxes the simple the ordinary the routine god and man are becoming one and if god can be expressed in us in the way we pay our taxes and the way a man treats his wife in a way a wife references her husband in a way we dress and the way we speak about one another the reverence and respect we have for god's word the residence reverence and respect we have for one another if god amen if god can become one with us and we can become one with the word and display the word in all those little things then he can speak squirrels into existence too then he can say unto this mountain be plucked out and cast and see but don't try to talk to the mountain if you can't talk right to your wife see what i'm saying if we can't keep from fussing and fighting amidst ourselves quit trying to call for the tree to quit bringing fig trees amen if we can't even do we got to keep the word we got to keep all the word and man we want to see such dynamic supernatural things but i'm telling you friends the dynamic supernatural things are built on the back of every day calm and living the word day after day amen decision after decision conversation after conversation it's got to be the word the word the word the word in our home the word in my mind the word in my heart amen the word when nobody's looking the word in our conversation with one another amen the word would not work the word when i'm at church it's got to be the same word at church it's the same word at work not one life here and another life there not one testimony here it's got to be the word the word the word the word the word and word on top of word on top of word on top of word i'll tell you what's more supernatural be careful i say this i feel like i got to be careful all the time but i love you guys you love me so i'm not going to be careful what's more supernatural than seeing blind eyes open is being able to conquer your own spirit a.a allen could have miracle after miracle after miracle but he was raised by his parents to be an alcoholic he could never kick alcohol miracle after miracle after miracle but he died a drunk and brother of them didn't criticize him brother brandon wasn't mean about it but it was just honest about it said his parents did that to him he felt sorry for him but you could watch the demonstration on the pulpit you could wash the dynamic the fireworks going off and the praises and hurrahs but you didn't see the man stone cold drunk afterwards needing help get out the door or get in the car somebody to help see god has come down in this hour with a word that can wash all of that away he has come down with a full word that can wash away complex walk wash away childhood problem it could just stay in the washing of the water of the word because this is his victory this is his achievement this was his great goal to get preeminence and a bride amen if your complex is stopping his preeminence then stay under the washing of the water of the world and let him wash the complex out because he wants preeminence if i could just kick this if i could just get that if i if you're trying to do it of your own willpower you're going to fail amen you've got to get under the washing of the water of the word and you've got to say god i'm yours you've called me for a display of your word and this hour and this thing is hindering your display this thing is stopping lord amen i feel like sometimes this complex this habit amen this addiction amen is getting more preeminent than your word is having in my life god take it out of me why because i'm your victory amen i'm your great achievement amen to have a bride on this earth that will be one with your word is your achievement is your victory and the reason of your death oh friends don't let the devil lie to you and beat you up and tell you these things you can't be this and you can't be that my goodness amen the children of god have gone through every nasty situation they can go through and have dealt with every kind of complex and sin in their life that they could deal with but it doesn't stop the word it doesn't stop the word why because it's not your achievement it's not your victory it's his victory it's his achievement it's been his goal so what do i have to do brother chad stay under the washing of the water by the word this word came to identify a bride this word came to wash a bride so that he could present to himself he could present to himself a bride without spot or wrinkle why because god wants to be tangible in you and i his desire brother says in the message god is his own interpreter he said i mean attributes was his thoughts and a word is a thought expressed and then that was in his thinking and when he said let there be and there was let there be and there was and now remember you christians were his thoughts before there was a world and you are the manifestation of his thinking his thinking his victory his goal his purpose you see the pattern he saw us because he wants to be tangible amen before there even was a world you were in christ amen i'm the royal seed i had to be in christ before there was even a world you were in christ in god in the beginning that makes you then you see his subjects and the whole thing is god himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled seen and so forth and that's what god is the whole thing what god wants to be tangible held touched that was his goal he's going to have it in a perfect way in the new heavens and the new earth but he's going to have it also in his bride he's going to have it in his brothers and sisters not a second person not a third person not a fourth person sometimes we think we must be the millionth person but it's god god what's what's the attribute of god god what's the word of god god god wants to be tangible in your flesh in my flesh he wants to be seen he wants to be heard through our lips seen through our actions demonstrating his word the message identification he says then see god come down and the character of god was christ he was the reflection he was god made visible god made visible what was christ god made visible in the beginning was god he wasn't even god then no god is an object of worship only thing he was was the eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts was expressed to words and the word was made manifest what is it it's all god becoming tangible and you are part of god and jesus come to redeem those that was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world it was in god's thoughts and that's what he came to redeem and them as soon as it strikes them they see it because the life is in there he said in the restoration of the bride tree he said otherwise you're going to form what's known to me as a bride see it's i'll go with you you will be part of me you will be my bride my life will be in your body just like husband and wife as one person you and i are going to be one at that day you'll know that i am in the father the father and me i in you and you and me oh i just love that satan just gets so angry at that see the oneness of god the oneness of god this is why brother branham couldn't preach pentecostal oneness couldn't preach trinitarianism because neither one is adequate to express god the oneness of god is all of his attributes is the oneness of god god is his attributes god is his word his word is his attributes his attributes are his thoughts his thoughts expressed through his words what is the believer the words in the book what book the lamb's book of life you see no matter which way which angle we take and try to describe it it all comes back to the same thing our origin was in god we come from god we go to god it is a part of god god satan just gets so angry at that see the oneness of god all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into the church there you are makes them all one let's read one more scripture as we close first john chapter 4. musicians if you want to make your way up and brother ben first john 4. first john 4 and 17. hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world as he is it didn't say we will one day be as he is so are we in this world what is he the word what are you the word what is a word a thought expressed what was that see gene of god inside of you an attribute of god was an attribute a thought what is a word a thought expressed when that attribute comes to life by the baptism of the holy ghost and starts to live out that's the word that's the anointed word which is christ the bride of christ is the body of christ it is god desiring to be tangible love one another that's why john he got so revelated he went to heaven brother baby says he's so revelated he went to heaven he's seen all that was there he's seen all the way over into the millennium the new heavens and the new earth and he comes back and he says little children love one another let's make it simple little children love one another i've been to heaven i've been back i've seen all through the church ages and i've seen the tribulation period i've seen the calling on the jews i've seen the new heavens and the earth come up after the millennial ring i've seen it all and the best thing that i can give you after seeing it all is this little children love one another because when you love one another you love god super simple we were together before we'll be together again i'm attracted to you and you're attracted to me you're not attracted to me from my good looks that's a guarantee and that's probably the reason i'm not attracted to you either but there's something else there that's irresistible there's a magnetism in the children of god you know brother bram said you know how you get around some people and they just create an atmosphere around them you just want to be near them other people they seem okay they're all right but you just can't wait to get away they look good on the outside they seem all right but there's something you can't connect with something not there there's people you get around and you just love to be around them you just want to talk to them you just want to spend time you just want to be in their atmosphere i tell you what friends it's not the good genetics it's not the way they comb their hair their nice teeth if you as a redeemed child of god come in contact with that there's something else there brother branham would call him on the pulpit and said i see you have a welcoming spirit i just want to say this little children love one another because if you love one another you love god and if you can't love your brother you see you know you can't tell me you love god who you haven't seen because his brother is his representation on the earth this brother by the washing of the water of the word and uniting with christ has become elohim god with us the supersede displaying the super sign and it's a everlasting sign this virgin bride is conceived on the word and what is she bringing forth the word in simple humble everyday life the word is on display and it's attractive to the attributes of god we're polarized to one another love one another love god will we always get it right probably not does that matter so much not really but when we love one another we better let's all stand when you've climbed to the peak of the stature of a perfect man you've got all your ducks in a row and you've lined up temperance virtue godliness you've got buttons on your merit badge seth when you've got all the great achievement you've gone all the way to the top the last great achievement of them all is love divine godly agapo love if we don't have love we don't have nothing and what is the bride she is the supersede christ on earth and what is she to portray the super sign and what is the super sign god and man become one that's the bride's ministry on this earth don't overlook it friends don't look for fireworks don't look for pyrotechnics on the stage don't look look for that humble life that humble loving life that's reverent to god and obedient to god's word watch for that you're going to see elohim watch for remember jesus had three and a half years of light's camera action but he had 30 years of molding his character and learning obedience by the things he suffered and growing and increasing right what was he in those 30 years the word made flesh every day living a life i bet the ones around him noticed it was different don't overlook the life don't overlook the everyday your brother living a godly life every day your sister living a godly life every day don't overlook that that's elohim that's god becoming tangible learn to respect it learn to cherish it learn to honor it there's a lot of people in the world that can do mighty wonderful signs open blinded eyes he opened the hearing of the deaf they can do wonderful things they can preach like it's nobody's business they can put on a show for the masses amen but they cannot live the life simple and humble every day don't overlook the sign of him what's he here to do what did that union do he came the son of man to reveal himself the son of man to unite the head and the body together to do what to show the son of man again in humility and reverence and obedience and empower the power to live the word i say god bless you i love you i love you for standing on the word i love you for faithfulness for being committed to coming to church that's the word for loving one another that's the word for raising your children in fear nomination lord that's the word i love you for all of those things i love you for being honest i love you for dressing right i love you for talking right i love you for all of those things where you display christ back to me and i hope you can love me for the same if you never do what's called a miracle in your life i've still seen christ if you never part water walk on water disappear and show up somewhere if you never do that in your life i've still seen god tangible because you can take the word and in obedience to the word live the word every day of your life praise be to god let's pray lord jesus we thank you god i pray father lord that you just just mold us and make us in your image lord strip away lord all the wrong ideas of what it's like to be god in flesh all the misconceptions lord and all the all the the the desire for showmanship take it away from us lord all the desire for self lord let it fade away [Music] but god let us make a full surrender here today but i surrendered to you lord wash me in the water of your word you wanted me to be your achievement and i want to be your achievement you wanted to live your life through me live your life through me lord god you want this vessel this tabernacle to display yourself through i want you to have it lord help me to stay in the washing of the water by your word and wash away all of self all of pride all of

life let me let me walk as humble as you walked and as honest as you walked let me be as reverent to every commandment as you were reverent to every commandment let me treat others the way you treated others lord lord i pray if you want to do more than that it's your your victory it's your achievement it's your preeminence not mine if you want to show signs and wonders it's your achievement not mine but if you the greatest wonder of all is if you can let chad die and christ live the greatest thing i've ever seen in my life lord is you take away complexes you take away wrong ideas and wrong actions you do something in me that i wasn't capable of doing myself god let it be real in all of us lord the real life of jesus christ not the stage show not the animated version god not not the denominational idea of the pentecostal version but the real reality of you living in flesh every day every moment of every day while we commit ourselves to you lord be tangible in me i pray be tangible in me whatever you want that to look like is what i want lord if you want it to go noticed or unnoticed by the world that's what i want if you wanted to know a security if you want to put it on display whatever you want is what i want but let me lord be your vessel that you use be tangible in all of us lord bless my brothers and my sisters bless the families the husbands and wives the children the singles bless them all lord let them lord let them express your word in this day in humility and in reverence and respect let the light shine and i'll see you tangible lord god i love you
