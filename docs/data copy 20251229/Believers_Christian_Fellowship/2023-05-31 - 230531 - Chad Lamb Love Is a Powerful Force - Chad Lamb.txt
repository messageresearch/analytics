what you've planted deep within us Lord by your grace God we're thankful for that privilege tonight that we can stand here as brothers and sisters as your children Sons and Daughters by revelation God and that we can sing these songs and mean them from the depths of our soul God that's your grace in our lives it's your predestinated plan your foreknowledge being expressed now in flesh God it makes us so grateful Lord now as we turn to your word I pray that you would take this vessel that stands behind this sacred desk take it under your complete control now Lord and speak Eternal words through these lips of clay well we're not looking to man but we're looking to you to you to operate according to your provided way according to your word and we will receive you according to the word Lord now speak to us change us from Glory unto Glory bring us into the position you want us to be in as we surrender ourselves to you have preeminence among us this evening we pray let your word be established in the hearts of your children in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you while we're standing let's turn to Second Thessalonians together II Thessalonians chapter 3. just want to say we had a wonderful Memorial Day picnic on Monday and we appreciate all who were able to come out and the weather was absolutely perfect and I really want to express our gratitude to brother Ben and sister Amanda seybolt for not only just providing a place but they work really hard and we thank you both for that it was a special time for all of us and I left encouraged and I left blessed by it so thank you for that and I told brother Ben wherever he placed an order for that weather that he must place it again for our family retreat because I'd like the same exact weather to the T so it was wonderful and so we appreciate God for that amen let's look here in second Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 5 and we're going to be continuing with the thought of love not a part five but just in the same thought uh chapter 3 verse 5. and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ may God bless you as your seeded it's amazing as we look at this subject of love it just continues to expand and as we've preached on it you know we've preached on it before we will preach on it again I'm sure because every time that we begin to look into the word of God and the word opens unto us on another level or we see it more uh more than we did before maybe more details or through more scriptures amen I I almost as I'm preaching as I'm meditating on these thoughts and preaching I'm almost a little bit remorseful because I realize I'm still missing something amen because the word of God is so rich amen there's so much to it there's no way amen every time God I used to be when God would unlock another layer and we would see it maybe in more vibrant color than we did before I used to think oh this is it now I've got the revelation of it but now as we've served God long enough and we've seen him Circle back over the same subjects and expand them again amen you realize we're never going to come to the end of this this is the word of God and it's Eternal and I'm thankful for that amen but but tonight I'd like to talk on the subject love is a powerful force love is a powerful force and we looked at this scripture in second Thessalonians Paul saying and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God Amen and it's one of those things that you you think it seems so a simple the subject of love it seems so basic and it is basic but it's so profound at the same time it's so simple but so deep all at the same time and and Paul is praying that the Lord will direct your hearts into the love of God so it seems like this is something that you can constantly be directed deeper into and have more of and go further into amen and so that's what we ask God for Lord direct our heart into your love Amen brother Branham says in the message do you now believe all the way back in 1955 . so now I'd like to just tell you what my secret of this great is what what how'd you like me to tell you tonight what I think is the greatest most powerful force there is on Earth would you like me to tell you about it in a few minutes you might not love me so after this because I will just tell you all the mightiest forced areas on Earth is love that's exactly there's nothing that will break down love no matter what it is amen let's go back to First Corinthians chapter 13. which is the the chapter of Charity First Corinthians chapter 13. we've read it several times but I really I want to read it again it keeps growing in my heart it keeps expanding to me First Corinthians chapter 13 I'm just going to pull a few excerpts from this my brother bam says the mind is forced ears on Earth is love there's nothing that will break down love I love that and so it becomes Dependable steadfast a mighty force and in in First Corinthians 13 verse 1 he says though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity which is love agape love have not love I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not love I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity have not love it profiteth me nothing let's skip down to verse 8. charity never faileth that's what brother Branham says brother Branham says amen it's it's it's the greatest force and he says nothing will break down love and here Paul says love never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether it be tongues they shall cease whether it be knowledge it shall vanish away now let's go down to verse 13. and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity is love it's the greatest amen that means that love is greater than Faith love is greater than hope love is the greatest of these three and and that's to me where my heart is that's what I want I want that love of God shed abroad in My Heart by the Holy Ghost and I want to be directed into the love of God and I want it to grow and expand within me until it takes full control of my being so I want to look at this amen for a little bit tonight in the message Divine love and Sovereign Grace the prophet of God says now we are faced in a day when it is prophesied to us that brotherly love will become a strange thing among people and it's to my humble belief that that is the greatest of all the gifts that there is in God's Bible if the Lord Jesus should stand on the platform tonight and look me in the face and say I'm going to give you your choice you can be a great person a great Minister I'll give you a gift of preaching the gospel I'll give you the gift of teaching the word I'll give you the gift of Divine Healing I'll give you the gift of Prophecy or I'll make you a prophet or any of the fine Gifts of Faith any of the gifts that's in the Bible I'll give them every one to you but when but then I will withhold love from you or either I'll give you love and withhold the gift from you I'd say Lord take all the gifts and let me have love amen see no matter how many gifts we got they will never do us any good except the love of God is the motive behind the gift we must have love so I love the way the prophet of God said that and I want I want to really I'm just going to read it again because it hit me with such in fact I've read this before a little time ago but Lord take all the gifts and let me have love no matter how many gifts we've got they will never do us any good except the love of God is the motive behind the gift hey man I I I think you know growing up I grew up in the Pentecostal church I grew up in and seen a lot of things experienced a lot of things uh uh that way and gifts and operation of gifts amen but so many times even as a child I would begin to see the wrong motive behind the gift you would see self-glorification with a true gift but self-glorification you'd see pride being mingled in with the gift and then you begin to see that that's the wrong motive for the gift and when the wrong motive is there amen it can take things the wrong direction because the wrong motive is behind it but I said God no matter what I have if I I want to come to the place the prophet of God is that if God would if it would have to be an exchange let's just say that way and I would have to exchange every spiritual gift I could have or even the gift of preaching and all of these things and give it up to have the true love of God I would give it all up and take the true love of God because that true love of God will see me all the way into the Finish Line amen and a gift can leave me destitute and spiritually bankrupt and backslidden on the side of the road a gift can leave me worse off because of the wrong motive is behind it and the devil can get in to where a gifted person is operating and begin to bring the wrong motive and begin to cause somebody to operate with the basis of Pride or jealousy Envy or Strife or want the vaunteth itself or or any of these things amen that gift being motivated by a wrong spirit with being being backed up by the wrong Spirit can leave you destitute and bankrupt on the side of the road but love never fail us and love will bring the right motive and then if God wants to operate any gift and God wants to get any gift after that if that gift can be motivated by love God's love the love of God Amen then that will be that gift will produce the right results amen if we if we look in Revelation let's just turn to Revelation chapter 3. oh no I'm sorry Revelation chapter 2 and we'll look at the Ephesians Church age Revelation chapter 2. verse 2. it says I Know Thy Works thy labor and thy patience and how thou cast not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars and as born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted so so far the uh the Lord Jesus is speaking very positive things about the Ephesian Church age I Know Thy works I Know Thy labor I Know Thy patience I know how you cannot bear them which are evil now let's try them I mean you've done so many good things it has born and has patience and for my name's sake as labored and has not feigned in then he comes to verse four nevertheless I have someone against thee because thou has left thy first love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove thy Candlestick out of its place except thou repent he's saying you're doing good work you're laboring you're you're judging you're doing everything that you should do but I'm someone against you you've left your first love amen and brother Brandon makes this statement in the message the seven and the Seven Church ages from 1954. he says what's the matter at the Tabernacle a man ought to be able to say when you meet a man is your Christian experience when was it the dearest to you you ought to be able to say right now well my best experiences back when I first got the baptism of the Holy Spirit when I come and just oh brother you're falling from Grace that's right but the man says when you say back when I first received the baptism holy ghost that was the greatest experience of my life and brother remember says that's true then you're falling from Grace because we should be growing in Grace and growing in love and growing in a closer walk in relationship with the Lord Jesus all the time until when you say when was your greatest experience you say right now and we can't say right now then we need to repent and go back to our first love that's what had happened to his Ephesian age he said there was a little bit of a cooling off not that they were serving God not that they didn't have the works not they that weren't laboring in love not that they were not judging and not bearing them that were evil they were doing so much but they began to cool off in a little bit of formalism came in and they started getting into the church cycle of things [Music] and before it was never a church cycle it was a love for God that had him doing everything that they did I said God help me never fall into a church cycle into a church system and doing things because of the church I attend to or the group I fellowship with and Lord let that never that cold formalism and churchianity never let it come to me God but break me out of it because I want to be motivated by love for everything I do so many good things he could say but they begin to grow just a little bit formal amen and oh God I don't want to grow even just a little bit formal God help us in the message perfect faith where the man says and when we were Sinners alienated without God in the world in the muck of mud as I talked about this morning God came to us God sought you you never sought gone no man can come to me except the father draws him first and God come down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love amen amen because if if we don't reflect on that and keep the realization of what we were and would have been without the mercy of God Amen then then it's amazing how the longer we walk with the Lord amen and we forget what we were could have been would have been without him interjecting himself in our life without that we can go to a little bit formal and become a little bit self-righteous amen but when we when we can recognize where would if we could just ask the question and allow our mind to wander where would I be if he hadn't injected himself in my life if he hadn't drawn me if he hadn't stopped the path I was on to him draw me and him bring me to This Light of the Gospel where would I be and if you just let your mind wander I was driving down the road the other day and and I was watching a a homeless man in Lima walk down the road and he was he was mentally ill he was so far gone either in alcohol or drugs or whatever it was he couldn't even walk straight speaking to himself and I thought and my heart broke and I began to cry and I said God Amen I could be there that could be me amen there's not I'm not here because I'm great I'm not holding my mind and sound amen I could be there amen and I've said before what separates us from the homeless man drunk in the ditch is maybe three or four bad decisions you make this wrong decision in that wrong decision and you go with the wrong group and you decide for the first time to partake in drugs and alcohol and you become an instant addict and and then and then all these things have what three or four bad decisions and you're in the same place that man's at and when we see those things that ought to create a perfect love for God what what would I have been what was I where was I going without him and how did I save myself and how did I bring myself to truth and how to no way that ought to create a perfect love it says look what you was look what you are what did that somebody that loved you can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will we create create a confidence in his word it's what I love in this quote the statement a real genuine love will create confidence in his word amen let's go to the book of Galatians chapter 5 now one thing I have become in myself a little less tolerant of and I think it's because I found these Tendencies Within Myself and then when God exposed him to me I was frightened by the very thing I found within myself but this tendency to beat our chest and Proclaim how great we are the bride and we're Unstoppable and we're invincible and we're this and we're that and although the statements are true they're true because of the word of God and because of the plan of God and because of the decision of God they are not true because of us and our flesh and ourselves and the problem is sometimes the statement are made in self and and I've become so much less tolerant than that than I was because I found myself guilty of that and I became I began repulsed by my own attitude because it's it's not me and myself that's anything if there's anything Invincible about me it's the sieging of God God he placed in me and the word that he's ordained for that Gene to express and there's nothing in the world that'll stop that because of his love matter and it's not because I'm invincible and I'm great and I'm this and I'm the bride and I I'm everything I am because he decided to inject a part of himself in this Tabernacle of clay and he has a purpose and a plan for that so it's not the man in the mirror who's the great one it's not the man in the mirror that's going to overcome in this day it's the God who dwells inside amen so that's why we are such a paradox we in ourselves are such a paradox brother remember said the greatest enemy is God is William Branham the man he looks in the mirror that's my enemy but but but what's the greatest help I got the genuine me down on the inside he said down inside there was another William Branham so this William Branham in the mirrors the problem the genuine one the Son of God down on the inside that's the solution amen we are a walking paradox in Galatians chapter 5 verse 6. says for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love amen so if we have great faith how does faith work at workers by love brother M said in the message desperations now the word plainly states if you want to put this down in Galatians 5 6 that Faith workers by love see Faith worketh by love and the only way that you can have faith is have love first because after all faith is love and sinners incentive that's exactly what faith is it's an incentive to love now if you don't have love you can't have faith I mean that's why brother remember could say above all the gifts that's why Paul could say if I had Faith all faith that I can move mountains and have not charity I've become nothing man but if we have genuine love we'll have genuine faith okay he goes on in desperation to say that's the same thing that it is we must have love before we can have faith then we have genuine love what does it do it pushes our faith out on the Battlefront for God see genuine Godly love for God and for his word and for his people will push Faith out there love just takes a hold of faith and just come on let's go and out it goes because that's what love does that that's why love is Faith incentive it incentivizes Faith come on let's go he said it takes faith and pushes it out to the Forefront and puts it in action what is moving it love praise God that's why to have the love of God should have brought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost is the greatest thing to me that we can have because it'll bring everything else in line and in order let's go to Romans chapter 5. yeah we'll read this quick we've been quoting this all along but we'll read it again in Romans chapter 5 verse 5. I want us to know where this is in our Bibles so and hope maketh not a shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us thank God now let's go from here over to Ephesians 3. Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14. for uh what did I say 14 yeah for this cause I bow my knees into the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love love is a rooting and a grounding it's an establishing Force it'll be it will root us and ground us that we can be rooted and grounded in love now you may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breath and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US what where is this great power that comes on the scene where is this great power that we need in times of trouble where is this great force amen that we need to overcome I'll read it again in verse 20. now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think so when we pray and when we even when we even he can do more abundantly than we can ask or think even when we pray sometimes he'll surprise us in the answer because he can do beyond what we can ask or think so this one that can do abundantly above all that we ask or think according how will he do it according to the power that worketh in US how will God do the amazing things that he'll do according to the power that worketh in US it's amazing to me and and how will I know all of this because uh Christ will be in My Heart by faith and I will be rooted and grounded in love to know amen the great revelation of Christ but this power that will work in us we're going to look at that as we go on don't forget that statement according to the power that worketh in US President says from that from the message from that time in 61 he says I don't know how long I'll be with you I don't know about that but I'll tell you a little secret the most powerful force in the world isn't speaking with tongues or interpreting tongues are being being honored by God to be a minister or to be an evangelist or to be a prophet the most powerful weapon that I've ever found in my life is love in the message Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever it says I've been a minister for 31 years I've seen all kinds of gifts I've seen God do great things but the greatest thing I ever seen in my life was love it's the most powerful force that stops anything there is is love love that moved a mighty God God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son love is a great keynote that we leave out it's something that's eternal is telling us in all of his experiences 31 years of ministry the greatest gift the greatest thing is not to be a prophet is not to be an evangelist it's not to have all these gifts the greatest thing the most powerful force is love it says sometimes what we leave out but it's something that's Eternal so let's go back and look at our scripture we've been looking at in first John chapter 4. first John chapter 4. first John chapter 4 verse 16. we've been all over these scriptures through the book of First John but he says in first John 4 16 and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him this is how I believe brother Benham could say and I know it is because there's a quote that says so the most powerful force there is is love why because John says God is love and God is the most powerful force there is and God is love and love is gone so if we have love we have God if we abide in love we abide in God if love abides in us then God abides in US let's read it again and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world he is so are we in this world and remember he says that that God can work I want to I just want to refer back to the scripture we read in Ephesians 3 19 or Ephesians 3 20. now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US and now we come back to this love that is in us and herein is our love made perfect then we have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world because why if the love of God abides in us where is God and where is God's power where is God's Force it's working within us the same love amen that he created the world is in US amen the the same love that gave His only begotten son for salvation to pay the price of redemption to redeem back the Fallen World to erase when Adam lost and restored back the title deed that was love the love the love of God God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and where is thy love that love is abiding amen is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost that love is abiding in US it may it abide more and more may we walk into that love and grow into that life amen so he goes on to say now in verse 18 there is no fear in love this is I want to spend a little bit of time on this there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hated his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God loveth his brother also so I want to go to back to verse 18. now we'll talk about this for a minute there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear of Torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us amen he loved us and he gave of himself for us making a way where he could dwell within us in the love of God can be shed abroad in our hearts and it's a reciprocating love God loved us we love him and and he that feareth there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear and I don't want to drive into that to the in a legalistic mindset where we said but I was afraid the other day so I I don't have perfect love now we have to realize that that there's an outer man and an inner man and the outer man is the flesh man and he consists of the Flesh and the spirit is the outer man but the inner man is the soul amen where the spirit of God is quick and the seed of God the life and that's growing amen and is growing and taking over but we still have an outer man and the outer man can experience negative emotions the honor of man can be afraid you can hear a doctor say something to you and you can be afraid you can have an experience on the road where you're nearly hit and you can be afraid you can see your children amen stepping into a dangerous situation and you can be afraid amen but that outer man is going to perish it's going to fade away it's going to be changed Amen in the twinkling of an eye amen so the outer man is not the man that we're focusing on it's the inner man amen and that inner man amen perfect love is casting out fear and may the Inner Man dominate the outer man and bring the outer man subject to the Inner Man her perfect love cast out fear because fear had torment he was afraid he's not made perfect in love amen so we must grow the inner man must grow we must grow into these things and tell it that it begins to display what's on the inside comes on the outside and the outside is brought subject to the inside so I mean how many times even in great testimonies that we hear amen the initial response to an action would be fear but then something inside will well up and we'll remember the Lord and remember a verse and remember something that happened and all of a sudden Faith would rise to the occasion conquer the fear on the outside man amen and Faith would take its place and what's faith and sin of love amen and then all of a sudden now you're not afraid of the diagnosis you're not afraid of the situation You're Not Afraid amen because something inside took charge and dominated the situation amen and Faith took its place because love grabs faith and puts it on the Forefront and then fear moves to the side we're gonna see this I want to spend some time looking at this in the and and some stories of brother Branham and he preaches a message Called Love in 1956 and I'm going to read quite a little bit out of this uh message I'm going to quite a lengthy quote but bear with me and he's going to start by speaking about a circumstance he ran into with a killer bull we all know it but there's some things I want to highlight some things that really stood out to me this time around and and he knew that there was a killer Bull in this field it had been somewhere else and it had killed a man and it got sold and was moved to this location and he was there working for the Department of Natural Resources he was a game ward he was going to release some fish and then there was a man that he wanted to pray for so he's going to cross this field and he had forgot that the bull was there and he says I unbuckled this old pistol and I throwed it up in the car and I went over there started across the field where the brother was I forgot that the killer was in the field so on my road across the field over going across that way there was a little bunch of shrubs out there little scrub Oaks and I happened to get about 200 yards or 300 yards from the fence about the same distance the other side little swamp of a pond in the middle there and all of a sudden within 30 feet of me this killer bull raised up and there I was first I reached for the gun no gun I want you to look at brother Van's initial response that would have been my initial response he writes for the gun a human effort to save himself I reached for the gun no gun see how God takes care of things just right no gun I looked to the fence he was too close to me no tree to get into death laid before me he was a killer warnings all around don't enter here well I forgot about it and there I was well there's only one thing for me to do straighten myself up and don't die like a coward die like a man I love the prophet of God I just love him as an individual I love him as a man don't die like a cow or die like a man I'd love to be able to say that in that situation but I I don't know I'd probably been screaming and running straighten myself up it see this is the mindset that he's in there's a killer there I can't I go for the gun there's no gun I'm gonna die but I don't want to die like all this is all the human element this is all the outer man I straightened myself up I thought well this is the end of it pull myself up no need of trying to run he was in is in 20 feet of me just throwed his horns in the ground like that and bellowed with all he could fall on his knees and throwed his horns and kick the dirt and getting ready so I was just standing there that's all I could do I thought well I certainly will do this I will not go down a coward I'll go down showing my love of God in my heart and I look back at that bull and all of the sudden something happened this is what I want to focus on right now this was not the human element this was not the man we cannot listen we cannot look to brother banham and look at him and say that was wonderful how brother Branham loved the bull no this was something more than the man I want us to see that because if we leave it in the flesh we think oh he's come to a position he's come to a place the prophet of God and we put him there and leave ourselves out of it amen but he is no different than you and I as children of God he's not in any different position he's not amen he's not a different kind of person he's a Son of God Amen in the same possibilities are here for you and I and he says all of a sudden something happened I love this we're going to read this as we go it's going to it's going to catch on you're going to catch what I'm saying something happened he didn't work himself into something he didn't push himself into something and he didn't try to produce something this was not a human effort to produce something this wasn't something he conjured up or he did or thought that I had better amen in US twinkling of an eye in a flash when he faced death something happened now this sounds kiddish it sounds like a little baby talk but that's when the trouble with us tonight we try to being an adult in God when we ought to be babies in God we know so much God dwells in the center of humility and simplicity don't never forget that I looked at the bull if anything I could have cried for him why I thought poor creature well how wrong am I now ordinarily I wouldn't feel that way about it ordinarily I wouldn't feel that way about it you know the man wretched for his gun the man had an uh oh moment oh no this is bad I'm going to die but I'll take it like a man not like a coward but then all of a sudden something happened and when that something happened he could have cried for the bull listen this is Supernatural he could have went for the bull and look at what happened when the love of God came on the scene he was looking from the Bull's perspective now listen don't leave this in Bulls let's bring this right down to daily life all of a sudden something happened and he looked at it from the other position and he said how wrong am I now he's going to take the blame for this problem for this situation said well how wrong I am now ordinarily I wouldn't feel that way about it first I was looking for the gun I was glad I didn't have it I'd have shot him and then went and paid for it but I didn't have the gun I thought well poor creature I'm in your pasture this is your home and you're just a brute you don't know any different listen if brother Branham can do that for a bull can you do that for a co-worker a family member a loved one somebody else in the church you don't know any different and you wouldn't want to kill me anyhow but I Disturbed you I'm sorry I did that I didn't mean to disturb you talking like I am now I just couldn't listen I just couldn't help it there was something talking in me this wasn't the man this was God in the man I just couldn't help it there was something talking in me oh my it's too bad we ever have to leave that just submit to it God just took over and the bull roaring and going on he lowered his head and he said now creature of God I'm the servant of God I'm on my way to pray for a sick man over here dying and I come across the field here where your home is I'm sorry I broke into your home that's what I did I broke into his home that's all the home he knows of now stop and think that's true I said I come into your house I broke in on you I'm sorry you forgive me I'll go across the field I won't bother you and I said now in the name of Jesus Christ our creator go over there and lay down again I'll not bother you and that bull took towards me as hard as he could and when he got to about six or eight feet of me I wasn't a bit more afraid than I am standing right here perfect love cast out all fear this is what first John's talking about this is not our effort amen this is God this is the love of God this is the reality on the inside not something we put on that we paste on I paste on love your love will fall off when you face a killer bull all your stick on religious statements amen they fall off I'm the bride and I'm invincible and I'm this or that amen wait till you get to the hour of trouble and see whether it's genuine or not whether it's a velcro stick on title or whether it's the reality that's in the soul [Applause] [Music] I don't want a label I don't want to stick on title I don't want to claim I'm this this and this and that you know what I am I am nothing without the grace of God left to myself I destroy myself I was going the wrong way with all my thinking I've ruined everything amen but the grace of God has injected himself every time I get myself in trouble he's brought me out and so I have nothing to stick on myself whatever I am is what I am in my soul amen what God has made me to be from before the foundation of the world and what his word is bringing me into the image of it's got to be him and not me so we St I mean friends Peter stuck some labels on himself Peter I'm brave and I'll not fail you and though all men leave you need I won't forsake you foreign oh my goodness there's so much prep pep rally preaching but there's got to be a reality and I want the reality not we all pass out labels we're this we're Invincible we're this we're this no I I I'm only that if God's made me that I'm only that I'm God's I'm only as big as God's big in me I'm only as powerful as God's powerful in me here's the prophet of God going to shoot the bull scared going to die but something changed and now he has sympathy for the bull you know when God first created Eden it was a it was a world of perfection perfect love perfect love to vote everywhere and there was harmony with the animals amongst themselves and amongst people amen but what happened amen man fell from perfect love and then all of the trouble that we see is because evil entered into the world and what is evil evil is not a creation evil is a perversion it's righteousness perverted now the wrong love has come in and a perverted love and has twisted everything and now there's enmity between the Beast and between men that wasn't there in a world of perfect love and if someday it won't be there in the future in a world of perfect love so what what was it that that bull encountered that bull encountered what the original thought of bull was intended to be Amen in harmony with mad and love and perfect love amen confuse the bull I mean that bull has no consciousness of a a feeling and sorting out his feelings and he doesn't understand the words that the prophet is speaking but it's the love being projected and when love is projected Sovereign Grace takes its place and the bull goes over and lays down what force moved him over it was the love of God the same force that kept Harmony and Eden amen oh my goodness he says now he says I come into your house broke in on you I'm sorry you forgive me he's asking the bull to forgive him what are we looking at we're looking at the operation of perfect love forgive me I'll go across the field I won't bother you he said I wasn't a bit more afraid than I am standing right here perfect love cast out all fear I don't care if death is staring in the face you can sing happy day happy day since Jesus washed my sins away listen that's not trying to not be afraid many people me included I've tried to be a brave Christian when facing difficult situations and I've tried to be brave and I've tried I've tried to trust God and I mean with all that's in me I was trusting God I was trying to be brave trying not to be afraid but you can't stop that quivering in your heart no matter what you put out you can't stop that shaking on the inside it's going to take something Supernatural it's going to take something that's God to actually drive fear away until you can stand like the problems that I was no more afraid in that situation than I am standing right here said no wonder Paul could stand in the face of death and say oh death wears your staying grave where is your victory sure through tribulations he had learned the love of God how did he learn the love of God through tribulations suffering brings patience Works tribulation to bring patience of course now patience makes love trust and when that bull got within about six or eight feet of me he just threw his feet out and stopped and he looked at me he looked this way that way so depleted just quieting right down walked over and laid down I walked within five feet of that bull and he never even turned and looked at me I walked right out of the pasture what is it it was the love of God the power of God where was the power of God working it was working in him Amen in brother banham where was that power of Deliverance it was in him where was it working it was working in him that's what Ephesians was telling us in Ephesians chapter 3 it says according to the power that worketh in us he can do exceedingly more than we can ask and think according to the power that works in us what power his power working in US Why move that bull over the lay down it was the power of God amen you say brother Madam I don't believe that story well you don't have to but it's true the same God that would close the mouth of the Lions and the Lion's Den for Daniel can certain tame a bull in a few minutes when the love of God has been projected then when I love the Lord and the love in my heart comes back to that bull then when love has come to its end Divine Sovereign Grace steps in and takes the place hallelujah oh my why would I fear when death comes how I want to love the Lord that when it comes to the place where everything is gone divine grace will step in someday and pack me across the river of Jordan Yonder into a better land where there's no sickness or death or sorrow I love the Lord you love the Lord we have got nothing no sickness no diseases nothing else can separate us that love of God goes right on and when you love him and come to the end where love can't act no longer on your behalf Sovereign Grace will take Love's place and God will inject himself in the situation here's some time ago out in my front yard I was mowing with a mowing machine little old power mower and I'd mow about two rounds and here come another car load I'd run around the house and run in put take off my overalls and put them in clothes and somebody come to be prayed for I'd pray for them maybe they're an hour or more nobody else in line then maybe in the late evening I'd slip out put my overalls on run out the front yard mow a couple more rounds while the front yard was growing up before I could get in the back one afternoon back there I went back there and and I just slipped on my overalls real hot I didn't put on any shirt nobody could see me so I was just mowing along there the little old power mower putt putt Putt-Putt and I was going along and I forgot that a big nest of hornets was in the corner and I rammed right into that fence and in less than a second time I was completely covered over with Hornets you know what they are those great Big Fellas why they could kill you one of them could knock you down and of course me with no shirt on the Hornets all around me but something happened here it comes again something happened instead of being scared a love came in and took its place you might not want to believe this but at the Judgment bar you'll see him when the secrets of our hearts is disclosed I was covered over not a one had stung me and I thought poor little creatures well that's the only way you have a defense God gave you that Stinger that's to defend yourself you've got just as much right you don't know that was my fence it's just as much yours as it is mine it don't belong to either one of us it's God so you made your nest right there oh ought to have been looking out for you and I'm sorry but I said I'm the servant of the Lord and I love you little fellas them just humming buzzing all over I said don't you try to Bluff it here's what he said don't you try to Bluff it this is no Hey listen words ain't going to get this done slogans and and phrases and and pounding the chest that's not going to work in this situation don't you try to Bluff it you better know what you're talking about I said I love you little creatures of God I'm sorry I apologize to you for waking you up but I said I'm serving God's people and I have to cut my grass and I was in a hurry I'm sorry I Disturbed you now in the name of Jesus Christ go back into that Nest I won't bother you anymore I'll go around it and then still around me my mower never stopped I just turned loose the handle raised my hands to God I took right a hold of the handles and I and not a bit more scared of them Hornets than nothing and God my sovereign judge them Hornets made a few rounds around me and made a beeline just as straight back into that Nest as they could go what was it the projecting of love of God brought down the Sovereign Grace of God not the projecting of brother branham's love but the projecting of the love of God and somehow how would I know that with me speaking in English they didn't hear down the interpretation and they heard what I said I can't tell you but anyhow they obeyed the very word I asked him in Jesus Christ's name to do love it conquers animals it conquers human beings he says you don't try to Bluff it there's no making this is this this is not the realm of pretend this is reality this is not a human emotion this is not a human love amen there's something much more than that amen because in the human realm I I don't know about you but if it was me I know what would happen to me and and and and the natural man the natural realm without God injecting himself in the situation and doing something for me amen but brother Brown had that where something changed but if I was in that situation and I didn't have whether something changed I couldn't even probably repeat to you the names that I would call those Hornets and the things that I would say and anger and frustration and fear and I'd call them dumb Hornets you go away and leave me alone and but when the love of God injected itself the love of God didn't make the Hornets an enemy they didn't make the Hornet something to be hated they made the Hornet something to be sympathized with and pitied and loved my goodness this is Light Years Beyond human this is not human amen this is not our efforts this is not us trying to be loving you can try to be loving all you want amen but at some point it's going to break it's going to fizzle amen your love the human love is not strong enough to handle some of these circumstances but oh praise God something changed something happened in a moment's time the whole atmosphere Chained and brother Ben instead of being angry and afraid he was loving and had sympathy and began to apologize to Hornets apologize to a bull I said God that's the love that I need but that's the power that I believe is shed abroad in our hearts by the I believe it's there but listen what brought love to the Forefront it was the obstacle that brought love to the Forefront what was it that displayed the love of God it was the need for the love of God it was the great adversity that produced the great love we think of all these trials and these Temptations and the difficult things we go through we look at them as bad things they're not bad things they're good things friends we absolutely need them amen because the promises are to them that overcometh how will you reach how will you receive the promise if you don't overcome how will you overcome with no trial and then how will the love of God be expressed amen if your human love is enough to carry you through every circumstance and you can retain your emotions and you can hold back your fear and all of these things you can do yourself how will the love of God ever be expressed no I'm telling your friends the love of God will be expressed when we've gone beyond human amen beyond the ability when the situation is so serious and so intense and so fearful and so dangerous amen that there's no way a human being can endure that's when something will happen [Music] I wonder many times that that's why brother Branham says you wait till this Council Begins the title you wait for these things then you'll see what you've seen temporarily manifest in fullness of power not because human beings are going to be able to do it but because the circumstance will get to the situation where nothing else can do but the the but the perfect love of God producing the third pool not a human brain not human emotions not we finally got ourselves to Perfection we will never get ourselves to Perfection it'll be the love of God being perfected within us and we've seen it here it's been displayed to us amen and I thank God now that we know we don't have to produce him we don't have to fake anything we don't have to work anything up we don't have to keep trying and trying and trying there's no trying to produce this amen the only thing we're trying to do is surrender more surrender more surrender more so that he can take a greater portion of me and feed more on the word and stay in the washing of the water of the word so that it can get more of me out of me so in times of trouble there's something planted deep within me that could come to the Forefront I can't produce this all I can do is open myself up and say God I need more of you I need you to lead me further into your love amen I need Your Love Shadow brought in my heart in Greater measure than it's ever been before because I'm going to meet things in my life that I cannot humanly overcome I need you amen planted deep within me I need you to come on the scene because God can do exceedingly abundantly more than we can ask or think according to his mighty power which worketh in us so that means I need him in me I need him and me and I need as much as I can stay surrendered by his grace stay surrendered to him so that he can take preeminence in me so in the hour of great need something can happen because I won't be able to do it myself I I have failed so many times and walked away embarrassed of myself because in the time of great trial I failed and Times of great pressure I've done what Peter's done and I have I've been as foolish as Peter was to make great boasting statements about my Christianity and my love for God and my belief of the truth and in a great time of trouble I've done what Peter's done but I thank God that God got a hold of Peter he changed Peter humbled Peter and broke Peter and Peter got to where Peter no longer trusted Peter and he died and Christ began to live until Peter and so much that when he would begin to pray for a lame man a man that would go running and leaping and jumping and praising God Amen he would recognize why why look you to me like I healed this man I had no power to heal him but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ whom you crucified this man stands hold Peter had gotten so far away of boasting so far away of being proud and arrogant and boastful and claiming he can do something to when he actually when God actually uses him Amen to perform a mighty Miracle he won't even take credit for it now and say why are you looking at me as though in my power I've done this amen oh that's where we need to be friends that's the place in humility and sincerity and simplicity amen so that we can become nothing so that he has room to become everything so that we're not asking God Amen to divide for position so I can die so that he can live amen I can surrender and empty out so he can fill up time of great need may he that's in me overcome because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world Council of churches greater is he that's in me than he that's in governments greater is he that's in me than he that's in that's that's where our hope will come from prophet of God goes on to tell another story about a Madman out in Washington he said have you ever read my book at the maniac out there in Washington have you read that that Maniac onto the platform 260 pound man or more and said I'll break every bone in your body and police and ministers fled every way and I was left on the platform with the maniac something happened it's a different message same statement something happened remember brother Ben said I'm not the one who was on the river that day I'm not the one who opened bly's eyes and does all these Miracles I was just standing there when he did that amen amen I hope we can have that testimony that I'm standing near when he does something I don't want to live a life that never sees him come on the scene I don't want to live a life that never sees him amen come into action I don't want to live a life that I can never say something happened it wasn't me it was him there was a faith that came up there was some words that came out there's something happen and then a fear Fade Away not because I said I'm not going to be afraid but because something actually happened that I can't explain I can't work up amen my emotions were moving into fear then all of a sudden something else moved in and fear was pushed out of the way and Faith took its place because love grabbed faith and pushed it to the Forefront amen he says I waited the time 128 pounds and the maniac stood like that as T set together he said you snake in the grass up here pretending to be a man of God I'll show you how much man of God you are I'll break every bone in your body and he drew back his big fist and he was well able physically to carry out his threat and brother bam says he spit on him the man hawked and spit on him boy I don't know if you've ever been sped on would you talk about something infuriating a human being everything was was pushing would push a human's emotion around the wrong way but he says something happened instead of despising that man I felt sorry for him I thought poor man you wouldn't treat me that way while you were a man just like I am you wasn't made to act like that you were made to love and to be a father of your children and to love them and to love all men you were made to be a Son of God but the devil has took a hold of you I felt sorry for the man and he said walked up to me close and went and he spit in my face I looked at him I've had it happen with witch doctors and everything don't worry if God is with you who can be against you this man hawked and spit in his face but something happened so I looked at the man and I thought poor man I love you my poor lost brother listen that is not a slogan that was not that was not a preconceived thought when when I get spit on this is what I'll say in fact you can carry those flash cards around in your pocket after this service and let's see how well it works amen before you get the flash card you'll say something else laughs but it was the reality of the love of God so I thought poor man I love you my poor lost brother I never said a word and he walked up to me and he raised his big his big fist back and the crowd setting breathless of six thousand inside and pretty near that many standing in the rain he drew back his big fist he just struck a preacher he was out of the insane institution you might ask the police there they was on the records to date and he'd hit a minister and broke his jaw in his collar boom run in there and run to the platform he said this night I'm going to break every bone in your body and I looked at him not with hatred but with love and as he did and started towards me something inside of me said but tonight you'll fall over my feet fall over your feet he said I'll show you you snake in the grass whose feet off all over and he ran to me and threw back his big fist to strike me I said Satan come out of the man and as I said his head went back and he fell and pinned my feet to the floor the police had to roll him off oh that's it love when brother Benham something happened to him and when something happened to him instead of being angry with this man or angry with the boulder angry with the Hornets instead of the natural human reaction instead of fear or anger or hatred or bitterness amen something else took over and when the love of God came on the scene it caused him to have sympathy for the one who was potentially hurting him Sympathy for the bull oh I'm sorry I Disturbed you it's my fault I shouldn't have I'm sorry Hornets I forgot you were there you got just as much a right to be there oh I felt looked at the man I said you poor man you don't want to be like that there was a sympathy that came in with the love of God and began amen began instantly to walk in the other person's shoes and change the whole perspective and begin you don't want to live like this you wouldn't really want to hurt me something's wrong amen and and begin to master and dominate the situation not by force not by yelling not by harsh words amen not not even having to raise his tone of voice but began to command the situation by love and love was the force that abated whatever was driving this man love conquered amen whatever was driving that bull loved conquered whatever was driving us when it's a love conquered amen whatever was driving brother Branham to fear and grab a gun love conquered love mastered the whole situation and gone oh I don't think we realized what we lost in Eden but it's coming back I I don't think we even realize how far as human beings because we don't know what it was but oh it's coming back it's coming back and the seeds of it are here in his people amen the power of it resonates in his people and I want that to come on the scene not me I want to die so that he can live brother Branham says friends I'm not no little boy no more I've seen a mini a test but I've never seen nothing yet could override love it just takes everything out of the way love conquers wild animals love conquers it's just the most conquering Force there is because it's God you know why I can help you because you love me and you believe me if you didn't believe me no matter what kind of works God would do by me you still wouldn't get any benefit do you know that that's my success with the Lord the people love me and I love them and that's where the success comes from amen that's the successive Ministry I mean if God didn't put in my heart to love you and you to love me amen all the preaching in the world wouldn't produce anything Amen brother Brown says that's why I can help you is because you got confidence in me and I can tell I mean I can tell you I can take no credit for it amen because instantly when God called me to become a pastor and I became a pastor God changed something inside of me something in me come alive amen that that wasn't there before and I began to love this congregation and love the people with a love that's beyond just Chad this is not just emotion something actually happened in me because it has to be that way if I can't really love you how in the world can I help you amen there's tons of preachers lots of words that can be spoken but if there's no love being projected with the ministry amen it's not effective amen just being able to preach is not enough but there actually has to be God Amen God himself has to work through the gift and love has to be projected so Sovereign Grace can take its place how will people get saved amen because love must be projected the word must be preached with love corrected in love admonished with love amen taught with love and Brethren said that's the secret to my success because people know I love them when I listen to brother random I I feel like he loves the people he loved me and I loved him amen and it does me a world of good but if there's not reciprocating love amen if that love leaves the church amen all the great teaching in the world is not going to produce anything amen there must be a love a love relationship back and forth the same thing for the home it doesn't matter how much God Godly wisdom Daddy has amen if love is broken amen and there's no confidence back and forth amen there's going to be problems but there's got to be a love we need more than flesh we need God same God Amen who begins to change us the natural and listen it's not emotional love it's not that I can get up here and then start pulling on emotion I'm not good at that anyways I'm just I'm sorry I'm a failure when it comes to working emotions and don't you feel and let's all Kumbaya that's not my nature some people are so good at that they can pull people emotionally and connect them emotionally to themselves God never gave me that ability amen so he had to put a real love in my heart for you all and it has to be something that you can feel you can sense it's got to come through it's got to be a reality amen that was the secret to a success and like I said I can take no credit for it it's something God did inside of me and I'm thankful he did because I'd be ineffective without it but it's not something that I could produce and it's not something that says I ought to love my brother in the church that's not going to get it I ought to a Shepherd ought to love the Sheep so I ought to love that's not going to get it she'd say I ought to love my shepherd that's not going to get it I ought to love my brother I ought to love that's not going to cut it it's going to take something more than that it's going to take God actually knitting our hearts together in love God actually giving us love for a brother love for a sister love for one another it's got to be real but thank God brother Mary said why would you want to substitute when the skies are full of the room this is what he's wanting to do Jesus says all men shall know you're my disciples when you have a loved one for another he didn't say when you do the signs when you do the Wonders I mean they will come with it but they have to be motivated by love but all men will know you're my disciples when you have love one for another but the man had something in him something in him that would rise to the occasion when the need was there when when there's no more human love when human love's not enough and remember brother Branham was a Golden Glove boxer if the love of God had not come on the scene who knows what would have happened with the maniac but there was another Force that was faster than his hands took control of the situation amen I believe there's another force in me not because of me but because of God amen I believe there's something else in me that can Master every situation but oh God help me to get myself out of the way and let you master every situation help me in times Amen in times of of stress and fear help me to just pause long enough to say Lord I don't want this amen I'm surrendering and yielding you take over Lord because I don't have this I don't have it I don't have enough for this world I don't have enough emotional Reserve I don't have enough strength I don't have enough with I don't have enough to meet the challenge of the hour me as a human being I don't have what it takes to meet the challenge of the hour but I believe by the gift of God Amen and I believe by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that I've got within me more than enough to meet the challenge of the hour and I want the outer man to stay out of the way so that God on the inside can do abundantly above all that we could ask or think by the power that dwells within us let's say God help us let's turn to first Thessalonians chapter 3. first Thessalonians chapter 3. verse 12. and the Lord Make You to increase and abound in love one to another and toward all men even as we do towards you to the end he may establish your hearts unblameable and Holiness before God even our father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his Saints look at verse 12 again and the Lord Make You to increase and abound in love I say Lord Make Me make me to a crease and abound in love oh if it's in the word it's possible if it's in the word it's for me if it's part of the word it's for me and if and if Paul was praying that the Lord Make You abound in love and then it's possible that the Lord will make me abound in love and I'm saying Lord Make Me abound in love make me grow in love and walk in love and increase in love Let It Be In Me Lord for it's a possibility because it's in your word brother Branham tells us a story I just like to finish with this he tells us about an experience he had when he went beyond the curtain of time and he began to see the saints that it went on and he was hugging them and shaking their hand and they were calling him his precious brother he said if you could just only remain if I could just only remain there forever it is no yesterday no tomorrow you're just there no sin nothing can happen sinfully there's nothing could be sin and everything was perfect love what was there perfect love and he makes this statement he says just remember I'll say this with the faith that I have in that Vision whatever it was I'll speak it in the name of the Lord except you have that perfect love you'll never be there Works aren't going to produce it efforts Christian labels it's not going to work only perfect love shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost except you have that perfect love you'll never be there because nothing could ever be there without it your spirit would be out of place there it couldn't come there would be no way for it to come I want to go there but I've got something in me now by the grace of God that'll carry me there and I believe I've got something in me now amen that will take its place and every obstacle I find and that's why we we've been given such a word in our day we've been given such a measure of the word because with the measure of the word comes the fullness of the Holy Ghost and the full power of God and the full manifestation of Christ has been made available in this generation and I want to stay surrendered to all of it and uh and listen I don't want to get distracted away amen from what my purpose is here with all the things that life can distract us away from but I want to stay consecrated I want to stay simple dedicated sincere so that there's a greater portion of God taking control of me and less of me taking control so that in every situation he can come on the scene let's finish with the Ephesians I want to read one more scripture in Ephesians chapter 5. Ephesians chapters 5 verse 1. it says be therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also have loved us and has given himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savior Paul admonishes the church he says Walk In Love so there is a walk in love that we can walk in he wouldn't have he wouldn't have commanded the church to walk in love if he weren't possible to walk in love but in order to walk in love we we have to stop walking in things that aren't love because we're walking in this life we're walking in this earth and so much of our walk amen can be consumed with things that aren't love can be consumed with things that are not Eternal that are not gone amen but he told the church Walk In Love Don't Walk in the world don't walk in worldly desires and walk in the flesh and the desires of the flesh but he said Walk In Love and God is love and the things that are of God and God is the word and the word has been given to us amen and the Holy Ghost is love and God is love amen so what do we walk and we walk in love let's walk in this message that he's given us and walk in the light of the hour and walk in God and God Walk in us and let us walk in love as Paul told the church Walk In Love say God help me to walk in your love help me to walk away from the other things amen and walk in love so that it will produce in Me Love let me pay attention to love so that in Me Love Grows let me surrender to love so that Love Takes control let me yield to love so that love begins to become the dominant force in my life help me God to walk in love make me to walk in love amen let's all stand musicians if you'll come praise be to God I love the message of the hour I love the word of God I love the example that God's given to us friends there's so little that we can do humanly speaking I'm not talking about as children of God I'm not talking about the seed of God what I'm talking about as a human being there's so little that you can do you can't save yourself you can't save your children you can't protect your home you can't protect your property you can't do anything but the power of God is unlimited and it operates by the love of God and if I know that that the the greatest force on Earth is love and I know that God is love and I know that God is his word and I've been commissioned and I've been challenged to walk in love amen then I know that if I continue to stay in his love and stay in this channel that he is open for us that love inside of me will grow and take more dominion and Love Will Conquer everything I don't have to be good enough I don't have to be powerful enough I don't have to have enough I just need more of him in me because he's enough I need to walk in this love and God help us to surrender amen let's bow our heads together ask the Lord to help us walk in his love their Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your goodness for your grace Lord for the word that you've given to us in this hour God it's your great love gift to your bride is the love gift of yourself when through this message you unveiled Yourself by the opening of the word you gave yourself to us and God we want to just open up and receive you Lord God you're a gentleman you don't come where you're not invited you don't take what's not given for you're a great gentleman and God your Prophet taught us in doors and doors if you're invited onto the living room you'll come but if you're told not to go into the bedroom not to go into the kitchen you'll not because you come where you're invited but God help us now to surrender in a greater way and invite you to take full possession of your house not to just invite you to the front door but invite you through every door so that you can come and take possession of The Possession you've redeemed and may you live through US Lord that as we meet these trying times whether it be through sickness better be through heartache fear troubles whatever we might find I prayed God that we would learn to rest and allow you to take your place and God in every one of these situations we're praying that something will happen something Beyond us something beyond our ability something will happen and you'll begin to project Your Love and love will begin to take over lord and move from within us to take over and master the situation and bring everything according to your Sovereign plan all we yield ourselves to you help us God reveal to us anything that's a stumbling Stone before our feet anything we've allowed that we shouldn't have anything that we are permitting that you want us to remove God help us to surrender to it now and yield may you come and take your place Lord God put a greater love in our hearts help us make us to walk in love help us to walk in your love and may your love increase in US may it take Dominion we want to surrender now to you and ask all that you would help us in our time of need for God Only You will bring us through

hour we love you father we ask that you would keep us As We Go From Here Lord May the word that was preached take effect in our lives May the word be a force a power that begins Lord as we receive it by faith may it begin to do the work that we cannot do in our own willpower but we surrender our will to you and we surrender our rights to your word and may you come in and begin to do the work that we cannot do may your word be the force that begins to work within us and bring all of those attributes that are in the seed may it bring it to full life full manifestation to where it begins to bear fruit Lord the full fruit of the Bride tree we're asking for you to do that work in us as we stay in your light stay surrendered to the washing of the water of the word we love you and we ask God that
