while we're standing let's take our bibles and look at first corinthians chapter 11. say i appreciate the atmosphere this evening thank god for a place to come and worship with like-minded believers and brothers and sisters in christ to share our little licks of fire amen first corinthians chapter 11. i want to read just one verse here first corinthians 11 verse 1 be followers of me even as i also am of christ let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we ask that you would lord bless the reading of your word i pray god you would take control of this vessel for your glory may you speak your words of eternal life lord and may we hear it and receive it lord may you grant us lord the spirit of revelation that we might catch what you're trying to speak to us in this day and that that word will be more than word but it'll become a manifestation lord to become a living word living out through our flesh by your spirit god have your way with us move upon us and have preeminence in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated amen i want to um just speak for a moment on on this says be followers of me even as i also am of christ and i want to refer back to uh something that took place on sunday this past sunday i made a statement and as soon as i made the statement something checked me the spirit checked me not something it was the spirit of god checked me hard and i began to repent and you guys might know that and caught that i've had a few people ask me what did you even say i missed it amen and and it wasn't it wasn't that i was saying wrong or preaching wrong doctrine but the way i said it god didn't like he wasn't pleased with that and and so i wanted to address that and apologize for that but uh first we you know we were talking about the denominational attitude and the approach to the word and and tr keeping god back 2 000 years ago and not bringing present tense and that's the great fallacy of denominationalism but when i made the statement and i don't even remember i didn't go back and check word for word what i said but it was on this wise that uh preaching all you have to do is believe jesus christ died on calvary 2000 years ago and that's it and i said something like dead dung i called that that nung and all the sudden something in me just grabbed my heart and stopped me in my tracks because there's no believing no part of the word is wrong there's nothing that you can believe out of the word that is wrong or would be evil or can or any way make you wrong or make you evil amen believing any part of the scripture is not wrong it's clean believing in calvary is clean and pure and the foundation for our belief because there's the price of our redemption was paid amen so it wasn't so much that my point was wrong the point was not wrong the doctrine that was being taught was not wrong but but brother brahm says sometimes you have to drive a nail to it clenches but sometimes you drive a nail too hard and too fast and then you're working fast to try to dig it up but it's already dug down amen so more than anything it was that what god checked me on was the approach it was too strong of a statement it was too firm and in it and and i had gotten in the way and god checked me and after that i had a little bit of difficulty getting my footing because i had lost confidence amen because you know i got in the flesh but praise god he helped us anyways the word was good and the word was true and i just wanted to bring that to your attention because you know it matters what we say and what we do matters and you can have the right word preached the wrong way and bring the wrong spirit and that's not what we want amen we want the right word with the right spirit to bring the right response and the right attitude we can carry the word with a wrong attitude and make it wrong brother said in doors and doors from 1965 he said you go into a church and watch the pastor if he's real wild and carries on the congregation will be the same see they take the spirit of one another instead of the holy spirit and that's the thing we have to guard against i have to guard against it you have to guard against it we have to be very on guard amen and i thank god i thank god that he checked us so fast on that and that we had an opportunity to say something right away that wasn't right because we don't want to sow the wrong attitude in the wrong spirit amen because we have to recognize amen recognize the word for what it is and make sure that we don't take our own approach amen so we have to be careful that what we're presenting to the people is the holy ghost and what we're receiving is the holy ghost not the spirit of a man let's turn to mark chapter nine i'm gonna just talk about this for a minute and then get into what i what what god has laid on my heart mark chapter 9. mark chapter 9 verse 38 and john answered him saying master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbade him because he followeth not us but jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me for he that is not against us is on our part so here you know john is is getting the wrong idea he's following christ and and he's he's in the inner circles close to christ and now somebody else is taking the name of christ and and they're doing a work and he forbids them because they were not following us they're not part of our group so we forbid them and jesus said don't forbid them if they're not against us they're on our part amen don't just because they're not with us don't assume they're they're on the other side amen and so jesus uh in this he really paints the right approach and the right attitude for us john had the wrong attitude jesus had the right attitude of course and brother bam says in 1964 god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief said all these believers as we could go on for hours all these are like a bunch of change out of your pocket in god's hands you pull out a bunch of change there's pennies nickels dimes quarters half dollars dollar all in coins now that's what the world the world is in god's hand look at this that's what the world is in god's hand there are some people that just can have a pennies worth of it and god can only use them in a penny way that's all they can buy don't reject them if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out and say they're not in it because god uses pennies sometimes this is really important what we want to do is we want to back up on what we drove too hard and actually bring the right attitude in the right approach lot was just a penny abraham was a silver dollar so it taken a hundred lots to make an abraham and so will it take a hundred carnal believers will never stand in the presence of a genuine christian that's separated from the carnal things of the world living in christ jesus where the word can flow through him he can only take a penny's worth that's all he's got so you see people that say i don't believe in healing i don't believe in these things just know it's a penny but just let let him alone see just a penny's worth and so that's all he can buy don't stop him just let him alone remember that's just all the farther he can go brother rem says in 1960 the message as i was with moses so i will be with thee or how can you try to make all the lutheran see it all the baptists see it all the presbyterians and nazarenes and pilgrim holiness don't condemn them that's all they know that's all that's in them brother said don't condemn them that's all they know if his opinion's worth leave them alone amen it doesn't make them bride you can't change somebody's position in predestination and election they meant so by a pervasive persuasive speech or by a bold rejection you can't change anything so if they cannot receive the word you might as well just leave them alone and be whatever god ordained for them to be see the problem is not being able to see the word there's no problem in that the problem is rejecting the word when it's presented to you and calling it something evil that jesus didn't go around all of israel condemning every person he come in contact with but who did he call children of the devil those that stood and called him beelzebub they looked at the word made flesh and they rejected him called it evil names and they sought to destroy it and stop it amen those were the ones that were children of the devil amen so we've got to make sure that everybody who can't see the message doesn't become children of the devil that god can have a purpose even for that amen because we realize when we get over to new heavens and new earth amen when we dwell in the city the city dwellers are the elect predestinated chosen amen living in the city and only they can live there but the rest of the world is inhabited by millions billions i don't know how many people and those people amen what they're doing over in the in eternity in new heavens and new earth is they're serving and working for the city they're bringing their tithe and offering into the city bringing their stores and their foods and their grains into the city and in exchange for their service to the bride and the king amen they get a leaf off the tree of life for peace perpetual peace perpetual life because amen they they were a pennies worth on earth to serve something in god's kingdom to do something to create a christian economy maybe maybe their only portion is the decreed a christian economy amen that helps keeps the doors of this church open just a little bit longer in this nation and they couldn't receive the word they couldn't do anything else but they could they could do something amen to help the bride in some way even indirectly the further the calls of christ amen so don't frustrate individuals like that don't call them names amen amen we shouldn't amen we shouldn't evil speak we should just recognize if they can't receive it they can't receive it the problem is open rejection the problem is turning down christ not saying i don't see it i don't understand i can't see that it doesn't make sense to me amen that's fine leave that alone but the evil is in the open rejection the antichrist spirit that would fight against truth or call it blasphemy or false doctrine or false prophet so we want to have the right attitude and the right approach amen because there's rewards coming for some of those individuals who could only to put hold a portion of the word there's still a reward coming to them at the great white throne judgment so we don't want to go too far off the right too far off the left so the point that we were making was true the point that i was driving was true amen but you can't just hold the one portion of the word and believe that that one portion of the word will get you through if you're rejecting this other portion of the word because that portion of the word is christ and this portion of the word is christ and if you reject christ you reject christ the point is still true but somebody who has no capacity to see no way no ability to catch the word because there's nothing in them to catch the word amen god is going to judge them based off what they did with the light that they had there's only this much light will george judge him according to that but remember god's great economy he's doing something and everything he's doing is working towards the benefit of the elect even indirectly praise god maybe there has to be a whole lot of pennies in the nation so there's freedom of religion so we can keep printing books and passing them out and maybe that's the only thing they're there to do go to church stand for fight for rights keep keep things going just so we can find that last predestinated seed and so praise god may god give him a reward for that because we benefited from that and if you're the last one to come in you'll thank god for every baptist that petitioned the government to keep freedom of religion keep the doors open because they were doing that they were doing what they could with what they had and they were serving god's economy in some way and guess what when when we in the in the city as city dwellers amen the bride of jesus christ is those that are outside the city come in they're going to be our friends and our associates and it's not going to be like oh here comes those people coming into the gay i wish the king would shut the gate when they walk in it's going to be ah oh how are you doing how are things going there's going to be a love there's going to be a respect there's going to be an appreciation it's not going to be first class second class it's going to be the bride amen and the king the predestinated chosen elect of god and then all outside and there's going to be a great fellowship and a tremendous love and a tremendous joy amen praise god brother baby said don't condemn them that's all i know that's all that's in them but to you who believe to you who know to you that's got something in you that's calling to the deep if all the deep you've got's been satisfied then stay where you are but for me in my house for me there's something more that than what i what he sees there's a land beyond the river somewhere there's still a deep calling to the deep i cannot be satisfied with theology i cannot be satisfied with good a good church i cannot be satisfied with good a good campaign i cannot be satisfied with a little healing service there's something beyond that that's calling so just let them alone go on through don't argue with them but we're passing to another land they wasn't ordained to go with you but i was ordained to go on amen amen and if you can just fly a little higher and see things for what they are it takes all the argument and all the bickering and all the fighting out of it amen you see somebody amen they just have no capacity to receive the message no capacity in them to see it but they live true to what they see they honor and respect they speak no evil of the bride they speak no evil of the word of the revelation amen you can just say go on friend i'll see you on the other side because they may be one who receives entrance into eternal life for just not condemning not rejecting not disrespecting the bride but showing respect and love and holding their portion and being a penny so may we see many of those on the other side remember abraham was friends with abimelech that's right and bemalek wasn't a real israelite david was friends with hiram of tyre they were good friends and he wasn't an israelite he wasn't part of the chosen nation and solomon continued that friendship amen that's all through the bible friends so may god bless all those that are around us amen and may we have the right approach and the right attitude and be christ-like in all things and if we ever step to the right or left may god's hand of correction come down fast even if it's in the middle of a sentence in the middle of preaching in the pulpit i'm still thankful that god corrects his children and keeps us straight amen if you could turn with me to romans i want to go into another thought there were some things that i didn't finish on sunday because my cage was rattled and so i'd like to share some of those thoughts i'd like to take a text of eve restored eve restored and talk about that today and go to romans chapter 8. we've been reading this scripture quite a lot lately romans 8 and verse 29 some of the the beauty and joy of being able to preach sunday and wednesday and sunday and wednesday is when you when you get on something you can just stay on it amen and you keep thinking you're going to move off and you just don't move off and god and god amen keeps giving more out of the same scriptures romans 8 and 29 for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified if you find yourself in that scripture then don't worry you're already glorified we're traveling through amen we're traveling through the manifestation in this dimension in flesh we're doing the part that he's called us to do to display the portion of the word for our day but in the great plan of god in god's mind he sees it finished he sees us finished he sees the whole works done from the beginning amen and he knows amen that we are already glorified in his mind there is no chance of us not making it if that doesn't bring peace to our hearts there's nothing that's going to bring peace to our hearts amen and so many times there's so much pressure to perform and i got to be the bride and i got to do these things amen and then under that pressure every time we fail amen we go back to zero and say well maybe i'm not and i'm not sure amen friends the god has sent a message to break us out of that pentecostal idea amen the armenianism amen that was rampant in the previous age he come to break us out of that because if if god if you were ever chosen of god and for ordained amen you were always chosen and foreordained and so the security that that brings gives a release amen not a pressure amen not a pressure to be something but a release to be what's inside it's not an outside pressure it's not a confirmation amen that's pushing us into something but it's actually a revelation that takes all the bonds off all the chains all the limitations that limit us in the flesh removes that so that we have the freedom to be what's on the inside it's the opposite and brother bam said in spiritual amnesia from 1964 he said you that wants the holy spirit you that wants that experience not an emotional excitement you want the holy ghost the life the germ of life inside you and you want to get rid of that amnesia that makes you you can't identify yourself you don't know where you stand you don't know what you are let's get rid of it right now there is a new birth here for you a real genuine new birth so when brother brown says this you realize that the the new birth amen is here to take away my spiritual amnesia the new birth is here to reconnect me with what was in the mind of god before my true identity who i really am the new birth is here to unlock the mystery inside of me [Music] let's look at first peter together first peter chapter 1. first peter 1 and 23. i've read this several times but it's always striking to me being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible so the new birth is by the incorruptible seed not the corruptable seed but incorruptible by the word of god so it takes the word of god amen to bring the new birth of the incorruptible seed but of the incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever brother ben says in the god who is rich in mercy i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now are you the sons of god see you always were the sons of god for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you had to be some part of you your life that's in you now what was that the incorruptable seed that life that's in you now had to be with god before there well when when he before he even became material on earth before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he knowed the color hair you would have he knowed all about you so there's nothing to worry about amen and when i say this i always feel compelled amen to qualify some certain statements amen god no he knew he knew before the foundation word you were chosen you were you were called you were justified you were glorified all before in this thinking your place is secure your position is is stable it's not moving but yet in this flesh we're still a given opportunity to make choices amen and while we're in this journey amen those choices will have repercussions so there is still a law of sowing and reaping that takes place but that law of sowing and reaping is in the flesh not in the soul in the flesh we make choices in the flesh amen we get chastised we have we have ups and we have downs amen but god's plan is still secure none of that is changing his plan none of that is changing his idea none of that is changing his purpose for your life those are just those are part of our experience here to learn we're here don't forget we're here on this earth for two things we're here to fulfill his purpose to manifest his word in due season and we're here to learn what we could not learn in perfection so god sets up his laws in the fact that he foreknew us and choses and glorified us so that he would never lose any portion of himself the plan is secure and he made it by faith so that it could be by grace amen because that's his love it's his love for himself it's his love for his elect it's his love for his portions of himself and that grace is secure and he made it by faith because he knows the seed when it comes in contact with the word will believe the word because there are two parts of the same thing but yet for us to learn the things that we couldn't learn in glory glory also gives us free moral agency so that we can make choices and by those choices we can make wrong choices and so in those wrong choices amen we can have a rod of correction and we can begin to realize well after time after time after time we begin to realize that the only thing that works is the word i've tried it by reasoning i've tried it and by group consensus i've tried it every which way i can try it i've let my passions run me i've followed the leader amen i've listened to ministers i've done everything but at the end of the day i realized that the only thing that works is stay with the word because every time i venture from it i get i get spanked i get chastised and i reap consequences that can sometimes last a lifetime and god's not going to change that because you're the elect predestinated seed that's part of the training but it doesn't change who we are when moses was he was born a proper child he was ordained before the foundation of the world to be the deliverer amen that was a fulfillment of the prophecy given to abraham that was when moses was born he was born with that portion of god to manifest that word inside of him already and when he by his own choosing chose to get ahead of god's program and do by his own will what he thought was right he failed miserably and ran into the wilderness for 40 years amen but he could never change what was already in him and who he was ordained to be god had no option but to chase him down in the wilderness and find him and bring him back that's why god has no option but to chase you down in your wilderness and find you and bring you back he had no option but to prepare a fish to swallow jonah no option but to come in a burning bush to get the attention of moses no option but to come as a still small voice to get elijah because nobody else will do it was the portion of himself ordained for that time and that vessel and he had to use that one and he's done the same thing for you and i am no matter how many times we've failed backslid run away he's chased us down he spoke to us in our cave amen he swallowed us up he brought a storm that would get us out of the boat and swallowed us up and bring us back to the commission amen he found us back on the backside of the desert hiding out from the believers hiding from the message and he does something supernatural to get our attention and bring us back to our commission amen he's not going to lose one amen amen amen now you know why life is so hard now you know why every time every time i do wrong every time i get off the path it's the repercussions are so severe it's seeming like others can just move on amen but you're the bride of jesus christ you're the elect of god you're a portion of that life that's the the word to be manifested today amen if you get out of god's will he's gonna find a way to bring you back in and we love that my rod and thy staff they comfort me brother ram says in the message communion i finished with this on sunday now then one day as i walked on the voice talking don't never smoke drink so forth and the young fellas and and all got older see there was something moving but yet all at once i looked up and i said i'm not the son of charles and elle branham what's happening is amnesia's lifting there's something calling like my little eagle i'm not a chicken there's something up yonder somewhere oh great jehovah whoever you are open up i want to come home there's something in me calling there was a born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow now that old life was forgiven put in the sea of god's forgiveness to never be remembered against me no more the old life the way i was born the wrong nature through hybridization amen through the new birth when i recognized who i was when i recognized the word and i called out to god there was a new birth and the old life was forgiven and put in the sea of god's forgiveness never to be remembered no more and we become a new creature in christ and as a new creature in christ amen in the flesh you can still fail god and make a mistake it will chastise you but you'll never go back to being what you were before that old life you're divorced from that old life it's put in the sea of god's forgiveness never to be remembered no more god doesn't see you as hybrid god doesn't see you as fallen he sees you as redeemed he sees you as perfect he sees you as his bride he'll take care of the errors in the flesh and the wrong thoughts in the spirit he'll correct that and get that out but there's you've changed something has changed you're not what you were you're a born-again son and daughter of god never to go back to what you were before that old life is forgiven put in the sea of god's forgiveness never to be remembered against me no more see now we stand justified as though you never had sinned in the presence of god brother man says christ in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed i'm going to read several quotes quite a few quotes out of this message and it's a message that just continues to unfold for me all the time it says you think i'm beside myself i'm not we've got the devil's answer let me now not me that liveth but christ the word living in me it's not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here and here it is we god is answering christ is risen and has paid the price for our redemption what god in christ manifested he gave that flesh that and blood that in the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed that god and his redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day listen this is the answer to the devil's question the answer to the devil's question has everything to do with your position in christ let's just keep reading that then we stand justified in the presence of god as a drop of ink dropping into a tub full of bleach you've never you'll never find the stain in the ink no more it went somewhere it'll never come back again and when a man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished i'm going to read that sentence again because we're going to talk about what's not in this sentence and when a man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it and then changes his behavior and starts acting right and comes to church every service that's not in there friends it says that predestination that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished by what seeing the truth and accepting it seeing jesus christ and recognizing for who he is the present day jesus christ you see it your sins are demolished amen but then you say what about all the habits of my flesh and the actions and the lies and the smoking amen let him who purchased you take care of the thing he's purchased believe amen believe your sins are demolished believe you're born again by the spirit of god and let him that's on the inside be the control tower to bring the outside man subject to the inside [Applause] you have to have faith in who you are amen if you're in one day and out the next day in one day now you're never going to kick a smoking habit you're never going to kick a lust habit amen because you're in and out in and out no confidence in the plan of god no confidence in the redemption of jesus christ that's the truth amen you have more confidence you have more faith in your in your inability to keep the word than in his ability to keep his promise it's showing a lack of faith in god a lack of confidence in his blood but we're going to believe the word and let the word wash us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness christ is risen and has paid the price for our redemption what god in christ manifested he gave that flesh that and blood that in the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed he's not talking about jesus's flesh and his first coming talking about our flesh that god in his redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day amen i will read this last sentence again when the man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed that season accepts it his sins are demolished it's gone it's separated it's dropped into the ink of the blood of jesus christ and it's never to be remembered god forgets it and he stands as a son and daughter of god in the presence of god amen amen now we are sons of god not we will be we are now we are redeemed we have satan's answer god has vindicated himself god proves himself to his promise in this day hallelujah the headship is here amen christ the risen lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he that he ever was manifesting itself there's the devil's answer it's not me devil it's him it's not my word it's not my idea it's not my choosing it's his his word his choosing his idea his plan and he's here praise god again in crisis the mystery says predestinated there's the mystery he before christ or anything else was ever on earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing eve would fall oh this is so good friends he chose the bride knowing eve would fall amen it didn't say he chose eve he chose the bride amen because the heart purpose of god is to have a bride after his own choosing the heart purpose of god is to have you and me amen what he was doing in the garden of eden was displaying or foreshadowing or portraying his heart's purpose he knew that would fall because his heart's purpose amen was not that that was expressing his heart's purpose his heart's purpose was to have a bride of his own choosing let's keep going knowing he would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall now listen he chose a bride he didn't choose that bride after you come to the earth and he watched your characteristics and he decided i think that's going to be a pretty good one they're going to keep my laws and understand no he chose the bride before the foundation of the world when you were glorified so so he chose a bride but when he chose a bride he chose a bride that would not fall you cannot become the bride by a good life you cannot become you cannot be thrown out of the bride by a bad life brother chad you mean we can do anything we want yes be born again by the spirit of god let that incorruptible seed come to life and do whatever you want because what that seed wants to do is keep the word love the lord it's part of god there's a natural attraction to the word and a desire to fulfill all of it if you're the bride of jesus christ do what you want and in the deepest depths of your heart amen if you want lust amen and you want cigarettes and you want alcohol go get it friends because i promise you if you're a predestinated seed of god you're going to hit a dead end road amen and you're going to wake up one day in a hospital on your back in a car wreck somewhere because he's not going to lose you anymore he's going to lose jonah or moses or elijah he will get you back to where you need to be until you have that new birth experience and awakened to the real you and then when you do what you want you do what you want from the life that's in the seed and what the life and the seed wants is him wants him all of him all i can give him i want more of him i want more tomorrow than i had today amen i want to live a greater life i want to be more pleasing to him i want to know him better and see him more unveiled that's all we want friends that's it are there desires in this flesh yes wrong desire still wrong actions lust and selfishness and all of that but there's a love on the inside that's greater than the hybridization there's something growing on the inside that wants him more than this flesh amen wants all the things of the world amen let the bride come to a new birth and let her have what she wants because she wants him he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold on to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold on to that word they are predestined to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand now you see a secret what too to restore fallen eve as she was a prefigure of the church that whole story in genesis adam son of god amen in him being male and female coming out man two manifestations of flesh united back together as one what was that that was a pre-figure of what god was going to do to restore fallen eve as she was the pre-figure of the church so what's his plan been all along and then his great masterpiece that he put the pre-figure masterpiece the masterpiece family in the garden of eden it was marred and it fell and he went right away back to work to remake it he didn't just say oh well that didn't work no he had a plan all along and it was all part of the plan that's why he knew he knew amen that eve would fall amen because he was going to have a bride after his own choosing so what was he going to do with this bride he was going to restore her back fallen eve coming back and then when eve comes back he's not talking about that same flesh amen eve that came out of the flesh of adam when that eve comes back he's talking about whatever that eve prefigured when it's standing here on the earth today he's bringing that back what's the secret he said that's the secret now you see the secret what too to restore fallen eve as she was a prefigure of the church and now notice as god opened up the side of adam and took out eve by his own flesh and blood and divided his spirit from masculine and feminist to feminist and put it in eve took the rib from under his side and made eve out of it so god did the same thing taking out of the side of christ the blood and the water and christ is the word and taking the word and making up his church eve see back to himself again redeemed by the blood that was coming from his body you see it now god's great mystery now being unfolded that's been hid since the foundation of the world but prefigured all the way down through now watch we find that that he did that and here he here in ephesians and many other places but that will give you enough you know now down through the ages he has been slowly unfolding this mystery can you see it now now down through the how did he what happened in the pre-figure now he opened adam's side and took part of his flesh which was adam to make eve the bride has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on creeds she cannot stand on the nomination she cannot stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she is part of it she was taken from christ again further down in christ is a mystery but god's great mystery what the eternal god had as a mystery has now been unfolded in jesus christ then give right down to his church what was once in god's mind is now in the body of christ what's the body of christ the church the believers the bride is the body of christ what was once in god's mind is now in the body of christ jesus making love to the church his bride whispering secrets to her is he making love to you amen is he telling you who you are and what you are and how much you mean to him and what his plans for the future are amen what's he telling you what was in the mind of god and the great mind of god prefigured it and he figured in such a way it was a mystery they didn't understand the story of adam and eve they didn't understand amen well they didn't understand what's going on it was a neat story and for thousands of years it's been a creation story amen but it's not a creation story amen it's a redemption story amen it's a christ in bride's story that's been the secret prefigured all the way down through that's been the secret amen what was fallen has to be restored amen so there's got to be a second adam come to restore all that the first adam lost and he did that in jesus christ but there's got to be a last eve amen because until eve is restored there can never be amen a restoration to eden we cannot there's no way to go to the millennium until the woman is restored and the restoration has to be complete and has to be finished every predestination like seed has to come in to this before we can ever go to any other place praise god christ is mystery of god revealed again notice one liked that first adam and eve before sin separated them in death now christ the second adam in life redeems his bride from death and now on his way back to the original eden restoring back his bride and fellowship back with god as husband and wife in the garden of eden sure christ and his bride so what's happening what's going on all around us what's happening amen the second adam in life redeems his bride from death and now on his way back to the original eden re what's he doing restoring back his bride in fellowship what's he doing the two are becoming one they're being united to get in fellowship to go back to the original eden so there's no going back to eden until you have a fully restored event it's important to know again he says it's a revelation it's as eternal as god's word is eternal look but the threefold purpose of god's great mystery is revealed god manifests in christ christ manifesting the church in order to redeem the lost eve back to the original condition in the garden of eden what's he trying to do he's trying to get he wanted a bride of his own choosing he foreshadowed it it fell he's been bringing it back amen what's he been bringing back he's not been bringing back the original adam and eve that was the foreshadow he's been bringing back what they foreshadowed he's been bringing back what's he been bringing back christ and the bride of his own choosing that's what he's bringing back and he's restoring eve he's restoring who he's restoring the bride in this day restoring her back to what restoring her back to an eden condition what was her eden condition sinless spotless virtuous bride of the son of god god in this day by the washing of the water of the word is restoring this eve back to her eden condition my brother chad quit looking in the mirror and start looking in the mirror the inward man the real you is restored back to an eden condition you never did it in the first place why you is he talking to not the outer man he's talking to the inner man you've never did it in the first place amen and when that revelation then it comes to a place where we know what we are who we are every elections come in and the revelation rises the part that's binding us down still will be changed amen to a glorified condition so don't worry about that focus on the reality the reality is not out here the reality is in here and what has he done he's pronounced it already you who's standing with the word on the word with the word amen if you believe every word every jot and every tittle you're standing justified as if you've never done it in the first place what is that that's an eden condition friends the bride is being restored by the word by faith in the word by the blood of jesus christ and faith in that amen she's being restored by the washing of the water of the word back to an eden condition how could brother branham look at a people just like us say you're the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ oh god i want a faith in me that says that's nothing but the truth not because i made it happen. because i'm worthy of it happening it's nothing but the truth because something in me knows that's the truth i know that's my full ordained position i know i've been justified i know i've been glorified i know he's called me to this glorious stand i know that i was part of him before the foundation of the world i can't show it to you in the flesh i can't make you believe it but something in me knows it's a reality and i could say if he if that prophet can declare amen me believing all of this word totally justified then i can accept it by faith there's nothing for me to fear praise god in order to redeem that lost eve back to the original condition in the garden of eden because that has to come back before they can go back to eden she's got to be restored back to an eaten condition before she can go back to eden that means all of our sin has to be washed away again in crisis of mystery says watch redeemed by christ the second adam you believe he was going back home to eden with his fallen wife redeemed back home again that's christ in the church today taking his wife back what's he doing he's in the church today taking us back see the threefold mystery now god manifested in christ christ manifested in the church all together to bring back the original adam and eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood and same spirit and everything else whatever he is she is what's he doing today it's christ manifested his church all together to bring back the original adam and eve again now remember what did eve fall from she fell from disbelieving the word so if you're going to restore eve back first you have to bring the word back right if there's going to be a restoration of the woman of eve to the original eaten condition then in the original eden condition they had the word of god unperverted unpolluted unchanged they had the original word the perfect word they had the original commandment from the lord amen and then that got perverted and then she fell by disbelieving the word and taking satan's lie and then after that she manifest in the flesh what had already happened on the inside so now if we're going to bring her back to an eden condition you have to bring the word back to an eden condition you have to bring a word back to its original word in its original form and its original purity without perversion amen without corruption of man without reasoning without all that if you bring the word back amen then you can bring eve back to the word she fell by disbelieving the word amen she's still falling amen by disbelieving the word because she doesn't have the word she's believing in trinitarian baptisms and a trinity doctrine of god and believing in all kinds of false ideas and then in order to get her back to an even condition you've got to bring the word back for her to believe so she can come back to faith in the word to come back to the purity she was in in the beginning not by her conduct by her faith now you see why god sends a prophet why god restored his word why did god restore his word so you can say i know the truth on servant seed and i know this and i know to know so he could restore you he has to restore the word so he can restore you amen the husband has to come so you can unite with your mate amen the revealed word he's got i mean the whole the whole ministry of the prophet amen was not to say hey look at what we know and denominations are wrong this doctrine's wrong that doctrine's wrong let's have doctrinal debates because now we're right that wasn't the purpose it was to restore the word so when he restores the word there's going to be a seed on the earth that will believe that fully restored word so the full word in its original form is back in an eaten condition the tree of life restored and the tree of life restored can now restore the bride tree which will be the tree of life restored back to himself again god sent his prophet to restore his word back to purity so that he can raise up a bride that would believe that word and be purified by faith in that word to come back to an eden condition again so the two could unite all friends it was more than saying i believe god sent a prophet i do believe god sent a prophet what was that prophet here to do what was his purpose for coming because god always sends a prophet with a purpose moses came to lead him out of egypt and to take him to the promised land not so they can say moses was a prophet yeah he was a prophet what was the purpose of the prophet to do the work of the lord what was the work of the lord to unite the two together in the token he says then you are subject for the resurrection because the resurrection power is already in you the token is the resurrection power showing that jesus raised up from the dead and you are raised up from the dead the dead things of unbelief amen eve has come back to life again you're raised from the dead being the bride of his own choosing what dead the dead of unbelief how can you come back from the dead of unbelief unless the word has first been restored for you to believe in you are raised from the dead the dead things of unbelief and have been made alive in the word of jesus christ you believe it and the word lives through you let's turn to ephesians chapter 2 quickly ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation we were all in that miserable shape in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others now i want you to read that scripture carefully i don't want to go too fast among them also we all had our conversation in times past fulfilling the lust of our flesh outer man fulfilling the desires of the flesh outer man and of the mind outer man and we're by nature outer man children of wrath even as others that's the hybridization that's the wrong birth that's coming the wrong way but in order to change that amen he's got to bring the new birth out of the incorruptable seed but god who is a rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins and it hath quickened us together with christ by grace you're saved and have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that none of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them you were born the way others were born you fulfilled the lust of the flesh the way others fulfilled the love to the flesh you fulfilled the desires of the mind with a corrupt mind like everybody else but god who is rich in mercy love that he loved us already loved us amen for by grace you are saved amen through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of god god had already pre-wired you to receive his word that's his grace that's his love let's go to colossians chapter 1. colossians 1 and verse 18. and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead then in all things he might have preeminence brother ben says back in christ is the mystery god revealed he is the head of the church which is his body and he wants the preeminences listen now listen close what we're going here what he is to be the head of the body his bride body which is taken from him flesh and bone like adam see brian born from the dead see that's born from the dead sin of unbelief what killed eve unbelief is that right their unbelief in what the unbelief in god no she had faith in god sure did she there isn't she didn't say there is no god no sir she wasn't an infidel she said you know i don't believe in in the word at all no she believed all but one little thing now you see why the word has got to be restored in this day and then it's got to come back to the full revelation of jesus christ it can't have parts missing and it can't have parts that are wrong because she wasn't a disbeliever of god she wasn't a disbeliever of all the word but she lost that part of the word through reasoning that part of the word and because of the lie of the devil and she was deceived she disbelieved and the church ages has been deceived by the same thing amen but he's got to bring back that word so she can believe it so she can be restored now didn't the bible say over in the book of revelation jesus said himself as jesus sent my angel to testify of these things unto you whosoever shall take one word from it or add one word to it and if all this heartache and sorrow had to come because a woman doubted one word of god will he let you back doubting one word he would be unjust see that wouldn't be right be condemned skip down a paragraph he says now no notice now he is the head of the body that's born that's born from the sin of unbelief in god's word she was dead but she's resurrected now she's born from the dead born from the dead sin of unbelief in god's word what what is the bride she's born from the dead she's coming back to her eden condition to be united with the headship to go back to eden that excuses every denomination every crete see unbelief in the word which is himself the word of life the word only has life any other word is hybrid no matter how much it looks like it it isn't the word the word produces its own life and eve swapped for personal knowledge the the eve swapped it for her own knowledge and her own life amen but the word produces its own life amen so if we can get the word back the word produces its own life when eve swapped it for knowledge it brought death amen and now this bride has been laying dead but she's born again from the dead amen quickened from dead from sins and trespasses quickened from unbelief brought back to life again brought back to her eating condition and when she comes back to the word the word produces its own life it's not a life you live it's a life he lives through you again in christ as the word of god revealed he is the first fruits of the resurrection is that right watch then what is he he is the head of the body which is his church then the bride buddy body must follow the head for it as part of his resurrection and part of the mystery the bride body is part of the resurrection and part of the mystery and god has had a mystery he's been unfolding it down through the ages amen and the bride body is part of that mystery and so when when christ comes to the fullness when the full word comes back amen is resurrected out of dead denominations and comes back to its full power the body must resurrect with the head when the word comes back the bride comes back praise god i'll read that sins again then the bride body must follow the head for it as part of his resurrection and part of the mystery it's impossible for it not to go oh my it's part of god's mystery how god revealed himself here and raise it up by the word so he reveals his church and raises it up by the same word it's part of the threefold mystery as the head was took from the grave so must the body follow him back to eden where the head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bridegroom must follow the bride because that's the head and the head is revealed and come back with eternal life and the body must follow that because it's husband and wife again amen and as long as you're pregnanted with the same word which is his body you've took his body become in him when you took the word amen you become one with him when you took the word what were not yesterday's word but today's word the full word that's come back to the original not the creed the word let's turn to first corinthians first corinthians 15. first corinthians 15 and 20. in first corinthians chapter 15 verse 20 but now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead president adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order christ the first reads afterward they that are christ at his coming let's read this again i like to read it again for as an adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christ at his coming when the word resurrects the bride resurrects let's read this verse again 23 but every man in his own order christ the first roots afterward they that are christ that is coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign until he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that he shall destroy is death praise be to god he's taking us back to an eaten condition he's taking us back in spirit and he's going to take us back in flesh and the seventh seal prophet of god says it's an old battle that started way back beyond time and there was satan and his angels was kicked out and then they come to earth and the battle set in again because eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of god from that very hour satan won the battle over god's word because one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word so how is he going to restore it back when the subjects take all the word and believe the word now eve brother brethren said eve was fortified behind the word but now adam and eve in the garden of eden were a foreshadow of what god really wanted because god created them and knew that they would fall because his heart his his heart purpose was have a bride of his own choosing so he set this up as a foreshadow declaring from the end from the beginning from the beginning what he did then is declaring what will be at the end so now he set this up to foreshadow it fell he created in a way that he could fall knowing it would fall although he didn't will it to fall he knew it would fall and it would fulfill his great purpose and his great plan because what he wanted was he wanted a bride you and me to be restored back so he hid her behind the word and and the security of adam and his wife was to stay behind the word but something's changed something's different now now brother branham let's just read what he said i'm not going to ruin it by saying it in the identified masterpiece of god in december of 1964 he says when he made his first masterpiece he put him behind the word when he made his second masterpiece he was the word big difference there's a real big difference from being behind the word and being the word because adam and eve were protected behind the word as long as they stayed behind the word the devil couldn't get to them amen so if they would step around from this word amen then they were open game for the devil and that's how they fell by moving out from behind the word amen but what if there's nothing to be behind anymore amen it's not the thing that was protecting them was separate from them but now the thing that's protecting us is who we really are we are the word amen that's why she can't fall she's predestinated not to fall because she's not behind the word she is the word and the devil couldn't go through that word to get to them amen but now we are the word and he can't break the word [Applause] it's different god protected them behind the wall of the word because it was a foreshadow but when the reality comes it's not behind the word it is the word you can no more fail than god can fail amen you are the living word amen jesus christ manifested in the flesh body of his bride amen how is the devil he can circle all around today man but he cannot penetrate that word because we are the word the living word restored back to the word the word come to the word the body and the headship the capstone is united together and when we take him his word amen when we take his body the word we become in him the word amen cannot be defeated cannot fail amen why because the word has been restored to the original condition the bride has been united with that word and come in the word to be part of the word and she's not hiding behind anything she doesn't have to hide behind anything there's nothing to hide behind jesus christ when he came in flesh two thousand years ago he wasn't hiding behind anything he was the word made flesh he didn't have to hide he didn't need protection he was the word and he could not be defeated amen we're not hiding worried if i step over here if i step over here i'll be lost oh i've got to be so careful no you are the word the very plan of god the very heart purpose of god is taking place in our lives right now and it cannot fail it's predestinated not to fall amen when he made a second masterpiece he was the word he was the word not behind the word but he was the word god never changes the plan that's exactly what he started off to do his first church with the word a few paragraphs down it says now we noticed that god began to make a bride for christ and the bride must be identified with him and in him because it's part of him now the brightest part of him she is part of him the word for that day the bride becomes part of the word for its christ now you believe that we have to be in christ in christ we have to be of christ in christ part of christ what is a woman when she takes a man or a man takes a woman the woman has to be part of him they're no longer two they're one and when god and christ become one they were one because god was the word and the word was made flesh the flesh and the word become one and when the church becomes christ's bride she and the gospels are the same i want to ask you what the gospels are brother ben and brandon say she and the gospel are the same she and the gospels are the same if you look at the gospels matthew mark luke and john what are they they're a record of something what do they record the son of man ministry that's the record of the son of man ministry and we know the son of man ministry has returned the son of man is here and i'll read that sins again and when the church becomes christ's bride she and the gospels are the same that was the record of the son of man misery and now she's declaring the son of man ministry in the easter seal he says his messianic anointed ones believe that what is the messiah what is the messiah messiah's anointed one and now if he was the messiah by being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of god to be the redeemer and the anointed one and god raised up that body his bride is the anointed one for this day she and the gospels become the same it's already raised with him in the resurrection because these these two are one when the word come back to original the predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it moves back to original eden condition you never did it in the first place back in christ as the mystery of god revealed he says what is it not them people the headship and the body has become one unit it's god manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer twained there one god in this church is one christ in you god's great revelation glory to god even bearing his name his name is jesus the anointed the reason he's called jesus he is the anointed it's the anointed body of christ proving manifesting god like that body did and that body redeemed every of this these bodies and through there god works his threefold manifestation going to the kingdom risen paid the price we're redeemed god has provided proved it vindicated it see and we stand justified in christ before him because he cannot pass judgment for he's already judged that body in which i am a part of what how am i a part of it here it is it's me if ye abide in me and my words in you then ask what you will ask the father anything in my name it will be done because it's there justified glory to god oh if i could get the world to see that why there you are there is the body of christ living standing redeemed redeemed he says it with emphasis if i could get the world to see this you're not going to be redeemed by accepting the redeemer in this full measure you are now redeemed god was working through the church ages amen as a redeemer redeeming redeeming amen but at the end of the church ages amen he has redeemed amen he's redeemed the church he's redeemed his bride and now he's come to unite with what he's redeemed we are already redeemed now uniting with christ so there's no hoping it's going to work out it's already worked out and we stand justified oh praise god justified in his sight why are we justified that's a good question why are we justified listen the way he says we are his victory why are we his victory because the heart purpose of god was to have a bride of his own choosing and in the in the pre-figure that bride fell by disbelieving the word but god before the foundation of the world portioned himself out to ensure that the bride of his own choosing will not fall by disbelieving the word and he's been bringing it back word by word word by word word by word until finally he builds it all the way back to the capping off and brings the full word back amen and he's already seen down through time that there'll be a portion of myself that will be my bride of my own choosing and when i bring the word back to its original condition there'll be a there'll be a bride there that'll say that's nothing but the truth and when they say that's nothing but the truth that that brings her into her original condition sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ by what by the same measure amen that abraham was imputed with righteousness by the same measure amen that there's always been salvation down through time because they see the word and they receive the word and when the word come back in fullness it brought the redemption in fullness there's now no partial there's no you've got all this but i'm still covering for this amen no he brought all the word back and the bride says i believe it all amen i believe but i believe the predestination i believe the serpent seed i believe water baptism i believe i was in the mind of god before the foundation i believe it all i may not explain it well i mean i may not be able to put it in terms of your understanding but something in me says everything that prophet said is nothing but the truth redeemed not redeeming redeemed redeemed the decide why are we justified we are his victory redemption is not our victory i got redeemed i went to the altar and i heard that preacher and i said he's right and i went up there and got redeemed it's not your victory it's his victory we are justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in his last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory amen we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us and we're already potentially arise because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word what is it eve is raised from her dead condition again and being restored back to her eating condition because we're raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denomination creeds to an eternal word of the eternal god which is him himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever and then there there would be a time come forth when he would express himself this is christ as the mystery god revealed there would be a time he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by why accepting what eve turned down what did he have turned down the original word and its purity she turned it down amen but now we've accepted what eve turned down you realize that was a foreshadow of four days it wasn't that we said oh yeah i'm not going to eat of that i mean if i was ever in the garden of eden i wouldn't eat that fruit whatever that fruit was it's not that that was a foreshadow she left the original word in its original condition and for reasoning she took her own mind by her own lust and that's been the failure of mankind from that day on but there's coming a time when he's going to bring the full word back and that full word is coming back and declaring itself and showing itself and it's saying i'm here i'm here i'm here amen listening for a voice to say i see you i see you i see you you're here you're here you're here in all your full glory you're here in all your power you're here in all your fullness he's going i'm here and there's a people predestined on the earth that says i can see you and the world's blind to it but there's a predestined bride that's called to go back to an even condition he's calling i'm here do you see me in the cloud do you see me in the son of man and a son of man do you see me in the bride do you see me in the word and there's a bride here saying i see you i see you i see you and that revelation is bringing her back to her original condition we've accepted what eve turned down the original word in its full manifestation in its original form and we've accepted what eve turned down and we accepted what eve turned down we've reversed the curse that was upon eve and we've come back into an eden condition that's why brother branham could look at the the church and say you are the sin if you're standing on this word with this word every jot every tittle where are we standing i'm trying to tell you as we close you're standing on god's word and with god's word you're the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ you're totally justified you never did it in the first place because you can accept him you can see him amen you recognize him for who he is amen and you can come to that manifestation and become one with that you are back in your original eden condition will i make the body change i already did i already have i've been changed and then i've been brought back from the life i've been resurrected from the dead deadness of unbelief i've been resurrected into the newness of life i've already got a body change on the inside i'm just waiting for the outside to catch up with the inside i've already been brought back to what i fell from i've already manifested the purpose that he had from before the foundation of the world now we're just waiting for that last one to recognize their place amen and then the outside is going to catch up with the inside i'm not afraid of not making the body change i've already made it when did you make it before the foundation of the world when i was in the mind of god that's why the sons of god clapped together and shouted for joy but the person why because they saw the plan of redemption and they began to shout and rejoice at the plan of redemption i was shouting then that's why i'm shouting now i was saying hallelujah then when he showed it to me in a foreshadow amen and now i'm saying hallelujah now when i'm down in this condition amen spiritual amnesia is being broken away and i can rejoice over the same thing i rejoiced over back there his plan of redemption for me not redeemed not being redeemed not going to be redeemed i am redeemed amen the word has come back amen christ is here in fullness the words in its original condition and i've united as a husband with a wife with the original word bringing me back to my original condition hallelujah what are we afraid of nothing how will he lose that he never will friends anointed by why accepting what eve turned down and adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see anointed with the word what eve turned down oh listen close what eve turned down he comes back what did eve turn down christ the word the original word the anointed word the word in that day the original word in the original form before any pollution or hybridization it said he said my word is spirit see anointed with the word what eve turned down he does not say it comes back he said he comes back and we accept it he has come back and we've accepted it it couldn't be accepted until this day because it couldn't be unfolded in his fullness till this day but when it's unfolded in its fullness god knew you would be here to accept it and by accepting that the washing of the water of the word the blood of jesus christ all the power that was in calvary is now made effect in a living bride standing at the end time and she's declared sinless spotless virtues bride of jesus christ not because she never makes a mistake not because she doesn't still have a temper sometimes not because she doesn't stress the truth but because she's accepted him he's come back and she accepted it see how that hybrid condition again just exactly what he'd done eve he told eve don't you do this don't you do that and you can do this and that and satan said oh you know and she turned around and listened to him but the even the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to do it yes sir god's going to do it he knows he'll have it he said it church would be here without spot or wrinkle she's going to stand there in the splendor of him his word made manifest if he predestinated a bridegroom he's predestinated a bride and the two have come together to do what to restore back to eden i'd like to close by quoting the scripture colossians 1 26 even the mystery which had been hid from the ages and from generations but is now made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory we've quoted that scripture 20 30 40 50 years but it's becoming more of a reality every day more of my life more of my identity more of who i am it is setting the stage for who i really am and it's bringing me out of amnesia back to my original condition i hope it's doing the same for you he did in such a way he guaranteed results because now it's not going to be a man standing behind a lutheran doctrine for protection or standing behind a pentecostal doctrine for protection amen are trying to keep commandments and stay behind no he made sure that you're not going to stand behind anything amen but the thing that was protecting them you've become the thing that was keeping satan from these children you have become that thing that was the wall impenetrable unchangeable undefeatable word of god made manifest in this day not because you earned it not because you're good not because you look nice done nice acting nice but because he predestinated before the foundation of the world and he's got a solution for the hybrid condition we were born in and he's not looking at that because that life is put away in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered no more and he sees you as he always intended for you to be that's how a prophet of god can look at a people with problems and faults and complexes in all kinds of marriage situations said you're the sinless spotless bride of jesus christ why because you're justified by faith justified what is justified just as if you've never done it just by faith faith in what faith in the full measure of the word that's been restored in this day bringing me back to a full revelation of justification praise be to god friends that should do something to us that should release us free us and from the bondage of trying and failing and hybridization and confusion in our mind it should free us to say god whatever you intended me to be is what i want to be god i'm yielding i'm giving myself i'm relaxing i'm all yours do with me what you want i'm not going to try i'm not going to press i'm not going to push i'm just going to submit and let you do what you always intended to do because i'm not going to fail i'm not afraid of failing satan's not going to slip around behind the word and get me and i'm not going to step out from around it but because i've taken him i've become him and he is the word and now that is the wall [Music] i'm not afraid not in jeopardy i'm not in jeopardy i'm not on trial i've passed from death into life there is now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus in the wall those scriptures have got to become a living reality no more fear no more manipulation from churches and systems and dogmas no more manipulation no more fear mongering amen you've you've been declared by a prophet in this age that if you're standing on the word and standing with the word and believe every jot and every title where are you standing you're standing justified back in your original condition in the mind of god what he intended for you to be and there's nothing for you to fear praise be to god the question is can we have mary's faith can he say something that he's never said before can he do something that he's never done before can he make a declaration on the earth that's never happened you're going to conceive a child knowing no man it's going to be the fulfillment of the word it's never been it's never been done amen it's never been said to a to a human before and how how is it going to happen what's going to be the holy ghost the thing in you is going to be formed of the holy ghost and she's going to say amen be it unto me according to the word amen he's saying something that's not been said to the church jesus never been said before amen he's saying it now in the end time amen if you're united with christ you become christ you become in him you become the wall amen and you can no more fail than he can fail you've already made it you're already predestinated you've been chosen to this glorious last day you are his victory and the reason of his death what can defeat that friends nothing's going to defeat that but can we have mary's faith when he can say something that's not been said like that before not been said to humans before when he says it that way can you say be it unto me i believe it all i'm frustrated with my flesh i'm frustrated with my fallen mind but whatever that is that you just said it's the truth it's me it's me praise god let's all stand musicians if you could come oh friends this word is the greatest unlocking power that i know of it's the greatest liberation the greatest freedom that has ever been on this earth religion has bound people for thousands of years man's ideas put men in bondage and when jesus christ came they kept trying to put him in bondage by their law by their laws he was the word and he came to bring freedom and liberation and they kept saying your disciples ate with unwashed hands they picked corn on the sabbath they did this and they did that and they're trying to bring the word back into their bondage but jesus christ was there to free them from the bondage and then he goes to the gentiles and they do the same thing we repeat the same pattern by their traditions make the gospel of no effect and take the word and filter it through human reasoning and bring the people back into bondage of a religion you have to have a certain experience it's got to come a certain way you got to go to a certain church you got to believe a certain set of doctrines you got to do this you got to act right and if you don't act right you got to go back start over again but christ has come just like he did then he's come and we accept it and what has he come to do he's come to bring the greatest deliverance his bride has ever had to free us from all of religion all the corrupt ideas of man break away our spiritual amnesia and say you are justified you never did it in the first place little bride you are the word made flesh you are the manifestation in this day you will make it you've already made it just hold tight they're still part of the plan to be unfolded they're still the demonstration a manifestation of this word for this day has to continue on hold tight don't get nervous don't be afraid nothing's out of kilter nothing's out of the plan you're not being lost you're not falling away you're not in any danger whatsoever just hold tight and play your part play the housewife part play the husband part play the mechanic part play the preacher part amen just stay tight play your part i'm working out my plan but you're totally completely secure nothing to be afraid of nothing to worry about amen nothing's going to happen to you no matter how much tension persecution political unrest war breaks out in the streets amen be fine be steady be easy everything's okay don't worry everything's fine you were predestined chosen to this glorious last stand you never did in the first place you've been brought back by your faith in this revealed word back to your original condition sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ and he's going to make your body match what's on the inside and take you back to eden praise be to god things can get worse things can get better things get better and then get worse then get worse and get better then get worse worse but i don't care my position is secure it doesn't matter we're not afraid praise god let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father we thank you for the liberating power
