you we're going to happy to be seated for just a minute amen today we get to do one of our favorite things we get to dedicate a baby to the lord amen if brother ilya and sister natasha want to bring their new little baby forward we'll dedicate her to the lord little malana ilya luzonov amen milana look that means beloved or darling and then this girl is going to be beloved she's going to be the

is a gift that comes from you because only you can give life and lord you've placed this little baby little milan the lord in the hands of godly parents who love you and want to serve you they've dedicated their lives to you and now they bring this baby to you lord that you've so graciously given to them and they're pledging now before this congregation that they will raise this little girl to serve you to know you lord and they could dedicate themselves also lord to razor in the fear and ammunition of the lord and the nurturing admonition of the lord i pray to bless father and mother lord anoint them to do the job i pray to inspire them lord with wisdom lord beyond human understanding that they would know how to handle every situation that they should face i pray you provide for every need that mulana would have through life and i pray god that she would know you from the earliest days that she would hear your word and her ears and she would sense a godly atmosphere in her home and that she would give her heart to you if you should terry time should continue that she would give her heart to you as a young child and serve you all the days of her life we love you lord we'd commit ourselves as a congregation to stand behind these parents to bless them and support them and help them as they raise this little baby in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you brother god bless you god bless you michael lord bless you brother praise the lord let's all stand amen brother bram said he liked that job and i said i do too that's wonderful god's certainly been good to us it's always precious to see that fresh life coming forth and i said before may the natural be a type of the spiritual as fresh life is coming in the form of babies being born let there be those that are being born into the kingdom constantly fresh life coming all the time amen let's just read first peter together first peter chapter 1 i'd like to take for a title lord willing this morning influenced by the word and not the world influenced by the word and not the world amen and it's just a very simple subject but the lord laid it heavy on my heart and uh we'll just press forward and ask god to give his divine wisdom and leadership first peter chapter and verse 13 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust and your ignorance but as he which hath called you as holy so be holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be holy for i am holy amen hold on to your place there as we pray i also want to let you know that brother mike allen and his family are up in ontario this morning ministering in a church up there and we'll be driving back this evening so just keep them in your prayers as well let's pray heavenly father we thank you god for the privilege of being here lord for the privilege of gathering together with saints of like precious faith to hear your word lord preached and we pray now that as we've prepared our hearts we've prepared ourselves we've done all that the prophet told us to do and we're standing here lord expecting you to speak now we've come lord to hear from you and we pray that you would take preeminence and speak your words through these lips of clay that you would hear lord through these ears lord that we would be able to receive the word that you have for us this morning we ask your special blessing over everything we say and do in jesus christ's name we pray lord before we're seated we pray you bless our brother mike allen and his family keep them safe on the road and anoint him lord to preach the word inspire him lord that he'd be able to preach exactly what you have for the needs that are there we commit all things into your name in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated amen before i start in too far you know i want to get entitled again influenced by the word and not the world amen and i appreciated the song sister naomi saying and i believe that song was right on time inspired of the lord amen i had a conversation with the brother on monday and we were talking and i was just sharing with him the burden in my heart and i say sometimes i feel i feel as though there are times that that where we're calling out and crying out for an individual walk crying out for a shaving off to the world a sincerity and a dedication a higher level than we've ever had before and and i'm afraid sometimes that that if we don't tune in if we don't catch things on a spiritual level we just think things sometimes are a little legalistic or a little bit of nagging and and if i could just share the burden on my heart it was what naomi sang she's saying exactly what god's been dealing with me in my heart and i i said to this to this brother this way i painted a word picture i said it's as if you know the ministry screaming out be in line stay in step don't partake of the world shave off entertainment and and and we're still in a grassy field blue sunshine pretty blue sky flying kites and having picnics and everything's okay so we don't realize the the intensity of the hour because right around us everything's fine but in my spirit i can see the clouds i see him amen i can see the lightning flash i know it's coming i know the hour is arriving i know it's time like she said the showdown is coming i don't know if it's months years 10 years decades i have no idea but my in my spirit i know it's coming and i see the little kid flying the kite and i'm yelling out a warning nothing's happening everything's fine it's fine now it won't always be fine and so i when she's saying that song i thought that's just exactly where god's dealing with me right where my heart is god is trying to prepare his bride for what's coming and it's not a scary thing don't think because i said that it's scary it's not a scary thing it's a proving time it won't be a frightful time it won't be a scary time it'll be frightening to the world but for the bride this is proving time this is the hour she's been prepared for this is the moment that everything that's been prophesied and everything that's been talked about is going to come to a culmination everything's going to come to a head and what you've seen temporarily will be manifest in the fullness of his power but look at every time the spoken word was manifest it was in the hour of need jesus broke bread when when they needed food amen he told peter to cast a line in and hook a fish and bring out when he needed a coin amen god doesn't clown god never played around he didn't use the supernatural as a gimmick as a show they didn't use it to attract the world but the spoken word and the supernatural always come at a time of need and when there was a time of need the supernatural showed up amen elijah smote the syrian army blind not for fun not for a gimmick because he was in an hour of need because he was surrounded and they come to destroy him god doesn't play with these things but the manifestations come they will come they're prophesied they will be here but they will be here in an hour of need just like every single time in the scripture he parted the red sea not for a show he parted the red sea because of a need because they were they were ready to be destroyed do you understand these things that god's doing they're not for showmanship god is not into showmanship amen he separated the jordan because they had a need all these things were done to meet a need so if what we've seen temporarily will be manifest in the fullness of its power that means if there's coming a great manifestation of the full life the full power of jesus christ it'll come in an hour of need where nothing but the full manifestation will do so you do the equation in your mind what kind of atmosphere will that be if it's going to take the full life of jesus christ on this plane the full measure of his power then what kind of condition will be in the world in that day because god's not showing he's not playing it's not a game [Music] so i can see at times people are getting frustrated because you're picking on my hobby and you're picking on my love but you don't understand you're whistling in the graveyard don't understand this isn't the hour for games this isn't the time for playing you know we're not walking around morbid and you know we're excited we still enjoy our family we're still playing with the kids and that's not what i mean but it's time to become aware and start shaving off everything that's not necessary everything that's not of the kingdom to let it fall to make sure they were influenced by the word and not the world brother branham says in 1958 his wonders to perform actually i want to back up i want to read this scripture again if you don't mind just read it to keep it fresh in our minds wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ as obedient children not fashioning ourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance but as he which hath called you as holy so you be holy in all manner of conversation that means manner of life manner of conversation is the way you live so be holy in all manner of your life all not just around the other believers not just when i'm at church not just when i'm doing spiritual things but all manners of conversation because it is written be holy for i am holy we're supposed to be a reflection he says in his wonders to perform 1958 it was while those who went to emmaus along the road began to talk about him that he stepped out of the bushes and walked with him through the day the reason we don't have the spiritual blessings we have too much time to watch television too much time to read the newspaper or listen to something that we ought not to listen to and we are not redeeming the time but we're giving it to the things of the world instead of our time to the lord jesus and the bible said that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god christians live on the word amen not entertainments not pleasures of the world not pleasures of this life christians live on the word amen brother bam said you know when they were talking about him he drew near he said it's always when you're talking about him you know you realize that that's what we should be doing all the time we should be meditating and him talking about him talking to him listening to his word reading his word i mean we live in a world where we're bombarded by messages every day all day i mean this is satan's eden and everything you come in contact with is perverted and defiled everything everything's perverted and defiled it doesn't matter how clean it looks there's a perversion behind it because this is satan's eden amen all the advertisements everything you hear the conversations around you it's all perverted and if we're going to spend all day every day in satan's eden amen in order to make sure that influence is not taking over in our lives and not getting a foothold we need more than just a casual observation of the word twice a week we need a daily diet of the word of god we need to be constantly on our mind in our meditation it will be an atmosphere of prayer and a communication with god all the time because the devil is always trying to get in don't forget when those two hundred thousand thousand demons were released out of the river for euphrates they went into the the armies of stalin mussolini stalin and hitler and then what did they do they brought a persecution against the jews in natural then after the war was over brother ben said they went into the ecclesiastical realms and now they're coming after the bride so 200 000 000 demons released into the ecclesiastical world to come after the bride amen how many bride do you think there are on the earth today it's probably less than you and i would even want to think about how many demons per bride i'm not even going to give a number how many demons per bride are there to what to shut you down to destroy you to kill you spiritually and they're constantly trying through every avenue every every window every doorway any way that they can get and they're trying to come in we have to be hyper vigilant in this hour and the only way we're going to do it is stay tied in tuned into the spirit of god and the spirit feeds on the word so to strengthen your spiritual life you have to have the word because the word is spirit it is life it is the same thing we have to have more not less more hallelujah we need to be devoted we need to be dedicated we need to be more sincere says in the message just one one more time lord 1963 pentecost a few years ago years ago no more than 50 years ago stood out the people stood different they come out of a different groups of worldliness because of their worldliness and stood out as an example and goddess took the church and today it's one of the most powerful churches in the world but the thing that she's doing she's turned right straight back around and went back into the same conglomeration that she was called out of and when she begins to do that her power is taken from her where do we get the all-night prayer meeting let the preacher preach till about one or two o'clock in the morning like he used to i like quotes like this let him preach until one or two o'clock in the morning like he used to do he'd be preaching to empty seats they got to go home and see we love susie or somebody or certain television cast now that's the truth why where your treasure is there your heart is also our treasure ought to be the word the greatest treasure of our life ought to be the word the greatest desire we have should be for the word of god amen let's turn to hebrews together and look at hebrews chapter 12. keep your bibles handy we're going to hit several scriptures lord willing this morning hebrews chapter 12 and verse 14 follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord this word holiness means consecration purification sanctification of heart and life so god is requiring holiness without which you'll never see god it's always been the standard and always will be the standard we're never going to mature out of holiness we should be maturing into holiness it should never be we used to be this way but now we're more mature shouldn't be that way 1959 what do us what does thou hear as brother buhler said about his sign in the back you become born again you become a new creature in christ old things have passed away the carnal things of the world has no more hold on you and you have no more hold on them it's a two-way street they'll let go of you but you've got to let go of it amen and you have no more hold on them when you've passed from death into life when god gets a hold of a man the first thing he does in the church is bring it from the worldliness to holiness and he brings it from death and to life it's born again praise be to god so god's bringing from worldliness to holiness but what do you think the 200 000 000 demons are trying to do amen let's go to first john together first john chapter 2 and verse 15. first john 2 and 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man loves the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever so we're not supposed to be motivated by our lusts unless the eyes lust the flesh and the pride of life remember it must be obedient unto god brother brahm says in 1956 vi azuza jubilee many times that we let the world slip in that's what's the matter with our churches today we kindly let down a little bit here and there the devil is coming from one place to the other taking a little bit slipping here just a little of this place here in a little place here and first thing you know it's got the whole thing in a confusion he doesn't come in with a big thing he comes in with a little thing slipped in just a little bit here and slipped in just a little bit there and a little bit here and a little bit there not on the same spot from over here and over there that's how brother branham describes it and he's he's preaching the jubilee year of azusa street and he's talking about the failure of the azusa street revival so just a little bit slipped in here a little bit slipped in there and next thing you know it brings confusion he said in the faith of abraham 1959 and then when lot looked up begin to look over towards the jordan plains he seen they were well watered there was a big city there sodom gamora many of the cities plenty grass a possibility of making him a few dollars he chose that that's a way a mini a lot did a few dollars when he was looking at the well-watered planes he didn't see his wife turning to a pillar of salt there you go he didn't see the results of his actions he didn't see his wife turning to a pillar of salt he didn't see the fire that was going to destroy the city and part of his children he didn't see the disgrace that his daughters was going to do because raising them up in a bunch of worldliness like they were raised in that's what you look at today friends it depends on what you're looking at as i taught the other night we look at the unseen we look at god's promise and carry anything and call anything contrary to it as though it was not so lot had left abraham abraham was separated from worldliness abraham was living a separated life and lot in him had to separate because la abraham needed a greater separation than the separation he had he needed to separate not just from sodom and gomorrah not just from the land of the chaldees not just from ur but he had to separate from his own father and now he had to separate from lot his nephew because god couldn't visit him until he made that final separation and lot amen lot it says the he was a righteous man he said the sins and sodom vexed his righteous soul he didn't enjoy the sodom condition he vexed his righteous soul but yet he was willing to endure the sodom condition for gain lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life he was willing to endure it vexed his righteous soul he didn't like it but he was willing to endure it for whatever he could gain amen but he didn't realize that that decision would cost him his wife would cost him his daughters amen would bring disgrace because he raised them in that bunch of worldliness he himself amen he himself still had a righteous heart but those around him were lost it matters what we do it matters what we look at it matters that we stay vigilant all the time let's turn to john the gospel of john chapter 17. john 17 and 13 and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not that thou should just take them out of the world but thou should keep them from the evil so jesus was declaring that his disciples were not of the world even as he was not of the world so the same way he was not of the world was the same way they were not of the world but he was praying that they wouldn't be taken out of the world they have to stay there amen we have to be here but he wanted them to be kept from the evil let's turn over to first corinthians first corinthians chapter 5. in verse 9. first corinthians 5 and 9. i wrote unto you in the epistle not to company with fornicators yet not all together with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for them must your needs go out of the world it says but now i've written unto you that you need not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an adulterer or rail or a drunkard or extortioner with such a one no not to eat so now in the first and in the when he when he writes to the corinthians before he had told them not to keep company with fornicators or dollars on all of this but then he writes back a clarification he's saying i'm not saying that you can't keep somebody that's in the world he says if i told you that you would have to leave the world but if somebody's called a brother and they're doing these things don't eat with them separate from them because it's going to bring an influence in your life but but what he's showing is you can't you can't get out of this world you're supposed to be in this world but we're not of this world you're going to have to company with fornicators and adulterers if you're going to have a job if you're going to do anything you're going to have to company with fornicators idolaters extortioners drunkards all of these things you can't separate from the whole world but you can live a separated life in the midst of the world abraham lived a separated life in the midst of the world abraham lived on the plains of memory but abraham had interactions with the world he had interactions with the bemalek and then he he even signed a peace treaty with abimelech he even fought for the kings of sodom and gomorrah and the kings that round about and delivered them had interactions it wasn't that abraham had left the world he was in the world but he was separated from the world and abraham is our example you can't you can't say i'm going to go to a commune and i'm just going you can't live like that you're not supposed to live life jesus didn't want his disciples taken out of the world he wanted them kept from the evil so we have to be right in the midst of it but not living like lot going down there mingling with it for some lust but staying separated from it amen and that's the way that abraham lived it says in 1961 abraham and his seat after him now as we find out abraham never fully obeyed now that's the way with a lot of us people as soon as we go and make a confession we think well now we've joined church and we're going to be pretty good people we're neighbors it won't hurt the smoke a little or if i just keep my card party going now listen when brother bam says that you can right away just write off what he's saying because i'm not going to smoke or go to a card party but he's speaking to the denominations that had already fallen but why don't you take this and bring it down home brother branham had to he was preaching to a mixed multitude we're not preaching to a mixed multitude this morning we're preaching to believers [Music] so we can dial it in a little tighter than that if i just keep my car for you that won't hurt anything but remember god never did bless abraham until he fully obeyed and god will not bless the seed until you fully obeyed separating himself from the things of the world come out from among them and be you separate saith the lord i will receive you touch not their unclean things you abide in me and my word in you ask what you will and it'll be done to you see now you see you've got to come out of the world but what did abraham do oh he had his nephew along lot a church member a lukewarm and his daddy the old man was a fly in the ointment as long as he stuck around and he took some of the things along and that's just the way we try to do we try to pull into the churches into our organization the things of the world amen it wasn't necessarily abraham but it's who abraham associated with he had to separate from all of that and he had to live a separated life and when he finally lived separated god came to him in flesh let's go to second corinthians just keep laying a foundation here and then we'll get into what i really want to get into second corinthians 6 and 14 2nd corinthians 6 and 14 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for you are the temple of the living god and god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate sayeth the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty so what does god want separation what does god want holiness hallelujah that's why the entertainments of the world are not for us they're just not for us uh that it used to be if i could just be honest with you i love you all dearly but we know that years ago under the previous administration we were taken down the wrong road worldliness crept in big time and and god has been dealing with me very specifically that it's not all gone yet they come in crept in and then we we were duped we were led to believe and it's our own fault we had the message we didn't have to accept it but some things become acceptable that should have never been acceptable begin to allow our children to watch disney movies like what's wrong with disney movies the anointing that makes them the artists that the artists that make those things that write it and draw it are mostly homosexuals ungodly don't care a thing about god that's not for us the worldly entertainments are not for us just because it's g doesn't make it good just because there's no swearing no nudity no violence doesn't make it good because there's influences that come in there's themes that are introduced there's concepts that come in that aren't of the word of god they're contrary to the word of god and we think no nudity no violence no swearing no no then it's okay it's not okay if this thing that's coming in and this joke and the thing they're laughing about is contrary to the word of god then it's evil even if it's g that's not for us brother branham said brother ben said that the church of the living god is entertained by the holy ghost and the holy ghost feeds on the word there's the recipe right there so some things came in and i know because some things have been washed out of me year after year one thing after another god will bring to my attention and wash it out of me and wash it on me i've accepted it i shouldn't have accepted it i let it in i shouldn't have let it in i've had to apologize to my children i have to say i shouldn't have let you watch that years ago we shouldn't have had that in our home we've had to get rid of some things we've had we've had to make things right and and i don't think we're done because i don't think we understand just how pervasive that spirit was but god wants a clean church brother brahm said in testimony on the sea in 1964 everything shiny remember hollywood glitters with worldliness with the gospel glows in humility there's quite a difference between shining and glowing the gospel glows now look at the glow the gospel glows in humility and meekness and humbleness and power a lot of times we don't put power in with those other words because a lot of times what's considered power anymore is flashy and arrogant and showmanship and this is the power of god but that's not the power of god but the gospel goes on humility and meekness and humbleness and power so if we want power let's first get humility because brother graham said the way up is down humility and meekness and humbleness humility and humbleness are like the same thing so that means it's doubly important humility and meekness and humbleness and power brother i'm saying that modern events may clear by prophecy in 1965. look in the bible you see where that what age we're living in when you see these great things being made manifest when god promised to do it he always does it at the end of each age when the church has come to turning to a to the turning place and it's turned from word back to sin and worldliness worldliness is sin worldliness is the opposite of holiness and worldliness is sin the bible said if you love the world or the things of the world the love of god is not even in you speaking last night i was speaking about the sacrifice that was offered the lamb it was to be seven days representing the seven church ages there was to be no leaven found amongst the people no leaven for seven days that means that there's nothing mixed with it there's nothing mixed with it there's nothing mixed with it it's unleavened constantly and we don't want no creeds leavens and things mixed with us we don't want world mixed with us it's got to be the unleavened bread of god the word of god the unadulterated word of god which man shall live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so we don't want any world mixed in with us so we have to be able to identify the world man i'd like to read out of first peter there's two scriptures i want to read and then i want to talk to you for a while first peter chapter 3 first peter chapter 3 verse 1 likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also without the word be won by the conversation of the wives well they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of planting of the hair the wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god a great price for after this manner in the old times the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement now when i want to look at this when i look at this scripture this is talking about women but it's also talking about the bride you run the parallels together and you look at verse 4 he says but let it be the hidden man of the heart not the outside but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptable even an ornament of a meek and quiet spirit this word meek means mildness of dispensation gentleness of spirit meekness then you get to the word quiet quiet spirit means quiet and tranquil and then we go to the word when it says which is inside of god of great price that word great price means very precious very costly excellent of surpassing value this is what god deems valuable this is what is of great value to god this is what is precious to him so when you look at this if i want to be pleasing to god i need to find out what's pleasing to god and here he's telling us what's pleasing to him he said you know not he said not the outward adorning of planting the hair of wearing gold or putting on apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek mildness meekness gentleness of spirit a meek and quiet quiet tranquil spirit which is in the sight of god of great price that's the opposite of the modern laodicean woman she's bold she's loud she's equal to men she's bosses she's an authority she i mean you just go to the store and you listen to the women screaming all the time loud and boisterous that's not what god wants that's not what he's looking for because the women represent what the condition of the church loud and bossy and the worldly churches are bossing god around loud and proud and all of those things let's go to first timothy chapter 2. first timothy chapter 2 in verse nine in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shame faden shamefaceness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works so saying the same thing peter's saying the same thing paul saying to timothy and this is the area i want to spend some time on because this is what god is drawing my attention to and i'll tell you how he drew my attention to it he did it in a unique way i i just have to tell you a personal story because this is how god deals with me when several years ago i don't know how many years ago maybe six seven eight i don't know five years ago i don't know how long it was probably seven eight nine years ago something like that i went to the philippines and when i was in the philippines i found i wanted to bring something back from my wife so i found a little necklace for my wife and it was a little string of freshwater pearls little white ones modest and small and not very expensive and i brought it back and i gave it to her and thought nothing else of it she liked it she enjoyed it she appreciated that i thought of her and and just went on no problem but several months ago maybe six seven eight months ago i don't know exactly i'm not good with time but some time ago all of a sudden god started drawing my attention to that and i started wondering if that was exactly right and something strange happened she told me she said hey i went to put that necklace on and it broke the hass broke off of it can you fix it for me and i said sure no problem i'll fix it for you and a couple weeks went by and i didn't get to it and one day i went over and i saw the thing laying there on the on the dresser and i said i'll fix that for her and she won't have to remind me she'll be so pleased you know i'm going to get lots of points for this and so i was excited and i picked it up and as soon as i picked it up god spoke in my heart and said don't fix it don't fix it and i put it down and i just started meditating and praying and god showed me that that's not the word because the word says don't wear pearls i had made excuses because we were taught to had used reasoning because we were taught to we were taught in this assembly to let those things go we were taught to do wrong and it was wrong and when god thundered in my heart don't fix it i knew it was wrong and i laid it down and i waited a few days and i explained to angie what the lord had told me and she had no problem you know she had never i had never felt bad about it she had never felt bad about it i saw her i never felt like it was a modest i never had a problem with it then all of a sudden i had a problem with it and and god drew my attention to it and so i i we dealt with it she was fine it was no problem and then when i was in indonesia one time and i brought back a little bracelet a little polished stone bracelet and a week or two after this happened she came out and she said is this okay and god right in my heart said no immediately and i said no sweetheart it's not okay she goes really i said really and so she took it off no questions no arguments and then i explained to her what god had done and she realized there was no problem with it after that and and i thought well that was for our family that's no problem like god's straightening us up praise the lord this is for us but that's not the case this is for the church i was in prayer saturday morning and and since that time over the last several months god's been drawing my attention to things i've been noticing things i've never noticed before i've been looking around and seeing things and god's drawing my attention to certain things and not that i want to have my attention to draw anything i don't but god is and i've just been putting aside and brushing it aside and brushing it aside and saturday morning i kneeled down in prayer and i had other things i wanted to preach on today fun things exciting things but god started doing i went into prayer and while i was in prayer i got lost in prayer and i quit praying and i went into meditation and where i wasn't praying all of a sudden god starts downloading one thing after another after another after another after another and i knew i had to come and deal with this because god told me to because it's mine to do because there's a shepherd over the flock and god drew my attention to it and it's time and i'm so thankful that god doesn't dump everything on us at once but god's let us out bit by bit one thing correct it right next thing correct it get it right the next thing correct it and get it right i'm so thankful god's been tender with us and he's led us along gently but but saturday morning when i got up it was like 45 minutes or an hour of god just dumping this on me planting it right deep in my heart and i knew exactly what it was and and i said god i don't want to preach that i wish i could just be a teacher you know let's just break the seals let's just break something open and i'll let somebody else pastor and i'll come back with the next exciting breaking of the word but that's not what god called me to do and so i was thinking you know about the assembly here and what we've been through and how god's been good to us and what a mature mature assembly it is and i was thinking if i've had to do this many times with my children talk to them about something a change in direction or something that i'm no longer comfortable with and i've got adult children they're mature now and i've got a couple of adult children and i don't force them to do anything i don't hammer them i don't pound on them they're mature and so i give them my vision i tell them what i see and i let them make their choice because if i make the choice for them they don't get the victory if they make the choice they get the victory so with my adult children all i do is share with them what i see i give them wisdom i give them advice i give them what the lord's given me and i let my children make the decision now of course there's a limit to that as well but in those things because i want them to choose i want them to have the victory and if you'll allow me to this morning let's just pretend we're sitting in the living room we're all gathered around sitting in the living room and let me be like a dad and just tell you what i see and tell you what the lord showed me and tell you why when when you know when i gave that to my wife i i didn't think anything of it i thought it was nice she thought it was nice we were happy about it but later when god brought my attention to it i realized that i had been duped that i had come to accept things that i shouldn't have accepted and i went to this quote i'm gonna go ahead and read this quote because every every one of you are already thinking about this quote but i want to look at this quote carefully and see what the prophet's actually saying not what it's been turned into questions and answers 1964 question number 283 paragraph 64. brother branham should a christian woman wear simple jewelry or necklace or pearls well sister i know this means a lot to you and it means a lot for me for you to place your confidence i tell you the truth now remember the bible said when you adorn do not adorn with costly jewels and pearls and all kinds of jewelry wearing of jewelry but let that be the adorning of peace and quiet and meek spirit which i just quoted which is a great price before the lord now i don't mean by that sister that if you have a pen now this is me not the lord now pay attention brother man said this is me not the lord so take it for that this is me not the lord i get great value in what the prophet of god says he said this is me not the lord said he says if you had a pen that you wanted to wear or a little necklace your husband gave you if you catch it a pen you want to wear or a little necklace your husband gave you wanted to wear a little necklace or or you know wear a pin a pen that you wanted to wear a little necklace that your husband gave you or maybe something like that you wore now to me i don't think that's bad that's just me now remember i make myself clear that's my opinion but i think it's the approach to it it's the way you do it see it's the motive behind it and when you see it's getting a hold of you then leave the thing alone but i think if you wore your wedding ring now i know you nazarene people it used to be that you wouldn't even baptize a woman with a wedding ring on i don't believe that is necessary in the bible they wore redding rings only it was a tablet they called it around their head nine pieces of coin in it but to show that they were married now i think that's all right if women want to dress and make themselves look decent and clean and ladylike well i think there's not a thing to that to me but when you get to going to put that thing into making it a little pride then you're wrong it's your attitude so that was the quote and i think about the only one you'll find that brought justification to some of our actions but brother branham is very clear this is my opinion this is what i think and just be clear it's my opinion not just me but what he said is if you had a pen that you like to wear or a little necklace your husband bought you that's not an accessory necklace for every outfit you see what i'm saying but we took one thing and went further we took something and went further and we were taught what's your motive behind it it's what you're doing but i'd like to refer you back to the scriptures because we have to stand on the scriptures so let's look at timothy again first timothy 2 9-10 i just want to share with you if you're ever confused about anything go to the scriptures first timothy 2 9 and like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shame faceness and sobriety not with broader hair or gold or pearls or costly array but which becomes which becometh women professing godliness with good works that's the scriptures that's the scriptures that's not somebody's opinion that's the scriptures now if you can go with me back to first peter 3. see friends i realized when i read that again that i had actually left the scriptures that the scriptures actually mentioned pearls and that's what i bought and i was duped into leaving the scripture because of this quote not that brother venom quoted it wrong but that it was re-quoted and re-emphasized wrong first peter 3 one likewise you wise be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wise while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of planting the hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price so here peter's saying the same thing it matters what we wear and jewelry does matter it does matter and because we because we flexed what the prophet has said now if i can just go back to what the prophet said if you had a pen or little necklace that your husband bought you or your wedding ring now why can't we leave it there see but but we went more than the wedding ring we went more than the little necklace that our husband bought us and when brother graham said the little necklace that your husband bought you to me this is just me now that's something special that's not that's not an accessory for every garment that's not just for the case of adorning but there's something special for some special reason something that your husband bought you and even in that brother brenham said this is just my opinion this is just me so even in that he says it's just me but what he said what he said was a pen or a little necklace little necklace your husband bought you which means it's something special a gift for a reason or your wedding band he didn't say any more than that but somehow we took that and when the when we let the bars down more flooded in more than what the prophet said but we use this scripture for justice this quote for justification and that that quote is not justification for everything that we see now we went further than what we should have went and we certainly went further than the scriptures i want to come back to the scriptures and brother branham he's a good guide and he guided us right but if we're going to take what he said us take just what he said not more is that fair remember we're sitting around the living room you don't have to shout amen you don't have that's not going to bother me you can sit quiet because we're just in the living room i'm just sharing with you what the lord shared with me and how how he spoke to me and i'm just gonna i'm just going to drop on you exactly what dropped in my heart if you'll let me do that and take it from the lord and take it from your pastor somebody's got to be the shepherd somebody's got to watch over the flock and this isn't of my desire this has been impressed upon me by the lord and god has called me to this office in this place and so if you believe that you're a sheep in this fold then you better listen you can do what you want you can make your own choice but i'm just giving you a good stiff warning and i'm giving you a good lesson if you believe that you're a sheep in this fold god has anointed the shepherd to say a certain thing a certain way and i'm going to do it exactly the way he dropped it in my heart saturday morning so i would i would listen he dropped in phrases that weren't my phrases analogies that weren't my analogies and i and i i just appreciate god for that i'd say it like this modesty is not determined by the amount of fabric or how much skin is covered modesty is not determined by the amount of fabric or how much skin is covered you can have skin covered from the neck to the wrist to the ankles and it not be modest and you can use yards and yards of fabric and it not be modest because modesty is a spiritual condition an immodesty is a display of an influencing spirit this is what god showed me in modesty is actually when something's done in an unmodest way it doesn't mean that you're demon-possessed it doesn't mean you're not a child of god it just means there's an influence coming in and the end the spiritual influence can be seen in the in modesty it's spiritual it's not natural it's a natural reflection of a spiritual condition and so these things have to be taught so that we understand what's happening so we know how to pray and we know what we're looking for and we're watchful all the time now when when i when i in my failure to keep the scriptures bought that necklace for my wife i was no less a son of god it didn't diminish my sonship by any degrees all right and in fact god was merciful to me because he understood it was wrong teaching so god had a lot of mercy on me for a long time i mean when he brought it to my attention i had regrets i repented i understood where my failure was but god had a lot of mercy on me he didn't bring the hammer down he was merciful and he showed me and he began to reveal to me and that's what god's doing this morning showing mercy when when my wife accepted the gift and when she wore it she was no less a daughter of god god didn't stop answering our prayers he didn't stop healing us he didn't he didn't stop moving in our home he didn't stop growing a spiritual he didn't stop any of that because much of what we were doing we should have known better but a lot of it was in ignorance and a lot of it was because of false teaching and wrong influences so god was merciful to us but now he's asking for a greater maturity and he's saying no more now it's time to stop and i thought well that's like i said it's for my family but after saturday morning i realized it wasn't just for my family god allowed that scenario to play out in my family just so i would tune in and focus on something amen because because it's a it's a physical type of something spiritual because brother ben said the husband is the the pastor is the spiritual husband of the church and so after saturday morning i realized what i have to do and why i have to do it praise god let's read another quote and then i'll get into some more questions and answers 1964. you know in every life there is a male as the prettiest but the human race take any bird cow take a bunch of cattle which is the prettiest the old crumpled horned cow or the big bull take a deer which is the little doe or the buck take a bunch of elk which is the prettiest the male or female moose whatever you want to do take take it in the bird take it in the chicken the rooster the hen take it in the bird the little pretty cardinal or the little speckled hen set on her nest and raise her eggs see everything in the whole race always the male is the prettiest but the female to the human why she she calls the fall satan chose her right there and beauty is of the devil see satan was the most beautiful angel he was a cherubim that overshadowed look how different women is getting now to what they used to be how many remembers reading of pearl brian let's see your hands some of you older people supposed to be the most beautiful woman in america any little teenage sniper fritz on the street would be twice as pretty as she now why that's just exactly what the bible said when the sons of god saw the daughters of men were fair that was the bunch of renegades that sent the flood upon the earth that god destroyed the whole human race see and brother bam showing that the the the the women are becoming more fair more attractive and prettier as time goes on and he goes back to show pearl brian as the example she was supposed to be prettiest woman in the world and nobody would even turn their head to look at her now because beauty is increasing because it's coming back to what it was in the days of noah it's got to come back to that condition amen and that condition is causing the fall of mankind it's causing everything that it calls the first times causing it again so that's what brother benham is explaining it's exactly and today everything's based on upon hollywood and beauty and things like that when beauty is the secret thing of the heart and not the outward appearance praise god beauty is the secret thing in the heart and not the outward appearance and i think i have failed on this my wife and i have failed in this but i want to share this with you so that we're not continually failing if we take our little girls and over emphasize physical attractiveness to our little tiny thoughts we're going to sow into them the wrong desire for the wrong thing they already have a little human spirit they already want to be accepted they want to be pretty they want to be all those things but when we take and make that a focal point we're always talking about how pretty they are and if we buy them little dress up clothes with little high heels and necklaces and rings now i can say that because i did it so that gives me the right to say it and i've been chastised for it so now i can really say it i did it and i got my spanking so now i can say it but we've got to be more spiritually aware than we've been in the past we can't be as duped as we were everything we do matters we're setting an example we're putting those children on a course and everything we do is setting them on a course and we've got to be careful what influences we as parents put into their lives or allowance of their lives and we buy them the little princess dress up outfits with the sparkly high heels the big greens the ruby necklaces and all of these things what are you telling that girl and then you go oh and all you're so beautiful you're the princess you're the queen someday prince charming will come see we all have different personality types and we all have different propensities to different things and some are more susceptible to things than others and you can start things there that will carry on for years what does the bible say the adorning of a meek and quiet spirit many of us have told our daughters your character is shining today your inward beauty is stunning to me see we got we got caught up in laodicea and we felt like you know you've got to lavish praise on your girls and tell them they're beautiful because they won't feel like they are and you've got to make them feel like they are amen it doesn't matter if they're completely unattractive but if they have the right spirit to god that's a precious thing and we've been focused on the wrong thing and training in the wrong area and going the wrong direction for years because those things are not in the word that's not the scripture that's not our focus that's not our emphasis that's not the message but because it was at the walmart shelf we bought it without any spiritual discernment we bought it and some of us made worse mistakes than that and this one's not mine but i want to tell it anyways they bought little makeup kits that was play makeup kits and little hairdo kits and what are we telling our little girls what's important and what matters see we're just around the living room i don't like these conversations but they're good they're needful two hundred thousand thousand demons have been released in ecclesiastical realms to do what to disrupt the forward progress of the bride to try to handicap the bride because the maturity of this bride is bringing the demise of satan's eden and you think he's just going to come one way he's going to come many different ways he's going to start when you're young come when you're old come through your friend come through a neighbor come through a family member we've got to be careful and just because brother xyz and sister xyz bought their child this thing doesn't mean it's good for your child and just because your little girl a little boy comes home from sunday school class and says hey everybody in class has got this or done this why can't i we had to deal with that his son come home from sunday school class little bitty sunday school class crying everybody in class is talking about spiderman i'm the only one who doesn't know anything about it crying tears coming down his face something was bad wrong bad wrong and we're still being washed out of that so don't think it's all gone we're still being washed out of that friends i'm still being washed out of that and so those things are not all right it's not just kitty it's not just trivial these things matter we've got to have some spiritual discernment and look at something before we jump into it and look at something before we do it and say is this what god wants i said before we can't always go with the assumption because it was okay in the past it's okay now that's not always the case but we've got to say god and and i made this statement for and i hope you can take it i hope you i hope all of you can take it home when we ask the question well what's wrong with it we've asked the wrong question the question should be what does he want me to do what does god want me to do today now in this situation but when you ask the question well what's wrong with it immediately there's a wrong spirit attached to that amen god is good i'm gonna finish this quote beauty is the secret thing of the heart and not the outward appearance let them adorn themselves not with outward appearance but inward of meek gentle spirit that's a christian so now on your question sister i don't know just what to tell you she was asking if it was all right for her to be a hairdresser now i can stop right now or take another 30 minutes and and how many would just stay another 30 minutes he's asking if he can ask another question so now he takes another question said brother branham does this first timothy 2 9 mean women can't braid her hair does broad hair mean braided hair he says now look sister now i'm glad that followed this what i just read to you i'm glad that followed this i never fixed it there but just it followed that good notice a braided hair in that day was a sign of a street woman that's what she done braided her hair paul said to the christians now that adorning not not let it be of braided or boarded or braided is the same thing to braid their hair because it looked like the rest of the world now you're supposed not to look like the world or act like the world what's he talking about hair is he talking about braided hair aborted hair he's talking about hair let the lesson come home you're not supposed to look like the world or act like the world see the women are supposed to be different there see now braided hair now today braided hair is pretty and it's a long ways from the fashion of the world now you see the women the way they do their hair just keep your hair in a way just don't look like the world don't look or dress like it if they wear shorts you wear a dress if they do their hair cut off and all bobbed and do that you just let yours alone see and the braid now the question is braided me embroidered mean braided yes that's right and now on the street now look i look now i looked that up out i find out years ago what the braided hair meant see the women actually the women of old just just pulled their hair back and tied it more like a ponytail today and they went around they had robes on like that but the women of the street took their hair and braided it all across their heads and wrapped it around like that and put flowers in it and things like that and that was the flapper on the street just like we see the flapper today the way she dresses so brother branham was saying it wasn't just a straight braid down the back they braided their hair and wrapped it over i don't know how wrapped it over the head and put flowers in it and things like that he says don't look like the world if a hairstyle becomes popular in the world don't do it that's what he's telling us don't look like the world just because hair is uncut doesn't mean it's always holy because we can do unholy things with uncut hair praise god see what happens is influences come in and they're like i said there's different people with different propensities and different natures and different makeups and different weaknesses you may take a sister that's got a weakness for this area for fashion and things like that and it's a weakness it's something she has to fight against and she might spend her time on the internet looking up cute hairstyles i wouldn't waste my time we're not supposed to look like the world she finds some little new hoochie-doo thing i'm going to say it that way because sometimes it's ridiculous what i see in message churches and even in this church coming with their air all twisted up and stuck right on the side of their head that's not simple that's not holy because that come right out of the world right it was a worldly hairstyle somebody picked it up in the church tried it when somebody saw it they heard all the other girls to gather around that girl and say oh that's so cute how did you do it and the next sunday two more got it and the next sunday five more got it and the next thing you know everybody looks ridiculous sitting out here with their hair all wadded up and stuck on the side of their head how did that happen it slipped in through one and because they were a believer now it's okay you see what happens see how the devil comes in because i know that they are a real believer i know they live a godly life i know they love the lord i know they have a good family and if they do it it must be okay and you don't know that's a struggle for that sister that brother that's a weakness that they have to fight all the time and now you picked up their weakness and carried it through the church because it goes from one to the other to the other to the other i thought before the next time i see some fad pass through the church i'm just going to gather everybody up who's caught it that sunday and line them up front and say look how silly we look look how ridiculous we look we're all copying one another trying to stay in the latest fashion and the latest trend and the latest hairstyle and the latest see what i mean this hits home but it hits home i mean the reason it hits home is because it hits home because we've all done it i've done it you've done it people around us have done it but we don't want to catch the wrong influence we want to have spiritual discernment and say is this god is this the holy ghost is this right for me to do today not because sister so-and-so and brother so-and-so and that good family they're good people there's nothing wrong with them they they if we're not nobody's saying somebody is not a son or daughter of god doesn't have the holy ghost not saying that at all because the scripture says grieve not the holy ghost thereby whereby you are sealed that means you can grieve the holy ghost and still have the holy ghost so you can do something that's grieving to the holy ghost even after you have it nobody's putting anybody in or anybody else but what we're talking about is influences we've got to be influenced by the word of god not the world and influenced by sister so-and-so that got influenced by the world is the influence of the world we thought it was sister so-and-so brother so and so but we didn't realize they picked it up from the world and it come down through the line and it's a worldly influence we've now picked up praise to be the god i see it all the time with hairstyles so one time that people were braiding one little strand of braided hair down like this just one little teeny thin one that's weird like whenever you see something really weird like that it's like why would you do that that's weird the next thing you know you go out to the mall and there it is she's got it and she's got it it's a worldly trend that's passing through the worldly women and somebody picked it up you go to youth camp and you see they've got one little bitty bit of hair colored a different color than all the others it's like what why are you doing that that's not the holy ghost influence is that fair to say we picked that up from somebody else somewhere else and it didn't come from within the holy ghost influence on the church of god it came from the world and crept in through a crack somewhere and once it got in somebody saw a good person do it and they just repeat it we got to be careful with these things these things matter does it matter brother chad it matters enough that god god absolutely arrested my prayer time and shut me down and dumped all of this in my heart it matters modesty is a spiritual condition or displaying a lack of it is displaying a spiritual influence every time i see something i ask myself where did that come from something really i mean i don't mean somebody have their hair back one day and down one day that's fine that's no problem but all of a sudden it's like that's weird and you all know what i'm talking about and it comes straight from the world amen i'll just i'm just going to download to you it was downloaded to me when it comes to modesty and clothing the body should move within the clothing your clothing should fit loose enough that your body can move within your clothing it's the nicest way i can word it because sometimes clothing is so tight that it shows every move of your body and clothing was given to hide or cover the body not to display the form of the body that's why god it covered our nakedness god is trying to cover the form of the body and we think modesty is the mount of skin showing or not showing you like i said you can be covered from the neck to the wrist to the ankles and be completely immodest because if you've got something stretched tight over your body every time you twist or turn it accentuates the movement or form of the body and this is for men and women because men in the last few years started wearing these super tight sweaters you know and especially if a man's been working out a little bit and got a little bit of muscle he can't wait to get that super skin tight thing on and these super tight pants and all this nonsense men's pants should fit around their waist not hugging down on their hips shouldn't be skin tight you should have room to move within your clothes so your clothes don't not it's available across the shoulders tight down through here tucks under the breast and tucks down the side and every time she moves everything's on display and every brother in the church has to turn away from that sister it shouldn't be that way we shouldn't have that going on we got to have some discernment and awareness your body should move within your clothes your clothes shouldn't show every form of your body as you move praise be the god so let's go back to the original purpose for clothing to hide your form to cover your body leggings and short skirts are not modest there i said it leggings and short skirts are not modest it doesn't cover the form doesn't hide the body but no skin showing i'm not worried about skin leggings with a short skirt are not modest skirts that mimic men's pants from the thighs upward are not modest if they've got pockets in the front pockets in the back and a fly they are they are mimicking men's pair of pants from the thighs up they're the same as a men's pair of pants they're not feminine and they're not modest why does a woman need a fly they were created for men that's menswear women don't need a fly that's pretty straight but it's the truth so men's swimming skirts that mimic men's clothes i mean you there's no difference two front pockets a fly and a button or a zipper and two pockets in the back there there are men's jeans men's britches they're not modest straight skirts are not modest everybody likes to wear these little straight ones with no flow and no form a little straight and like to wear them just just just below the knee so we can say we're covering the knee and be in the message but then every time you sit down everybody's turning their head like this because you're wiggling to keep that knee covered brother branham didn't tell us these things so we could walk the line he didn't tell us these things so we could get his clothes see when you see that there's a spiritual influence there something's going on there's more than just the skirt there that's what we miss so many times if we're always wanting to be on the line and everything's always on the edge something's wrong spiritually there's a spiritual growth that needs a place a spiritual awakening some deliverance something needs to happen if everything's always on the edge it's tight it's all these funny forms of these leggings sticking out and these little bitty and in these skirts when they wear the leggings with the skirt usually it's a little bitty thin skirt that clings all over the thighs in the rear end and then women think they can sit any way they want to sit because they got leggings on it doesn't work it doesn't work praise god if it requires a slit to walk then it's too tight it's not brain surgery this is simple if it requires a slit and a slit's not modest anyways but if it requires a slit so you have free form in your legs so you can actually take a full step then it's too long or it's too tight it's showing the form underneath it's not covering the form capped sleeves are not modest i said it because every time you raise your hand somebody's looking underneath loose sleeves are not modest for the same reason a woman has really loose season got a big baggy t-shirt on every time she fixes her hair every guy in the room has to turn his head little bitty t-shirts are not modest they're not modest they cling too much they show the underneath for them too much they're not modest you should have sleeves enough to hide what's under your shoulder praise be to god capsies are not modest little t-shirts are not modest hair for men or women conveys an attitude anybody that's halfway spiritual will say amen to that this isn't just for women this is for men too clothes and hair you can see a young man come in he comes sauntering in with his tight britches hung down on his hips skin tight shirt and some poofy fluffy thing with hot you know with bleach streaks or i don't know what they do to it i don't know how they get it brown and yellow at the same time but you see them walk in and you say there's something wrong with that boy and then you feel condemned i shouldn't think that i should think lovely and wonderful of everybody but that's your spiritual discernment telling you there's something not right about that and we've swallowed that down too long and we've played nice he's too long instead of being real not hating a brother he might need encouragement he might need the word he might need deliverance he might need salvation it's not a pull away from somebody but also we don't have to shut off our spiritual discernment to be nice you have to say there's something wrong there there's a wrong spirit influencing right there and then you go to them with understanding you can be nice you can you can be helpful you can be encouraging but but you have to not shut off your spiritual discernment say no everything's fine not no everything's not fine the woman who comes in with a little bitty tight pin skirt amen and you can absolutely see everything little slit in the back so you've got enough room to walk something's not right you don't have to pretend everything's right it's not right something's wrong i mean that doesn't mean you cut them off or don't love them or disfellowship or they're not of god or don't have the holy ghost it's none of those things they might need taught they might need an understanding we've got to be careful where our influences come from sometimes we're influenced by the world sometimes we're influenced by other church members who are influenced by the world and we've got to have some discernment and we've got to stick with the word of god above all let the word be our guide and stick with the word of god and pray about things and ask for discernment and not accept everything that walks in because it's a good brother a good sister nobody's taking that away from their good brother good sister but that thing's not right we don't accept it we don't repeat it we don't do the same thing a lot of influences come from social media social media is dangerous it's addictive there's people on social media that have who knows how many followers i don't know how all this stuff works i just hear about it vaguely but they've got so many followers and they're called influencers so there's a whole new level of marketing now where people with products are shipping products to these people with these internet channels or these social media channels called influencers and they want them to to use their product drink their drink wear their clothes amen because they know that people watch them and are influenced by them and if they wear the clothes and if they drink the drink and they used a certain thing that it'll influence others because people will copy people monkey see monkey do and if we spend all day on social media checking other people and what they're doing you have no idea but that thing is influencing the way you think and the way you feel it has an influence and some people just can't stand to not know what's going on in somebody else's life that's a weakness in personality they just can't stand not knowing what everybody's talking about i'm telling you it's a blessing to not know what everybody's talking about it's a blessing to live a separated life when you see a fad going through the world amen and and and you're like what's that or when you hear somebody talk about a music artist or or a sports figure and you have no clue who they're talking about that's a good thing you should thank you should thank the lord and say i'm glad i don't know that that's the new fashion this year i'm not trying to figure out what's the new fashion what's the new color for the year what's the right accessory to wear with it forget all of that i want my experience to match the word is what brother branham said i want to be influenced by the word and the word only and forget all this other influence social media you know somebody post you know i you know whatever i don't know how it works i never had it you hear people talk about it they post something and then you know this is wonderful and this is the greatest thing ever and all we're just loving xyz product it's the best thing we've ever had and so everybody goes buys xyz product and you're just starting to come and catch the fad when the person that you got it from is off to a new one says xyz is no good i found a better one it's foolish it's childish but just follow what follow the leader follow the leader don't follow people follow the word quit following stuff follow the word quit getting tied up in social media it doesn't matter for much i mean if you want to be linked to grandma and aunt susie and all that that's one thing but but don't be following people and following stuff and that stuff influences you you know we're sheep the bible calls us sheep guess what we're sheep the quicker we realize that the better off we are we're influenced by one another and we catch influences in what's become so dangerous in the message now is we catch influences from other churches and we catch influences from each other inside the church and somebody will pick this up from another church just because it's done in another message church don't make it right just because they sang that song and it sounded pretty doesn't make it right where did it come from what cesspool did it come out of just because it was done and it sounded nice doesn't make it okay just because they dress this way doesn't make it right you see things sweep through and i'm always so incredibly discouraged sometimes when i go to fellowships and you just look around you can't help it it just grieves you so bad you see influences influences influences influences and it's not the holy ghost influence it's people catching one another's spirit and one another's influence and somebody somewhere tapped into the world brought it into the church and passed it around and i think the devil is duping the children of god the devil is deceiving why because he's looking for every avenue we'll be looking for him over here and he's sneaking in behind the gate right behind us we'll be fortifying this he's not going to bring any false doctrine my way there's not going to be any false teaching this way and he's coming right through the gate with all kinds of immorality and worldliness we've got to have spiritual discernments these things matter songs we sing where we get them from they can't be influenced by those things the things we wear who we pick it up from the way we do our hair it matters it matters praise god let's get back to my original analogy or might not analogy my life with the necklace brother branham said a little necklace your husband bought you that's not big colorful beads that go with every shirt to understand that's not what he was saying and i'm just going to tell you like my own children like i tell my own children these big old long draping necklaces and these big beads and these colorful things they're not modest brother venom said a little old necklace your husband bought you or something not green with the green shirt blue with the blue shirt yellow with the see that's not what brother ben was talking about and that's not what the scripture tells us that's different than the scriptures multiple rings and multiple fingers is not modest brother benham said if you want to wear your wedding ring now i guess that's okay it's not i don't think that's bad but that wasn't that wasn't three four rings on different fingers that's not what he said he didn't call that modest when he said it's okay to wear your wedding ring i'm just giving it to you the way god gave it to me now you're adults you're mature believers you pray about it and you do as god leads you to do but i'm just telling you as the shepherd of the local flock what god showed me and what god shared with me and told me those things aren't modest they're not modest it's not what god wants now what god wants now is something different he wants a bride who will live every word and not use anything the prophet said is an excuse to go further than what the prophet said but to stay with what the prophet said something small something petite something special something your husband bought that's what brother bam said now that's my opinion i don't think that would be bad so when you go that way you realize that what he said and he said it was his opinion and he wouldn't think it would be bad and so just stay there just stay right there but the scripture is clear not the outward adorning of gold and pearls and costly apparel you see men's wedding bands have become jewelry the trends are changing instead of just a simple wedding band they become elaborate and be colorful and you've got men who will wear a different band with a different outfit that's gone beyond the purpose of a wedding band it's become adornment they got all these funny materials and all these funny looks and all this funny stuff it's nothing more than the world creeping in and changing the original temp for something and now a men's wedding band has become adornment and i never thought we would see the day well what's wrong with the little gold band and now we got to have this and we're going to have that and they're real fat or they're real skinny they got diamonds on them are they changing all these it's not wrong you've got diamond in your ring don't don't don't misplace what i'm saying but why is it changing and why is it such a fad i tell you like this if it's a fad stay away from it if the whole world's going one direction i want to be going the opposite direction if everybody's picking up this fad i want nothing to do with it i want to go another way stay simple stay humble stay meek stay mild do you understand that's what he wants when brother branham saw the vision of the bride marching in the end time amen what did she look like brother i said long gowns long sleeves hair straight down their back marching in stem i don't mean that's how you have to dress brother branham never condemned short sleeves he never condemned any of that stuff i'm not talking about that but when he showed the bride in a vision he would show something simple something modest her beauty did not come from the apparel her beauty did not come from a hairstyle her beauty did not come from outward adorning her beauty was that she was marching in step with the word that's her beauty and if this bride is going to have a beauty about her it's going to be the same beauty it's going to be the beauty of staying in step with the word this is what the word says i've read to you the scriptures amen don't don't start calculating i encourage you don't go home and start don't start splicing quotes together to get to do what you wanted to do anyways read the quote but go to the scriptures read the scriptures and read the quote and read the scriptures and decide what you're going to do because too many people have taken the message of brother branham and twisted it into lust because i want to wear this and i want to wear that and i want to look like this and this is just who i am no it's not who he wants you to be because he wants you to be a word bride to reflect what's written in the word amen the bride doesn't wear makeup i don't care what anybody told you or how you want to twist a quote the bride doesn't wear makeup the bride does not paint her face brother better said it over and over and over that doesn't mean that she's not allowed to cover a blemish but she's not to paint her face brother man i made that clear remember my brother abraham said that god always left enough quotes that you can take whatever package you think belongs to you and i'm speaking to you as the shepherd of this flock shepherd of this flock and only this flock and i'm telling you what the lord told me and i'm telling you what the word of god says and dozens of other quotes now you've got to decide which one belongs to you and which one you're going to identify with because this matters friends it wouldn't have happened to me like it did yesterday morning if it's not important it's important there's things coming but god wants a bride prepared marching in the word all the word even the things we think are not a big deal god is so tuned with his word he wants that bride to live that word exactly and he'll correct us if we don't think the bride doesn't get corrected she gets corrected god can correct his bride anytime that he wants to when you go into kohl's and you see the shirt hanging there with the big necklace take the necklace off and buy the shirt just because it comes with it doesn't mean it has to be worn because it's not modest we've got to watch what we're doing and we've got to be aware all the time of what we're doing men need to help their wives you know that should be self-explanatory but it's still men need to help their wives because you're the high priest of the home in and i've made a mistake many times and not saying things when i should say things because i always defaulted to the spiritual condition of my wife because my wife is godly woman she wants to do right i know her heart and so i just assume every decision she makes right because i know her heart but she's not the high priest of the home i am and when something has to be corrected in our home many times god comes to me first and i would brush it aside because i know my wife was a godly woman and god would tell her if there was something wrong and god's already knocking on my heart trying to fix something because she belongs to me and she's under my headship and there's nothing wrong with their spiritual condition a lot of times it's my spiritual condition that's the problem so god comes to me to bring a correction and now it's my job to bring the correction to my home amen not as a dictator but as a loving leader realizing that most of the time it's my fault this last one was my fault completely brother branham said a little necklace your husband bought i bought it it was little but it didn't match the scriptures you see it wasn't her fault it was my fault god comes to me i've got to fix that and so men have to help their wives and not always default to the fact that your wife is spirit-led that goes without saying you married a spirit-led woman who loves the lord there's no problem with that but you can't just always brush stuff aside when god brings it to your attention you've got to deal with it brothers it's your job to lead that household it's your job to leave that to lead that sister and if god wants something fixed many times he'll come right to the head to fix it and then when god does that it's always the same reaction there's a lump that comes in the throat you swallow it down i hope this goes okay why because you don't want to hurt her you don't want to hurt anybody you don't want to come across strong just like what i'm doing today i don't want anybody to get hurt we're all in the same condition the bars were let down things crept in that never should have been here god wants to straighten it up we're all in the same boat i don't want anybody to feel bad i don't want anybody to feel pointed out all right we're all in the same boat i told you my story but god is lifting us higher than where we've been what was acceptable is not acceptable what was okay is not okay god wants a bride lined up with the word men need to be men they need to have enough courage to help their wives and really lead their home because she's not going to answer for it you are if you let it go she's not going to answer for it you are and that goes for your teenage and young adult daughters as well we've got to do what god's called us to do i'm going to read a quote wisdom versus faith 1962. get some old pictures look at grandmother her long skirts braid of hair hanging down her back she wasn't so attractive to look at look at the modern one today little skinned down dress that every form she can move without sinning she can't move without sinning why can she not move without sinning because if a man looketh upon a woman to lust after he's committed adultery already with her in his heart and brother bennett said what about you woman who dressed yourself that way and them tight clothes that arouses the passions of a man when you know better and put it on anyways you can't even move without sinning i didn't say it prophet did what we do matters the way we dress matters we've got to keep things up not down i've seen way too many women every time they get around a man or they're just i think if i give you 50 bucks will you go buy another shirt that one obviously is not working sometimes these things happen without us realizing but when but when we awaken to it we say hey that's not working let's get another garment where i don't have to always be pulling and pulling and pulling let's just wear one where i never have to pull where i'm free to move as i need to move and if i'm tending my children i got to realize i'm bending over to pick up my if you've got little tots you got to be super careful because you're going to get in all kinds of awkward positions while you're tending your tots i mean you've got to be aware of who's behind you and who's in front of you this is just basics friends this is abc's but if you're always tugging on your clothes to keep it in the right spot and make sure knees are covered and make sure this is a it's wrong don't wear it again get close where you can move freely where you can cross your legs i mean i've sat across from sisters good sisters crossed their legs and i see the whole back of their thigh and i turn away as fast as i can but it's too late you can't turn away that fast i thought why would a woman want to wear something like that if there's a chance don't wear it it matters what we do it matters what kind of pressure we put on our neighbor it matters what kind of pressure we put on a brother or what kind of pressure we put on a sister by the way we're dressed god cares the prophet told us god cares god cares we don't need extra adornment we don't need extra accessories we don't need a bunch of stuff in our hair i mean we just don't need it live simple clean humble meek that's beautiful i think we have the loveliest sisters on the planet there's a beauty that a that a necklace cannot enhance and that's the truth there's a beauty in our sisters that a necklace or a hair adornment will not change one drop in fact i've seen things that take away they don't add to the natural beauty that's already there there's a beauty that comes with holiness there's a beauty that comes with modesty and every brother in here will tell you the same thing it's an absolute breathtaking beauty that you destroy with adornment and it hinders the natural expression of the beauty of holiness it does not help it you don't need those things they're not necessary but a lot of women okay i love you guys but i love exposing the devil because he's out to trip all of us up we've got to be wily the young women and i'm not talking about the teenagers the young mothers and the young women dress to get the approval of the other young women not of men and that's where the pressure comes from to be as pretty as attractive on par with however you want to order it's a subconscious there's a subconscious thing where i've got to be as pretty and i mean you can see it when somebody when you see you know people losing their mind over somebody's skirt and they're just like yeah that's the prettiest skirt i've ever seen in my brother why was it worn what was the motive behind it i mean now we're getting right down to heart surgery but every woman has a natural desire to be pretty and the last thing she wants is to be the least attractive so there's a pressure especially in the young married women i don't know why but that's where it is the greatest there's a pressure in the young married woman to be pretty and to be as pretty and god forbid to be prettier but i'm telling you it's there i know it's there and the devil takes advantage of those things we've got to be secure in who we are not insecure if you've got your husband's undying devotion and love and if he thinks you're beautiful why do you care what anybody else in the world thinks brother branham said a woman has a natural desire to be pretty for her husband but i mean i'm telling you you'll put something on your husband won't say a word about it but three or four sisters in the church will say it and you'll walk home happy it's not supposed to be for the other sisters it's supposed to be for your husband you have a desire to be pretty for your husband does your husband like it does your husband want it is that what he's after then who's it for i know that's cutting some people deep but it's the truth we've got to quit being influenced by other things in the spirit of god lust of the flesh lust of the eyes the pride of life that's not what we're supposed to be influenced by that's worldliness and it's got to go that doesn't that sometimes has nothing to do with how much skin is showing or how tight the clothes are sometimes it's a wrong motivation for a totally different reason but we've got to be secure in who god made us we've got to say this is my husband he loves me if if if everybody else if nobody else ever compliments my shirt my skirt my hair then i'm happy as long as my husband's happy and god's happy see we gotta we gotta come back to the bible back to the message and all of these things have got to stop it's got to fade away we've got to be the real reality brother brahm said in the message influence you know there's so many of us and most all of us influence somebody by the things we do and the way we live and the things we say we influence somebody somebody is watching your life and then when we profess to be christians what type of life should we live if somebody is watching us and your life that you live well will reflect on the influence on somebody it might be their eternal destination will rest upon the way you live and the things you do for they watch you i'd like to finish it with this thought this morning on influence we see all these things that have influenced us we've been influenced with wrong decisions wrong desires wrong actions there's a lot of influence but now god wants to turn our attention to the fact that we are also influencing and to me this becomes the this becomes the most serious part of the whole morning if you can catch this this is the most serious part of it all because it's not we got to be careful of our influence who's influencing us and where they're getting it from and what we're allowing the influences that we're allowing in the church and in our life we've got to be careful of that but the most critical part if i could get it to you today is the fact that every one of us are influencing somebody else and that's a responsibility that we carry ourselves we'll be responsible for god for how we influence somebody else when we know not to do these things we've been told not to dress this way we've been told not to paint our face and we're making we've been told not to wear tight clothes we've been told we've been told we've been told and today you've been told and told and told spelled out things people don't like to spell out but i'm comfortable spelling them out because god spelled them out to me we've been told and told and told and now there's a great responsibility that if we've been told these things and we repeat them and have a negative influence on somebody else and cause somebody else to sin by our actions then we are responsible before god and we've got to start being careful about what we say and what we do and what we praise and what we mock we got to be careful of what we criticize you criticize something godly you better be careful you criticize one of god's children and put a thought in somebody's mind towards them you got to be careful if we call something old-fashioned that's godly you got to be careful amen we've got to be careful because everything we do is influencing somebody else this is the important part the way we wear our hair the way we wear our clothes the way we speak with our mouths the way we carry ourselves is influencing somebody else and we need to be conscious of that it's been too many times in insecurity trying to get the approval of others and not realizing and are stretching for approval we're giving a wrong influence instead of backing up and saying i'm secure with god who god made me and i want only his word and if you can come to that place and walk in his word and walk by the leadership of the holy ghost now there's a holy ghost leadership and influence coming out and influencing others for the right things not the wrong things he says again in the message influence you must be a servant to christ to stay honorable with that word because that word will reflect itself through you and you're going to influence somebody that's watching your life young people likewise business missing the same way he's talking about ministers but young people likewise the apostle paul told timothy don't despise don't let no man despise thy youth but be an example i say that to the young people here our youth are an example don't let nobody despise your youth and you don't despise it yourselves because many of you are an example to the older you can live a standard that some older folks can't live they haven't caught the revelation they haven't come to the understanding you guys are clean clean faced dressing clean is that right and there's some older folks who haven't caught the revelation you've caught i say god bless you don't let don't let no outside influence from another youth group and another church and some other believer or even older people that you look at don't let them change what you're doing you walk with the word you stay you started fresh and clean stay fresh and clean stay that way don't be influenced by what the older people are doing and they're wearing that in their way you guys be an example and you are you are further in the same message he says so just keep that in mind that we're bringing influences every day and the life that you live proves what's on the inside of you you cannot change that it reflects every person reflects outside what he is inside and if we take the testimony of being christians i think that that is one of the most solemn things that a man or woman boy or girl could do when he takes on the name of christ that he is going to be a representative of christ you should watch every move you make because somebody is watching you should watch what jokes you talk about what jokes you tell brother branham said he felt condemned when convicted one day he says i'm always joking and cutting up i shouldn't do that it's the prophet of god why it's an influence we're influencing somebody else it says in questions and answers 1964. said i'm here to try to help you because i love you you're my children that i have begotten to christ i claim every one of you i claim you tonight i claim you all the time i always claim you as my brother and sister you're my children i'm your father in the gospel not fathers it would be a priest i'm your father in the gospel as paul said there i've begotten you to christ now i spouse you to christ that's engaged you to christ as a chaste virgin don't let me down don't let me down you stay a chaste virgin how will i do it brother branham stay right with the word you got that stay right with the word we've got the word on these things i talked about stay with the word live clean and pure have nothing to do with the things of the world if you love if the love of it's in your heart say oh jesus please take that away from me i don't want to be like that i don't mean just to be some person that's saying this i mean to be a genuine believer believe jesus christ and live for him every day don't do no evil why because somebody's watching us and it matters let's close by reading second peter chapter 3 together musicians if you want to make your way up brother tommy come on up second peter 3 and 9. ii peter 3 and 9 the lord is not slack concerning his promises summoning count slackness but is longsuffering to us we're not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also in the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness seeing it's all going to burn it's all going to burn our houses our jobs our clothes are it's all going to burn everything is going to be destroyed and it's coming fast what manner of persons aren't we to be in all holy conversation holy living holy lifestyle and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless is that what you want to be let's all stand god is good friends those these are not my favorite services to preach i'll just tell you that i like the exciting things but this is exciting god loves his children so much that he's going to keep us right on track not a step to the right not a step to the left but right down the middle of your road i don't want the permissible god i want the perfect will of god i don't want my own desires i want his desires for me i've gone my own way and it's not ever done me good i i've i've pushed the edge and the boundary of things and it's never worked out good for me i said god keep me in the center of your will if i step to the right or step to the left correct me lord jesus and bring me back to the very sin of your will tell your friends god wants us to live the life it's not just believing the doctrines it's living the doctrines he's not concerned with what we intellectually can reason and understand what he wants is a manifestation a life of that word lived out in flesh he wants it lived in the teenagers and the boys and girls and the moms and dads and the sisters and the brothers he wants that word in flesh alive to the world that's what matters to god that's what he's trying to point us to that's where he wants us to be i tell you friends things are coming things are coming and this is part of the preparation how you know how how can wearing a necklace or not when our necklace be part of the preparation it's about the word we're being prepared by the word and we're coming in line with the word and we're forgetting our ideas and taking the word that's preparation because when we come to that time it's going to be the word and the word only the bride will have the word and thus saith the lord or they keep still he's teaching us to line to the word not our ideas and not take quotes and manipulate them to get what we want but stay with the word and watch the quote with the word they go together amen let's sing that song i surrender all let's just sing this song together i surrender all [Music] is i surrender all i surrender i surrendered is i surrender i surrender and all to jesus [Music] know [Music] i surrendered i surrendered i surrendered the blessings surrendered oh i surrender all and all to i surrender now i feel the sacred frame oh salvation glory glory to his name i surrendered let's just bow our heads dear lord jesus we love you god i just want to say forgive me lord lord there's things that i accepted that i never should have accepted i should have been more prayerful or i should have been more tuned in with your program lord i should have been more involved in your word my god i wasn't lord your enemy slipped in and deceived me but god in your great love you corrected me you've opened my eyes you've put my feet on the right path and god i just want to say i love you for it and i thank you god you're so worthy of praise you're so worthy of our worship because you love us so much that when we are wrong and don't judge ourselves we're judged and chastened by you that we will not be lost with the world god i pray to bless your children now lord as they hear this lord may they receive it coming from you not a man or a man's ideas lord but may they cut through all of that and find you what your desire is for them in this hour god i pray you'd speak directly to the hearts of your children lord that they would know what it is you're trying to say what it is you're calling for lord i pray god that there'll be humility and meekness and repentance and lord that you would bring us to the right picture of what you want that we can stay with your word oh god have your way with us live through us lord let us be vessels that are clean and pure sanctified for your purpose that you might fill us and use us for your glory if there's anything in us that's not right purge it out of us lord and lord if there's one in here struggling with a desire for worldly dress or attire or entertainment i pray you break that spirit off of them now in the name of jesus christ let them go free lord that they might express your word and only your word oh how we love you lord we ask your blessings to be upon this congregation
