so the mystery of god will be finished as the revelation coming through christ is being completed it is finishing the mystery of god because there's been a mystery about god and god's been portraying this mystery when we come to the end time he's going to he's going to begin to reveal the mystery what's been a mystery will become a secret what's been a mystery to everybody will become a secret to his bride and the reason we're going to this is i want to focus our glasses now on what is our purpose as individuals and the message christ is the mystery of god revealed prophet of god says now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery what are we going to talk about now god's purpose we get so distracted by all the things in the world so distracted by all the things we go through daily that we need to get our glasses focused again we have difficulties and we have strife and we have hardship and we've got all kinds of up and downs and this is just part of living in this life you know that god as we lived in this life he never took away all of the effects of the curse when he put us in this life he called us he quickened us to life but he never he didn't take away aging he didn't take away amen the fact that sickness will still come and difficulties upon this earth we still suffer with many things like the rest of the world suffers but they suffer with no purpose we suffer with a purpose there's no direction for them the only purpose they have is a self-purpose amen but we have a different purpose and all of these things we may have the same things happen to us to happen to the world amen but our reaction should be different than the world's reaction because our glasses are focused to god's purpose and god's purpose is to live his life in individuals amen and so don't don't don't let me as i talk don't let me use terms that cause you to think bride i want to use terms that cause you to think me amen i want you to raise your hand and say he's talking about me amen let's focus our glasses down so you can see god's purpose is you amen god's purpose is realized in you god's purpose is displayed in you and the mystery of god is being revealed in you as an individual this is finishing the mystery of god
