Sweet Holy Spirit came in into my [Music] soul I knew I'd been [Music] changed my sins all forgiven cuz when I touch Jesus he made me whole like the woman who tried [Music] many positions but when she touched [Music] Jesus was healed on that day my sickness was different my sins were so many but when I touched Jesus he washed them [Music] away I pressed through the crowd reached out and touched Jesus the Sweet Holy Spirit came into my soul I knew I'd been [Music] changed my sins all [Music] forgiven cuz when I touched Jesus he made me whole Reach Out And Touch Jesus [Music] as he passes by you'll find he's not [Music] busy to hear your hearts [Music] Cry he's passing by now your needs to supply re Reach Out And Touch Jesus as he passes [Music] by I have a little plaque as I go excuse me as I go in and out of my little house there and it says on the plaque has two little sparrows and it says I I Sing Because I'm happy I sing because I'm free and I was looking in the scriptures brother Bram talks about that about over 50 times but listen what the Bible says it says fear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows where soever therefore shall confess whosoever shall confess me before men will I confess him also before my Father which is in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before men him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven think not that I am come to this send excuse me peace on Earth I came not to send peace but a sword and that's misunderstood but all through the trials all through the testing there's one thing that a Believer has the trial of your faith worketh patience so we've all gone through patience because we've all gone through trials and it doesn't look like there's even any possibility that it can end took a little bit of a a fall the other day and uh when I heard the crack I knew what it was pretty well but that didn't stop the pain and I just said well Lord I'm still alive so as I managed to move around and get to the phone and they weren't too happy that I waited about 5 hours but when I finally got a hold of my family I said you better come they call Brother Chad and brother Chad and I have to say this publicly because this is the main reason I'm giving my testimony he went to Sister Sister lamb and said let's agree that when he goes to the hospital and gets x-rays they won't find any breaks that God will heal whatever broke cuz I kept saying I know cuz I've bu busted a lot of Bones through the years and I know when a break is a break so I got there and they went through a battery of X-rays I guessed probably 12 and they finally come back and they said we don't know why you're in such pain but we know one thing there's no break I haven't seen you smile that much for a long time you know I'm what I'm fixing to say don't you so the Bible said that not a bone of his would be broken my Lord on the cross thank think of all the nails that went by those tiny little bone fragments or bones in his hand not a bone was broken but he got bruised and I got bruised real bad but so I thought well I laid there through all the tests and whatever and they said well we can't find anything so I went to another doctor because you know how insurance is well you got to make sure you get everybody lined up to check everything and I and he said only thing I can think because it's an MRI uh CT and all these others didn't show anything but I knew in my heart that God had healed me and so I still haven't gotten an MRI by the way that was a month ago and so I started uh thinking about some things that I've been going through like there's people here this morning I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you're going through tests and trials you're going through some difficult times and you wonder Lord how much longer can I put up with all this stuff remember he'll never put anything greater on you than what you can bear every single thing like a little sparrow that falls he knows it an insignificant little bird like a sparrow he knows it and I'm reminded of how beautiful it is when you step out in faith you know you shouldn't be walking dead I'm not this isn't against my family but but you know you shouldn't be doing anything and I said you know they used to call the old Trappers up in the mountains they get Cabin Fever cuz they couldn't get out because of the snow well there was no snow a lot of rain but no snow but I was getting cabin fever I thought you know if I'm trusting the Lord I've got to trust the Lord but what about the horrible pain you're in ah I don't need those painkillers I don't need those things so I just took a little baby step at a time I'm I'm here to tell you I'm walking on what the doctors say is a broken HP am praise God praise God forever more so I believe the word it isn't the easiest thing to do as far as the natural is concerned but when the spiritual takes over it has nothing to do with the natural because the other is simply just a what symptom he's the Healer you can't see the symptoms in God's economy because faith is a substance that's more real than a broken bone hear me this morning substance is what faith really is it's the real thing as brother Chad's been saying it's the real thing I want to see reality brother sister it's happening today it's happening in our church if you can just go reach out and grab a hold of it God wants to deliver us so as I'm thinking about that I was thinking about about 18 years ago this December 1st I was asked by the brandham family if we would sing at sister Rebecca Brams you've heard this but I want to bring it up this morning it was around the 1st of December uh she was 60 years old and uh that was about 18 years ago a little less than 18 and brother Jim would you sing and it was a private uh funeral just the family few other guests and you know you don't feel worthy uh I never talked to brother brandom but my wife and I were surely close to brother George and sister Rebecca very very close as a matter of fact when she came just before she passed away she came to Phoenix and I was ministering there and afterwards she came and she was crying and she said finally I found a church that my [Music] Daddy has said would be the revelation of this message and finally I'm starting to see what he meant could I be your piano player and I said oh sister absolutely of course phoh like that because she was struggling on the piano anyway she would play the violin but we we were so well first of all we were shocked that she would even say it but as we went on and she stayed there and then you know that she passed away with cancer and we were there with her towards the end and then when brother George said I want you to and your wife to sing that was a great honor for me to sing there with brother Billy Paul Brother Joseph and all the relatives sitting there but while we were singing I know you've heard this before [Music] while we were singing my wife and I and I looked over the brandham family I'm sure just like brother brandham saw his kids there when he was living growing up now older as we're singing this song that I'm going to sing this morning several sparrows came to the window behind me and they started singing their little hearts out they sang so loud I thought the people couldn't even hear us because it bombarded my wife and I from that window window now I I've never seen that before they would fly up to a window that was right behind you and start singing their hearts out and I can't help but say Lord this scripture is fulfilled you are concerned about the sparrow and you just want to bring a witness to how beautiful this song is and when brother brandham said over 50 times His Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know he watches over me and you everything could be a lot worse you could had a lot more def de devastating things happen in your life but God is in control of everything brother John he never misses a beat he doesn't care what Satan throws in your pathway he will deliver you you love him this morning amen thank you sister I have to read what brother Bram said and then I'm going to sing he said I can hear him say speaking of the three Hebrew children I watch them all night long Hallelujah for His Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know he watches me he watches you he watches over me yes sir His Eye Is on the Sparrow I Sing Because I'm happy I sing because I'm free for His Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know he watches me and it just dawned on me this morning early real early the reason sister Rebecca and brother George wanted that song she was happy because she was in another land and she was free because she had no pain of cancer anymore so there's an exuberance in The Believer when he has a chance to Worship the Lord no wonder that song meant so much to brother Brandon and it means so much me to me this morning to be able to offer a little bit of encouragement to you so if you're battling things in your life and you think will I ever be delivered just be patient God's got it all in control he's coming along the line he's going to send angels in your neighborhood and maybe it's a goer or maybe it's this or that but he can deliver you in Jesus name God bless you sisters [Music] Hallelujah why should I be [Music] discouraged why should the Shadows Shadows come oh why should my heart ever be lonely and long for heav and home when Jesus is my portion my constant friend is [Music] he for His Eye Is on the [Music] Sparrow and I know I know he watches be His Eye Is on the spare and I know he watches you and me I Sing Because I'm happy I sing because I'm free for his ey is on the [Music] sparrow and I know he watches watches me let not your heart don't let it be troubled his tender word I hear and resting on his goodness I lose all all my doubts and all my fears though by the path he leadth oh but one step I may see for His Eye Is on the [Music] sparoh and I know I know he wases [Music] me his ey his on the [Music] [Laughter] spare and I know he watches me whenever I am tempted listen now when ever clouds and they often arise when songs give place to S haven't we all done it when hope within see to die oh I draw the closer to him oh my from care he sets me [Music] free his eye it's always on the spirit R and I know he watches me His Eye Is on the spare and I know he watches brother Ben sing I Sing Because I'm happy I sing because I'm free his is on the SP and I know he [Music] watches stand with me and sing please everyone I sing why do you sing because I'm happy

oh speak to me Lord speak to me let your spir move through me Lord speak to me amen God bless you this morning let's bow our heads together and pray oh dear heavenly father we're so thankful this morning oh thankful for the opportunity to Worship You thankful for the testimonies that we've heard oh so thankful that we're on on this Earth in this day and you've given us ears to hear eyes to see a heart to perceive Lord what you're doing and God we've come Lord for a fresh dose of isav may you continue Lord to clear our vision to unstop our ears to remove every block in the channel Lord to our soul and may you feed us on your word again today God may we gain strength by that word Lord and may we become what you predestinated us to be in this age may we move right into your very image and your likeness Lord and may we surrender ourselves in a greater way and lay down our own lives and allow you to come and take absolute Dominion inside of us that you may accomplish your purpose thank you Lord for all that's been said and done I pray now God your special blessing as we look into your word God we can't do anything of ourselves we can read we thankful for that we have a Bible in our language we're thankful for that but but God it's going to take the supernatural element Lord to unlock it to us to make it live Lord and I pray you'd Supply that Supernatural element this morning that you would take us Lord and Lift Us Higher by Your Word God take this vessel under your control and Minister your word through these lips of clay may we lay ourselves aside and may you just take over lord we commit ourselves to you we're so thankful to be here this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning over we're standing if you could take your Bibles and we'll turn to the Book of Revelation thank you musicians and thank you brother Ben man just want to remind you that brother Benjamin seabolt's gone this morning he's down in Junction City Ohio preaching for the group of Believers there so just remember him as he's preaching and be traveling back later today and also our brother Gabe Smith will be traveling to Oregon this coming weekend to preach for Brother Rich Cobb so be praying for him as well amen praise the Lord I appreciate the specials God bless you brother Jim it's so good to see you right here in the front brother it was a tremendous testimony and as we follow through that testimony with our brother Jim it just became so amazing what God had did and and unless you followed step by step you don't realize what a miracle it is for him to stand here and sing because he was in such excruciating pain after his injury like he said they went and did all the test and could find no break but he was in such such pain he could hardly move I went to visit him and it was horrible it was terrible the pain he was in he had to do a follow-up visit with oio they went and did some more scans and told him the same thing that they come up with different reasons why he was hurting so bad but after he got home they gave him a call and they said actually we found a break it is broke your hip is broke they didn't find it in the hospital they found it at oio and all of a sudden I was confused why they didn't find it we prayed they wouldn't find it they prayed there would be no break they couldn't find it then he goes home and then he calls me and lets me know and and I said oh brother and he says it's okay he said it's okay God's my healer I'm like praise the Lord I said what do you have to do and they said because it's a weekend they couldn't do anything they want me to come in later for an MRI they're going to get some prescription medicine I have to lay completely flat not completely immobile and completely flat sister pharoh was wondering how she was going to get home health aids and n is in there to help him and and all this stuff well I called him a few I no I went to see him a couple days later and I expected brother Jun to be laid out flat not able to move inmobile I walked in his house he's sitting on his couch and as soon as I walked in the door he stands up to come and greet me I said brother what are you doing he said God has healed me brother he said oh IO dropped the ball they didn't order the MRI they didn't get him the pain medicine and he just took it amen as God had healed him and God has certainly healed him and then and then what he told me when I went for that visit he says I know why God didn't allow them to see that he said if they would have found the break when I first went to the emergency room I would have been in the hospital for a week or more laying there flat and God was going to heal me and let me go home so they couldn't see a break God is good friends God is so good amen I'm so thankful that we serve a risen savior amen so I appreciate that testim appreciate brother Daniel for offering the song special amen it's just a blessing to serve God and it's a blessing to serve God together with you all man sorry to keep you standing let's let's take our Bibles and look at the Book of Revelation chapter 8 Revelation chapter 8 verse1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour and God bless you as you have your seats amen want to say God bless you Sister Marty it's good to have you here from Arizona and also brother Ben and brother Aaron L sisters here with her boys God bless you it's good to see you guys again from Arizona amen we get a lot of visitors from Arizona and we like it amen praise God it's good to see you all and we're going to continue on with the subject I don't know if you remember but we had the uh uh we preached a sermon over two weeks ago called The White Rock Rock and the white stone and we just got super inspired and started preaching and got nowhere near finishing it and so we just got it uh our opportunity to come back today and to pick up where we left off we're going to do just a little bit of review because it was a little over two weeks ago that we ministered on that so we're going to hit the review and then get to the the rest of it and then I once again I've got a a a PowerPoint with the slides so we can go fast I have a lot of slides and I have a lot of uh uh quotes and scriptures and and and I'm not even going to apologize for it amen normally I say I'm sorry but I I don't care I'm so excited I love the word so much I'm so excited just to share what's in my heart that we're just going to take our time this morning it's Sunday morning amen amen let's just take our time and enjoy what God has given us amen this is a special day that we live in and we know that every age has been special but this to me is the special of the special this is the capping off amen and I'm so excited to be alive today and have this Revelation in my heart amen so we read here in Revelations 8 if you'll remember last time we went through and walked through the The Book of Revelation from the church ages to John being caught up to the lamb taking the book and loosing the seals the seals opening in symbol form and brother remember said it was a church form a symbol form they could see the symbol of what it was but they didn't know what the Revelation was and then you come to the the opening of the seventh seal is here chapter 8 verse1 when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour so now we come to the opening of the six seals in the sixth chapter of Revelations and it's information symbols and things all kinds of stuff to talk about in there but when you come to the seventh seal there's nothing to talk about it's silence it's quiet nothing no moving Parts amen no no images coming out no symbology nothing so thankful for that now let's go over to Revelation chapter 10 and in Revelation chapter 10 verse one Revelation 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire brother benus said none other than Christ this could be this is Christ The Mighty Angel and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth now this little book open the prophet of God tells us amen this is the same book that was closed in chapter 5 and sealed with Seven Seals now at this coming when the mighty Angel comes down who is Christ and brother Brenham said the seventh angel has to be on earth at the time of this coming so the sealed book it becomes an open book and the mighty Angel descends and brings an open book which is what the seven seal book of redemption now open in the hand of the mighty angel coming down at the time the seventh Church age messenger is on Earth amen so there's no doubts no questions no wiggle room about those things amen and and let's read verse two again and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not now this is such a important verse of scripture and we went through it last time but if you'll just forgive me I want to review cuz I want to encapsulate this whole thought together so just bear with me amen you can say brother Chad you just said that I'm going to say it again and again and again just prepare yourself because this is the day we live in this is the event that has transpired in our day and and so when the mighty Angel descends with an open book in his hand he cries with a loud voice as when a lion roars cuz he is the lion of the tribe of Judah he's the king amen and remember said he's coming now to look for his Queen this is what's transpiring in the end time and the end time seal is the seventh seal and this here is a description of the seventh seal as it opens Revelations 101:7 brother Ram tied that to the seventh seal which he also said was the coming of the Lord amen so now there was a voices the seven Thunders uttered they were voices because John was going to write what the seven Thunders uttered so it was something you could write down we got that so it was a voice it was an explanation it was something amen but he was told to seal it up seal up the the things the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and so now they're sealed up and that sealing is what brother brandham refers to on those seals on the back of the book so if you're listening to brother benam as he's coming down through his ministry he starts talking about now there's seals on the inside of the book and On The Backs side of the book and and then he he he says it different ways you if you follow him through you'll catch he he uses different terminology but he's he's driving at the same thing that there's a set of seals that you can see which were opened when were they opened they were open in the vision of John 2,000 years ago when it opened as a white horse rider and a red horse rider and all the symbology and brother benam saying but there's a set of seals stuck on the back part of the book book amen and and and nobody knows what there are there's nothing written about them there's not even a symbol of that what is he talking about he's talking about the Thunders that were sealed up that's that other set of seals amen that was that oh praise God you don't know for me what it means to see these things so clearly because we probed that and asked God and didn't understand what the prophet said but brother Ben says it's so simple and it is so simple it's one of the simplest things in the scripture amen when brother B saying there was a time in the message people were saying are there 14 seals could there be 14 seals because he says seven seals on the inside of the book Seven Seals On The Backs side of the book and it's not 14 seals amen it's it's something that opened Amen in a revelation a symbol form but the real revelation of it was still sealed what it all meant what it represented what each symbol represented was still sealed it was sealed till when till the time of the end or the end time or the time of the opening of The Seven seal which is the end time seal and when that Seal's open now will come the revelation of the Seven Seals to explain what it all means that's what he says there's nothing written about it and it ties to the seventh seal because when he opened seventh seal there was silence not a symbol not a sign not nothing so we'll read vers vers four again and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer this is why brother M's referring to this as the end time time no longer is the end time seal the ending of all things amen and everything ends he says on this seven seal first it's time no more amen for denominations and time no more for Gentile world power then time no more for this and time no everything finishes out on the seven SEO he said even time finishes on the seven seal and time doesn't finish till the end of the Millennium so everything it's the wrap up It's The End Amen it starts the end of everything praise God now verse seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so in the sounding of the seventh angel this mystery of God should be finished praise God now we're going to come down here to a quote I want to read out of the message is this the sign of the ERS and in in the message this is is this the sign of the ERS he preaches this Sunday evening the last Sunday of 1962 which happens to be the next to last day so it's December 30th in the evening of 1962 and he titles the message is this the sign of the answer sir so he starts with a question is this is and and you know we we went through this last time this is the culmination of six dreams and then a vision that he had amen and and now he's got the the word of the Lord to go go west because you got to catch a revelation and come back so now he's going to to go through Junior Jackson's dream which was one of the dreams that came to him in that sequence of six and he says and he came to me and he said something's in my heart I must tell you brother brandom I said go on brother Jackson said I dreamed a dream and there it was I just sat still and I listened and watched said I dreamed that there was a great big hill like out in a field where blueg grass or something was and said up on top of this hill where the water had washed away the soil there was a top rock up on top the hill like uh up on top of the hill like and it was Rock no grass and where the water had washed down and to cup some kind of readings on these stones and you were standing there interpreting this reading on these stones and said all of us and there and here is the way he put it said the Brethren from Jordan from all around we were all standing together listening to interpret that mysterious writing on those stones that mountain said then you picked up something like from the air something like a wrecking bar or a crowbar wasn't it brother something like that A Wrecking Bar real sharp and said how how you done it I don't know said you struck the top of that mountain ripped it around and lifted the cap off of it and was in the shape of a pyramid and you ripped the top of it off now that was months and months before the pyramid message was preached said beneath that was White Stone Granite and you said the Sun or the light has never shined on this before look on this watch this then further down he says and he said look upon this light has never come upon it before and when all of them got up and I told them to watch that and all of them come up to look in so brother takes this in the in the dream he takes a sharp tool and he rips the top off and reveals that there's white granite rock underneath and he said light has never shined on this before but he said while they were looking in he looked out of the corner of eye I believe it was and watched me I slipped off to one side and I started going towards the West toward the setting of the sun coming up a hill going down a hill coming up a hill going down a hill getting smaller and smaller I went all the way out of sight praise God so now this is the dream that brother bams has and and he goes through all six dreams but he really spends a lot of time on this dream and then on the experience he had when he got caught up into the constellation of Angels in the vision uh the week before he preaches this and then he tells about the the the the vision he had where the stones were laying all over his driveway where they were going to tear out his gate he finds out that was time for that that's the time marker for him to go out west everything comes together he preaches it in this message and then he leaves immediately after this to go out west and that starts a whole another cycle of events that leads to him coming back in March and preaching the Seven Seals so all this all of this comes together so we just want to keep in sequence as we move down through now he continues on in is this the sign of the answer and then notice in some mysterious way we picked up out of the air a sharp tool that opened up the the top and in there was white granite but it wasn't interpreted there was no letters I didn't interpret that Junior I just looked at it and said to the Brethren look on this and that's fulfilled tonight so the dream was fulfilled right there and so there's listen don't ever think that there's a future fulfillment of Junior Jackson's dream brother bam said it was fulfilled right then and then the last part of the dream they saw brother bam going out west that was fulfilled the next or two days later when he got in the station wagon and drove out west and moved out west amen so the dream was fulfilled amen what what did he do oh praise God let's just keep going I don't want to get ahead so we know he goes out west and he goes out west he connects with this constellation of angels this was the picture that was tooken and became becomes the sign of what brother Ben's talking about there was a representation in the Heavens to show us amen that there's a Capstone coming down in the pyramid for it's a Capstone and the Capstone is made of the wings of seven angels amen and and the Seven Angels brother said represented the church ages complete it's the complete New Testament it's the completion of the church ages now the capping off of the Church of the New Testament is coming down Amen brother b gets caught into this constellation amen and and it's amazing that it's a clown it's amazing it's white because it was White Rock that was under the stone and white represents Purity and he said there is nothing written on it it's a pure Revelation that light is never shine never been illuminated it's not not one word he said written about it in the Bible amen so it cannot be tampered with tainted manipulated messed up by the ideas of man it was kept totally secret to the end time so that it wouldn't be all messed up so that our thinking would already be messed up about this amen he says when it's in the Bible men probe at it and poke at it and they do all these other things but there's not one word written why light has never shined on this before and brother B said I've read all these books and don't even know that there's Seven Seals yet to be revealed what's he looking at he's looking at the Thunders what's he doing he's preaching it and s s is this the sign of the end Ser he's preaching it there he's letting you know that in this Bible is a mystery within this Bible underneath the rock which represents the Bible because remember it had writings all around it he was going around interpreting all the writings what was his ministry to this point to tie together all the Loose Ends from the church ages that have been left off and misunderstood and he was taking the scriptures and he was correcting the doctrine of the Apostles and bringing us back to the teaching of the Apostles he preached what Paul preached so he interpreted the writing on the outside of the rock then he comes to this point and says now there's something that's not even written there's something with in this Revelation within this mountain of the word that light has never shined on before before nobody's looked on this and now in the vision he takes the cap off and shows you there's a there's a rock within the rock there's a revelation inside the word and nobody knew that till that point and then he tells them you look on this I'm going out west they were looking what were they looking at they were looking at what brother brandham had just exposed in this message he exposed the fact that there's got to come a revelation of this that was sealed up till the end time cuz Daniel was told that it'll be sealed until the end time so that means at the end time what was sealed has to be unsealed because it was sealed until the time of the end so the time of the end would be the time of the unsealing what's going to be unsealed the one thing in the Bible that there's not a word written about and it's those seven Thunders lights never shine on this in that message he's telling them to look on this amen so he can go out west and and then and so they were just there to what to look on the fact that there's got to come another revelation of this yes not to figure it out cuz there's nothing written they can't figure anything out they can't read anything all they can read is verse four which tells him he sealed up the things that were uttered praise God so then he goes out west he connects with the angels when he gets caught up into the consolation of angels they tell him go back East for the revelation of the Seven Seals in in the same message time shall be no more he announces that time is over what happens what happens could that be so now Brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is capped by the seven Thunders this is so critical what is this it's the Capstone it's The Headstone it's the headship of Christ coming down to cap off his bride hallu what caps off the church those seven Thunders he ties it all together you remember the pyramid message it's the Capstone what did it do the Holy Spirit capped off when he says the pyramid message he's going back to stature of a perfect man showing that through faith love Temperance or faith Temperance whatever I I don't even have it right now I'm not even going to try amen bring building up to the stature of a perfect man but the headship is love the eighth is the capping off which is love which is God and so he's tying this together with the pyramid message which is Statue of a perfect man and he says what did it do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual and seal it when we added to our faith righteousness godliness and faith and so forth and kept adding it till we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is God that's how we makes the individual and caps him and seals him with the Holy Spirit then if that be so he's got seven Church ages that he's had seven Mysteries that's been sounded away and they fought for to bring back and now the headstone comes to cap off the church does the Thunders mean that my brethren sir is that where we're at I remember that I said in this message it's all questions is this the sign of the end sir sir is this where we're at is that what the Thunders mean is this the time for this to be fulfilled it's all questions but if you follow the message through when brother brandham comes to the seven seal it's no longer a question to him he knows that it is the sign of the end and it is the end time and it's the and and it's the opening of the seventh seal he knows it before he's asking questions but after he says it is amen now look at the title God hiding himself in Simplicity Albuquerque New Mexico this is 3 weeks after he preaches the seals this is not during the seals so he starts the seal week off preaching God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same but this is after that not before he says something happened the other day you read or heard the tape the seven Thunders what time is it siru brother branom just called the tape what time is it sir the seven Thunders what was he preaching the seven Thunders what was he showing there's got to come a revelation of these seven Thunders this is the mystery under the capping this this is the Min this is what caps off the New Testament this is what finishes the word this is what completes the bride this is what brings Christ down to unite with his bride this is the opening of the seventh seal amen This is the End Time message this is the end time and the revealing of of the Mysteries this it's it's all here and he and he comes and he says have you heard the tape the seven Thunders go find the tape titled seven th he tells you which one it is what time is it sir so what time is it sir is the seven th thers that's where brother Brandon preached letting you know there's got to come a revelation of these Thunders and he says is it time for those Thunders if it is the Thunders will cap off the church amen is it is that what this is for is I'm supposed to go out there to get the revelation of these seven Thunders it's all about the seven Thunders so what does he do he goes out west why because the question is the seven Thunders yes what is it nothing's written it's mysterious it's a white Rock not one word written completely silent sealed up till the time of the end he goes out west Amen to to to what because the question is is this the seven Thunders is it time for the seven Thunders to be revealed is it time for those seals on the back part of the book to come open that's his question he goes out west amen we talked about this before God puts the sword in his hand which is the word coming to the hand of the Prophet amen then he gets caught up in the consolation of angels then he gets sent back and he he he goes out for the mystery of the Thunders and he comes back preaching the Seven Seals where' the Thunders go are you following goes out to get the revelation of the seven Thunders and he comes back preaching ing the revelation of the Seven Seals so maybe the revelation of the Seven Seals is the seven Thunders praise be to God now we're in the seventh seal now notice now that now when this taken place Junior was standing in a field had a big pyramid he's going right back listen he went through this dream in detail when he goes out west when he preaches at the end of 1962 now he's back here 3 months later amen and he's preaching in March and and now he's in the seventh he's at all eight days of preaching he's come to the 10th service he's at the last one in the evening service on Sunday preaching and he goes right back to Junior Jackson's dream says now this taking place Junior was standing in the field had a big pyramid to it like that and there was something wrote on the rocks and I was revealing that to the people is that right Junior about a year before it happened now notice the next thing now I took some kind of a bar cut it off on the inside side was the White Rock that had nothing roote on it and at that time I started to the west and told them all said don't go out west stay here and look on this till I return went West for the blast returned back to the east with the Holy Spirit interpreting this Unwritten word what Unwritten word the seven Thunders that John heard and was told to write and was told to seal up that's the unwritten word and he went out to get the to hear the blast to connect with the angels the holy ghost bringing him back East to what to interpret the unwritten word how did he interpret the unwritten word what did he call that series that he preached when he interpreted the Thunders the unwritten word he called it the preaching of the Seven Seals amen he said now if that isn't perfectly the God Almighty I want you to know what is what am I trying to say this for friends is to show you we at the end time Daniel was told go thy Way Daniel for the prophecy the vision is sealed up till the time of the end when will it be unsealed the time of the end brother benam is saying I'm here to tell you this is the time this is we're at the end time what end time when that Mighty Angel come down with an open book in his hand and the revelation of the seven Thunders and cried with a loud voice and said time shall be no longer what is it it's the the seventh seal It's The End Time seal we're at the end time no question friends we're at the end time I used to think listen I I used to think brother Brenham didn't say anything in the seventh seal now I go back and read and he said it all in the seventh seal he gave the full Revelation in the seventh seal amen it's all laying there he told you he told everything that he was allowed to tell it's all there he tells you it's at the end time he tells you he went and got the interpretation of the written word he tells you he came back and preached it he tells you all of it yes look at what he says get in seven seal when will it be brotherr I brother BR I cannot tell you I do not know but one of these days if we never meet again on this Earth We're going to meet Yonder at the Judgment seat of Christ and you'll find out in that room the Revelation coming from God just like the rest of them has that one of the mystery of that seal the reason it wasn't revealed it was seven Thunders that uttered their voices and there it is perfectly because nothing knows anything about it wasn't even written so we're at the end time we are here praise God and you know when brother M comes to the seventh seal he sees it unfold in three unfoldings amen and one of them happened the other day one today and one was in unknown tongues he couldn't make it out and so you know what I believe to me there's still mysteries in the seventh seal there's still things we don't know about the seventh seal to say the seventh seal is open amen you can say well what all is entailed in the seventh seal well I know this part one of the Mysteries so one of the mysteries of that seal what seal the seventh seal so the seventh seal has more than one mystery one of the mystery of that seal so it means the seven seal is not simplistic it's not just knowing one thing one of the mystery of that seal the reason it wasn't revealed it was seven Thunders that utter their voices one part of that mystery of that seal amen that lets you know that the seal is open is the revelation of the seven Thunders which were contained in it was the revelation of the Seven Seals the unwritten word amen that lets you know that one mystery under that seal has been opened so the seventh seal is open listen if the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord it encompasses so many things amen you've got the if you've got the coming of the Lord You've Got The Return of the full revelation of Jesus Christ the full mystery of God has to return the headship has to come down the invisible Union has to take place amen the bride has to be impregnated and bring forth Christ again upon the Earth then she's got to be carried away amen her atoms have to change she has to to go in a translation then he has to return through two prophets and reveal himself to 144,000 then he's got to destroy everybody on the battlefield and the Battle of armagedon and then again he comes back to set up the millennial Kingdom the coming of the Lord has a lot to it friends and some of it's still mysterious because we don't know exactly how things will happen we don't exactly know when things will happen we just know what this seven seal is and that it's open so we're not in any way trying to say it's simplistic oh it's this it's easy there's a lot to it friends when Jesus came the first time in the first coming it encompasses so many things so many details amen when he came there was prophecies being fulfilled there was a movement of Nations there was a census that took place there was an impregnation of a virgin a virgin womb according to Isaiah 7 there was a Nazareth location then a moving to Bethlehem then the ends being full and there was wise men that came there was a Herod trying to kill all the young then there was Jesus debating in the temple when he's 12 years old the growing up of Jesus Christ then there was his ining his Earthly Ministry signs and wonders and miracles amen then there was the rejection of the nation I mean it was full of stuff that was the first coming and we treat the second coming like it's just going to be one little simple thing amen but one of the mystery of the seal the reason it wasn't Reve revealed it was seven Thunders that uttered their voices and there it is perfectly because nothing knows anything about it wasn't even written so we're at the end time we are here you realize brother B's not saying it's getting close to the end time or this will happen in the end time he's saying this is the end time again in s said do you notice when the Jews asked him that you know when we compared the scripture here with Matthew 24 with the six seals the seven seal was left out because you see Christ said only God himself knowed not even the angels no wonder it was it even written you see they hush nothing taking place then Angels don't know it nobody knows when he's coming what is he talking about the seventh seal that's the part that was left out of Matthew 24 yeah nobody knows when he's coming but there will be seven voices of the Thunders that will reveal the great Revelation at that time what great Revelation the revelation of his coming the opening of the seventh seal it will be revealed at the at the Thunders the the the seven voices of those Thunders will reveal the great Revelation at that time so I believe to us if we don't know it if we we it won't be known till that time but it will be revealed in that day in The Hour That is supposed to be revealed in why is brother bah haltering around so much on this because he himself knows exactly what it is we're going to get to this in a minute so the thing for us to do is to be reverent before God and serve him and do all that we know how to do and live good Christian lives here now we find that the six seal has opened to us we see it and we know that the seventh seal cannot be broke to the public until that hour arrives key word there is public now there was some reason that God let the seven voices be thundered because must come for we find that Christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened the seventh seal but you see it's a hidden Mystery so when you opened the seventh seal it was a hidden mystery no one knew it but it it's right along with what he said no one would know his coming they also would not know about this seventh Thunder mystery so you see it's connected together so what is connected the seventh seal the coming of the Lord is connected with the seven seal mystery the seven voices of the seven Thunders will reveal the great Revelation at that time and we are here it's the end time brother R can't come right out and say it he's told not to in the third pool you won't explain this like the other ones when it starts it'll be a total secret but he does everything he can to get you to see it and we missed it and missed it I missed it and missed it and missed it and missed missed it and missed it and missed it then all the day one day it was like fireworks going off poof there it was this is why brother B said don't try to interpret anything just live a simple Christian humble life you'll get yourself way moved away from it if we try listen the the the revelation of the seven Thunders the opening of the seventh seal was so simple that's why he started with God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same amen the reason he starts with that message and then he comes to the seventh seal says how did I know a week ago amen that that is so simple so humble and he tells us you just don't try to interpret anything if God wants you to know something he'll reveal it to you just stay simple and humble and live a Christian Life if you try to interpret you'll wind yourself that much farther away from it why because it's so simple if you try to figure this out you're going to do nothing but mess up what the opening of The Seven seal is because it was so simple it was taking place all week and nobody there knew it that's how simple it was yes the evidence of the opening of The Seven seal was manifesting right before their eyes and brother M talks about that I think we're going to get into that right now I I mentioned it to you last time but I went and pulled some quotes and I I didn't get them all because I didn't have time to read through everything but if you find some more along this line send them to me so out of the week he's preaching the seals brother Brandon makes several statements and here in the first one God hiding himself in Simplicity says now if you're Wide Awake you'll see something I hope I don't have to hold it in my hand to show you see it's it's here we're at the end yes sir smart education will miss it the simple Visions when they're revealed in such Simplicity till it just crosses over the top of people's head what will cause it to cross over head when we think too hard because it is Mega simple super duper simple so simple nobody that was present when it was happening knew it was happening except the man who was preaching amen and it was that simple all right so this is the first message then we come to the second seal he says but in the last days of the sounding Revelation 101:7 said the mystery of God would be finished in the last days at the sounding of the seventh Angel Malachi 4 said that he would send Elijah before that evil Day come upon the earth when he'd burn it like a furnace and he would restore and to bring back the children to the faith of the fathers the original Apostolic Pentecostal Faith which he promised to be restored now that's just as plain as scripture can say it now it's promised and if we're in the last days something's got to happen and it's happening and we're seeing it he's in the second seal it had already begun the day before in the first seal he told us what was going to happen in the breach then he comes in the first seal and he starts it and he says if we're in the last days something's got to happen so if we're in the last days something's got to happen what's got to happen in the last days well there's got to be a big miracle thing and there's got to be some big no what's got to happen in the last day is the mystery that's been sealed has to be unsealed the seven Thunder mystery has to be revealed that's what's got to happen in the last day that's what he's been talking about the whole time everything brother Brenham leads up to this message when he comes to this he's leading up with those seven Thunders the White Rock the mystery nobody knows silence in heaven the coming of the Lord the the the the Mysteries under the seven Thunders that's everything like if you followed his ministry till you get to this place and you're in brandham Tabernacle you come to this place this is everything he's laying down to prep you to this and he says if we're at in the last days something's got to happen he's been telling them what has to happen what has to happen is those seals on the back part of the book have to come off that's what marks the end time that's been waiting for the end time for to be unsealed so we're at the end time something's got to happen and it's happening and we're seeing it praise God Amen I wasn't but by the grace of God I'm seeing it now amen be third seal but this morning early the Holy Spirit came to where I was just as plain as anything I seen this other seal open now just exactly now now now he hears me I know and I'm very grateful now you'll just remember that there is something happening that I hope you're catching it there's something happening I just want to test the church one time and see if they could actually pick up something before it actually taken place now remember remember that I've told remember what I've told you and may the Lord help us that's he's saying I like I said before I couldn't imagine sitting there that day hearing those things and straining like crazy to try to remember what did he tell he's told us all kinds of stuff what he talking about remember what I told you and he's talking about remember what I told you and serves as this the time remember what I came back and said in God hiding himself in Simplicity then the breach I he's been telling them the same thing all along that there's these seals that have to be open the Thunders had to be revealed the unwritten word the White Rock the mystery that that Daniel couldn't see that sealed up to the time of the end there has to come the opening of The Seven seal the coming of the Lord amen the opening of The Seven Thunders amen and they have to be preached they have to be revealed these been telling that all along and he says I hope that you're catching I hope you're catching it there's something happening it was happening right then I just want to test the church one time see if they'll actually pick it get up something before it actually taken place remember remember what I've told you and may the Lord help us fifth seal the fifth seal is open there many other things if you caught it I'm waiting for my questions to see by all right this is interesting because when he comes to the fifth seal up until this day he's been saying that that when we get to Sunday Sunday morning which will be the The Eighth Day when we get to Sunday morning in these meetings we're going to have a prayer for the sick we're going to have a prayer line and prayer for the sick and he's announcing it all the way through but he changes his mind and he says no I think we're going to do questions and answers and then maybe pray for the sick so he changes his agenda from what he had in the beginning and look at what he I'm just going to tell you what I think so take it for what it's worth this is just what I think he says many other things have you caught it I'm waiting for my question to see by what's he trying to see he's trying to see by the questions you ask if you caught it he's wanting to know what the people are getting and you know what he got can I wear deodorant is it all right to to wear panty it was going right over their heads they weren't they were missing completely the event that was taking place before their very eyes and he says something's going on at the end time and this has got to happen and it's happening and we see it it's happening I hope you can catch it remember what I told you and Lord help us I'm testing the church to see if they can catch something before it actually happens and then he comes to the fifth seal and he says that the fifth seal has opened there what was the opening of the fal explaining the souls that are under the altar showing what happened for the Redemption of the Jews from the time of Christ on he says the fifth seal is open there many other things if you caught it I'm waiting for my questions to see by all right that's important you catch that this is where he's saying we're going to have questions and answers and now he's telling you I'm waiting for the questions to see what you've caught Sixth Seal now remember friends these are not my ideas of this this is not what I've been thinking this is all together from me so help me the Holy Spirit knows it you wait if the Lord willing tomorrow night what night is the end this is Saturday six seal tomorrow night in the morning he's having questions and answers in the evening he's preaching the seventh seal he said tomorrow night I want to show you a mystery that's been going all the time right here in this meeting I doubt very much whether you've ever seen it or not what's what's took place it's been something that's laid right here before you and I've watched each night for for it to rise or somebody to say I see it what's he talking about what is he what's he what's he been what's he been waiting for somebody to say say I see it brother B I see it and he's trying to get him to see it and he keeps referring to it and he keeps telling us it's the end time we're here this has to happen something's going on are you catching it I hope you can catch it then he says it's been going on it's been going all the time right here in this meeting you know what probably happened if I would have been sitting there that day and didn't have this Revelation I would have been thinking of the most complicated difficult spiritual super natural wow moment thing that that could be going on and I would have missed the Simplicity of what it actually was it was actually a man coming and saying amen under this fifth seal this fifth seal these are souls these are these aren't Gentiles these are crying out for vengeance these have to be Jews this is what H what is that that's the seven Thunder amen that's the mystery that have been sealed up explaining what those symbols actually meant and it was happening right there and it was so simple that what they were hearing was one of the seven Thunders they've been hearing it all week signifying that the mighty angel had come down with an open book in his hand and the Seven seal was now open and they're sitting right in the middle of it and he's saying I hope you catch it I hope you see it's going on all the time I would have went home that night without the Revelation said God please show me you got to show me I know I'm missing something the prophet says I can't get it I'm not spiritual listen you don't have to be super spiritual to catch this you need a revelation from God am and it's like Ping that simple not complicated not deep it's not deep how deep is it to say that when brother Brandon when it came time to preach what was sealed up that John couldn't write that God would bring brother Brandon back from the West to reveal what John wasn't allowed to write and it happened to be the explanation of what the symbols were that's not hard that's simple questions and answers on the seals now he's come to Sunday morning that was Saturday night we just read now he's come to Sunday morning he collected all the questions and he's read through all the questions now after he reads through the questions look what he says then also knowing that right among you things are happening I'm just I know I know that you don't see it I'm just positive that you don't see it how does he now know last night he was hoping they were catching it but the night before on Thursday night he says I'll see the questions and I'll be able to see if you're getting it then last night he says I hope you're getting it it's going on all around you then he gets all the questions and he reads through all the questions and he says I know you're not getting [Applause] it praise be to God I'm just positive that you don't see it and you say and listen it's not cuz brother brandham knew all along that they're not going to see it he's hoping all along they see it I'm just waiting for somebody to rise up and say I see it it's going on around you I hope you catch it remember what I told you amen is going on right here he's wanting them to see it hoping that they'll see it expecting them to see it but then now when he comes to Sunday morning he's collected the questions and read the questions and read about deodorant and divorce and cutting hair and dying and whatever else they put on there he realizes they have no clue what's happening this week he doesn't get mad he realizes now it's not time he says I going to go back to this Sunday morning I'm just positive that you don't see it you say brother B that's a hard thing for you to say that I know it is but look let me just say this now I suppose this is just taped for ourselves and so forth but let me say this that you you don't you don't get it see and you're not supposed to get it so don't try to interpret anything don't try to put your interpretation to it you only get further away can you imagine not realizing that all all those things brother B was talking about I hope you see it I hope you catch it something spiritual is going on all the time and if you don't attach it to the preaching of the seven Thunders and you try to figure out what it was you can realize now that you would have been off in a multitude of rabbit chases going down the wrong road that's why he said don't try to interpret it wait for God to reveal it to you cuz once you see it you see it it's not a question mark it's not a guess it's not does it fit or doesn't fit it fits so perfect is like whmo that's it that's why he said don't try to interpret you don't have to try to interpret when God opens your eyes there's no interpretation needed it's self- interpreting it's all right there that's why he said just be humble just be quiet just pray for Revelation don't try to figure it out don't bend your mind to sort this out you don't have to bend your mind it doesn't take a mind bending it doesn't take super intellect it doesn't take that a child can understand what's going on in this week of services doesn't take super duper intelligence all it takes is the revelation that my goodness when he send him back to preach the seals that was the mystery contained in the Thunders that was what John wasn't allowed to write and now brother brenham's preaching it and what does that mean that means the Lord Has Come that means the Seven Seals open that means this is the end time praise God don't try to put your interpretation to it you'll get further away the seventh SE now notice remember the vision of the constellation this is the seventh seal now Charlie uh here you are something going on I told you this week it's been all around you but I wonder if you noticed it I I have so much Sympathy for the saints that were sitting there that week it's been all around you but I wonder if you you notice it remember the constellation of the vision of angels when I left here to go to Arizona you remember what time is it sir do you remember that listen he's in the seventh seal he has already come to the place where he comes to his noes and he says stop go no further he already tells us amen of the vision that he's not allowed when the third the third pool he's not to tell it to nobody and then when it starts it'll be a total secret he's already told you that but then he comes here to this and he said it's been all around you but I wonder if you noticed it remember do you remember the constellation of the vision of angels when I left here do you remember what time is it sir do you remember that I can't tell you what it is but do you remember what time is it s because if you remember that then there's something that's been going on all around you but I want and it has to do with what I preached on what time is it sir and if you remember that then we're here something's going on all around you do you remember what I said praise God notice there was only one great burst of thunder and seven angels appeared is that right he got he the blast got caught up then the seven angels appeared one burst of thunder seven angels appeared and I saw the lamb when he had opened the first seal and I heard as it was a voice of thunder and one of the four Beast said come and see notice notice one Thunder seven messages that's been sealed up and cannot be revealed until the last day at this age see what I mean he's he he can't tell you but he's telling you he can't come right out and say but he's telling you remember those angels remember when when when Jesus he goes back to Luke Revelation 6 remember when Jesus opened the first seal and he heard A Sound of Thunder and then he opened all the other seals in Revelation 6 and and and 81 he says remember that now he said one Thunder what Thunder remember he said a blast went off when he was out in Arizona and shook the whole world and caught him up into the constellation of angels into the Revelation that only they had okay one Thunder seven messages that's been sealed up and cannot be revealed until the last day at this age see what I mean now have you noticed the mysterious part of this week that's what it is I hope you're seeing it friends I hope you're catching it he says something's going on all around you amen I hope you're catching it I hope you're seeing what it is I hope you caught it by now I I'm watching for the questions to see amen it's going on all the time I'm waiting for somebody to rise up and say I see it then he takes you back serves this the time to the Thunders to the seals am me coming back to open the seals and now he's he he's preached the Revelation under each one of those seals he comes down to the seventh seal and he's telling you he says one Thunder Sabino Canyon seven messages that's been sealed up and cannot be revealed till the last day what messages the seven Thunders from Revelation 10 that was sealed up till the last day till the angel said time is no more the end time now it's time to unseal it according to what Daniel was told now he says now you notice now you notice the mysterious part of this week that's what it is that's what it's been it's been not a human being a man it has been the angels of the Lord that's why brother B said this isn't mine this wasn't my mind this wasn't my idea this is not my interpretation he said God sent an angel to the room every day and gave me thus saith the Lord on what to seal it has nothing he said nothing to do with my understanding nothing to do with my intellect this is straight from God straight Revelation that's been hidden in the word amen coming right from God right to you that's what this has been the mystery that he was hoping everybody could catch it's been the preaching of the seals amen and the Seven seal again he says now how did I know the other day last Sunday a week ago when I was preaching on be humble be humble remember God deals in little things I didn't realize what it really was talking about and now I see it it is in such a humble way you think that something like that would be revealed to the Vatican or be put but it comes just like John the Baptist who else came just like John the Baptist Malachi 4 brother bam he's saying it comes it comes just like John the Baptist do you see it it comes just like John the Baptist it comes like the birth of our Lord in a stable what he's talking about he's talking about major prophetic events that almost nobody on Earth knew what was happening and it was in such Simplicity that there was a little woman and her husband back in a stable she delivered and nobody else in town knew it that night and nobody else on Earth knew what was going on except the Magi that saw the star were making their way amen you realize nobody knew what was happening the Angels had to come and say it to Shepherds so Shepherds could go to declare it am mean what was happening the greatest event of all time was taking place where was it taking place in a little stable in Bethlehem out of the way with no Fanfare nobody what was doing it why cuz God he hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same and brother R said you think something like that like what the seven seal the seven Thunders the great Revelation that's waiting till the end of time the opening of the seventh seal you think something like that would be revealed to the Vatican or but it comes just like John the Baptist it comes like the birth of our Lord in a stable glory to God so help me that hour is at hand we're here oh my now do you see it the truth of God's Vision the seven angels bringing me from the West they were coming from the West Coming Back East bringing me here for this message tonight what message the seventh seal amen what are they bring him back for so that you would know the seventh seal is open again in the seventh seal now we are grateful to God for what he has showed us I've been sitting in the room up there for8 days and the message that I have just got through explaining to you many of you here will understand and I promis that there was something going on spiritual all the time that I was sure you were missing it and here's what it is it's the absolute a Vindication of this interpretation of the scriptures being sin of God because before we even went into it I left to go West what are you talking about left to go west something supernatural's been going on all around tell me what's been going on well you have to understand why I went West and when I come back to understand what's been going on Supernatural spiritually all this week I want to read it again I promise that there's something going on spiritual all the time that I was sure you were missing it and here's what it is it's the absolute a Vindication of this interpretation of the scriptures being sent of God because before we even went into it I left to go west and the Lord showed me a vision one day about 10:00 one morning and I came and I explained it here that I had seen it I didn't know what it was it was a constellation of angels well well remember that you'll get it on tape called what time is it sir well now that is exactly what you're seeing now what were you seeing what he preached and what time is it sir amen that's why that's why brother brandham changed the title catch this brother brandham changed the title when he preached it before it was a question is this the sign of the answer is this the sign that's the question and he's asking could it be could this be the end time could those Thunders could that be what it is then brother brandham goes and has the experience out west and now he knows it's the end time he tells you it's the end time he tells you we're here and it's no longer for him a question his question is answered when he changes the name now the question is directed to you what time is it serves now the question is not his question he's got the answer to the question now brother bam he never says is this the sign of the end s he never uses that title again but he very specifically uses it when he first preaches it and doesn't use the title what time is it s he's very specific is this the sign of the end sir that's his question that's what he's wondering that's what he's supposing he gets the answer and he's satisfied that he knows this is the end time but then from then on he changes the title and never uses that title again from now on the question is is this no no what time is it s now the question is yours to answer by Revelation now you've got to answer the question now the question is directed to you not to the prophet anymore he's not confused he's not wondering he's not pursuing anymore he knows that this is the seventh seal this is the time now the question is your question what time is it sir I'm asking you what time is it is it the opening of The Seven seal is it the coming of the Lord is it the revealing of the Mysteries is it the end time oh praise God now the question is ours to answer what time is it sir praise be to God questions and answers he says have the seven Thunders which equal seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet but are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet do I mean are they still mysterious and we still don't know what the Thunders are he says no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about it was the revelation of the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was he makes it so simple they was to reveal the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of the sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh Church age who is William brandham which means but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed praise God and the latery in church age now he ties this together with Malachi 4 we've been through that says he'll do turn two things he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be those divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers Malachi 4 is fulfilled in Revelation 101 to7 in the revealing of the seals he says when those Seven Seals were opened that opened up the entire Bible and again he says the hidden mysteries of Christ was fully revealed and the Seven Seals I made this statement asked this question last time but I'll ask it again if the entire Bible was open in the Seven Seals and the mystery of Christ was fully revealed in the Seven Seals why would we need anybody else to come and reveal anything else right if the hidden mystery of Christ was fully revealed then there's not still a mystery of Christ to reveal if the Bible if the opening of Seven Seals open up the entire Bible then there's no more of the Bible to open up so why would we need another great man or another messenger or another great person or somebody else to come why would we need something else to come before we can go in the Rapture and we need somebody else to fulfill something else it's already [Music] fulfilled if we need somebody else to open something else that means that it wasn't open it's been opened now for us there's still parts that we don't see is that right yes there's still parts that we don't see there's still things I don't understand there's still parts and pieces that I I can't explain to you that I don't know amen but that doesn't mean somebody else has to come because it's already in the message amen everything we need's already been revealed in the message we're just waiting for God to click the Revelation so that we can see what's already laying there we don't need someone else to come we don't need another interpretation and listen I I'll tell you this and and and and and and just take me for what I'm saying and understand me as your brother amen God will use the five-fold ministry to help us keep unlocking this mystery over and over it's his tool it's the tool in his hand for him to speak to his children amen he's not going to take some super duper it's going to be the fivefold ministry worldwide that he's going to anoint to take the word and keep breaking the word till we all come into the unity of Faith till we all come into the stature of a perfect man amen that what's God is the bride going to have a Ministry in the end time he says yes it's a great ministry it's going on all the time it consists of apostle prophets evangelist teachers and pastors what is it that's the ministry of the Bride what is the ministry of the Bride to take this Revelation and keep preaching it and preaching and preaching and God keeps folding it through where through the fivefold ministry that's how God does it amen we're not looking for another Prophet we're not looking for a great Apostle what we're looking to do is keep laboring in this word and praying for Revelation and God keeps giving it Peace by Peace by Peace by piece by piece as we move forward but we don't need another message we need isav to see the message so now we real realized that that Capstone was the headship was The Headstone Christ the intelligence the Revelation the mystery revealed coming to unite with the people on the Earth to bring the revelation of the mystery of gone to our hearts listen it's late but I'm going to keep preaching because it's just in my heart I can't stop if you got to go go if I'm the last one here I'll still be having a good time don't you worry about me cuz I'll still be having fun and I won't let my family leave so they'll have to at least stay but they're going to have to pick up the amens a bit I'm going to go to the quote that we left with last time and I want to preach this last section this last few slides in the contest this is the watch Night Service this is the day after he preaches is this the sign of the ansers says we are your servants and we give ourselves holy to you for 1963 that the power of your spirit might have more preeminence in our life he's praying this is his opening prayer and in in our being help us God forgive us and help us we pray raise up mighty men raise up Mighty Warriors of Faith open this year Lord the hidden Mana that rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of God when we come to this say the rock beneath the rock everybody body there remembers last night's service Junior Jackson's dream the sharp tool the cap coming off the White Rock a mean going out west it had impact on them because he was announcing to them that I'm leaving you and I'm going out west because of these Visions something Great's transpiring so it impact so now in his prayer he's praying in the watch Night Service looking to the coming year and he's saying open this year Lord the hidden Mana the rock beneath the rock what was hidden Mana hidden Mana was the Mana amen that was back in the temple and the holy of holies cuz Moses was told to take a golden uh sensor and to take this golden vessel and take some of the Mana that fell in the Exodus Journey the Mana that they would eat that would dissolve when the sun came up that wouldn't keep from the next day to the next he was told to take it fill it amen in this golden vessel and put it in the holy of holies and it would keep from generation to generation and that became the hidden Mana nobody could see it but the priesthood and when the priesthood goes in the high priest when he went in on the day of atonement he could take some of hidden mana and he could eat that hidden Mana so that was the hidden Mana but brother Brenham now was praying he said Lord open this year Lord that hidden Mana what's hidden mana mana is the word Mana is the word that fell day by day but there was a hidden Mana that nobody could see back in the shikina glory of God back where God dwelt but there was Mana that was hiding in the back heart of God's mind and the holy of holies that nobody could see light had never shined on this before and brother brandom saying God open this year that hidden Mana that mystery in the back part of your mind that rock beneath the rock what was the rock beneath the Rock The White Rock that had nothing written on it the revelation of the seven Thunders the rock beneath the rock that why that we might see the program of God what did he want what are we supposed to see at the opening of the seals what are we supposed to understand at the end time seal we're supposed to understand the program of God amen then he goes in this this is where I want to focus now cap off the pyramids of our life Lord put the Capstone Christ Jesus upon each and every one of us may his great magnificent holy blessing be upon us all he talks about the great Revelation the rock beneath the Rock open it and give it but Lord cap off the Pyramid of our lives and when he says that he's referring right back to of a perfect man those Seven Virtues to the capping of love which is gone and he ends by saying let this Revelation let this Mana let this rock bring us to maturity so that you can cap off our lives that's what this mystery is supposed to do supposed to bring us into the stature of a perfect man to maturity now we come to Revelation 2:17 remember I I titled this a white rock and a white stone the White Rock and the white stone the White Rock was the rock beneath the Rock in junior Jackson's dream but now we're going to look at a white stone say he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the children to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and I will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth save he that receiveth him if you remember brother Gabe mentioned this a few weeks back when he was preaching and he he talking about if you go into the concordance and you look at the different definition they show you that in ancient times in Greek civilization that many times they would pass the verdict of judgment by giving you either a white stone or a black stone the black stone meant you were condemned the white stone meant you were acquitted and that and that happens and so there there's several meanings behind this white stone one you realize little bride you never did it in the first place that's what we realize under the seven seal amen under this capping we go back into the mind of God and realize what predestination really was what a c Gene of God was what a child of God actually is amen what went wrong in the beginning and why we're in this condition and how we've been washed by the bleeding bloody word and brought back into a virgin condition so that you can have true justification not justification that that Luther taught in the church age but true justification you never did it in the first place it's not part of your record praise God Amen so he says now to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it I want us to to focus on this white stone now for for the rest of the time we have here together this morning brother baham goes to the pergan church age which is this section of the Book of Revelation that we just read that scripture he says it also says here that he's going to give the Overcomer a white stone and in not on the stone a new name it's really important which the owner alone knows now the idea of a new name is familiar when Abram was changed to Abraham Sarai to Sarah Jacob to Israel Simon to Peter and Saul to Paul these names either brought about a change or were given because of a change catch this if you overcome in your generation you're going to receive a white stone and in the white stone a new name and whenever he gave a new name it was because he was going to bring a change or because he had already brought a change but the name signified a change amen amen and Abram Sarah and and Saul amen and pet and Simon Peter and and Jacob to Israel every time that he changed the name it was because there was a major change in their life life amen so now he's he's teaching this principle and it was only after Abram and Sarah had their name changed by the Lord that they were made ready to receive the coming son in Jacob's case he had to overcome and then he was called a prince in the case of Simon and Saul when they had received the Lord their change came and today each one of us True Believers has had a change in name we are Christians it is a name common to all of us but one day we will have another change we will of certainty receive a new name it could well be that the name was our true and original name written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world he knows the name but we do not one day at his good pleasure we will know also now I want you to just bear with me as we we work on this thought of a white stone and the white in the white stone but not on it is a new name brother B begins to talk about how the change in the name was because there was a major change either the changing a name brought overcoming power or overcoming brought a change in the name and he and he starts to attach these thoughts together and then he goes on to say that we've already had a name change we're called Christians so that's a title not a name but he calls it a name change so if your title changes that's a name change yes amen and he says now that name could very well be the one that's written in the Lamb's Book of Life we don't know that but he does and someday we all will know now now now I'm not taking away anything brother Benham said because I have no idea what's actually written in the Lamb's Book of Life because I don't know if there's actual paper in heaven and ink and you understand it's a spiritual word I don't understand how it works I don't understand how big the book is I don't even know if there's a physical book or if the book represents something something in the mind of God you understand what I'm saying I'm not trying to discredit anything I'm just telling us we always think carnal and God uses carnal representation to get us to understand something that doesn't mean it's actually the way it is he's trying to get us in an Earthly existence to understand what he's talking about so we could all have names that and I'm sure we will I'm sure we'll call each other something I doubt that I'm going to be number 452 and you're going to be 489 I mean we're going to have a name and God knows what that name is what language it's in I don't know how to spell it I don't know what is the language we're all going to speak I don't know I don't know but one thing I know is every major change comes with a name change and when he changed us from Center to Christian that was a name change so we may have many name changes in our existence might not just be the one at the end we may have many name changes as our title changes now notice this rock what's the name look at that rock and tell me what the revelation of the name is you can't because it's not written on the Rock it's written in the Rock oh let's put our spiritual jackets on this isn't about physical this is about Revelation friends this is not what's written on the outside of the rock to read this is what's inside of the rock how do you read what's inside of the Rock Amen are we going to all get big hammers one day when the stones are hand us and we all go through and break them to see what our name is amen there's something in the Rock and what's in the rock is my identification my identity is sealed inside this Stone amen and nobody can see what it is because it's not on the outside of the stone it's in the stone so even if God hands you a physical Stone today you're not going to be able to look at that stone and read a name and know what you're name is because there's nothing written on the stone was there another White Rock with nothing written on it it was the Revelation that was in the Seven Seals amen the Revelation in the Thunders there was nothing written what was it it was White Rock here's another white stone Only The Rock was massive this one's just a little piece and that little piece doesn't have anything physical written on it but it has your identity sealed inside side of it that's why no man knows the name but he that receiveth it because nobody else can read it amen you could show it to everybody but nobody's going to know what your new name is because only the one who's received it will know the name but they're not going to get it by reading the rock they're going to get it by a spiritual revelation of what's inside the Rock amen praise be to God I'm so tired of carinal I'm so tired of natural I'm ready to drop all that and say God lift me up into the revelation of this word where the reality strikes my soul I wonder sometimes if people get to heaven if they don't get a White Rock if they're going to be disappointed and asked to leave or think they're in the right wrong spot because we made everything so physical yes it's not not on the Rock it's in the Rock when brother bam took that cap off there was nothing written on it it was a sealed veiled mystery here's what brother B says all the way back in 56 the Bible said he that overcometh will I give a white stone in a new name that no one knows but he but he himself don't make any difference what people say you know yourself when you've been brought into the inner Veil now he's attaching this White Rock to you coming into the inner veil with Jesus Christ you're Union with Christ your new birth your baptism of the Holy Ghost he's attaching it to this White Rock which is your identification so don't make any difference what people say you know yourself when you've been brought into the inner Veil no one could tell you any different not because you joined church because you did this or that but something just tells you you've got a stone that's in your heart not a hard Stone a soft one this Stone makes your heart soft instead of hard see how brother bam uses the same analogy of a stone and he makes it your new birth when the Revelation comes into your heart yes sir so don't get fixated there may there may very well be an absolute natural representation and I'll be thrilled to death to get it amen but I believe I've already received my White [Music] Stone by the grace of God in the third seal brother says John said everybody in heaven everybody beneath the Earth everybody heard him where is this this is in this is in uh Revelation chapter 5 when the lamb takes the book amen he starts rejoicing everybody in heaven everything beneath the Earth everything heard him praising God about it John must have found his name on there you know amen well he saw the lamb take the book when the lamb take the book listen this is happening in Vision amen at this point the book is still sealed he hasn't even opened the seals yet that comes in Revelation chapter 6 but brother brandom says John must have found his name on there you know the question is the book wasn't even open yet if it was open was it open to the page where John could look and see and then if he wrote John in there what kind of ink did he use and what kind of language did he write it in yes yes you understand John's in the vision he sees the lamb come forth he's weeping because he knows all Redemption is lost if nobody can take this book now an elder comes and tells him weep not for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and overcome to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and he steps forward a bloody lamb he takes the book they all start rejoicing the Angels pour out the prayers and incense of the Saints amen and John starts shouting and rejoicing and praising God Amen brother B says why he must have found his name on there the question is how did he find his name on there he doesn't take the little book and eat it till you get to Revelations chap 10 when the mighty Angel comes down friends this is just brother Chad you can take it or leave it but I believe it was a spiritual Revelation to John not something he was reading on paper but he was recognizing I'm part of that Redemption my name is on that book and he caught it by Revelation that John's in there and it may not be pronounced John it may not be spelled and John's name wasn't even John like we say John now probably had a Hebrew or Armenian name and it was spelled with characters maybe we don't understand it doesn't matter that doesn't matter that's only for this Earthly existence but we have another identification that's not the name on your birth certificate and that's the C Gene of God that was in the back part of his [Music] mind and John must have looked and found his name in there it wasn't like John took the book out Jesus hand start praise God the first seal he says now watch said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand it Church it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal but just what it is they don't know because it's a white horse rider and it's only to be revealed at the last day when the actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ but to the church notice how my that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands it see what I mean you people I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand it amen what's he just done we're in the first seal the first seal now is what he started preaching the Thunders amen the Mysteries the White Rock that that had been sealed in the back of God's mind and he comes in the first seal and he says listen you've got to understand something and to understand that you've got to catch a revelation and you need a change like Abram and Sarah needed a change and that change is going to be a prophet pronouncing to you your true identity I'm not going to call you church anymore this isn't church church ages is done I'm going to call you bride this is a transition time this is the opening of the seals amen the seals listen he says now when the seals actually broke that means there's no future actually breaking of the seal the Seal's actually broke in reality who's it broke to not the Christ he knew what it was all along it's broke to the church he says Church oh my that just makes me tremble I hope the church truly understands it see as Church you're not going to understand it you can't get this revelation this church just like Abram couldn't receive the son and Sarah couldn't receive the son Church can't receive this revelation of the seven Thunders the mystery it's going to take a change in your identification a change in your name and you're going to have to go from church to bride so that you'll understand it praise be to God I could preach this every day of my life and never get tired of it this is the message this is who we are this is what awaken the bride this is the bride's Revival this is what's giving her rapturing faith in the ability to overcome all the lies that the devil's been spewing for thousands of years it's all under this Revelation amen he says in Feast of trumpets notice Revelation 101:7 all the Mysteries are to be revealed to the bride by who the messenger of the leodan church Hallelujah come back again Revel notice Revelation 10 1-7 all the Mysteries are to be revealed not to the church to the bride you're going to have to have a name change by who not somebody coming in the future not by another messenger not by another great Minister by the messenger of the leodan church which happens to be William brandham has anybody got a revised version of Bible if you have you'll notice where said the an angel It's a parentheses that says the eagle because this is the eagle age anointing uhhuh the messenger to the leian church see Revelation 10 1-7 what's Revelation 101:7 the mighty angel coming down the loud voice like a line seven Thunders uttering voice amen time shall be no more the mystery of God shall be finished that's Revelation 101:7 that's the seven seal that's the end time seal that's what the leoan church age messenger reveals to who the bride you got to move from church to bride he goes and Christ is the mystery of God but his mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride that's the only one can see it if you're Church you can't see it it's only reveal to his bride there has to come another identification you have to catch a revelation of who you are in relationship to Jesus Christ before you can catch this Revelation but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride this is why I absolutely cannot apologize for somebody not being able to understand the message I can't help it amen it's only for his bride there's nothing we can do about it there's nothing we can do to change it this Revelation is is a private Revelation only for his bride so there must come a personal revelation of who we are so that we can receive this Revelation the message once more he says if the church can overcome she will stop saying listen if the church can overcome she will stop saying I'm a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian we she can overcome her Creeds and the world that's drawing her there she'll come back to the bride of Christ misses Jesus Christ what is that that's a new name we stop saying Presbyterian Baptist Pentecostal Catholic we'll stop saying all of that we'll even stop saying our specific version of the message but we'll come back to one identification and that identification is Mrs Jesus Christ that has to be who I am I'm not Mrs I'm I'm not this kind of believer or this kind of believer following this kind of Doctrine forget all of that I don't want that title all of that title will denote something that will keep me down I need a title that'll Lift Me Above everything that a human being can do and I need the title of Bride and more specifically I need to drop Methodist Baptist this persuasion that flavor and I need to come back to being mrss Jesus Christ you can say you can even think isn't that presumptuous well how presumptuous was it when Paul said I'm the light to the Gentiles how presumptuous would it been for the Virgin Mary to say I'm the Fulfillment of Isaiah 7 how presumptuous was it for brother brandom to believe he was Malachi 4 how presumptuous was it for Jesus Christ to believe he was the son of man the Son of God listen you can think what you want to think but when it's a revelation to you you can't help it it's who you are it's your identification it's the reality of your life it's not a put on it's not a make belief It's Not sewing titles over my shirt so I look like I'm some it's the reality that is in the depths of my heart that God through this message has unlocked something to me he has shown me amen before you see white stones laying around they're just rocks amen amen they don't have anything on them they they're they're not anything specific they don't indicate what's on on the inside but one day God will hand you when you overcome denominationalism when you overcome yourself in your own thinking and die out the self he'll hand you a white stone and in that white stone is a new name which identifies who you really are and no man knows that name but he that receiveth the stone am it's a personal revelation to you not because you attend a certain church or you're born in a certain family or you sit in a certain Pew that has nothing to do with it you can't get it you can't catch it like you catch the flu you can't get it through osmosis you have to get it by a divine revelation where God personally hands you something that gives you a new identity and by Revelation you know what this Revelation contains it's who I am he says in Christ's mystery of God revealed praise God praise God Christ in you makes him the center of the life of the Revelation Christ life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do what's he trying to do Under the seven seal under the end time it's the mystery of God is going to be finished God's revealing his great mystery and guess what you're part of it that's exactly what the prophet tells us amen listen I'm going to find this quote here I want to read it to you before we move on he says and this is again in Christ mystery of God revealed he is the first fruits of the Resurrection is that right then what is he he is the head of the body which is his church bride then the bride body must follow the head for it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery so when he says under the seven seal the mystery of God will be revealed brother comes and preaches the seven seal and he titles it Christ is the mystery of God revealed well Christ is Mr and M Jesus Christ combined together bridegroom tree bride tree male and female amen reflecting one another United together in a holy Union and Christ is the mystery of God revealed that's why brother Brenham said for the bride body must follow the head for it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery for you to be part of that mystery you better get one of those white stones that has something locked inside yeah that nobody can tell amen only he who receives it again this is just your brother Chad this is just me I'll say like brother alist said this is just my excitement he said it so nice that that Great White Rock that was under the pyramid that was the mystery that was contained in this Bible it was the mystery of God it was one desire one goal one thing he wanted to achieve and every character in The Bible's been typing it out amen every character every story's been W trying to show you what the unwritten part is all about the mystery that's the White Rock under the rock but what is the white stone to me the white stone is just a part of the White Rock and brother bandham said what are the Believers the names on the the words on the book are the Believers what is this she is part of the mystery you're part of the mystery and what is that White Rock to me this is just to me to me in my Revelation what God has done in my life that rock is my part of that great big mystery in the Bible that's my little portion C genene of God portion of God his purpose in my life to manifest in this day and locked inside that Revelation is my true identity who I really am from the Lamb's Book of Life said the bride body must follow the head for it's part of the resurrection and part of the mystery it's impossible for it not to go it's part of God's mystery that's my portion of that great big rock one of the one little chunk off of that is my portion and my personal revelation of who I am in Christ oh I got to finish this quote he said Christ and you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing what is the new birth then remember in the inner Veil brother Brenham made it part of going in behind the veil brother said what what what is he trying to do what is the new birth then he said well brother Brandon what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen not you joined a church you shook hand you done something different you set a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon what Christ Christ and me that's the mystery that Paul was a steward over now we go back to this famous scripture in Matthew 16 Jesus asking his disciples who do who do men say that I am and they had answers for who men said that he was but he comes to a real good question who do you say that I am said to him but who say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him bless out there Simon bar Jonah this is his name Simon bar Jonah Simon bar means son of Jonah the word Simon means hearer Peter had been hearing the word since he was a child amen he had been hearing his father talk about the Messiah coming he went to synagogue and heard it preached about he was a hearer yes prise God some of you young people in here you're a hearer but you need a name change amen amen nothing wrong with being a hearer but it's got to go further than a hearer amen he says he said blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah amen you're a hearer you're the son of Jonah for Flesh and Blood have not revealed unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter what did he do he just changed his identification he said thou are Simon barjon he called him by his official birth name who he was and who his father he gave him his Earthly identification but now after receiving the Revelation he says no Flesh and Blood told you this but my Father which is heaven because you can receive Revelation from the father it means you're due a new identity and you're now Peter you know what Peter means Peter means a stone what is a stone it's a revelation Peter caught a revelation of Jesus Christ revealed personally to him and it changed his identification he's no longer here but now he's got the revelation of what he's been hearing all of his life this is the Messiah he heard about Messiah he heard about Messiah coming he longed to see the Messiah but in this in this moment of time when this Revelation strikes his soul now he realized I'm looking at what I've been hearing all my life it's standing before my eyes and now he's a stone he's got a confession he confessed his Revelation Stone brother B is a two ways there a confession and a revelation but you have to have a revelation to have a confession I also say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall never Prevail against it what's the foundation stone of the church a personal revelation of who Jesus Christ is to you and it'll change your identification ation amen Peter we just been through this means a rock or a stone it originally Simon who was hearer some of us need to move from being a hearer of the message till we get that Revelation ourselves and we get our own Stone the anointed ones at the end time so these trees the True Vine the True Vine and false Vine you've heard me preach on that sense from years ago how they've growed up together brought them in individuals and showed that from Cain and Abel the two vines that met at an altar both of them religious both of them anointed both of them Desiring life and worshiping the same God this is what we heard Wednesday night brother Emanuel and one was rejected and the other received and the only way that the one was received could have done anything different from his brother it was revealed to him for the Bible said by faith Hebrews 11th chapter by faith Abel offered on God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain which God testifying that he was righteous Jesus said the spiritual revelation of who he was who does man say I the son of man am he said Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God blessed out there Simon Simon son of Jonas Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it Upon This Rock I'll build my Church the true Revel ation of the word there is the true vine again what identifies the True Vine amen when they can receive the revelation of the true word for the day that they're living in who Christ is today who the Messiah is now and where he is now not where he was amen they all in this day knew where he was he was in Moses he was in The Exodus Journey he was he was in Egypt doing signs and wonders they knew he was in Samuel and they knew he was in the prophets they knew he was in David they knew he was there but what Peter caught was where he was right now who this man is this Revelation this day's word made manifest what do we need today amen we need a revelation of the word today who Jesus Christ is today where he is today have we caught the opening of The Seven seal the revealing of the Mysteries the coming of the Lord the mighty Angel who could be none other than Christ himself coming with an open book in his hand to what to reveal the hidden Mana that was in the back part of God's mind so that you would have strength to find your identification so he can hand you one piece of that Revelation hallelujah amen and that piece of the Revelation would contain your true identity from the Lamb's Book of Life amen PR amen praise God said oh God let me have the stone above anything else I need this Stone I need this personal revelation of who I really am more than I need to know anything else I need to know who I am in you and what part I have do I have part in this Great White Rock that mystery that was contained in the word am I part of it or not part of it that's the rock we need Amen in that Revelation is your identification has your new name has your identity from the Lamb's Book of Life how what what what personal pronunciation you may have in the Millennium I don't know but one thing's for sure your identification on the Lamb's Book of Life is bride Mrs Jesus Christ that's the title that you're registered under now he goes on and says Able by faith again in Christ is the mystery it goes right by them and they don't recognize it till it's gone it only picks up the predestinated seed that God predestinated before the foundation of the Earth the same thing came through in the days of Noah same thing came through in the days of Moses Days of Elijah days of the prophets days of Jesus on down through to this very hour the pregnated person with the seed of God the word in there manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of God that the word and the word alone manifest itself in this person The Prisoner to an IND individual not say my church now my church has nothing to do with it Hey listen now we're not talking about the Big White Rock in the pyramid anymore now we're getting down to the personal White Rock the Revelation that contains your identity listen you can look at that Big White Rock and you can listen you can be taught to repeat like a parrot and say you got the Revelation I don't say that to me mean or judgmental but just because you can repeat what you heard preach over a pull pit doesn't mean you got the Revelation amen but when that Revelation strikes you it strikes you personal it gives you your identification it's one it's part of that gr that's a huge revelation of Jesus Christ it's Christ is the mystery of God revealed but guess what to the bride they each have a part of the mystery they are part of the mystery and they each get a white Ro a white stone part of that Revelation has to do with you and you you and you and you and in that Revelation is your true identification from before the foundation of the world who you really are to me that's part of the significance of the seals it's so the bride can know her true identity absolutely amen so she can rise so she can rise above the confusion in the world not say my church my church has nothing to to do with it it's an individual one person all hell is against this teaching all hell is against this truth but it is the truth Jesus never said now Peter you and John and all the rest of the people you've got the Revelation now the whole church is saved no it was to him personally I say unto thee thee not them to thee Thou Art Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the word Peter means stone stone means the confessed one or the separated one Upon A Certain Stone Upon A Certain thing see I called out the church called out upon this this Stone upon this Revelation Flesh and Blood never revealed it to you but upon this Revelation called out group I'll build my church in them and all the gates of hell will never be able to withstand it listen why won't the Gates of Hell be able to withstand it oh we got a good lesson with Alistair was here amen why because the Gates of Hell have been defeating the people people of God by propagating lies what was prevailing the LIE the hybridizing word what won in the Garden of Eden what caused Satan to win the battle is because he lied to Eve and she took the LIE what happened in every denomination they accepted the LIE what happened in every failure down through the church I mean down through time it was the LIE amen how has the kingdom of Satan been overcoming the Believers it's because they propagate their lies their false Notions they're false doctrines they're false teachings humanism mixed with the things of God hybridized word has been bringing the defeat of God's elect all through time but in the end time God has taken the veil off the entire Bible he's restored all the loose s all the doctrines that had gotten lost he brought all the truth back and then he peeled the veil off the whole thing and said it has everything to do with Christ in you the hope of glory and now God is going to finish the work by finishing it in you by giving you the true revelation of the true word so the Gates of Hell have no chance of defeating you because he can't lie to you because you know the [Applause] truth he can only defeat You by a lie he can't grab you and twist you in a knot and throw he can't do anything physically to you he can only defeat You by a lie and God has taken the veil he's revealed the entire word amen amen and upon this Revelation praise God to an individual I will build my church in them and the Gates of Hell shall never Prevail over them amen why because anybody who brings an idea you say that's not what the prophet said that's not what the Bible says that's not in the word that's different than the word amen I reject it what have you just done the Gates of Hell could not Prevail against you why cuz you stood behind the wall of the reveal word for this day what Eve failed to do in the beginning this bride's not going to fail she's predestinated not to fail she'll stick with thus sayith the Lord this is what a prophet brought this is the revelation of the word this is the Divine the perfect interpretation with Divine Vindication I don't need your IDE or slam I'll stay right here praise be to God and maybe you're right somebody comes with another idea Hey listen maybe you're right but until he reveals it to me I'm not leaving this wall you may be right that may be true what you're preaching may be dead on Amen but I'm not going to follow you I'm going to follow the word and until he reveals the same thing to me I'm staying put amen amen there's nothing wrong with that when brother brenon preached the seals he says you're not getting it you're not supposed to get it he said don't try to interpret it if God wants you to know anything he'll reveal it to you don't follow I don't care who it is I don't care how sound they are How doctrinally Sound how much how long they've been in the message and how they can tie everything together don't you dare follow a man you follow the word and that man and especially if he's a true minister of God he may be teaching you exactly what's in the word but you stay behind the safety of the Revelation God's given you until God opens your eyes to see it amen don't discount it it may be true but don't chase it either until God reveals it to you we'll find ourselves derailed somewhere upon this Revelation called out group I'll build my church in them and the Gates of Hell will not be able to withand it listen brother B says she'll be a super Church a super race sometimes we get the wrong idea and somehow all of a sudden we become super powerful and we become superheroes and we just go and do this and denounce that and call this and listen it's never our power it's always his power in us to be a super church is to be the one who stays with the word and who says I don't really know that sounds interesting but this is all I know is what the prophet brought so I'll stay here humility surrender submission is a super church is a super race because that's where the woman failed every time in the Bible through surrender submission and humility sometimes we get the wrong idea of what the bride's supposed to be in the end time she's supposed to be a vessel completely surrendered to the will of God and if God does anything through her to be his strength manifesting through her not hers he goes on and says not one hair of your head Shall Perish you are mine I'll raise you up in the last day give unto him eternal life and raise him up at the last days there it is the Revelation not them but him an individual not a group an individual all hell is against it what is all hell against all hell is against you getting a white stone with your true name in it amen all hell is against you getting your own personal revelation of who you are in this mystery of the end time and who you were before the foundation of the world and what's your purpose here and you surrendering to that and finding out that your M Jesus Christ individually not a group individually all hell is against that teaching praise God now I want to come and finish with this one thought remember that several I don't remember how long ago months ago I don't know maybe a year ago maybe more we talked about Sarah and Abraham how there was a prophecy in Abraham's life that he shall have a son and that son shall be the promise shall be in that son and that son shall be Isaac and you remember how that that there was some doubt on Sarah's part and she she came up with the scheme of Hagar and and in the legal way and and Justified the actions that come up with than ishmail yes we found when we looked at when we looked back at that the the the scripture says in Hebrews 11 that Abraham grew stronger in the faith as time went on he didn't grow weaker he was perfect in faith he believed what God told him and it was imputed unto him for righteousness he didn't always understand it but he believed it the problem then wasn't in Abraham anymore the problem was in Sarah because she didn't believe and it wasn't that she didn't believe the promise she wasn't struggling to believe that Abraham would have a son and that what God Said was true the part she was struggling with was her part in the prophecy that's why she could distract uh uh separate herself from the prophecy and said here take my handmade and there's a legal way which which we can bring you seed maybe God will do it this way amen and what what the reason it was off the word is because Sarah wasn't part of it it was wrong so when it comes down to it Abraham was believing Abraham was believing but now in the in the plains of memmory when God comes in flesh which denotes the end time when God comes in flesh and discerns the thoughts behind it that's exactly what God did in this generation when he came through a prophetic Ministry of William brand and turned his back to the crowd and discerned the thoughts amen behind him he showing that we're at the same time this is the same marker now Abraham and Sarah get a new name new identification they're going to get new bodies amen what it means they're going to be resurrected back to their condition in their early marriage we're going back to the church we were at Pentecost the words come back the brides come back am but yet Sarah now with a restored identity and a restored body amen coming back she's still not conceiving amen the listen the problem's not in Abraham the problem's not with God the problems with Sarah look at what Hebrew says through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised this was all hinging on Sarah receiving Faith Abraham's seed was restored his youthfulness restored her youth was restored they went back to the condition they were when he was a young man she was a young woman he was viral in the beginning he was able to produce he produced an ishmail amen and it was her who could never conceive amen now she's turned back young she's got a young body he's turned back into potency again amen they they've got all that it takes now now God doesn't have to work on Abraham anymore to fulfill the promise now he's got to do something to Sarah's Faith now it's hinged on Sarah's Faith because Sarah is part of Abraham so that makes her part of the prophecy meaning she's part of the word she's part of the mystery and because she's part of the mystery she has to have faith too not just Abraham's Faith she must believe and when that when her faith comes it says here in Hebrews through faith also Sarah herself receive strength not to be made young to conceive seed what do we need we need a revelation of our part of the mystery Genesis 21 and the Lord visited Sarah listen there before this there was seven times that he visited Abraham Vis Abraham changed his name to Abraham he visited him seven times the seventh time was the plains of memory because in the seventh age God would come in flesh and discern the thoughts behind him amen and we discern Sarah and now the serment would work on her and and she's the bride and now the all of this is transpiring but but he promised Abraham that I will visit you again in the appointed time in the appointed season I'll visit you you again but you read through your Bible there's never a time that we find God coming and visiting Abraham again the next visitation is this one in Genesis 21 when the Lord visited Sarah what did Sarah need Sarah needed a personal revelation of her part of the mystery before it was Abraham Abraham Abraham Abraham she was no doubt hearing what God told Abraham hearing the prophecy through Abraham and Abraham no doubt told her but until she came in contact with a living God herself in a private visitation listen there's no record of what happened and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoke for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a son in his old age what happened in this meeting I don't know what happened in this meeting it was Private there's nothing written about it but the Lord visited Sarah and then we pick it up in Hebrews and Sarah herself by faith Sarah herself receiv received strength God has done everything he needs to do in the end time he has sent a prophet he sent his word he's revealed The Mystery of the seven Thunders he's took the cap off of it he's revealed the unwritten word he's changed your name to bride he's told your identification as Mrs Jesus Christ but you know what we need we need an individual meeting in private with a living God who will come down and confirm you're part of this mystery you're part of Christ this message has to do with you you're part of that White Rock inside the Rock amen and here's your portion of white stone and in this stone is your identification revelation of who you are in Christ amen seed Gene of God revelation of who you've always been who you're always meant to be and in this Revelation is your identification what did the seven Thunders come to do to give Grace for rapturing Faith the seven Thunders the revealing of the seven Thunders the opening of The Seven seal came so that you and I could have faith to change these bodies you know what we need we need that White Rock that white stone we need that Revelation and we need it to give through faith give us strength to conceive on this word in wisdom vers Faith said Jesus noted by faith in the revelation of God's word in his own predestinated life Glory I hope that soaks Plumb to your heart Jesus knew who he was Satan was wondering he knowed that he was a predestinated creature of God and that God himself was manifesting in him it wasn't him doing the works it was the father that dwelt in him listen Satan was wondering Satan wasn't so sure who this was he was meeting in the wilderness but Jesus knew who he was and because Jesus knew who he was Satan could not overpower him in the Temptation in the wilderness why because he knew who he was how did he know who he was he just had a personal encounter with a living God at Jordan am and the Holy Ghost came upon him and he knew who he was this is my beloved Son and whom I'm well pleased now he goes from there he goes straight to Jordan and he goes straight to the Wilderness in the wilderness the Devil comes to the devil's wondering could this be that son could this be Messiah but Jesus wasn't wondering he knew who he was and because he knew who he was Satan couldn't defeat him with the Temptation Jesus knew it by experience he knowed it by Revelation he know that he was that Son of God that was to come into the world he knowed his standing he knowed he was born in this world for that purpose and that's the reason the word of God could work through him because he knows what he was you realize the power of a personal revelation of who you are in Christ it can't be group Revelation because in group Revelation won't work in your private Temptation being part of the truth in a group won't work when the Temptation comes to you when you're alone when the Mind battle comes to you when the Temptation isolates you in the wilderness and you're all by yourself it's going to take more than just I'm part of the Bride I'm one no it's not that you have to have a white Rock placed in your your hand carry it in your pocket all the time so that if you ever get confused and beat up and beat down and wondering what's upside and down you can take out that right Rock and in that rock is your identification say no Satan I don't need your lie I don't need your Temptation I'm a Child of [Music] God Don't Throw That Rock down there's nothing written on it why because it's written in the table of your heart who you really are the Revelation comes to the inner chamber keep it in your pocket friend the White Rock and you can show it to everybody and they have no idea what it means cuz nobody else knows the name that's in the Rock except he who's received the rock it's a private revelation of who you are in Christ 1 Peter 26 and 7 wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion in a Chief Cornerstone elect precious he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago God made flesh was the word made flesh that bled and died for us he was the Cornerstone that the church has built on but he's also the cap in off at the end time the Cornerstone the head of the corner the the the Cornerstone has become the head of the corner he's become the Capstone to cap off his bride and we can quote things and say things and and repeat things but what's going to give us the victory that Jesus had is when we have the revelation of who we are like Jesus said there's been a there's been a tremendous Revelation laying in this Bible that's been given to us in the end time the veil's been taken away it was sealed up with Seven Seals wrapped around it but they've been peeled off and it's been opened up and now we see Christ in every verse and every line and every character amen amen that's great but what I need I need to overcome leod deia and I need from God to give me a White Rock and in that rock I need my name the same name that's written in the Lamb's Book of Life mrss Jesus Christ oh I thank God I don't know about you but if I feel around in my heart I can feel that rock has God given you a White Rock with your name in it has God given you a revelation listen friends if there's if you're in doubt if you don't know just ask him just say God I need a revelation I need you to Quicken this to me I can see it I can identify with it I can recognize that some of these these things are true and I I have no objection to brother Brandon being a prophet I have no objection to the truth but I keep failing in my Wilderness Temptation I keep falling I can't I seem to have no strength to stand God I need you to give me what Jesus had when he went to the Wilderness I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost I need a meeting I need what Sarah had when she received strength to conceive seed I need a my Genesis 21 encounter I need Lord you to come to me and the Lord visited Sarah and he did unto her as he had promised God come to me and do unto me as you has promised what's he looking for is and he's not looking for accolades and Mar and he's looking for a surrender he's looking for somebody who'll just say I'm tired of my way tired of my thinking I'm tired of sitting on the fence I'm tired of playing around with the world I'm tired of trying to have two worlds at the same time I'm tired of it what I want is to dive into this White Rock and get lost in this Revelation and have him drop in my hand a white stone with the identification of who I am listen if he reveals to you who you are it'll change your whole life am amen it's not a church walk churches try Reformation we try to conform people and we all have a standard and we all live by the standard we all do the same thing listen that's not going to work so well I mean that may only work when you're around people or that only may work if you're embarrassed about getting caught doing something wrong but that's not going to work on the back side of the desert when he whispers in your ear alone yes it's going to take something more than that it's going to take a direct Revelation from the father of who Jesus Christ is today and who I am as part of that mystery Lord give us the white stone that has in it our new name amen I need to know brother BR said when he come to this last service he preached communion he said it was a wonderful day when I realized I wasn't the son of Charles and Ella brandham but I was a Son of God what did he get he got a White Rock with his name in it he knew who he really was hey what a glorious day for us to realize this flesh stuff has nothing to do with it this is temporal to serve a purpose that God has it'll one day be all change some of it trips me up some of it blesses me but overall it's a handicap but praise God that's not what I'm looking at he's given me something else in my heart a true identification when he says I'll no longer call I'll call you church I'll call you bride I say he's talking to me when he says when you leave these names and you leave these titles of churches and you come back to being the Bride of Jesus Christ you'll be Mrs Jesus Christ and something in me says that's me mama that's me he's talking about I'm part of that I was in the back part of your mind I'm part of the White Rock I'm part of the mystery of God and he's given me a little portion of that Revelation so that I know my name is on the Lamb's Book of Life oh we've seen the seals open we've seen the preach of the Thunders we've seen him come and do what he promised to do in the end time but you know what John got out of that when John saw him take the book John realized I must John must have saw his name in that that's what he started dancing and shouting it wasn't just because the lamb took the book but brother brandham gives us a little insight it wasn't just because the lamb took the book but it's because he saw his name in the book that he was rejoicing when the lamb took the book you know it'll cause you to be thrilled at preaching about the Seven Seals about the Thunders about the opening of the word about the coming forth of the Bride you know what'll thrill your heart not to say oh God sent a prophet that was wonderful and now we all know the truth of the Bible what will thrill you beyond sitting in your seat and being able to contain yourself is when you recognize he's talking about me when he says bride that's me when he says wife that's me when he says Mrs Jesus Christ that's me that's when you can't hold it in any longer friends when you recognize he's talking about me amen praise God that comes by Revelation say God grant us your Revelation amen let's all stand together oh thank you Lord Jesus musicians if you'll come and brother Ben let's just pray oh Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day we live in God the world is wicked but I don't care crime is off the chart corruption is in every facet of the government the economy is failing and I don't care Oh Troublesome times are coming winds are blowing Wars are all over and natural disasters are occurring but I don't care I would do it all over again to have this Revelation in my heart I would stand in this day if you let me pick I say put me here in the very end of the last moment so that I could have a heart to receive these messages God I'm so thankful to be here so thankful God that you predestinated me you chose me before the foundation of the world you give me eyes to see God I pray for my brothers and sisters Lord May each one have their Genesis 21 meeting with you God I pray you'd come to each one of your seed Lord may they open themselves be and may you come inside and hand them a little Stone a personal revelation that's just for them where you say to them you're my pride it's you that I've come for in the end time it's you that I want to unite with it's you who can bear the title Mrs Jesus Christ amen Lord let it come to my brothers and sisters now Lord God I pray that you'd fill them with the Holy Ghost Quicken the seed on the inside give them the revelation of their identification may they look into the opening of the seals may they recognize the the sound of your voice as a lion roaring and recognize it as a call a lion a king calling for his Queen to come to his side Lord may they not just hear Queen but may they hear their name and the Roaring of The Lion and the sounding of the Thunders in the revealing of the Mysteries may you call their name and bring them to your side oh we love you and we thank you for the word God I can't thank you enough Lord everything we go through in life and endure it's nothing compared to this the hardships the trials the difficulties it's nothing compared to the great love that you put in our heart the great Revelation that you've granted to us Lord as unworthy creatures to be able to identify ourselves with another identity one that goes previous to our Earthly existence the one that goes all the way back to your mind God we truly are the most privileged human beings that have ever been on this Earth and we're so grateful Lord for what you've given us in this day God help us to surrender more that you might have a greater preeminence in US fill us with your spirit use us anoint us for the work help us to surrender more let your word live in each of us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all thank you for bearing with me and hanging on but oh I love this message I love it I said God let me I you know I get so ashamed that I get distracted with other things I get so disappointed in myself that I let life take my attention and some of that's inevitable you can't help you're put here to live you're put here to work you're put here to have families but oh God may I never lose sight of this this is the premium this is the one number one this is everything to me help me God to never lose sight in the trials and in the pain and in the difficulty even in the pleasures of life let me never never never lose sight of this for this is everything to us friends may God bless you we love you all and thank God for you may the word of God fill you change you anoint you open your eyes may the word of God accomplish it's sent out it will not return void the word that was preached there is going to accomplish something in somebody's life
