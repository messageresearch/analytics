read well-core terrible air so that I don't go so fast but I know it mitten rub you because this is sunday-school book is escuela miracle how many her to learn here jr. starting with verse 16 verses he says Romans 8:16 spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God el espíritu Miss mulattos demonio and Westra spiritu que somos a hos adios SP that again I'm alone oh
