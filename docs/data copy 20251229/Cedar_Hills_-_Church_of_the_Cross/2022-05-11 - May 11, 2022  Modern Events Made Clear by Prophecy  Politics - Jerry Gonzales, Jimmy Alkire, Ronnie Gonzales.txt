praise the lord jesus jeremiah 1 12. everybody got it it's good to hear those bibles turn amen then said the lord unto me thou has well seen for i will hasten my word to perform it let us pray and may your children be able to catch what you're trying to tell them tonight and maybe you speaking through us as we surrender ourselves to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray all this yeah one of the things that was said last week is [Music] fundamental amen many believe today that the bible has been interpreted so much and there's so many translations that you can't depend on but god's word he says here he's watching over it he's he's he's hastening it and you look up the word haste and it means it literally means he's trying he wants it to come to pass so bad he would love to fulfill it before its time but we know that in his time it will all be fulfilled if he hastens his word he's watching over his words how would he leave us with the bible that we could not depend on the heart we don't have a god big enough to keep his words amen what we're going to do is we're going to do a little review and i'm going to start with with brother ronnie here last week he spoke of the pilgrims that came over on the mayflower and i asked brother ronnie brother brother what was the main motive or reason why they crossed the ocean to a land they knew nothing about and landed on what was the main motive jimmy they uh they did it so they could worship god to to the dictates of their heart amen how many want to worship god according to the dictates of your heart uh what were they fleeing from brother ronnie is capable of running you know during that time they had a lot of persecution religious persecution from the from the roman church so they left there to come here because of the persecution yes sir so then you talked about the bill of rights and what an amendment was an amendment is a it's an adjustment or it's an improvement amen you have your main constitution is a constitutional principle and our pilgrim forefathers had these amendments and the whole purpose of these amendments was to protect what brother tom brother tommy that's a good one brother ronnie amano ronnie what was the main motive now of these amendments it was to to protect the rights of these people amen you know as just a real quick scripture there uh let's turn into psalms 29 3. and it says the voice of the lord is upon the waters amen the god of glory thundereth the lord is upon many waters amen verse 4 says the voice of the lord is powerful the voice of the lord is full of majesty now as you know as brother jimmy said we let you know last week we spoke on the first amendment you know again that this for this first amendment it's the major one that is is under attack and it's again it's a freedom of speech is under the first amendment the freedom of press the freedom of religion the right to petition and the right for a peaceful assembly pacifica you know on april 25th of of this year 2022 elon musk purchased twitter for 44 billion dollars elon musk you know how many of you are kept up with the news on that got a few hands up there so so so he uh the reason why he purchased this this uh twitter twitter according to what he has said is because he saw how all these uh how these tech giants how they have control of what the people say they can censor they can censor the people they can block whatever they wanted i had a couple of customers that did an experiment and they what they did is they put out certain stuff on their accounts just to see what would happen and sure enough their accounts got blocked you know but why a lot of these tech giants they they they swayed or influenced the election a certain way estos and if they can control what the people put on there they can they can uh put make people's mind uh put in their minds to go for or against certain people now his his uh reason that if he sticks to it it's for him for the people to have a platform for to freely express themselves so the thing that captures my attention is this right here after he purchased this so people could have free speech the government puts out what is known as the disinformation board to have he he purchased this so people can have the free speech expression so but what the government is doing now if you put out a certain information that is true now the government can come in here and say well whatever such and such person put posted is is false it's false information but you know the crazy the the sorry the the thing for me that that stands out the most is this isn't something that's new you know there there was something that was it back in the in the early 19th century they had what was called the ministry of truth and again remember this is your first amendment that is under attack so we might not think that that this is something important because right now we're at liberty to be able to do it now now let somebody come and take away your liberty to be able to freely express yourself now it becomes a problem no if you can't if we can't come over here and preach the word how are we going to be able to come and assemble if we can't have if we can assemble how we can have a freedom of religion so so all of this is this all of our amendments are under attack but this one in particular has the most significance for the believer because speech is power to be able to speak carries a lot of influence speeches to be able to persuade somebody to be able to compel someone to be able to convert someone convinced to be able to bind or to be able to lose atar or our speech or our words so we see how important speech the most important is the expression how are we going to be able to receive life if we don't hear a voice now brother branham here in the message of the true easter seal the mano branham mensah he says and the voice of god hushed by greed and jealousy it's been that way in the church ever since iglesia trying to hush the true voice of god down through the ages he's kept his voice alive before the people okay so now so so we know by by the word of god that there is two vines and these two vines they don't just go [Music] they go parallel but not just go like this right now they intertwined why is it that they want us to to they want to stop the voice but for many the voice can be silenced but since they can't silence the voice your voice they'll do the best sin will do the best he can to be able to hybrid brother branham the wonder domino at the same time brother branham was baptizing in the ohio river where the angel the lord met him at that same time hitler hitler was was reigning hitler estaba now that's in 1933 hitler was before that but the the point i'm trying to get to is this uh and the propaganda that he was using and information information so and not only did he use those but he also used the radio and the film technology okay but brother ronnie that was in 1933 okay wait a minute now now don't we see these big giant companies like disney for example disney and how they're pushing their certain agendas pushing certain uh things to to our children they're pushing agendas and and they're infecting the the mind of the kids what they're trying to do they're trying to confuse the kids at four years old oh it's okay if you wanna if the little boy wants to be a girl it's okay if the little if the little girl wants to be a boy it's fine if the man wants to be a woman all they're doing is creating a modern day tower of babel it's a bunch of confusion now now that's why we as as parents we need to do the best we can to watch our children and and and uh and make sure they're watching the correct things or not watching that stuff topics for party propaganda included this was hitler now what hitler would use he would use anti-semitism anti-semitism is is was towards the jews but in a nutshell it's racism now it was attacks on christian churches and after the start of the second world war what they were doing was attempting to shape the morale of the people [Music] tell me that's not exactly what's going on today as they're trying to shape the morale of the small generation the of of everyone they're trying to shape these our kids not only our kids but with adults also you know and um so so one of the things that that that hitler would use well let's go says give sabah hitler so he had what uh a minister of truth is what they called him and this minister they had a ministry and a minister of truth so so with this minister of truth what tell hitler luckily he told hitler i've often wondered how is it that all these soldiers would willingly do kill all these people [Music] has anybody ever wondered that like man like they're killing innocent people so this man by the name of joseph gobels joseph he was hitler's minister of truth the hitler so he what this man would do is is watch this brother he told hitler change your tactics because he ha hitler be more expressive use facial expressions use your hands to be able to sway and to win the people over us and as i as i read that on the way to work the holy spirit comes and he says no wonder brother tommy would always say when a minister preaches i watch everything the twinkling of his nose the twinkling of his mouth his facial expressions his movements i watch because we have to watch where this anointing is coming from so this so this and it is also said that the hitler at the end of his speeches is also furthering persuading the people to believe that it was under a religious right that they were doing knowing that this was going to arise how this was going to be a perversion of the word amen amen he was going to he was going to produce the amen that was that's pretty for me that was mind-blowing and just just to finish up here because we got some good stuff coming up final couple points here now now remember this is the voice okay now notice okay if everybody can put their attention on me please if i stay here and i say the lord is great will that does that have an effect but if i'm here and if i say oh the lord is great is oh so not only am i speaking out with my mouth but the hands also speak not only do the hands speak but the body also speaks how do we overcome the evil one brother jerry manager it says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony hey man it's it's like a rocket right a rocket goes up one right one rocket goes up it those five go out i'm sorry silent and then those five explode and produce five more cinco produces and then those go out and they and they produce five more yes that's why gentlemen if you would play that audio this is from the message loose ends [Music] i'm gonna come up brother ronnie and people of our precious congregation congregation do you know where the united states is found in prophecy brother ronni it's religion it's found in the in the 13th chapter and the 11th verse of the book of revelations now we talked about the beast last week just a little bit let it send it out of the bottomless pit and we just heard that our pilgrim forefathers they fled the persecution which almost responded to the roman church romana on the roman martiology this is catholic records this is those records catholics during a 300 year period of time in the church ages on their [Music] that killed catholics there were protestants that also killed catholics that doesn't count the rest right and people think that that can't happen again that and the government gains control of religious freedoms or the all these ones we're hearing about control then he can begin to shut down our churches we've talked about that many times and if you read this whole chapter of the book of revelation it talks about both beasts it talks about the first one that sits on seven hills now this other beast starting with verse 11. before i read the verse now remember this this first beast came out from the ocean or from the seas can anybody tell me thicknesses and multitudes and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon now notice this beast came up out of the earth that means where there was nothing significant of course we do realize that when our pilgrim forefathers landed here the only true americans were the indians right but it was deemed the unknown world where they landed it was up out of the earth amen ecclesiastical ecclesiastical or religious religioso and political power politico and those two powers unite and now instead of being like a lamb this beast that looked like it was a lamb like a dragon and who is literally the dragon is literally the but the red dragon or the dragon of revelation chapter 12. that spurt water out of its mouth you come against the remnant of the woman we know that there's rome wrong things have not changed and this is where the united st a photo that we have and he exercises all the power of the first beast before him and causes the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed amen that first beast that was healed of its deadly room was what the old ancient empire of rome romano it looked like it was totally annihilated but how was the that wound it changed from the roman empire cambio del imperio romano to pablo rome right that's how it its wound was healed so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on earth in the sight of men it damien go like 10 different ways without but we're just we're just going to be going through the basics here you all go home and dig in dig into the message because we could be here all night the pastor would probably wouldn't put me for a long time which he would be totally right into it amen okay verse 14 and deceiveth them that dwell upon the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast so this first beast is watching everything that's going on behind the scenes wrong roma is manipulating everything you think that they don't know what's going on i better stop there there i could really i could really go somewhere with that but now watch this verse 15 verso and verse 16. and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should here in the united states of america america it's hard to even use that word united states because it's not united in saying all this we appreciate this the freedoms we have brother ben says in one place it's still the greatest nation with all of its problems is still the greatest nation in the world the media of the freedom to have business all these but he had power to give image to the image of the beast to make it speak and cause all that would not worship that image of the beast should be killed and he causes all both smalling great rich and poor reinbound to receive a mark on their right hand and on their foreheads that no man might buy or sell say be held the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his names and all the churches teach they're going to stamp you on the head and they're going to stamp you on your what you're going to do with it he also pieced a message jesus on your hands what are you going to do with him your forehead is your revelation what are you going to do the mark it's a spiritual mark la marquez it's not going to be a computer chip they're not going to put a number on you depends on what you receive as a revelation depend and then what you do with that revelation so with that said could you guys put the picture up there of the the dollar bill okay now i would like to go to the message here here paragraphs 311 and 212 if you'd like to mark it down for your personality you see where the pope come over here the other day did you notice all them 13s that happened then he spoke 13 words had 13 taking communion spoken yankee stadium everything was 13. next paragraph and our nation's number is 13. appears in the 13th chapter of revelations let's go ahead and put the picture up don't worry about the scripture i want the picture to be up 13 stripes inside of the picture where the eagles at right below the head it shows those thirteen stripes thirteen stars now that like globe above the head of the eagle it's the 13 bars thirteen numbers on the coins there's numeros thirteen stars on the coin everything is thirteen and a woman that i say you know in another place he says why the statue of liberty is a woman woman's nation 13 13 everything and appears in the 13th chapter of the book of revelation of the apocalypse and he says what's going to give life to this image plain speech to finish now the first beast was wrong he says that the image what he says they say and the whole goal is and you can see it now is to fight or stamp out communism he says don't worry about communism it's a pull on the hand of god everybody understand intending praise the lord go home and study it yes yes brother jerry talked about did you open that up or explain it a little bit more explicit in the relation to the first catholic president the second catholic president both prophesied that would come by our people this evening [Music] remember what we talked about what was the moon woman the church right okay so so in the context here so what we're doing so we talked under the first catholic administration which was john f kennedy kennedy so he initiated the the mission to the moon right they made it in 1969 in the mission called apollo we found that in the manuscripts it says apollo and napoleon were the same person so apollo or apollyon was the sun god so we see that there was a race to the moon right and the whole race like brother like brother ronnie said the whole thing of the race was to get there first the first one that would get there the primero would be the first one to plant the cedar evaplant and that way these all these things can come to manifestation but we saw that now that there's a second administration administration or catholic administration and with on the biden harris or biden administration and we and we saw that they're planning another mission and who remembers the name of that mission really the artemis mission right the artemis is three missions so so we see that in 2025 they want to go back to the movies but notice that now they're going in in artemis which was apollos a sibling a artemis era but we see that artemis if you break down the name she was the goddess of the moon so you start to see all this influence in this in religion what does catholicism have catholicism or the queen of heaven but she was the goddess of the moon and in one stage and and like brother jimmy he actually read some of the scriptures so i don't have to read it in revelations 13. she was the goddess of the moon but she's also known as the hunter so we see how it started it looked like a lamb but it'll be a dragon or a hunter later um go into that a little bit more could you tie in that delphi tripod what is it what does that mean sure the so the delphi tripod the triple delphi was something that was sacred to apollo herald like i said i wanted the tube because apollo has a lot of symbols and and so apollo he thought that that fight tripod he holds it sacred triple and and so what he did is he stood i'll just read it here the stool at delphi in which pythia was another goddess she sat to produce her oracles from there was sacred to apollo apollo was the name of the priestess actually of the temple of apollo at delphi del temple but you notice when where she said what does the word try mean question try is the trinity so you start to see all this just fall together by itself solo brother jimmy you can't make this up i mean it falls it fell together it went together by itself solo okay so so we saw okay so we talked about apollo like i said just a tiny little bit of a recap and we'll talk about apollo remember okay so but another another detail that i wanted to bring out about him remember he wrote the quadriga which was a chariot with four horses one rider for horses it was often depicted as a triumphant woman driving it it's it's in between so we try to try to break it down as much as possible but that's why especially at this time it requires much digging into the message because there's a lot of things that are in between the lines and if you just read it like a book so it's important to know the symbols it's important it's important to know history historia the scriptures and the message so it's very very important so that's why young people again it's like bro you would always say when it's a and and this is how he came through how he came through uh to the jews right because the scripture revelations 9 11 11. apollyon you can put it up there so they can read it and the other word is abaddon in the hebrew tongue it's the same one i know by definition jose for definition one is called the destroyer and one is the place of destruction in all reality keep in mind that this roman spirit guardian civil and ecclesiastical okay but that roman demon romano whether through apollyon or through abaddon hitler try to do he tried to exterminate the exterminator see that spirit okay abaddon and napoleon were the same self-destroyers remember to the to the gentiles we see the one rider and the four horses or what they call the four horsemen but we know it was the same writer knowing that at the end it was just all of them mixed together the white the red and the black negro they were mixed together and they brought death but we see it through on the on the side of the june see that in joel he speaks about four about the yen sections different stages in different senses here and insects over here so i started to think and remember it's the same one okay i just i just flipped them i should have i should have done abaddon first and napoleon [Music] remember that this destroyer coming all the way through but don't forget the truth and the word also comes through they're coming side by side the word through his people he would come out through his people okay but destruction so the first time the death angel in exodus the destroyer the destruction of solomon's temple number two you can imagine going through the bible and seeing so many things but i see him in the destruction of solomon's temperament in 586 i see him moving into the destruction of the temple in 7018 when titus sees jerusalem a time killing all those people during the dark ages right the 68 million jew uh christians that brother jimmy was talking about jimmy i see him in the holocaust during hitler's time right he tried to exterminate the jews 1941-1945 but then i also see a something coming in and that's why i said about artemis because there's another destruction coming okay there's another ruin there's another extermination extermination remember abaddon to the jews in a literal standpoint and to destruction destruction so much ruin santa rina brother branham watch brother branham and and he says here in the feast of the trumpets if you want to know where he is jews in a literal standpoint los judios and here comes the persecution to the church an ecclesiastical standpoint my goodness everything todo it's all mixed it's misclado you look at everything in history and religion that was a point of them getting to the moon remember look at it in this context okay i know i know i'm not talking about the it's it's the it's the type of that was the purpose of getting there because there was what does the offspring mean significa an offspring has characteristics of the father characteristics it's got the fingerprints for caleb all over where it's political or it's religious it's got its fingerprints on everything it's in her lace so close yes it's intertwined she's got her influence on everything influencing amen no man are you following me missing i don't want to i don't want to go too far too fast and try to slow myself down okay good good good um okay so brother branham here says this is the monobrandon catholic church is the beast the bible said that a beast means a power significant is that right and now that was the power of the church yes that was the beast then the protestant church come in come out of the catholic church and what did she do right after that organize themselves that is the image then the protestant church come out of the i read that if anything because cialgo if something cialgo watch if anything if something algo was made in my image foreign is something made in the image of this church you look like this church [Music] ism all them isms formed up into an organization and made an image just like the beast brother says there it this is so we talked a little bit about anything that's set up like that anything that resembles that beast it doesn't matter what church it is it doesn't even matter if it's in the message the message cannot be denominated but many people try to put little isms just finished saying hey do we have to realize is that it's a system it's the system behind it there's a certain spirit behind certain spirits whether whether it's churches whether it's politics or political is this brother tommy junior gave me this article when he gave me the saturn this was perfect what would i want to bring this perfecto but it was published in february 11 2014 2014. and it's an article that's called in lost history and i can give you the link if you want it after so you can read it for yourself the other ones the um the ones about rome and washington the buildings just cycle them that's that's okay that's that's called the arch of constantine constantino but you ever wonder you look at the architecture in the white house you look at you look at the buildings and what do they look like doesn't it look like they have roman influence in them in the very architecture that where our governing body sits let me read this i'll read a little bit so you guys can look at the pictures okay one of the estates which made up the original city of washington was called rome have you heard about rome maryland oh escuchado the roma maryland and the the author says probably not so read on continuous dc has an interesting historical connection to the city of rome uh this this might be one of the more fascinating pieces of local trivia we have ever come across a long time ago way before the city in the thought was in the thoughts of our forefathers founding fathers back in the 17th century there was a large estate in the area of about 400 acres acres this farm occupied land estate southeast of georgetown and georgetown then part of maryland part of the maryland the man who owned the land was fond of italy and decided to name the state rome he mentioned the small body of water bordering itself was originally called goose creek but then took a new name lego number the tiger creek like after the tiber in rome and i'm just reading verbatim okay watch this of course the story would not be complete without mentioning the landowner's name the name just happened to be francis pope el hombre del don francis pope according to an article i came across the washington post from october 7th 1883 the land was laid out and acquired by pope on june 5th 5th 1663 and you saw you saw the buildings are right coincidence coincidence brother brown says nothing happens we're just seeing how interlaced how that destroyer has snuck all his way in here our new birth is going to happen computers the chips the shortages everywhere setting it up perfectly that destroyer destructor to come in so there was wrong before there was washington you see the dna in roman in washington figuratively literally literally revelations 13 1 brother jimmy read it i won't read it apocalypse is now we begin to see that scripture right he looked like a lamb but they looked like a dragon you see the platform set up so everything is doom and gloom huh but the word of god also came here that just before the pope took his journey to jerusalem just before he took his journey tomorrow and he's coming here in vienna brother jimmy said it's ready for a climax what's this imagine brother branham said i don't recall the message but all it takes is a little bit of vodka somebody does go and push the button and he's dealing with who is he dealing with he's dealing with biden right we see them at it it's kind of like a proxy war that they're fighting right now they're fighting wars to some through other countries [Music] is it a coincidence that the very name biden is literally means button significa i thought that was awesome my goodness brother brown says nothing happens so watch this here but there's hope for the believer especially the gentile churches and the ladies if the jews are in their homeland today we have atomic bombs hanging in the hangars we have a church that's lukewarm iglesias we have a church an iglesia but also a people that draw their self together that patterns the ministry of jesus christ for to catch the stone but when it comes what's left to happen it might be i'm sorry brother it might be any
