[Music] amen let's just give one to the lord amen at this time we're going to introduce the word of god it'll be brought forth to our founding apostle brother the most better senior and there where you're at you may be seated and may the lord richly bless you chapter 6 capital says amen it reads this way 7-10 by the word of truth by the power of god by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honor andy honor by able report and good report as deceivers and yet true [Music] foreign as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things [Music] also acknowledge our brother rudy that was california happy to have you back and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be do nor reign these years but according to my words and joseph i want to say that friday we have we had a very very nice service and uh brother tommy donaldson just hit a grand slam [Music] and before i say this i want to say that i want to thank brother charlie and brother jody charlie because very touching and the lord is he spoke to me yes they claim but they claim like a bunch of sissies they say well it's mine they they just stop there listen he said son when you claim something take a hold of it he said because you're you're not going to get it remember one thing i gave it to you and that's the reason that this morning my message is all things are mine [Music] i want all of you to repeat that all things all things my mind everybody attributes that to himself again all things are mine very sorrowful yes [Music] one thing i want you to notice in the in uh first kings that we were where we read elijah said there will be no rain except i call foreign and they say well this pertain to the apostles and the apostles oh everything a very part or bit a totality holy entirely now that should make you feel good you know it's trying to find that some people say wait you you can't do this in the church your ministers can't do certain things well it's like the husband telling the wife you can do certain things but you can't do other things it is true remember when we praise certain [Applause] i i signed the name ray matthews he said but that's not right he said it's ray matthew naomi and philly [Music] [Music] he's [Music] pages well that's enough and maybe you would like to read when you're at home but i'm starting from page 89 because because and it says here this is but it's spelled this way gold and and he says here this yaki they all must be able to do it um that someone that [Applause] his name is the lord jesus christ [Applause] [Applause] okay [Applause] [Applause] [Music] he hasn't [Music] you let the devil tell you that it's not yours [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] hold works now in the book of philippians if you would like to turn with me equivalent a little little philly pencil and it's a very familiar scripture in chapter two we defend this capital let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus now if you say well that's the mind of jesus christ well this mind of jesus christ has to be in you it has to be in you [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] certain things [Music] [Applause] [Music] everything that he has now here's a very tremendous part here in page 86 it says this [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in the hands of god enough in other words he's waiting it's in his hands [Music] [Applause] from his hands [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] waiting [Music] pretty long i ever thought because i had not heard from my friend i was nervous but as i began to think about him because i was talking to brother chris and his wife and brother tommy his wife and my family yeah as i was sleeping the phone rang so no [Applause] and truthfully speaking i feel as bad as for two weeks like if my wife hadn't talked to me such was the love that was between david and johnson more than the love of a man for a woman and why is that love because of [Music] sometimes you don't know from one day to another who will be standing or who will fall [Music] and it's very tremendous thing that prophet said we live in the golden age a lot of times in in our midst we find we find people there and ministers that still preach the dark ages which is there are times in me like for example friday night [Applause] you know i i sympathize with people where they have no patience [Applause] we see people sincere people that are trying to serve god i'm [Applause] [Music] garbage is because when you say something that is i've made many many many many many mistakes in my walk with [Music] [Applause] [Applause] and probably many will not receive that statement [Music] so then we don't live in dark ages we live in the most glorious age of possession we live in a time when god has opened [Music] amen rejoice but let me insert a little thing here what was the name of that fellow from waco texas david corsin [Music] i am not defending david [Music] the ones that came against the jews [Music] was the government wherein wasn't it the german army the german government [Applause] now what was david koresh doing different than a lot of people loose why did they pick on david corres [Music] that even the government went and had to literally destroy him with the woman and the children in that place why don't you say yesterday [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] stop and think [Music] you what are [Music] [Applause] they don't speak to the original [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and clinton will give you what we find when you call the rebels but you go through the jungle oh no and they ask you what are you doing here it is too you you tell a [Music] is [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] thank [Applause] that people mistooking for the lord jesus christ they weren't far from it the mind of christians [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] can you imagine god watch the people in this message the majority and in their condition the price is going to bring hold up outside the price going to bring what the variation of tight faces watch yeah we'll find in a minute where he's at it's a mystery that's in the seven-seal book when we stayed up in the little little stadium he's waiting in the hands of the original owners abraham had a right to the promise [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] but people say well it's mine then he says yet even though it's yours you have to fight for it okay well if god gave it to me why do i have to fight for it because satan is a squad [Music] [Applause] but i don't have it [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] then [Music] they're claiming that that man belongs to them why do they put slogans out that says the united states tries to play the friend and the policemen all over the world and the africans say it's not yours because you say that that's ours well we're going to get the restful that is coming against us [Music] go and capture adidas [Music] they it [Music] [Applause] russia then they call us crazy [Music] in charge of the united states and then he told [Applause]
