[Music] [Music] oh praise the lord [Music] every voice all together [Music] [Music] may god bless you this evening just real quick we're going to turn to the to the book of genesis chapter one and verse one capital uno uno we're just going to read that first part and it says in the beginning [Music] and sometimes we feel like we're like maybe we we could do better this coming year and a lot of times people come up and they and they have this this thing of i'm going to lose weight this year i have a new year's resolution i'm going to do this or that but this morning i got up and i read this and usually by january 7th all of a sudden we have this one why why we can't do it because we don't have time because we don't have this or that but i it starts by us relying on the almighty god knowing that he who has started working on the same god all of a sudden forgot to do what would create something of one of the of those six days in the book of psalms nor standeth in the way of sinners but his life now is your delight on the things of god of the lord day and night and he shall be like the trees planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf gets that if we could put away all the worldly things all of our worldly ideas put god first in our life at the beginning of everything we do i believe we'll see god create a new earth create something brand new that we wouldn't be complaining about what happened yet last year the bible tells us the blessings followed us it's not us too up to us to dwell on what happened to us god is moving us right now the new beginning i'm a new person but that he could finish the day if paul had the mindset see pablo he wanted to preach the gospel in rome but if paul perot we wouldn't have had the gospel according to the apostle paul but paul had the right attitude he found himself in prison saying control in rome in roma and i don't know if you know this you know but every single day for 12-hour shifts one to restore it's so much bigger it's better than [Music] if you would come and give us some words god [Applause] the 15th chapter of the book of luke prepare verse 11. and we're going to read it in the name of the lord jesus christ and he said and the younger of them said unto his father father give me the portion of goods that followed to me and he divided unto them his living no muchos diaz di so and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with righteous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine [Music] and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into the his fields to feed swine and he would feign had and he would feign have filled his belly with the husks and that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself he said how many higher servants of my fathers have bread enough to spare and i perish with hunger epic i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee. and i'm no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet great way of his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him amen amen you may be seated um we just we're going to talk about the story and many maybe know it oh but maybe many don't know what it is to work with swine come on and when i was younger about 18 years old i had the opportunity to work with about three thousand swine no it's fosse it's not easy and you know a few days ago i was thinking about this and i thought why is wine okay when i believe that god lets people go to certain things work in certain things so that you know when they so that when they go through these things they can know what the scripture is talking about um the reason why he wanted to leave he says just because he began to hang around with people that he shouldn't have proven the prophet says that he was a young man that he was instructed in the word of god or on the council of god but he began to hear a personas people that he should not have been listening so therefore uh youth it's not a scolding but it is a as a council establishment in this condition the prophet says that the father of this young man the prophet says i can be i begin i can begin to see him the how the god will put a signs uh for sale signs and the oh la casa he sold the house he sold his his barn and he got all of the money and he divided it and it says and he uh wrongfully has spent all the money that the father have given them but one and he was wanting to eat the food of the swine no poliah he couldn't do it but when you see the scriptures but the scripture says when he came to himself the prophet says that the reason why he came to himself was because he had a father and a mother that was praying for him what a responsibility causing the same problem there are still fathers that pray for their children us you're not going to go and eat a uh swine feed fedor you wouldn't do it but this man was so lost he had lost his the prophet says that his parents would wake up every morning to pray for their son this elderly father was was looking sitting on his porch and he was looking looking into the hills when all of a sudden he saw a shadow that was coming and he arose he goes and he said oh my son god hears our prayers that father here rose and he went running she was a mother was praying for him what is our attitude maybe those that have gone on that have left us your feet is lord i have friends i have left i have family lord you know that they have not returned to church like that prodigal son lord god that was on the road he was lost that was in his parents he was without hope lord but there was people that were praying for him you lord maybe they have departed thy ways why is he in estonia lord maybe this night they would raise their hand and say here am i into thy hands we command ourselves to receive this new year lord i remember my brother i began to remember to my brother ourselves in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Applause] and praise the lord it's an honor to stand behind the sacred desk thank you for your trust if you went apocalypse revelations chapter 22 apocalypse and the last verse 21 90 he's the beginning elisha principia and he's the end yes he's the alpha it's alpha and he's the omega yes and he has been with us all of 2021 2021. and he's going to be with us 2022. because he is the same yesterday tomorrow manana and i want to read the first two words and then you can be seated gloria the grace of our lord jesus christ remember brother amen amen remember your message requested mensa amen amen soviet i see sam remember your message we have some beautiful messages here muchos powerful and you stood up here and you said it's okay sometimes remember i started running around the church and i was like what it was infectious very infectious that stands out in 2021 not just the messages some of the hymns some of the brothers and sisters set up here and playing the guitar throughout this chaos people were still praising and worshipping god [Applause] don't you want the grace of god to the middle of the bible 118 you go from genesis to the middle if you're going from revelations to the middle east and this is all we got to do it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence do you know why i've always liked this verse remember rest you also numero ocho what verse is that right in the middle and and if you count the sixteen is if you count one through sixteen i'm number eleven is the beginning and the end that principle will all be fulfilled in each and every one and the grace of god will be with us all god [Applause] thank you can you hear me okay you know why i enjoyed that you know why i enjoyed that time because not one of them was told before church that they were going to come up i took a page out of our founding pastor's book yeah and there it's good to see when you when you have ministers that are ready

stay too long no but what a year it's been seemed like every year every year we say what a year it's been a year of struggles yes see anybody here not struggle give me the recipe a year of sickness a year of pain and suffering a year of losses a year of opportunities a year of healing a year of growth a year of overcoming and most of all he has done that has molded our characters to what they are today every year every day every hour of life that he gives us we are that much closer to seeing our loved ones that have gone on we are that much closer to the coming of the lord oh i tell you your redemption draw at night amen this is something that i want to and i knew i wouldn't finish on sunday number 13. with a subtitle it's high time to awake how many people are awake right now amen so we want to go to our scriptures that we've been reading luke 24 25 lucas when you have it you can say amen and he said unto them all fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken would you turn around and and wave at the camera all our brothers and sisters at home in different parts of the country and in different parts of the world those that are in in norway those that are in africa those are in the other parts they're already in 2022 we're waving to you from the past hello future tell us how it is got there already amen romans 13 11 romano and this is what we want to base it on and that knowing the time how many know what time it is no come on yeah and that knowing the time you can't even look at the rest of the scripture you don't know the time how many know what time it is that now not tomorrow now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation near when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of life amen may god had his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated this evening in an emphatic way it needs to be done it look at this the word time there is it's it's set or a proper time or season and this is all building up for sunday okay and when the true worshipers the bible says that now and so it is you know when you're looking forward to something [Music] i'm going camping now now is the time our discernment needs to be better than it's ever been you gotta awaken church i'm telling you i wanna i wanna tell you it's the suspension of voluntary bodily functions or the suspension of complete or partial conscience they can mean death now i want us to look at ourselves here in the mirror it's very important that we see ourselves that's why you can see you don't even have to worry about your neighbor or anybody else that is so 2 000. that is so 2021. you're gonna have to you got to learn to tell satan that tell them it's so important that's talking about those that died through the church ages that in are you ready to take on the new year oh someone list those past ten years the brother brother mark says after a couple of days a couple of weeks what do we do yes we revert back to our two weeks later i don't feel like getting up that's the way to say it throwing in the towel and you wonder why can't i keep it what is this can i keep it up it's what it's no different in the spiritual spirit you start off i'm going to be good i'm going to i'm going to really get to reading my bible and then life kicks us in the teeth and because many times we're not disciplined enough what do we do we fall back how many been out there four-wheel driving before yeah and you're going down the road and there's these tracks right and then it gets pretty rough and then you kind of try it well i'm going to go off a little bit that is but we think we you have more to give god's people i'm not talking to anybody today am i not established all right stir it yesterday um but then i got to talking to her and she started talking to me and she forgot to start but all of a sudden she says [Applause] really okay okay just give me your if you give me your full undivided attention i can feel you pulling and we'll the man thought this is done to the heart of the problem oh not me you don't know just know you're on the sidelines watching the fight no as long as i got a good job then i went through all the money i don't have to deal with nothing else don't start coaster after a while you're just like what's next what's going to come talking to anybody let me see let me see okay okay i want to make sure we get so tired of the roller coaster ride but what are we really tired paul says i have fought a good fight but i stopped to think about it because i see everybody is affected by it what is it what is it that tires us so much and then comes the answer dealing with the same situation over and over and over and over and over and over and over again hires us more than anything else that's so much the fighting if we [Music] why didn't it die out with last year am i talking to anybody i got to look in the mirror and ask myself these questions why am i still carrying this from last year you died i told somebody the other day i said that that's what what tire's a pastor when you tell the people to do a certain thing and instead they trust in the man but yet there are those that recognize the god that's in the man that's there and i said lord day after day i see the people check your socials [Music] did you all just leave what are you all still here oh yes that's like the most touchy subject of anybody the christian's walk is based on rest how many of you high there's no other place to rest but in christ so i asked the question then why are we so tired what gets us more tired as the days go by this is the word that he gave me with the are you are you with me come on there's two different things when you're dealing with something keep dealing with trying to change this and change that that's many people most people nowadays it's frustrating to cope with people nowadays anybody have have businesses it's frustrating [Music] everyone goes to work it's frustrating to cope with people not dealing with them because they have their own mind it's frustrating to cope with situations it's it's frustrating to cope with situations with conditions that seem like they're never going to change if someone has ought against you go to them all the time i want you to think about this how crazy it is [Applause] aside all these things stop coping with the same thing year after year after year let it go ask for forgiveness if you've wronged somebody to cope with the same thing all the time what does frustration show okay look at moisture does anybody here get frustrated frustration frustration only shows one thing that you're not in control oh you're losing control husband of mine those children who's in control you want i'm trying to help you this this night it shows that we are at the mercy of someone or something else we're frustrated am i talking to anybody here many many are entering the new year tired and frustrated you know why because you know you haven't made some things right and you know that you're going to have to continue the new year continue coping with the same things and we sit in church with a big face what but i'm going to tell you the truth cope with that person but that don't happen in here perez don't know pasaki great grateful very nice nap in here what's going on but you know what your greatest frustration is still gonna i gotta wake that's the greatest frustration that we have ourselves so we tell them apply the word to your problem applicable watch watch this though this is the holy spirit dealing with me upside down just when i thought i had a good answer i'm like whoa man no no oh this is this is something good so we see people with their problems you can overcome your problems and then i think and i say how can i apply the word to a problem if i don't apply the word to myself it's not the problem that needs the application of the word application of a word some magic tool or something like wow you don't have the confidence to apply the word to anything nothing else think about this who was it brother jerry i think it was that that preached to us about wolf culture what a message go back and hear it again today you're more aware more informed oh my goodness gracious exactly what the serpent told eve right when the law was given what did the lord do it awakened the person to show them here's still coping with the same habits that they have had for years still coping with the same desires that they've had for years come how man goodness gracious am i still with you are you still with me am i still with you all they could do was cope with nature cope with their desire every year they came to do the same thing i gotta go give a lamb cope with our conditions i don't know but you know what we're talking about come over here i want i want you to get to go a little farther that way now he's not my problem but i'm just for example okay i want you getting all hurt with me then i got to be well oh me full a question trying to make the word cope with our my condition you fill in the blank what your condition is i know what i lost or i got this problem or would you just deal with it he didn't he didn't mess up to cause the problem why do you want him to do that lord i'm applying the word now jesus the problem stays and year after year it's the same thing and then the holy spirit comes to me and he listen closely watch when the reality of it it's done in its right place or it's right for me watch now watch us now regardless of how little we are or how low we are important it makes it obey him it forces the issue and says give it back oh and then brother says if we could just think of that for a minute just a minute just think about this for a minute as we're coming into the last minutes of of of 2021 think about this for a minute now what happens what's the difference now difference now that's my problem the word has been established the token has been established in me it's been applied watch what brother branham is telling us here this is message restoration of the bride no matter what the condition is important the law of god's word now forces the condition to cope with the word and [Applause] those things how do i cope with [Applause] what a difference be we're going to have more bad situations but now you can't cope with the word let it try what if it kills somebody huh get back to the word no matter what it says you and i have to cope with the word too if it's the word then god said so yeah the genuine holy spirit will cope with the word he says goes on and says are you born again it is how many people are born again and that life is christ that's why the holy spirit is saying to awaken out of sleep don't be dormant no more no we're asleep because we're tired ourselves why because what we just saw the book of jeremiah this will be my scripture on sunday chapter 1 verse 11 and 12. moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying jeremiah is what do you understand he's asking jeremiah this what do you see what do you understand about what you see they look at this and he said i see a rod of an old alban oh i'm going to preach on sunday when the almond tree flourishes but i got to give you this to get you ready for it i see a rod of an almond tree you all know that the rod of aaron what kind of rod was it it was the rod of an almond branch right now it was from an almond tree watch this now what do you see for this year rod of an almond tree unavara del mendro is it dried up or has it blossomed and produced almonds oh yeah flores uh-oh what c is though watch what he said i see the rod of an almond tree the lord said unto me for i will hasten my word to perform it that the word and watch the way that the lord is putting this the word for almond tree la palabra almendro is chakel the word for hastening his word la palabra por presidente is if you could just get blossom or bloom flower that comes out the almond tree is the first tree that blossoms after winter it's i'm about to get into my message and then i really won't i really won't stop till about three in the morning watch this now it's awakening or arousing us out of sleep or out of dormancy he uses the same word us because it's the same cycle that you and i go through every year don't tell me you don't know as the pastor i know all your cycles are producing good i don't even hear from that person and then man [Music] but thank goodness that i understand cycles i better not go into the cycles watch this as ministers were good at motivating people don't get me wrong there's a good motivation but watch the difference now whatever i could do for any of you i would do whatever you put out to the ends of the world for any for all of you but if you came back from the ends of the world in the same condition what have i accomplished the only thing that i could do sister is pray for you then he goes or do something to arouse your faith isn't that the church we must be ready for today when i look at this oh i said lord help us but you know sometimes we have even that backwards is tremendous but it's sometimes misunderstood because we think sometimes that revival means to add more members to the church oh there's a revival going on in uganda in uganda they think that revival means to add new members no no adding you re adding new members is the results of the revival i like this one i'm going to say it again revival isn't added the members the adding of the members is the results that there was a revival but a revival is to revive what's already in the church come on church this revival in uganda was not to add more members in the church you and i must be the revival there is no revival without you and i know when we go through tribulations and trials we're trying to deal with things when the spring comes is it's the great awakening oh there have been great awakenings and that's why you have to rightly divide the world because you might sitting next yeah you're not awake okay i'm finishing now determined barely nine three hours has appeared to us the holy ghost and he's bringing us a message talking about the great awakening of righteousness is the message to speak forth great mysterious signs and wonders there is a great thing going to happen the people saying we've heard this many times pray pray pray pray he's not saying don't pray not what he's saying but why are they doing that because they want a you're talking candlesticks [Music] when the almond tree flourished [Applause] they have not recognized the awakening of the bride by being christians they fill the pool of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done because there were people that are in the bride because you're always looking to what's going to be done another human being nice to see you brother dave what she is thou is look at this come on church what i see a rod of an almond tree thou has seen well as best again tell your neighbor that's what we got to see as you stand today let's this year question see and answer the question there was what she is though and i will say i saw someone that was in sin of god this year oh yes come on somebody give him a high five give him a high five high five yeah give somebody a high five i see something more beyond than just flesh you're and it's time to really see your husband and your wife look at each other for reals i want you to look at each other again because that's all we know i see them in church i'm in church every night look again i see the rod of an almond tree oh i like what i see oh we know about the fig tree that's israel yes the victory [Applause] is as for me i will behold by faith in righteousness i shall be satisfied when i awake with thy likeness god bless you tonight [Applause] [Music] [Music] i don't want to enter this new year with all this baggage i don't want to just cope with things [Music] i want to go beyond that here in masaya [Music] want to deal with them and i want the word to dwell in me be established in me lord
