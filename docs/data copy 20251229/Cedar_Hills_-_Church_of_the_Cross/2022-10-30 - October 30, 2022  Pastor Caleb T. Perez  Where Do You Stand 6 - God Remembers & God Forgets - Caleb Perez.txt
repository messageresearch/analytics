yesterday seven more Pastors in their churches and uh it's just my goodness it just it just keeps on going we are we are thankful to God for that thank God for life in our to be able to still come together Worship the Lord together wonderful thing this morning amen I have kind of a little strange subject it's very very simple we should know these things sometimes a reminder is is good but but I as you can see there where do you stand number six subtitle and God remembered and God forgot is I want to preach this message I I think it's thought provoking but the central idea of this message is this can our God that is omniscient that knows all things that is eternal can that thought or that mind forget is how is that possible that that mind could actually forget and at the same token that mind can remember let's see what the Holy Spirit has to tell us today ready to go into the word amen Philippians the second chapter and the fifth verse Cinco have it you can say man this thing working yeah it reads like this let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Christ Jesus that's good stuff we could we could we could leave church today and be satisfied let this mind be in use turn around to your neighbors a neighbor let this mind be in you turn to the other side and tell your other neighbor let this mind be in you first Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 16. we made according what the clock is at all righty second First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16 says yes he says for who hath known the mind of the Lord the question who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him this is but we have the mind of Christ I want everybody to repeat after me but we have the mind of Christ good to see brother Jacinto sister Maggie and sister Dory God bless you also that are here amen we have the mind of Christ tell your neighbor now we have the mind of Christ you believe that though raise your hand amen you may be seated may God add His blessings to the reading of his word and uh we ask that God would give us our daily bread and according to the scriptures that we have just read the mind of Christ is the only access ISO that we have into the mind of the Lord can I get a witness you cannot even begin to comprehend the mind of God without first receiving the mind of Christ how you say brother is that the same thing it should be the same thing in one sense it is but in another sense it's a dispensational thing now now how many of you enjoyed that on Wednesdays what a wonderful panel it was enjoyed that how these portals and my goodness and there's there's so much more so so panel panel gentlemen we're gonna have to have another one because that one can keep on going for some time we just barely got the surface through the surface of that one but man that that can get deep in a hurry therefore the human being now that includes me and you the human being has been the privilege to enter in and know and have the mind of Christ how many deemed that a privilege this morning let me see your hands to make sure that you're all awake this morning okay okay it is the ultimate privilege to have the mind of Christ because that's the only once again the only access is we have to this great Eternal omniscient Mind Of God so the mind of Christ can only come into a Persona that has died out to themselves no other way will you get the mind of Christ because the holy spirit is the mind of Christ and if you don't receive the Holy Spirit you can never have the mind of Christ the Bible tells us or brother Branham actually says this that all that God was he poured it into Christ so Christ had the power that God had is and the church has the power that Christ has yes or yes we all have to agree with this before we can go on so so understanding then when the mind of Christ comes into your heart it's simple it's simply then you'll think like he thinks did you get that say it again because we got to build this Foundation this morning when the mind of Christ comes into your heart then you'll think just like he thinks amen I want to know how many believe that this morning because a lot of times we talk and that's not what the word says we think things and that's not what the word says according to what his mind says every time I pick up a book I listened to a message it's the mind of Christ speaking to me how many know that how many want to know what's in the mind of Christ you'll know what's in the mind of Christ do we really believe that or not then why don't we do it like we should we're okay with filling ourselves with what Hollywood has to say is Kay was feeling ourselves with what the world is saying but why aren't we feeling ourselves with what Christ is saying so then the question is do we really think like Christ thinks that's a good question this morning things happen we freak out don't think that way I was talking to to one of the men here brother Al yesterday and he was telling me some things that he was going through and when he left I finished up and we we had met there at the car wash car wash and brother Al as as you as as I left the car wash the holy spirit says I am pleased wanted me to tell you that brother because as we were he was talking he said now I could have fought this way but I thought this way instead like this and I said wow and then me I said I I can I could understand when when the holy spirit says tell him I'm I I am very proud of him there is nothing greater Church than when you know that Christ is pleased with you when you could have done something or made a decision based on Greed or based on on your feelings but you made a decision based on God's words so as we as we unfold this this message this morning how can I think like Christo if I don't have his spirit in me that's producing those thoughts it's why there is so much frictions in the church foreign it is the mind of Christ being voiced out the prophet is the voice of God to us if that Pastor in Ministry don't say what the prophet said I didn't say just repeat no no no no say what he said if they don't they're off the word how many believe in the faithful Ministry how many believe that that Satan also has a faithful ministerio he also has pastors an evangelistas teachers maestros prophets prophetas apostolis he has them all too and they speak very similar in a lot of things but notice this now where we're we're wanting to know more about this mind this great mind this great mind that is omniscientism we can we can sit the rest of our lives in church Nobody Knows the mind of God that's absurd that somebody would know it it's absurd that it has been open and we don't understand or know it okay that's what's up that is it's opened right to us we don't want that one of the smartest men in the 20th century everybody has heard of him no matter where you go we were in Israel with all these paintings of Einstein where you go everybody knows Einsteins well it was in Israel because everyone know that Einstein was a Jew right there in Israel he's well known he was actually they had pointed him wanted him to become the president of of Israel and of course he refused but he was not he didn't consider himself an atheist he considered himself an agnostic and he did however believed that there was a God he was The Mastermind behind all creations and he made this statement the brains of the world but we don't try to use our brains we left the mind that was in Christ be in us now now brother Branham he has some good things to say about Einstein Christ is revealed in his own word he says this if Einstein this is the Einstein had only had of the spiritual applications as he had the physical applications as he studied the laws of light he could have told us something once again he could have told us something when I heard his message brother Brahm says on that great Center somewhere into the skies that if it was ever contacted you make contact with that Center you could create Earth you could do anything and the power would be unlimited if only he could have applied what he knew in the physical application to the spirituals my question is what was Einstein's error de Einstein I have to know this thing I I ask these questions even to myself but these questions come I got to know the answers because if they made an error somewhere they could not take the physical and apply it to the spirit I don't want to make the same errorism I don't stand where I'm coming from I don't want us to make the same error why couldn't he apply what he knew to the spirituals let you think about that person what kept Him from applying it in the spiritual Realms here anybody want to answer I'll let you answer today okay he was using the wrong mind that's that's true he was using his brains brother branstead instead of mind of Christ he didn't have a new birth all those things are part of the answer which brings us to the the the the the answer because he didn't believe in a personal God now that's that's his that's his words I don't believe in a personal God who concerns himself with faith and actions of human beings that's naive this is Einstein the brains it's naive to think that he's a personal God and because he wasn't interested in the details what Einstein said okay if you don't believe in a personal God personal you can't believe in predestination you can't believe in calling an election you can't believe in destiny and foreknowledge these are the details I want to say this morning that I believe in a personal God okay I don't know about you but tell your neighbors say neighbor I believe in a personal God you believe see I believe in a personal God I believe in having a personal relationship I believe in a God that cares about us and has laid out a plan for you and I plan for me it's called The Plan of Redemption and that's why I believe that we come to church because we want to know more about his thoughts or towards us at least that's why I come to church so this is why where we get into our message now let's see how personal our God is how many want to go with me let's see how personal promise get some personalities Genesis chapter 8 and verse 1. just the first or words and God remembered it don't get no more personal than that put your name there God remembered Caleb God remember AJ yawning in church and God remembered calebster come on you got to say it again put your name there God remembered that's a personal God personal I'm going to say it again that's a personal God and God remembered Dory yes he did come on now that thinks about us I don't know but that excites me this morning what condition you're in this morning you could get the Revelation that the god of Glory yeah he didn't just thought about you way back then he's still thinking about it this is something that I don't ever want to overlook let's stop for a minute and understand the word remember here remembers the word zakar it means to remember our call to mind it also means to properly Mark is so that it is easily to recognize to think on and God thought is your spend so no way you're getting it when our name is mentioned he knows who we are you guys aren't excited are you excited brother Moses what about you my brother excited when God thinks about you smiling vehicle come on you excited you excited okay smile at me so I know you're excited buddy all right how about you sisters over there good remember remember when our name is mentioned he knows who you are we are Mark Thomas so that we are that he easily recognizes us and thinks about us the word remember in the dictionary is to have or keep an image in your memory of an event is or be able to bring to one's mind an awareness of someone or something now in order for us to remember something or someone they have to have been out of our immediate thinking you remember all of a sudden you get a phone oh I haven't I don't I hadn't heard from that that person for a long time with that person yeah I hadn't thought about them in years that's so that's the way we remember because we've been busy doing things other things happening in his life but with God that's not the way he views it there is not a moment that we are out of his mind I don't know about you but I fall in love with him more every time I'm gonna say it again there is not a moment that you are out of his mind oh I hadn't thought about about brother Emilio for a while oh I remembered brother Emilio oh this is not with God no condios no and that's why in order to understand the mind of Christ we must first get rid of our thinking this is where the question of the day is derived from how can an infinite Infinity it don't seem like it's possible then how can an infinite Eternal mind of something or someone if it doesn't forget we tend to think of remembering simply as a mental activity you got to get all these things to know where we're going this is to think of remembering as a mental activity that is triggered by something or someone's input for example our attention span today is not very good is that anybody here it doesn't even matter if you're young or old anymore that's they're getting old they forget our young people are forgetting more than the old people do this do this before you go hi guys how come you didn't do it I forgot foreign wow that's right oh I forgot the Frijoles right it's the smoke in the air and oh I forgot I left the stove on the light comes on in the garden I forgot to put gas yesterday did you call the brother for his birthday oh I forgot what it's our our memories being triggered by something I'm remembering forget and forgetting to us in our finite Minds that are intertwined together but when we talk about the mind of God remembering and forgetting according it's not simply a mental activity no it's implemented come on now I'm trying to get you to see things on a different on a different level with God he doesn't need some kind of input to remember to God the word remember not just a mental activity it is or focuses on the action okay now that might not make a lot of sense to you but let me just tell you the way the Hebrews understand the word when it says that God remembered Noah um here we go us if this would have been us I forgot here I am doing all this over here no one's in the middle of a flood with a bunch of animals no no no God that's not the way that God's mind works oh we gotta get these things now straightened out no God when he remembered Noah it means that he was acting Faithfully fell upon his promise to his promise us to protect and deliver his seeds so when we read that God remembered it simply means that God is on the scene present and ready for actions oh my it's totally different now it's not he remember oh no oh shoot I got to go make sure Noah's okay God remembered and it means he's there I got you it is hello everybody and we think so many things the wrong way so that's why I said and God remember put your name what is he saying God remembered Caleb simply means that God is present in my life that has been deposited in my soul this is what it's supposed to produce cares about the details you're getting it so can God remember absolutely absolutely and God forget oh we're going down the line here because we're getting to something here can God forget them the title of my message and God remembered thank God for God is yourself let's see if God forgets what it really means to forget is here Jeremiah 23 39. haremias I'm there with me this morning let's let's learn this have a greater mind Amazon therefore behold I even I would utterly and I will forsake you and the city that I gave you fathers and cast out of my friends when we speak about forgetting we automatically think about the mental capacity of a person if one has dementia or Alzheimer's dementia Alzheimer's then the ability to remember things begins to diminished forget things and many times they can remember things from years and years ago they have a hard time remembering day-to-day things can have short-term or long-term memory loss considered forgetting but you see when God says I will utterly forget you this is not in any way that his memory is diminishing that's not the way the Hebrews understand it means that he will ignore you okay it means that you'll have no regards for you that you'll be deprived of his presence that's the word forget it God is saying I will utterly forget you that's why when the children of Israel God would forgive them no not put them out of his mind completely but he would forsake them for a moment the enemy will come in here because they had no protection they will conquer them but when they repented he would remember his Covenant he would remember the Covenant that he had with his people and he would come on the scene and we'll deliver them see step to the side for a moment yeah and then we're saying Lord why Lord where are you Lord I pray and I don't get an answer call him back on the scene repentance oh but let that one sit in oh that one that one like oh you talk too much repentance and you think things you shouldn't repentance they'll remember you that means he'll come on the scene amen watch this now you see God's mercy and Grace has been extended but there comes a time when mercy has been exhausted and then God will remember all the sins and iniquities that has been accumulated because of our lack of repentance Revelations 18 tells us and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people yes be not partakers of our sins and that ye received not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities God can only remember sins and iniquities that have not been confessed and when he says he'll remember her iniquities it means that he is present and in action again bring punishment and revenge upon those that were against his word and his people he remembers her iniquities it's time for judgment now when God remembers but to his people that have confessed their sins washed in the blood of the Lamb yes that's what he says Hebrews 10 17 and 18. and their sins and iniquities I remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin and when he says I'll remember your sins and iniquities no more it means that there is nothing in his mind nothing to grasp nothing to Bear there is no punishment there is no condemnation for those things that have been remitted I'll remember your sins no more oh my goodness Church I get sick and tired of Satan constantly accusing God it gets old to me constantly reminding us of our failures our sins our transgressions it's time we learn how to fight back in contrast come on church I speak to people after people whether here or abroad wherever I go and it's the same thing yes I just can't get over the things I've done this is am I talking to anybody here am I talking to anybody here let me see your hands I mean you really I'm not going to get over things coming back coming back I don't know how to fight it let's start fighting him with the word [Music] there's a constant struggle everybody we struggle with so many things we struggle with how to deal with someone that has hurt us am I talking to anybody we struggle to deal with those that speak evil of us hello everybody that's I don't care who you are you're not exempt from them whether you say Amen or not it's not neither here nor there it is and we struggle with how to deal with a person that has hurt us Time and Time and Time the author asks does forgiveness mean that we should act like it never happened in order to try and get over it that's the way people deal with things nowadays like it never happened no there is no repentance there's no repentance there's no confession and I confessions but every time we see that person is activated in US hello something is activated all the bad feelings memories foreign here we are and we come hello in Nemos we're gonna have these people over and then um we're thinking of every reason why kind of excuse can I come up with um nobody does you're giving it away because you're so quiet it's reading my mind I'm not a mind reader no no but I dealt with too many people and I'm here to tell you yeah how do we know when we've truly forgiven someone say yo and my mind you did that just to say faith but how do I know when I've really forgiven my brothers when we no longer seek revenge or punishment wait till you have your kids to pay for what you did you want revenge you want punishments not the mind of Christ hello everybody when I don't desire that for my brothers and I know that I've begun the Forgiveness of the forgiving process does God remember does God forget when we forgive a person it takes work to forgive a person I'm giving you the tools so that you can overcome these Devils they said this or they did this I'm going to say it again it takes work to forgive [Applause] here's the misconception of the mind of God oh God he just says takes it puts it in the sea of forgetfulness right that's the way he's God's all-powerful praise God listen listen closely because we're getting to the good part of them God can just take it and put it in the field and then we're free no no it don't work like that just so that you understand before you hurt someone there's a process do things right you don't want to have to go back and try to amend these things closer to this because this is this is where the message we're coming to now it takes time to forgive them to overcome those thoughts and memories they'll always come at us until we learn how to forget and to forget is not so easy but the only way to really forget only through love why do you think that brother Brown says nothing short of perfect love will be there why do you think the Bible says that the love of many will work yeah it's wax so cold nowadays that they don't know how to forgive anymore you can't forgive without love nope it takes more love to choose not to remember something to seek punishment or Revenge it takes more love once again to choose not to remember something then if we could just erase it from our minds and be done with it we all wish we could do that at times you're not willing to go through the processo oh we're gonna get something good right now I'm gonna say yeah in our finite Minds once again we think God just takes our sins no no there was a process to that you say well these thoughts and memories come at me constantly yes but we're always trying to deal with them with our finite carnal minds and our carnal finite Minds cannot forget anything talking about when it comes to what people did do to you then how does God how does God do it when Satan is constantly every day follows the accusing us before him look what they did Supermarket look what they did yeah God's standing there what is he doing the process has already has already been a process of Justified oh Church you gotta get this this is the message when we try to do it the way we fail but when we do it the way that God does Satan is constantly reminding him mystery here for you and I I Mysterio if we can get into his mind and understand the process to forget and through the holy ghosts more we're gonna bring it closer now this is our personal God is personal this is our personal God who Einstein didn't know and as smart as he was important knew nothing about this can a human being remind God of something come on can a human being remind God of something amen amen here David is remembering his youthful years he's probably writing this Psalm El Perales during the time that Absalon his son was rebelling against him and in Psalms 25 6. David simply says remember oh Lord a human being telling God remember remember thy Tender Mercies and thy loving kindnesses for they have been ever of old does God forget so he has to be reminded no no when a Son of God asked God to remember it is with all humility that he is asking him come on the scene in their time of trouble remember Lord thy Tender Mercies and after asking God to come on the scene David then asked God to forget something and remember not the sins of Mike oh how many of you this morning can just say that Lord remember not the sins of my youths aggressions how can to ask God to wipe his sins from his mind I don't know if you get that or not but this is not this is before the Messiah came this is before the Lamb of God came he knew it was coming and he's asking God not just to wipe his sins away to wipe them from his mind is it even possible that an infinite all-knowing God okay who knows the beginning from the end and knows all your sins and all our iniquities and our transgressions to actually forget them is that possible it's a mind that knows everything to finally forget something where did David get that thought from I'm reading this it floored me yesterday where did David get that thought from the thought that our sins could be forgotten be justified with God that's not an everyday thoughts something from God's mind could be removed you have a spiritual cap you know where I'm going with it our founding Pastor in the message Physicians only God has the power to forget all right if that power stayed in God I would not be an heir with God everything that God is he poured it into Christ everything so he had the faculty everything that Christ was he poured it into the church and one of the things he poured in was the power to forget and it's got to be in his church now David knew it was going to come inspiration that's why he says God justify me at some point I know you can do that he was waiting for that Redeemer to come why don't we see it in action the church today because the love of many has wax codes no justification then there has to be a process whereby we're not only forgivenado we're Justified that process of justification listen closely to this and that process of justification not only for The Sinner it is also for the Savior I don't know if you get that but I'm going to say it again is of justification because not just for the Sinners for the Savior justifies The Sinner not the same process wipes it from his mind there is nothing there ever what you and I did listen to this now this we got to get this now let's see how his mind works now I want the morning Stars sang together when they sing together and the sons of God shouted for Joy way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain and when God in his great things Cena shouting and rejoicing in our Salvation was through Jesus Christ Jesus you see he says then they say the book actually was planned the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world this book the Bible is really written before the foundation of the world being the lamb Christos was slain before the foundation of the world and the members of his bride their names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life whose number foreign and now it's being revealed whose names were Christo I'm gonna say it again now he says I've justified by the time it's manifested now Lord I I made a mistake says let me tell you that bride is not forgiving she's Justified hey yes he said that word Justified is because if I did something wrong and I correct it I can be forgiven but I'm not justified I'll always remember what I did but the Bride of Christopher says as if she never did it to begin she's Justified he never did it she was trapped into it sorry brother Branham and Emmanuel Branham this young lady she did this and this and this okay maybe God will show you something he prayed about it and they said did God show you something about it but he had repented he said nope there are some things that God won't even show his propheta and that's those things that have been confessed and placed under the blessings cannot show them to His prophets oh brother Diego I feel fantastic right now the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us the event began to unfolds justification in its fullness the process to justify us and when Jesus died now you get it Justified come on now you gotta fight get what I'm saying then again enemy with the word you remember you did this no he's Restless I never did it have been Justified how will you ever completely get a new purse understand what justification really is you understand it they've been Justified for the foundation of the world the fundamental foreign the process o he was wounded for our friends he was bruised Ferrari foreign you think he didn't go through a process so that he could forget [Music] no man knows that but those that have his spirit my Lord I'm running out of time already who cares is right but the word justify as though you've never done it at all and then the blood of Jesus cleanses us from sins that's forgetfulness I didn't get that I'm sorry because we write things in a book remember things how many of you have a diary don't raise your hand Nobody Does that no more huh yeah of course not there's nothing to Daddy no more everything's on Facebook oh Stan Facebook check it out check it out what I'm doing there's no shame anymore there's no secret things yeah forget it don't even let me go we'll just we'll go off on a deep end over there we write things in a book and then I read brother Branham say that the Rapture it's put in the book of God's forgiveness and I said wow he said he's the only one that can do is I said Lord you put it in a book we think it was just be out there is that's not a good thought not that it's a bad thought either but so when you think about this put it into a book of the sea of forgetfulness I said wow the book of God's forgetfulness how he wipes it from his mind look at what he went through when I realized so easy you know what the book of God's forgetfulness is Jesus Christ the same book it's the same Lamb's Book of Life how does he how does he wipe it away puts it into the book what's the book Jesus Christ what does he do he makes a way for you to be in Christ and when you come in Christ the same as the drop of ink yes that when it hits the blood goes back to the elements nothing left of that ink church that he went through the process when we come into him say it again when we come to him and dwell in him it is sins being put into the sea of forgetfulness he pulls us back out of him say it again he pulls us back out of him says this is my bride now this is Justified accusing us because they don't know they didn't no no I don't know they are Justified fungus difficult placed in that books been a wonderful audience a few more minutes just make sure you guys are on your toes brother Branham says this is you say well let me tell you what brother Brandon says I'm hearing you message the Rapture is as humans we can forgive but not forget I can forgive you but I'll always remember that you've done these evil things and you're not just you're just forgivenando and I say go back and read it again as humans we can forgive I'm going to say it again as humans we can forgive but when the mind of Christ runs into us we no longer use our finite brains Christ comes into us now we can forgive now we've learned the process of health is that right of God she's Justified it reminds me of Rock [Music] chops off his ears take that one Jesus said put that away put the sword away you want to use this word it's going to be used on you and justifies Peter Pedro foreign [Music] come on are you standing over here all bummed out and stop there is not what brother Brown says he said the blood cleanses us from all sins [Music] justified in his presence because the love of Christ has been shed in our hearts when I look at this I say wow and then I see a different word Isaiah 49 50. I'm going to finish now just just two minutes 49 15. they said the Lord hath forsake now how many spirituals I in the Lord has forsaken me and my Lord hath forgotten me God's response and a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb they may forget yeah will I not forget behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me we stand perfect foreign there was a man by the name he was a rabbi named Rabbi Akiva is he lived in the First Century A.D siglo and he was tortured to death publicly by the Romans why porque because he had refused to stop preaching and studying the Scriptures it was the time of saying the morning those of you know what the Shema is that's that's the prayer they make
