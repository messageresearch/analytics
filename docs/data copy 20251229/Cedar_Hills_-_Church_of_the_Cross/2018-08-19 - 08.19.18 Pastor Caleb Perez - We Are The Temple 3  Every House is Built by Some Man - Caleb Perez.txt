and so says but Christ as a son over his own house a more eco sobre su casa oh I wanna let that one sink in for a moment here is a key security Tova christ but now let me stop for a moment FM e para

Lema the seventh and God said let us make man in our image he usually who again was a long way and a straight man after our likeness this prison is testament once again you know this man but Christ as a son over his own house Pharaoh please talk more eco service to Casa whose house we are we like cuenta someone nosotros let us make man in our image llamo Salome dentistry mocking God then made a partnership with man it was as though she soon associate open el hombre and man must work along with Enoch attract a man must build along with Enoch a defeat but he must build according to God's plan or his pattern in EKG cardiac ward or London or Sudan how many of you have ever tried to build something but it is not that oh they have no plans or you didn't have a pattern to go by not the name patronum planned como Seguin it's called a prototype right salmon propose you build it and then it doesn't work very well then you crush it down you build it again and don't worry I will it again till you try to perfect it right well they say in a second leprosy then when something works properly when that buffoons you're not being then you make a pattern of it you know as whom patron and then you sell your product you know in this product and then everybody all it comes with a don't worry about it comes with instructions you know this isn't super convenient comes with his hat earned I mean why don't you follow wait a second okay it's no different with God no idea he had in his mind in his thinking Ellen cement in two pence and he had you and I it looked a near me I saw the finished product in me recruit or also new immune cells not the only way for this product to be finished Atticus - Brutus - IRRI follow me now though be built exactly to his pattern or his specification yes I said if you go there quite those who this platicas humans that's not hard to understand just one less dude oh they and their Psalms 127 one then goes on to say son most Encanto et cetera no DC that except the Lord build the house if you cut it like us nah they labor in vain that build it and bono trabajan loss can defeat ha so now we see is it God building the house is the most your success you know la casa or is it man building the house us make man in our image God or is it man it's yours wasted long and I say it is both good it's almost God made it like that y'all go east to us brother Caleb didn't come up with that idea in the motel is no a new car and his word came up with that idea no sensible understand yo Knesset a God said if your Z except the Lord build the house a little ski in a gala custom they labor in vain that building especially look at if you can't draw ah now we're understanding nice time wasn't Indian without the church's when we look around today in Las Iglesias condo Marimo central churches are built by men less delicious donations per hombre is that right and then all kinds of churches I Mucha see because one man had a better idea than another man they think do anything ok no cost so they began to build their churches impersonal enthusiasts yes the very teachings are patterned after some man's idea business against us eternal patron delight there's no become idea some creat some is art monkey there scare those adult men's the churches today are built upon those things let's see let's destroy its women if you can spare a stone and when you look at that he comes to me that it makes you realize how important it is listening then they're gettin important even the prophet of God would say it matters who teaches you professor uses here important in this because every house for Caracas is built by some man you know I don't care whose house it is input that the keys every house is built by some man like a censorship or a good man if it is not made after the patterns you know such a trestle petrow then the man that is laboring is laboring in vain entosis Ilkeston if acondo is trabajan bad no our own bodies have been created by God no stress propio square plus 4 on a chose Portillo yet what have we done with our bodies que hemos hecho con nuestros propios square plus he who destroys their body God will destroy them & Canas to use to prop you quit boy sailor so as human beings we complain a lot somos de menos que vamos we complain because our clothes don't fit how much particular group I don't know skele hmm every house is built by some man cousin if you cannot put on hombre and we eat and we eat and we eat and we don't watch nothing if command was you come every known as feeling that were upset because I we can't close our pants you know what humble zipper doesn't close unless you're ready Perry what's going on whose fault is that God the king is not goodbye adios no no we complain because we feel sick no scammers

efika what happens fear do you live in and can mostly reveal yourself why do we complain porque no scammers were the ones that built it that way someone localized if he Commerce we chose to eat each meal Eskimos not American see the last time we're ever gonna eat so much you soluti more plat ok convey that caranavi that guilty of that give me another serving of that oh so good another serving oath reply to this and then the next and then that night I just can't sleep you know she nope no heartburn oh I'm not so good let me see it to the end as we go from the table straight to bed and oh ok

feeder to do and to feed ourselves the way we do s cojemos como elementary knows we also choose what to feed our inner man the man is cohere musky that let it come in a letter can you watch all kinds of feel fun TV minute or cleansin there was food and let the levy start to pick up the word and and read the world Oh question comes what kind of house have we built let's kick let's say because I was living fellow don't deceive yourself this morning no saying that use them easements or whatsoever a man soweth he's gonna repo ok long block what's the chat I look out in the audience in and I see many households do you mean all of this is coincidence maybe I don't know there's probably we average around 70 to 80 households here I think almost a tenth our chin tacky and in and as I look at and I realize every single house every household is built by some man cuz I said chaperone hombre yes sir yes I mean you with me it's not going to be there's peace in the home the ice fast enough that somebody has has created that ugly knock like any other there's violence in the home some man has done that see Ivy Lane sialic acid algún hombre comment soy so are you with me esta conmigo every house is built by some man very such a pollutant hombre and the question is have you fashioned it after the pattern that God gave which is his word Laputa Celaya to state the comfort milk patron Keith use do jesus said my sheep hear my voice mr. Wilkins onion my voice and a stranger's voice they're not gonna follow Allah was the arguments no one esta here yet we are open to so many voices that all numbers are here to certain times verses and without realization intended all those voices losses as both days are building a house and Levant and una casa are you with me están conmigo will listen to every preacher on TV of man oh you must not fight and when we look at it defend or the end result that it does not match God's Word that's the pattern but we have simply got a bunch of ideas inside of us lamenting Mucha ceases somewhere along the line one wall is crooked when I become independent Russia's coming down don't close right here what's going on esta pasando my sheep hear my voice mr. letters onion me was because every house is built by some man okay Casa Poonam watch where we're going this morning thinking send along the bamboo system mañana IIIi love God's Word I'm monopolizing watch you where he takes us phasing out in no jibba you get people that come to the pasture Ben I can't al pastor and the pastor I gotta say these things sorting ok seriousness Moses asked me questions about their wives masam preguntas their husbands this was gone you guess their children this was Tico's they ask for advice they import consejo concerning their marriages matrimonials discusses and then they go out and they do the exact opposite in Lagos LaVon yes an extract I meant a low contrary oh and I look at those things your meat OSS coarseness and I say yo they go in vain work at the labor and bono trabajar LK if he God has not built that house there's no idea because economy III look at those things yo middle school and I have to come to a conclusion you think ok I'm gonna completely and it's hard to come to this conclusion yes do rigorous tests conclusiveness because either I'm not their Shepherd or no so you old bastard a knows they're not a sheep or no saloon oh wait huh or they haven't got a revelation of it yet oh not in another village something I'm not gonna throw more drum to the side no no way I'm and then I gotta keep working think okay see is trauma handle but the person has to come then to the
