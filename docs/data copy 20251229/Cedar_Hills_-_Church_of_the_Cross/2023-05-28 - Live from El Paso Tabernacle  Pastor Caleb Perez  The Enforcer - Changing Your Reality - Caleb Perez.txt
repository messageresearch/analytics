up you know he he had a kind of a big mouth but I didn't know that he was going to be a great preacher a great preacher has a big mouth like brothers he preaches he says like my father is that's good that he had finished everything one of five years is my friend amen amen God bless to be here with brother Adolfo is I'm very happy to be here with Bertha Elf On You esposa and his precious wife how many knows that brother adolfo's wife she's something else I love sister Thelma I like the way she is she's my friend yeah God bless you brother [Applause] thank you [Applause] Naomi amen God bless you this uh this afternoon my interpreter I better wait for him amen amen it's a pleasure to be here with you all is I don't know how he expects me to preach after after hearing that is still very fresh but we are here at our postal Duty and we are grateful to God for a friend is the video that he I think may God bless you yeah hey man how many happy to be here amen just turn around and smile at your neighbor that's your neighbors amen amen and would you stand as we as we see what the Lord has for us tonight each and every one of you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for the confidence to permit us to preach and to use this sacred desk is after hearing those the two fine messages God bless you for for letting the Lord use it I can give one to the Lord Jesus wow wonderful foreign anyone that's here as long as one person is blessed and helped that's all we want us so in the message that that uh this is the unfailing realities of the Living God brother Branham we know those you that have heard the message brother Branham uses the scripture John chapter 4. and in there of course it's the woman at the well and my goodness you could go so many ways with this message and but here we find in John chapter 4 if you can turn to it on the 23rd let's let's just read the 23rd and the 24th verse when you have it you can say Amen now we already know the story yeah so we are seeing a woman her reality is is not a very good reality maybe all the bad decisions she made in life not a very good reality but all of a sudden she meets up with a man that she realizes is more than a man is the god man it is the god Prophet is you know we know the the conversation that went on but it comes down to worship and so let's let's read the 23rd and the 24th verse and it says but the hour cometh when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father's seeketh such to worship Him is a spirit can you repeat that and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth if you worship only in spirit you don't have a complete reality if you worship just in truth your reality is not unfailing but when you can worship in spirit and in truth now as I look into the audience tonight I see a lot of people and each one of you is living a certain reality I believe tonight that the Lord Jesus is about to do something that's going to rock our world you see because the Lord Jesus the Bible says is the same yesterday today and foreign cannot leave when brother Branham left the scene am I talking to anyone tonight I'm going to say it again he did not leave and the prophet of God left the scene nor did he leave when brother Tommy left the scene but he's the same just as much today brother says in every detail except the literal Corporal body now I believe that there are going to be realities that are going to change tonight and I want to know is there anyone here that can be honest I can raise your hand and say I need a change in my reality let me see your hands you see because we as humans we're getting through these routines and we go to church and after a while what am I getting out of this and we go home and it just seems to be the same routine and we go to work and then sometimes we ask this is there must be more to this than what is going on in my life I believe he's about to change some reality when we ask the question and we say well what is my reality an older person can say well is this all there is to life the younger maybe will say well I just want to have a good time those and many people think because as I said that that they've made some bad mistakes some bad choices that they have to stay a prisoner to their reality but I'm here to tell you tonight you don't have to stay a prisoner to your reality I want you to turn to your neighbor and tell your neighbor you don't have to stay a prisoner to your reality tell your neighbor neighbor I want my reality to change tonight I I don't know if you if you believe me or not I'm gonna say it again there's gonna be some realities that are changed tonight and my question is is it your reality or is it yours or who's reality I mean I want to talk to Believers tonight how many believers do we got here now what I'm trying to do is raise your faith to show that it is possible for your reality to change things gotta change tonight because the faith or what we claim we have sometimes doesn't seem like it's enough Something's Gotta change come on now we gotta get out of our routine we're going to get to that in a moment but as we talk about the Holy Ghost how many of you have the Holy ghosts the Holy Ghost is the enforcer it is [Applause] but the Holy Ghost is not in his office unless he comes and dwells in someone hello everybody you've got to come and dwell in someone it is a vessel to use therefore when he comes in the Believers the believer then becomes an enforcer of the claims so my question is tonight how many of you are enforcers oh oh yeah okay how many of you have the Holy ghosts let me ask you a question again how many of you have the Holy Ghost because we may have to change our subject and talk about receiving the Holy Ghost yeah we can't go on if we if if if we're not fulfilling this part first how many of you have the Holy Ghost then how many of you are enforcers wait wait a minute I'm sorry there's a disconnect here there's a disconnected because the number of people that raise their hands that they have the Holy ghosts so the number of people that say uh that that say if I asked are you do you are you an enforceros Santo okay how many are enforcers you can't have the Holy Ghost and not be an enforcer no president Elizabeth okay we gotta we gotta settle this before we get into it you've got to go God's provided the problem is is that people want to go their way because we live in a day and age as we were hearing this morning our young people have it 10 times worse than we did and we live in a world that people are constantly saying you've got to manifest your own reality anybody heard that um you haven't been living under a rock or something how many hear that this is my reality is this is my truth hello young people hola Joven is I feel for you all because uh that's all there is out there now nobody knows what a woman is nobody knows if they're a man oh come on well this is my reality that's right and we're gonna go to hell with our realities because you cannot meet the challenge of the day you can't meet the challenge of the hour if you have the reality of the world now your reality has gotta change there's no way you'll meet the challenges that are out so that's why we're here tonight they say listen you got to manifest your own reality positive thinking oh come on I'm dead I I gotta say all this before I get into this yes I got to make sure that you all are with me here yeah positive thinking right nothing wrong with positive thinking about negative thinking the problem is is that you're trusting in your positive thinking and if you're not born again then even though you have a positive thinking your reality is flawed well my professor told me that um hello hola Suave man oh my teacher told me that I'm in my ass wonderful are they born again or not um do they have the Holy Ghost spirit to Santa then they're trying to enforce something on you that if you don't watch it your reality becomes influenced ah here's the woman at the well she had made many a mistakes she had made choices that that she shouldn't have made decisions here comes a man that begins to tell her you've had five husbands so it's not even yours what [Applause] and I would give you living water he's about to change her realities tell your neighbor he's about to change her reality are you with me reality is about to change you want a good reality I'm going to tell you how this is what he said come on seek first kingdom of God and it's righteousness and all these other things will be attitude what part of that reality don't you understand this listen this is my reality my truth and the sad thing about it is that same way of thinking yes has infiltrated the churches oh I'm letting that settle for a moment for for a reason now we don't need a pastor no more yeah oh come on church I'm the league yeah that is a failing reality that is not the unfailing reality of a living God it's not no Lewis hello hola you begin to form your little ideas or your your little ideology and your truth becomes warped it is I don't need propheta oh I I I believe in the prophet but we don't need a fight for Ministry ministerio oh come on Angeline you know what I'm talking about what's out there and a lot of people have a reality that's warped it's a reality that's been tampered with an image I don't know if you how many of you believe me [Music] watch now while I'm preaching you check yourself let every man examine himself you got to do that today because realities are changing what's true for me or what is true to me I'm based on my own understanding and experiences truth to those things you see when you talk about truth and reality the first thing you got to know is that is your reality subjective or objective come on now I I want you to see this because people are blinded to things I I have to put this now I gotta I gotta say this a subjective reality says that something is actual depending on my mind come on now it's dependent on my mind it's the inner world of my mind my thoughts it's the world of emotions it's the world of feelings that compose our thoughts okay opinions judgments influences YouTube YouTube you can learn anything on YouTube that's right it's got some good things yeah but it's got some bad things part of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil yes but you can see how far the reality is because it's been tainted with man-made ideologies religions and beliefs the problem is is that we try to use that to approach God no problem is and form their own Fashions and their truths foreign but the problem is this after they tell you what they claim that they believe I'm hitting home with you young people because after they tell you oh this is what you should do this it is am I talking to anybody here enough time yeah all right just be yourself but notice the people that tell you that is they have to use drugs because they don't like the reality they've created and so they're trying to get you to come to the same reality and then they can't function without CBD did I say that out loud that one didn't go over very good yeah you wonder huh we better change our realities so they began to use drugs and alcohol and alcohol go to porn all these things so this has caused us because they're trying to get away from their reality they're looking for a way of escape and then they'll turn even to a virtual reality oh this is your generation they go now to a virtual reality because in the virtual reality you can act like God you can control everything you can create your own environment your own atmosphere there yeah and it's a way to get away a way to escape your reality but yet God gives you something far greater who gives you his holy spirit and he wants to give it to you [Music] okay we're barely getting warmed up now okay they never realize that's their subjective reality has been influenced and there are so many influences everywhere you turn whether it's a woke whether it's cancel culture oh it's even in religion is Mama come on we can become churches that's my reality wonderful Church doesn't equal unfailing realities uh I go to church the devil's here before you and yeah okay okay oh but there and there is an objective truth an objective reality that is not based or influenced by your personal feelings or emotions it's not influenced by what the world says what the church says it is the reality no matter if people realize it or not accept it or not he'll accept us or no God is God and there's nothing whether you feel good or bad it doesn't influence it is an objective truth is an objective truth whether you accept it or not or Jesus that God has placed in the church foreign what happened your reality was influenced by your feelings that's why the Bible says that those that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God not those that are led by emotions those that are led by the spirit today they are the sons of God now watch this now it takes somebody with a holy ghost to begin to enforce the claims we're going to get into our message now take somebody with the Holy ghosts to be able to enforce the claim as Christians we claim a lot of things we do that oh he's my healer oh come on now you know who I'm talking there's got to be somebody that can claim Force the promises [Music] and this is what got me about this message this message he starts here and he starts off praying for little children those of you that have read it and watch he's looking at these children and his heart goes out to them because he sees the reality of that of those children that if someone doesn't step in the bridge for them their reality don't look good he starts off the message like that go and read it if you haven't read it he knows that he's got to enforce the claim yes I'm here tonight not just to pass time I'm here to join my faith with yours so that we can enforce the claims foreign and he knows he's got foreign he didn't say Jesus he said I am going today for Jesus Christ see we are claiming her this morning how many sick people do we have here come on let me see your hands stand to your feet if you're sick come on I'm challenging you come on now oh there's more people I know I must just say I know come on come on who else and the first thing we think about is oh sick of the body there are people that are sick in their minds right now come on now stand up there are people that are sick in their souls you've gotten away from God we're going to come together as a body of Believers this is the Holy Ghost in his body that is going to make claims today I'm going to claim these people for Jesus Christ we are claiming them for the kingdom of God and this prayer of faith is zeroed in the name of the Lord Jesus strike you in this people's body wherever you're here you devil you will be uncovered and brought out these people this is the name of Jesus will be made well tonight Jesus receive your healing oh I'm joining my faith with yours foreign receive what you asked all right now let's go on here he continues praying for the people now he's praying for people the same message he's praying for people that are standing for their loved ones oh come on come on if you're a Believer it's the time we enforce this is still alive because he is here [Applause] yeah I'm telling you this is changing realities right now oh I can feel that I feel him moving around people coming back to the Lord now that's a challenge to yourself We join our faith together something's got to change we cannot meet him the way that we're going to say hold on to it don't you lose it hold on to it right now watch it's time to change your reality David was a Shepherd boy his reality that he would be a Shepherd his whole life and all of a sudden a prophet shows up the Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals His secret unto his service he takes him from being a Shepherd come on now when you think you have a dead end a shepherd Andre all right [Applause] you don't sound excited and if you want to be a king she wants to be a king who else anybody wants to be a king the Bible says the unfailing realities he has made you Kings and Priests what's the problem foreign [Music] watch this now come on now go to the back this brother needs something I want you to see this because this man here is he's typifying Christ he's coming come on which sister here needs something from the Lord right here okay there you are stand to your feet now Jesus is coming to meet her need he's coming to meet her need because he has seen a vision that this daughter is going to be made whole blessed now tonight same Lord Jesus is going up and down the aisle he came to bring healing to bring reality he came to change the reality that's what the vision shows foreign foreign [Applause] she was not part of course Jesus [Applause] ASAP four three dollars [Applause] yourself into the vision hello she forced herself into the video and her reality change [Applause] maybe the vision shows her because but if you can force yourself into the vision tonight she received a change come on now I'm gonna hit this part foreign he said a family of drunks was his reality to follow the footsteps of his Earthly father but all of a sudden in the tree hahaha there was divine intervention and from the tree that don't you drink or smoke or defile your body in any way I'll tell you all of you don't go out there and drink and smoke or defile your bodies because God has a work for you in your Generations do you believe that this is for your generation he took him from that family and said I need you somebody change your reality because you're going to play the part of the seventh Angels the same thing he did with Paul what did he do okay he was going and killing the the the the Christians yes I'm gonna get to one last part don't let me lose you here because something is about to happen watch this now I want you to get this now when we see this the word of God is the basis for reality there is no basis outside the word that's why I tell you young people old people the middle age just get the word inside he knows what to do now watch here's where we're going to separate the men from the boys are you ready we're gonna hit this part and then I'm gonna and then we're gonna finish here the word of God comes to who oh I'm sorry I I got off the wrong exit the word of God comes to who some of the time all the time he doesn't change his mind about his words and the prophet El Prophet is a Divine interpreter or a revealer of the word can I get somebody to agree with that that's an objective truth it's not up for debate yeah you know that's the way God does things the word comes to the propheta foreign now in the first seal here's here's what the prophet of God says when the first seal was opened it opened in symbol forms come on now now we need you Eagles to start flying come up a little higher with me now it opened in simple forms the sill being open in symbol forms then he goes on to say now what about when it's open in its reality form oh church I'm gonna say it again amen the unfailing realities but now it's opening up in his reality foreign if it thundered back then in symbol foreign [Applause] is this reality foreign foreign what good is the message if there's nobody to hear it if there's nobody to make it a reality [Music] oh come on I'm gonna say it again what good is the message there's nobody to hear it he said take the little book he said that is open in the hand of the Angels take it and eat it eat all of it eat everything that the broth that the prophet brought that's the only way is that the message becomes reality because you and I because we are the message oh come on am I talking to somebody here but it takes somebody to enforce it oh watch this now watch this now we're coming around the corner here's my father I guess and there's a there's a person that is possessed she as our pastor is confronting her she takes the Bible and she rips it right in front rips into pieces and throws it looks and our founding pastor says you can rip this that's just papering he said but this has become this is okay [Applause] now I'm gonna finish up here brother well I I've got about 10 minutes and I'm done are you with me okay here we go now we're gonna finish up with this now when it goes from symbol to reality it's now becoming the unfailing realities what does the revealing of the word show this is important here's brother Branham in the second seal God will do nothing until first he reveals it to his servants the prophets here's what I'm getting and when he reveals it to his servants the prophets and before he does it and he says and when he reveals it you can remember this okay he's telling you remember this according to this you can remember this something is on its Road well the prophet of God came that was the message of the seventh Angels who reveal the word I say we got it he revealed the word yes but remember this when he reveals it something is on its Road oh yes I want to know what's on its Road what is he waiting foreign come on what were they waiting for the lamb to come forth when the lamb came foreign and the Lord simply says this what are my unfailing realities I'm going to ask you that question what are his unfailing realities turn around and look at your neighbor you and I are the unfailings of the Living God Shake the hand of an unfailing reality of the Living God I caught what some of you were thinking we fail all the time I caught that Spirit we were failures we fail all the time let me tell you what brother Brandon says he simply says this we foreign [Applause] [Applause] now I end with this now the pianists you know us preachers we get going We Can't Stop almost but I will tell you this is the living realities that are on the road notice what he says here and I got to read this for you can just take brother calebs he says this an identified Masterpiece of God may you mold men into the image of sons of God oh granted Lord great sculptor is you're the only one can do it take your word and mold it right into the hearts of all of us we might be your masterpieces in the last days and be called the bride of Christ that the other men may see that there is such a reality who is that reality the Bride of Jesus Christ foreign when did Ali user call her to be the bride at evening time okay realities are changing now and then brother Branham begins to sing the song it shall be light should I lose come on if you know it sing it with me it shall be light about the evening time the revealing of the word and then brother Branham says [Music] was the beginning of it CPU you want your reality to change that and so it was the beginning of it but now Aura she's faded on into the bride tonight that is his reality this is
