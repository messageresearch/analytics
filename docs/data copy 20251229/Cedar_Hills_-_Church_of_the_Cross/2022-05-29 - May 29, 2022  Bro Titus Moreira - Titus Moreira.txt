follow [Music] our lord jesus christ [Music] maybe not a book we read very often we'll be reading from the book of ezra normally when i preach here english god gave us this message in spanish i want to preach it in spanish i give thanks to brother caleb for the opportunity thomas junior uh my brother william on our lord jesus christ to give you a little bit of context happening a little after daniel just is some of them were ready to return regarding the prophecy or according to the prophecy that jeremiah now these are the children of the province that went up out of out of the captivity of those which had been carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away unto babylon and came again unto jerusalem and judah everyone unto his city we'll be speaking with our theme starting again let us pray father [Music] in the name of jesus christ amen is in our lives this is god is not many a very difficult time in their lives the first temple they built was the temple of solomon have been destroyed in jeremiah's time and he time in babylon they have the vision but vietnam refuse of darius understood by books where the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet daniel was around 68 years old in babylon he was he had been 68 years ago he spent 68 years in babylon the 70 years weren't fulfilled yet they can prepare two years later [Applause] is casino we don't fast for me i say for myself i know that there's some warriors of fasting in here but when we see daniel fast that lets me that's what fasting is about of this earth [Music] confusion who was first movement and now we come to ezra chapter two el for the first time you right but it's more difficult to be excited we speak about restoration the definition of the word lets us know that can be an avedo daniels that there are damages restoration things that didn't come out the way you wanted them to and then it's more difficult to be excited over a restoration there there are memories that state of what happened so when i read ezra chapter two esto son lo sijos de la provincia these are the children of the province estos de la province these are the children of the province i went up out of captivity the chaos of those which had been carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away unto babylon and came again unto jerusalem and judah everyone unto his city that god can still do it the temple restaurant restore the city travel almost 1 000 months of walking there were about 50 thousand los que salero the ones that left it was a very small number compared to all them that stayed in babylon a very small number or smashing kids on the walls they were raping women they were taking the people of israel captive it was horrible and some left for you that's why you are here there may be neurotics where you can't even get your mind together is maybe children oh i am proud all of them [Applause] it's hard to make people excited the expectations are very low so very low it's i'm not as good as people think i am but i'm not also as bad as people think i am feel good about what about me many times we complain is it was only a crib that old temple was just a cradle what job chapter 8 says verse 7 job 8 should greatly increase come on to stay as a child [Applause] is need of milk inode elementos and not of strong meats for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe though but strong meat especially belongs to them that are of full age even those who by reason of the youths have their senses exercised notice what it's saying if you're going to be great if you're going to grow who knows be the predator [Applause] devils [Applause] he wants limiting you [Applause] seem great let me tell you it was too small oh a greater plan for your life more beautiful israel and the church oh they believe in theology you can't speak [Music] something that's hung along and had a lot of this embalming fluid do

oh to be free we can imagine the church pentecost today stands i believe three years ago the sunday visitor of the catholic church said that they had a million conversions to catholicism in one year but but the pentecostal church had one million five hundred thousand more than that but what have you got when you got it in other words the church today is not willing to pay the price it demolishes things around us when he shakes zumba he almost brings us down and i don't know what i'm speaking i can be one person maybe someone watches in that condition could ever imagine they realize depends on
