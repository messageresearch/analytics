the service from here good evening to each and every one of you may the Lord Jesus Christ bless you I want to tell you that I am with fear and trembling I am happy emotional Joy because when we speak about we speak about the Lord's Supper the words of the Lord come to me when he said in one of the gospels how much time have I desired for this how long have I desired for this time how long how long have I desired for this time for which time which moment for the moment to have communion if we open up our our Bibles in St John Chapter 13 starting with verse 3435 we're going to find some scriptures that I know we know by memory and we have read them many times but we the question is have we understood it what makes this event so great communion it's the the sacredness the solemnity it's what brother Brenham taught us uh according to communion when in the church it's announced that we are going to have communion it's a time as Believers we have to prepare ourselves the scriptures tell us I'm going to ask you if you can stand we're going to speak for a few moments minutes [Music] I want you to notice in what situation Jesus said these words Jesus was not in a Revival he was not in a church or a synagogue Jesus was in the upper room where only his disciples were with him where his friends were with him and this is where when Jesus said these words after they had communion a new commandment I give unto you Jesus never said I I'm I'm going to ask you for a favor uh here I am that if you want to Jesus says a new commandment I give you I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another that the Lord Jesus add the blessing to the reading of the lord of the word you may be be seated I know you didn't cap capture I'm going to read it again what Jesus gave us to Diego to Tom perz Jesus gave a new commandment because I was there were you there a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another not just any way don't love each other the way you want to inspiration and Revelation as I Jesus the master as I have loved you as I with my love as I have loved you love each other one another that's why this could not be pronounced in another condition I want you to see your brother I see my precious brother here and I feel honored that it is my duty to to love this brother to love my sister not until she offends me but with love that surpasses all understanding I want you to notice in the way that the Lord has invited us how we should love each other one thing that Satan cannot do he is the best preacher someone wants to be the best preacher uh they already beat you the best preacher is Satan that we all know that in his first sermon he deceived a third part of Heaven someone can do that Satan can imitate every gift he can come here see like no one else he can can manifest all the gifts he can come here and sit here it's that I'm I'm I've been here 20 years they already beat you s Satan has 6,000 years but there's something that Satan cannot imitate love one another as I I have loved you the disciples didn't understand but after three days when they saw that body everything that he suffered when he they heard the the shouts the The Cry of pain they did not understand when they saw that PR blood that was shed all over the walls love as I have loved you and there is no greater love that puts his life down for his friends first Corinthians 11 and 29 and 30 the Apostle Paul captures the Revelation solemn uh event and notice how he presents it and in verse 29 he says for he that eateth unworthily without Discerning not Discerning the Lord's body eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself I know that some of you did not capture it for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily for them that are going to eat or are going to drink unworthily who are they Paul says not Discerning the Lord's body the Lord's body without Discerning the body of the Lord what body is he speaking about brother Diego the body that was hanged on a cross of the Lord he himself placed God bless you brother greeting others prophets others pastors and teachers doern the body of the [Music] Lord they drink unworthily I want you to see your brother that's to the side your sister that's to the side you know who you're seeing I'm not seeing my precious sister everything that was in God he placed it in Christ and everything that was in Christ he emptied it out in his church then here's my sister Jen but I'm seeing Christ he that without Discerning that if someone would speak badly if someone judges if someone points the if someone steals from her if someone defrauds her judgment he eats and drinks the body of the Lord Jesus why you should never think a bad thought of your sister I ask would you be would you be uh are you able to think of bad about Christ in his presence why do you think bad against your brother or sister why do you offend them and that verse for this cause many are sick weak and many sleep in another version they are dead see why the body of the Lord is the sickest don't don't blame your brother or the pastor or the Deacon or the minister you have discerned the body of the Lord then why are you sick and if you're sick and you have discerned the body of the Lord know that God has placed gifts in the church but when you speak against those gifts I'm speaking about all the gifts Ministries spiritual gifts and let me tell you brother Bram brother Bram says that each and every one of us has a gift and when you speak against that gift you dishonor him and the and the Bible says that God dishonors the person that dishonors him now before we enter into this solemn act if you have not discerned the body of the Lord yet if you have spoken something bad about someone here your brother or your sister or you have maybe SC been scandalized or is offended because someone maybe said something or you heard something or someone did something to you and you took a root of bitterness and you think that you can take the Lord's Supper you should fix it because if not brother Bram says of ananas and Safa will return that wine that we're going to drink has been prepared and consecrated to God it's bread that has been prepared and consecrated to God and you that have been warned that your duty as a Christian is to love love your brother your sister if you see them or them sick it should hurt you because you have to love them not as you want to but he has shown us how to love and how did he show us how to love brother Diego he was hung on a cross because he loved me as he loved me I have to tolerate and support until my brother reaches maturity I want to at this hour before we read the last part I have prayed to God and I have said Lord forgive our sins forgive our unbelief us to manifest you to the world and when I see each and every one in prayer Lord is there something that I have in in here and then because I'm going to have communion and Paul he warns us because as judgment you can eat or it's better that you discern first of all if you don't find yourself worthy it's better I don't say anything but if you don't take it you are then guilty but if you drink it unworthily also you're guilty because we are Christians brother there is enough power on the cross so that the sin question would be finished in each and every one of us and if there's something that we should do from this forward instead of wasting our time in dirty filthy things of the world is start to ask God will teach us how to love each other I said Lord I love everyone but I want today brother before we read the scripture to enter into communion because the Bible says confess your faults one to another Lord I I have nothing maybe but maybe I've done something that someone has been offended I always we always see our side but what if you have also offended if there's someone here that I have offended if there's someone that I owe money to there someone that I've done something against or I owe something to or if you saw me in a in a different place or with an incorrect person with all my with all my heart I want brother Diego I saw you I I I would I I would be happy if you would do that maybe I I don't I don't remember is is there someone here that offended with me stand to your feet tell me we'll pray together and we'll take communion together I want you to meditate for the next few minutes you have to fix you have to confess and you have to fix it this is not a another communion not even a beautiful Ser Ser Christ speaking to his people if I owe something to somebody I would be happy if you would stand to your feet I will not be ashamed if you have to fix something do it now the scripture says firstan 11 verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered un that the Lord Jesus the Same night in which he was betrayed with bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner to also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death we're going to pray Lord good evening we feel privileged because you have called us friends and you have invited us to participate of to participate in this solemn event which is to have communion with you take this Lord's Supper what makes it holy is because you are there that's why Lord I ask Lord that you will search us and that you will prick our hearts so that we could obey your word and if there's something we want to do from this day forward it's to learn and and and learn how to love one another as you have loved us now we can see this act Lord we prepare our hearts judge us lord judge us Lord I I make this humble prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that in this communion when your people participated your Prophet taught us that there's healing in it there's healing in when we discern the body bring healing to your body not only to the physical body but also the mystical body We Worship You Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
