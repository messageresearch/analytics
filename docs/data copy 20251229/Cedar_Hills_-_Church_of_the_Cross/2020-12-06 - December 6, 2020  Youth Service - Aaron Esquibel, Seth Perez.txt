quietest place you're ever going to live in lugar you go to hell it's going to be loud there you go there's going to be a lot of weeping a lot of crying and it reads like this see i see and he said a certain man had two sons this is jesus speaking luke 15 11. and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country party and their wasted substance with righteous living and when he spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in wand and he went and joined himself to a citizen in that of that country and he sent him into the fields to feed swine and he would feign have filled his belly with the husk that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him amen you may be seated i mean so i want to just share a little testimony you know our pastor was saying this morning how satan would love to just do away with the ministry the other day my wife was going to the dry cleaners to pick up some of my or drop off some of my suits and she took a route that she normally don't take it and she was sitting at a red well just seconds later a car came flying through ran a red light she had our children with her orlando it was just who knows what would have happened but god's hand was there and that situation was avoided so you know just we got to be ready we never know when god would call one of us home we gotta love each other take care of each other now i want to ask you tonight what are you expecting are you expecting just to come sit here and and just hear another sermon and go off and keep living the same way we're living ceremonies i want to read you something out of the message desperations brother branham says the signs of his coming should throw every member of christ into desperation now about our souls our well what are we going to amount to if we gain the whole world what are we living for de que estamos and so desperate for god is so desperate for that journal of life like we heard this morning to just drop down in our soul that we just read in luke chapter 15 in san lucas capitulo cinco and maybe just dramatize it a little bit and bring it to today so we find out that jesus is telling his disciples a parable of a certain man who had two sons and the younger son you know he gets this bright idea one day because in those days the sun always fell air to the inheritance and he gets this idea he says you know what is high school this message that my parents follow este mensaji mis padres segen this whole religion thing is it's not for me no espara me it's too strict who can live this message that the prophet talked about [Music] this ain't real so he said you know what dad why don't you just give me what pertains to me all that you've worked for all these years and it's my inheritance why don't you just give it to me and i'll just be on my way i don't i don't want nothing to do with this life jasmino porquino melo azami and you know the father he invested time in his sons he was heartbroken to hear this so what do you mean son why do you what do you want to leave for yeah there's nothing out there for a christian man like you no no christianity the father knew that once he got out from under the blood of his home every trap that satan had set out for him he was he was going to get him and the father knew that satan you have everything here you have a mother that loves you we have servants that feed you every day wash your clothes your mom stays home since you were little and takes care of you what do you have to what do you why do you want to leave us he says you know what dad i i just don't want this i'm i'm out of here and i i just want what pertains to me and i want to go illio he says well if there's nothing i can do to change your mind i'll divide the inheritance and you'll take your goods you know isn't that the way a lot of us get as young people i know i got there you turn because that's the age that the world says we can move out right and we've always done things according to what the world tells us you shouldn't leave your house no ideas they had to casa until you know for sure that you have the holy spirit old you have a car in car maybe you have a cell phone you're ready to go right with those two things that's all we need okay well what happens when you have to pay rent que what happens when you have to go buy groceries what happens when you have to put gas in your car gasoline the list goes on you have to estus that's the dumbest idea i've ever heard it is it really comes down to this one thing what is it that you want to do so bad that you can't do under the roof of your parents home why we know we want to get where we can do our little things in private enough to answer to anybody right and that's wrong we should know it be on a shadow of a doubt what we're getting into when we do those things in so you know the young guy decides i'm out of here i don't care what my parents say you know important i've talked to the pastor i don't care what he says i don't even care what my brother says all he did is he wanted his his allotted goods and he was going to just take off solo querias so i want to just tell you guys if you haven't figured it out we're talking about the prodigal son of land and the word prodigal means wasteful significa luxuriant luho hi rolling al alta a altafama or reckless disaster so that word reckless caught my attention disastrous some time ago i was listening to that song i'm sure you all have heard it and probably liked the song the reckless love of god right how many have heard that song how many likes is so i started to think about you know is god reckless coming and so i i wanted to see what the prophet had to say about it so i typed in the word reckless turns out he's mentioned it about 17 times and every time he mentions it he's referring to reckless driving reckless living reckless idiotic well-fed self-styled rock and roll gang sorry reckless careless life and reckless holiday i was like man that song's not good like god's love is not reckless knowing that the commandment was great but having assurance he could be fearless he could be as we'd call it reckless we he might break up against a hill that would knock him backwards so can the church of the living god be reckless and fearless oh he [Music] he says it's not easy for a person to go to hell no the first cigarette you ever smoked you knew it was wrong your conscience told you it was wrong but you continually run through the red light run over the barricades pasta his parents told him don't go that way son but his mind was already made up his ambition was to leave his household to ambition and do what he wanted to do yesterday so he leaves home and he gets the idea you know what i'm going to move to the city this town that we live in there's no opportunity the program i want to get into they don't even offer it at this college i'm going to move to the city the program no no no foreign and as soon as he gets there he's living it up he's got a pocket full of cash him and some buddies were going to rent a house they had it all ironed out well things are good for probably the first two three weeks they're having parties every night doing whatever they wanted to do they didn't have a job so they were just living off the inheritance but let's fast forward about three weeks and you find the same young man encuentros from all the friends left dolos amigos fueron stopped paying rent they all had to move out the party was all broken up he found himself in a terrible condition cinco de luca started doing things he never thought he would do haciendo took a little hit of weed smoked a couple cigarettes before you know he was so drunk he didn't even know his own name and all i could think about was his father's voice don't and all these memories started playing back when he was a kid going to church going to sunday school you know it's real fun when we can live under our parents roofs and go out and do what we want to do is maybe just mess around with sin a little bit knowing that we can go home to a nice clean house olympia where our mom maybe makes our bed but once you're actually living in the sin like brother will said some weeks ago you realize it's not so cute because you can't go home to that nice clean house anymore you're stuck in that pig and that's where this young man found himself in control he blew all the inheritance and brother branham says and the portion that he spent was really his father's el gasto so this guy didn't appreciate the inheritance that was given to him just as it is today our parents maybe get us a phone they get us a car what do we do we trash everything because we didn't work hard for it yeah we want it we don't take care of it that's the same thing that happened with this guy here because brother branham says tested faith produces goods his faith hadn't you know our faith must be tested so that we can produce our own goods that our faith can produce our our goods in our life you know this man went solo the bible says he went and joined himself with a citizen of the country and he began feeding his pigs his swine so um and he says and he would feign that word fame means with pleasure [Music] with pleasure he would eat the the husks that the pigs were eating he enjoyed what he was doing it's like when we go out and do the things that we know we shouldn't be doing we enjoy doing that why is that because inside each and every one of us there's a nature of a pig maybe you help out in service which is all good but until that nature of a pig that's inside of each and every one of us is where we do the same things that this young man did so you know he came in and he found himself in this condition and the bible says but he came to he came to himself you know he was sitting there estas in tandoyi brother branham says and the angel of god came to him he said wake up he talked to him he said oh why don't you just get back home to them parents of yours you know they've been praying for you why don't you wake up and get on home and the boy you know he began to think of his father he had servants and here he was living like a pig and he said man i can't go home look at the way i i'm living i don't have close fit to walk on the property of the where we live nothing buena they wanted him home more than he wanted to be home hello for all the goodness of heaven belongs to the church so he came to himself he realized you know what i don't want to live this life i've had enough i think i will go home so you know he goes he starts making his way home and the bible says and he arose and he came to his father and when he was a far ways off the father had been waiting there for him maybe every evening the father would go and pray in the window just praying that one day he'd see his son coming home this evening he was he was praying just like every other day and he looks up and here comes his son and the son comes and they embrace each other and he's so ashamed because he knew the life that he'd been living and his father right away says you know what this calls and you know what he did he went and slaughtered a fatted calf the best robe that he had on his son put a ring on his finger who said this one's mine he and it was a glorious time gloriosa and you see the father wanted him home more than he wanted to even be home so i just asked you this evening where do you find yourself maybe you say brother aaron i've never left home i've never done anything near as bad as this product well like i said as long as that nature's still inside of you the wages of sin is death we must come to a true repentance and that's just what this young man did yesterday as soon as he saw his father he said father forgive me i've sinned against heaven and that's the key there yeah we can repent all we want to god for the things we've done but until we repent to our parents confess the things that we've done wrong those things will just stay there i pray that this was a blessing for you this evening god bless you amen may god richly bless you it is surely a privilege to be here uh this evening it is a privilege to be here this evening amen it's an honor for me to uh to greet the bride of jesus christ yes amen would you please stand and let's let's get into right into the scripture to proverbs 18. 24. a man i'll wait till you guys get it you have it can you say man a man that had friends must show himself friendly amigos and there is a friend that stick it closer than a brother and if you could turn to proverbs 27 verse 9 proverbial the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word and he may be seated so today we're going to talk about friends vamos avalarde who is friendly today who has a lot of friends juantos amigos so the thing in now right with my young generation entonces la cosa principal con mi generation is the more friends you have mas amigos the better lo i don't think it's better but that's what they think yes and many choose after a lot of friends de muchos amigos because on their social media page they can prove socialism i have a thousand people following me and maybe you see you make a friend amigo you might see him at the store your parents are who's that oh that's my friend amigo i don't know about that i don't think they're going to be friend for that much longer because it's not about quantity it's about quality because you can have a thousand bet or a thousand bad friends amigos which is so much less than having one true friend yes so i want to take you on a little journey right because i'm going to list you all the different types of bad friends all right and you might find yourself where you're like hey i think i that guy used to make that example used to relate to me so a lot of people get misinterpreted or or use this phrase as an acquaintance they think that's their friend much but a quaintest is peru there's a familiarity with someone ayuna family but it's not a personal relationship you might have someone that's an appendage he's friendly because there's a possibility that an individual's success will help them maybe some of you might have somebody like that right a requirement placed on a relationship that depends on a certain need being met in a mistake someone that drains an individual of their energy essence or desire to move forward maybe somebody's negative right amigo negativo considers himself to be a friend but it's always pessimistic about things maybe you have a person that's non-committal it is always going back and forth on their belief it gives an impression of providing support but actively works to undermine i've had many of those friends if you want some good friends right amigos buenos amigos you can get the cheerleader right that's the type your boy is not the actual cheerleader right no this is a type okay provides direct moral support for someone's success maybe you want to hang out with good time charlie us and we're going to go out and release some stress and have a good time everybody usually you choose a friend of kindred spirit us someone that provides emotion emotional and spiritual support but there is one true friend that i have found um [Music] but i came to tell you of a mighty great friend it may be someone who you know right now because i don't have to pull a signal just to get in touch with him sometimes we have friends that way embezzles amigos we make excuses and we don't get answer the phone because we say we had a bad signal but this friend as we heard this morning he is available and he's approachable you can call him whenever you want us it doesn't matter the time of day no del important he's not closed on the weekends but you know he's always waiting i hope somebody calls me today i hope i can make make myself known to them today because he wants you he wants to know all of your troubles maybe he knows who this is but let me give you an example of people who have been friends why he might just call you by your name and raise you out of the grave well if you've been on a boat and maybe your life is rocking around i don't know if you believe me right now i was on a boat and sometime my life seems like it it doesn't all you had to do is just wake him up and he would calm your storm if you've been blind and this man's your friend yesterday hombres to amigo why he will just restore your sight to vista if you ever felt see us like you've been sifted like by like wheat he prayed that your faith would fail you yeah if you were found accused by the pharisees and sadducees or maybe just your brethren and they were about to stone you with their words why this and this man was your friend yes to amigo he would get down and ride in the sand is yeah amigo if you happen to be born in sin shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking lies and this man is your friend oh he would just come down from glory to gloria to become a man die on a cross he would [Applause] he's been your provider if you've been healed if you've been saved if you've been sanctified and you know this man is your friend but maybe somebody doesn't know who this is so tell me who is this friend no just tell me who just say who is this friend thank a friend we have in jesus amigo tenemos and jesus he wants to fellowship with you tonight and he said his precious blood for you to yes somebody knew who their friend was to amigo ain't nobody no i'm not yet do me like jesus is that anybody tonight ain't nobody tells me like the but you say brother the bible never said that jesus was getting crazy like you are la vivre he never acted like you know running around doing helicopters [Applause] so jesus he spoke these words jesus in john 15. this is my commandment that ye love one another that a man lay down his life for his friends amigos he said ye are my friends vosotros miss amigos if you do whatsoever i command you henceforth we heard this more this morning i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth for all things that i've heard of my father i have made known unto you porque de las cosas you know you appreciate the people that are around you for a good mom and dad the soul desires that they want the holy ghost for you to our pastor ami pastor who is preaching constantly behind his desk italian has to have a personal relationship with jesus christ and that's what we've been instructed to do because we believe it is some people don't want to be intimate or have a face-to-face conversation nothing like a hug i know because i'm a hugger that's just who i am but there's nothing like being in the presence of the lord that's the key yes you got to be in his presence in maybe you would like to know this friend are you tired of choosing but i invite you today jesus christ is a gentleman jesus christ and he wants to be your friend he has made himself available to you l-c-i-a-a-l-e maybe you already know him do you ever ask to restore the friendship between you and him you know because i have experienced this recently in my life porque yo e there's this is what the lord commanded us could you raise your brother from the dead maybe you see your brother going through a hard time josi gustave can you pray for them during hard times maybe things you could you dedicate because even though jesus does all these great miracles he's asking you to do a miracle and he wants you to live for your brother everybody loves jesus doing everything for them everybody praises him lord you're great you turned the water into wine but when he asked you pero quando that you to love one another i don't know lord it's kind of uh that brother he kind of irks me i don't know if i can do that it's hard lord i don't know it's difficult has anybody felt like that algebra just in closing would you bow your head si pueden inclinas rostros if you want the
