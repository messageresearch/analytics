declared to his [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] but god will never fail the prophet in the message the revelation of jesus christ page 33 if you want to mark it down he is quoting here the verse that i or the [Music] jesus is not revealing himself as three gods jesus now if he is beginning to speak here or what is called the trinity and i want you to open your bible to the 16th chapter of the book of revelation and in verse 13 it looks like this i see and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of a false prophet [Music] there was three [Music] [Music] without applying [Music] and go back to the first phrase that i read he says he said jesus is not revealing himself as three gods [Music] but one god and this was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but they changed the name they went right into the scriptures [Music] and they took out father son and holy god [Music] [Music] [Music]
