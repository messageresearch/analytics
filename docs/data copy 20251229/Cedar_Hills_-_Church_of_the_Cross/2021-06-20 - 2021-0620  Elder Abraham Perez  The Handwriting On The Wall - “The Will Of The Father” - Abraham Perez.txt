========================================

[Music] if [Music] i will surely never see again where shall we go my lord where shall we [Music] where shall we go to whom shall we go if we have the words [Music] i can't eat them [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] and uh now we're going to try tonight by the grace of god to take this fourth seal and um see what the holy spirit will have to say to us in it now i'm going to read that uh revelation is the sixth chapter and beginning with the seventh verse seventh and eighth there's always two verses the first is the announcement and the second verse is what he saw and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the force forth be say come and see and i'll look and behold a pale horse and his name that set on him that said was was death and hell followed him and power was given unto them over the four parts of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with beasts of the earth and um the fourth beast the living creature like an eagle said to john come see what the fourth mystery of the plan of redemption has been hid in this book and he said come and see the fourth mystery of the book of redemption that's been hidden in this book come see and john went to sea and he saw a pale horse and again the same writer upon this pale horse now he has a name called death now notice none of the other rider none of the other horses or no time that this rider ever ruled they didn't have that man had no name but now he is called death it's not mentioned he's revealed now what he is his death but now when comes forth the eagle age that's the one that god always likens his prophets to eagles he calls himself an eagle the eagle goes so high ain't nothing else can touch him not only is he up there but he's built for that position when he gets up right you see where he's at 68 million protestants as we talk from from uh smucker's uh uh glorious reform the or the mortality of rome last night we find that up to the 1500 mark i believe it was or 18 i don't remember exactly now but it was 68 million put to death to protest the first roman church oh no wonder he could in person now himself in the persified uh name of and call death he sure was now god only knows how many he calls to spiritually die by his anti-bible word teaching this is the one he put 68 million to the sword and killed and probably literally billions died spiritually on his false teaching no wonder you think the name of death the fourth stage of his ministry is called the beast and in this fourth horse if you'll notice all the first one was white and then the next one was red and the next one was black and the fourth one all of these other three was representing it because pale is red and and uh white and still mixed together see it it is all mixed in this one horse i want you to notice the four of them notice the off mark of four of the spiritual mathematics god is threes this is four he's in four here first antichrist white second false prophet red third biker of heavens and earth and purgatory black for the beast pale horse satan be kicked out of heaven if you want to read that revelations 12 and 13. satan being kicked out of heaven then in revelation 13 1 8 he is incarnate in the person of the beast he spurs the antichrist yes it's the teaching called nicole radia then he becomes from that to a false prophet if he's an antichrist antichrist is against anything that's against god's word is against god because the word is god and then when he come to crowning time then he become the false prophet of his antichrist teaching yep and he gets a sword because he unites his powers together then you don't have to ask nobody he's governor of state he is governor of heaven receives a triple crown mixes a separate idea called pregatory we fight and put it all down to the bible count his numeral numbers and everything else yuri's playing right back there is number four not number three number four see now let's turn revelations 12. let's just read this just a little bit because we will have time to do it and uh let's read uh revelations the 12th chapter and the 13th verse and when the dragon saw that he was cast out into the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child now i see he was cast out of the earth and becomes incarnate as the antichrist spirit become incarnate into a man that man changes from one thing to another from an antichrist spirit to a false prophet and then the beast comes into him now we find out here that this satan after being kicked out of heaven incarnates himself in the beast and now he is a beast antichrist false prophet and now beast and given the name of death and hell followers fully satan only strong oh my on the earth the satan representative on the earth that he now is head of the kingdoms of the world the very same kingdoms that he offered to the lord jesus and matthew 4. satan now becomes a full king all right notice now he'd be given a heart of a beast at that time and satan will incarnate himself because when the church goes up satan's cast out it's done man all this accusing is done see as long as as long as the intercessor is still on the throne satan can stand there and accuse because he is the attorney of the other side he is the opponent of christ but when our lord appears here on earth he'll be riding on over so white horse and you'll be completely fully the emmanuel the word of god incarnate in a man how much different there is that's the difference though notice the enterprise is on a pale horse mixed color a horse is a beast that represents a power his power is all mixed up what it's politics um it's national powers it's uh religious powers it's demon powers it's all kinds of powers mixed together a mixed pale horse was he's got all kinds of powers but when jesus comes it's on a one solid course the word amen fourth stage of the rider watch the fourth stage of this rider is called death death means eternal separation from god that's what death means to be eternal separated from god separation from god is dead eternal death and this fellow is called death so keep away from me amen there you are friend here's a fourth seal open and the riders of the four horses is revealed to the best of my knowledge now this is all that took place on earth next seal we see is in heaven where souls are under order [Applause] hey man that's all standard our feet how many enjoyed that this morning amen why don't you turn around and smile at one another just greet each other in the name of the lord jesus

beginning i write unto you young man because you have overcome the wicked one i write unto you little children because you have known the father i have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i have written unto you young man because you are strong and the word of god abides in you and you have overcome the wicked one jose escrito vosotros padres conocidos love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him noah for all that it's in the world the lust of the flesh and the last of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes away in the lost thereof but he that do the will of god abide us forever little children it is the last time and as you have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time hitos but they were not of us or if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all about salieron de nosotros but you have an ancient from the holy one and you know all things now

i'm not blind to this [Applause] this is the beginning this will be my my first i'll probably preach a series of messages you know on the dispensation in the dispensation because the handwriting on the wall is the beginning and ending of the gentile dispensations dispensation so [Music] what is the purpose that god put each and every one of you here on earth it is to do the will of the father yes ephesians 6 1. children obey your parents in the lord for this is right obedience honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou

colombia una conference in bogota colombia i was supposed to give a conference to the married couples enriquez so this is the scripture i used over there yes yes ephesians 5 31 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and the two shall be one flesh notice how it reached norteco this is a great mystery yes but i speak concerning christ in the church respect nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wives see that she reverence her husband thank god tell me that your grandpa sister ruth and the
