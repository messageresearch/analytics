Jump Right In Here where we left off and maybe we'll just title this in different title tonight uh the Reason God reveals our thoughts the Reason God reveals our thoughts and don't forget in this series is actually coming from a series that I'm bringing out of Psalms one the reason we're into this thing about the thought life is there's one scripture in Psalms one one through three that talks about the man that is blessed and it talks about where he positions himself and it talks about him thinking upon the things of God and meditating upon them day and night and so because it's emphasizing a blessed man's thought life being under control I thought it necessary to take some time in our thought life and so but we're in the series if you want to be reminded of what we're going back to it's this blessed man of God who walketh not in the accounts of the ungodly nor sinneth in the way of the seed of the scornful and so it's all about position it's a blessed man it's a Believer but you have to position yourself correctly and he chooses to position himself away from the seat of the scornful away from the gossipers can you say Amen out of the counsel of the ungodly out of the way of Sinners he's distance himself as much as he can and positioning himself away from those influences I think we need to do that the second verse says and on his law his Delight is in the law of God his Delight is in the word but on his law it's not just he Delights in it it's not just that I love the word I like to go to church and I love to hear the preaching of the word but he actually when he goes home it's not just that he goes to church and listens to the preaching of the word he actually says I want to meditate on this day and night praise the Lord this is here this is a serious fellow here this is serious it's not just saying yeah I love the preaching and enjoying your preaching brother Paul and I love to come and hear it and all these other no he's taking he's saying I want my thought life to be invaded I want my thought life I want the word not just to be a hearer of the word but a doer and I want the word to consume my thoughts more and more so that's where I got this series on our thought life and it's becoming such a wonderful subject personally for me I will say though that what but you you're corrected all the time the word corrects where we're living and I'll tell you uh this has been a challenge for me to uh put the scanner on my thoughts I'm just going to go ahead and say this I really believe and I here's this this thought came to me on the way to church as I was thinking other thoughts than I should have for church and for the Lord I was they weren't bad thoughts but they were negative thoughts and I caught myself and I only have a five minute drive to work to to work to to church it's pretty bad when you got a five minute drive and you're already thinking negative thoughts but I said Lord I caught myself no no dump it out dump it up five minutes on the way to church and so I caught myself I said this is really real isn't it here's the pastor so Sam is mine ready for the service and he's thinking things he shouldn't think and I said stop it right there so this is really real you know what I thought this is what I thought maybe this came from the lord it's like we human beings it's it's amazing and I'm gonna adventure to say tonight that this is probably the place of most in our life that we exercise our rights more than any other rights that we have good you know when we say something and we get caught for saying something wrong if we have God in our heart we're going to apologize and sometimes people without God in their heart they apologize sometimes but you know we're going to make it right okay because we've been exposed and sometimes if you have the Holy Spirit in your life you feel convicted of something you said and you you didn't you weren't exposed you just went and and corrected it you went and said you know I I said the wrong thing I am sorry I should not have said that that Spilled Out I should have never said that so we ask uh we would say I'm sorry for that but how many people apologize for their thoughts the thought life is this this this undetected unchecked private place and because it is we exercise our rights we can think I may not be able to do what I want but I can think whatever I want and when you start reading the scripture and you start real realizing that the thought life can actually quench the spirit of God then you start saying it's time to grow to even let my thought life be corrected come on now casting down imagination and everything that exalted itself above the knowledge of God bringing every thought into captivity of Christ that's living a deep life you can't hide anything so God he can look back and say one of the two things here is the people that I'm looking at what they're thinking and he probably seen this on the day of Pentecost when the Bible says they were in one mind and one Accord that didn't mean that all their opinions were the same but they had one objective and that's to empty out of themselves and pray for God's promise to be fulfilled and they had that one objective together this is what we're coming to church for this is what we're in the upper room for we shut every other thought out right now we're praying for these 10 days and they had one Focus one mind and one Accord and God looked at that and seen their thought life and their uh desire to be in one mind and one Accord is in line with what they're saying and then the Holy Ghost Fire fell on that place one mind one Accord but when you have a service where there's millions of different thoughts from unbelief to what I'm gonna wear next week how am I going to pay my bill on Monday to millions of thoughts going on and it's not about let's forget all that and praise someone through to the Holy Ghost what if there's a soul here that needs more of God you may not need it you may not you may be saved and filled with the Holy Spirit praise the Lord but why is it that you're so selfish to leave it alone somebody else needs more of God so we focus say God what could you do in this little Wednesday night service tonight I'm going to focus it I don't care about my bills that I owe you know this is one place you can forget about your bills I give you permission because you're not going to solve anything tonight can you say man you'll pick it up tomorrow say God help me you're the provider I just sang it at church Jehovah Jireh but you're not going to deal with it tonight so Focus what can God do for the kingdom of God what Young Heart can come to the Lord what is who's struggling with depression that the spirit of God can sweep through that place and drive that cloud away what can you do if we could all get in one mind and one Accord and stop thinking other things then then that's part of the presence of the Lord it's an evidence that we've been in the presence of the Lord God is watching this and he sees he's trying to see if the heart opens up in Simplicity and faith and will drive out its own thoughts of doubt of overcoming trying to figure it all out in your own thinking he sees somebody and said Lord I I'm tired of trying to figure everything out we're trying to figure out how God's going to do this and he didn't really ask you to figure out how he's going to do it I mean he could show somebody a vision he could give this is a distinct like a prophet I mean I wouldn't knock that if somebody said it praise the Lord he'd tell you exactly what how God's going to do it but God wants us to have simple faith that he's going to do it but I don't have to think through how God's going to do it I don't have to think through wins gonna God's gonna do it are you listening tonight anybody know that there's such a thing as overthinking something but there is certain people that overthink life and overthink things and and besides fearing what's happened they're fearing what hasn't happened yet and they're scared of what hasn't happened or what might happen or what my children might do the direction they may go and and so it hasn't happened yet but there's so much fear that it might happen that they're Bound in those thoughts God does not ask us when we pray something to figure out and think through how he's going to do it but he asked for simple Faith to stand there like a rock and say I believe God is going to do it I believe he's going to do it because he's able to do it I'm not budging On Believing with all of my heart and when God looks at my thoughts and when God looks at my heart I'm not budging and God can see my faith isn't going to budge whatsoever but I don't have to think about how God's going to do it I don't have to think it through when God's going to do it but he wants us to see our thought life saying he's going to do it overthinking and all the while the Bible says let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus all the while the Bible says think on good things all the while the Bible's given us instructions how to guide our thoughts so when you overthink things you've probably taken a lot of your thought life just filled with wasted time can I get an amen so then we say something like I'd like to have a penny for every thought that was wasted thought I'd be a millionaire wasted thoughts had no value to them whatsoever never got you anywhere never brought fruit amen so God Is Watching and he sees of our heart is open to Simplicity and faith and open to driving out our thoughts of Doubt our thoughts of trying to overthink something or how God will do something I doubt too many people see in order to see the secrets of the heart being revealed I don't know I'm just speculating that most of it is to see God perform a miracle but once they got into that presence then you realize people come for many different reasons some people come for good so I said Sunday some come from come for bad reasons some come because you know of this that and just like when they come to church now some people come from a lot come for a lot of different reasons you want to believe people come just because they're hungry from the word and that's it but some people come to criticize some people come to find something wrong some people come because it's part of their scheduled Sunday going to church as part of their schedule they got a certain slot for that and uh and then as I said when I preach over time what I should have and they're done they got to get right out because I've went beyond their schedule and I think that I'll say it again because I think that we shouldn't schedule in God we should be we should be the ones flexible that if he wants to interrupt the entire schedule for the entire week instead we scheduling in from 11 to 1 on Sundays what if God wants to save your children what if God wants you to pray the rest of the night here why don't you quit putting God in a schedule and be submissive to his schedule his plan and his will amen some come as Skeptics always finding fault some have no trust in in Preachers and sometimes that's understandable because of what they've been through but they bring those thoughts with them and so everything's filtered through that thought of a Preacher hurting them some are thinking in the service that this is all good but I'm Unworthy of this I've done too many things I'm I'm not in this category I'm not and that's all the devil's thoughts I want to let you know that's all the devil's thoughts that none of that comes from God whatever thought that says you're Unworthy of the blessings of Calvary because of either what you did or because of you some of your complexes that's that's not a thought from God you are not worthy except Calvary has made you worthy of Every Blessing of Cal Ray so that thought is not even of God I'm worth unworthy all of all this and the healing is not for me because I've done too many things so you see this whole thought life and and thinking I've seen this all before four this is just an emotional workup I don't need it some people think this isn't for me some young people think this is not for me I don't want to be a religious fanatic this is not for me so I'm thinking as soon as I can get out on my own I'm out of here it's the young young people think that it's it's all thoughts your thoughts Satan's thoughts but it's not God's thoughts for you that's right so I'm thinking I'm too good for this I don't need to believe this I'm fine I got everything I need I don't need to accept Christ completely and sell out Lock Stock and Barrel I don't need to do that that's thoughts so you look at this these millions of thoughts going on in the other world no wonder God gets restricted no wonder God gets restricted and what he can do and I'm not trying to preach guilt on us tonight I'm trying to pre preach that our thoughts can Quench and hinder how VAR God can go our thoughts can can stop how God wants to go deeper in our lives our thoughts can stop healing that one God wants to give you your thought can stop you from the healing some thinking I'm too good for this I don't need to believe this I'm fine I got everything I need I don't need to accept Christ completely and sell out Lock Stock and Barrel I don't need to do that as thoughts so you look at this these millions of thoughts going on in the other world no wonder God gets restricted no wonder God gets restricted in what he can do and I'm not trying to preach guilt on us tonight I'm trying to preach that our thoughts can Quench and hinder how VAR God can go our thoughts can can stop how God wants to go deeper in our lives and I just think that we exercise our right to think what we want to think too much we have a right as an American we have a right and we technically we do have a right to think what we all want to think but it's such a private world but we give ourselves permission to think sometimes we give ourselves permission to say whatever we want to say I'll tell you you better say Lord help me to say a word in season and the right thing help me to say the right things and when I say the wrong thing to make it right can you say Amen but don't give yourself permission to say whatever you want I say what I want when I want to say it there's a right thing to say and sometimes there's the right thing to say in the right setting because you might be saying the truth or you might be saying your opinion but you're not watching who you're saying in front of you might be saying something in front of your kids that probably shouldn't be said sometimes so if that's true in our words brothers and sisters then what about our thoughts there's there's a reason that God looks into this area of our thought life and another reasons why God looks into this is that he wants to correct those thoughts he wants to deliver you from those thoughts maybe as I spoke tonight you've been corrected and you're my I need to bring this under subjection to the Holy Spirit God wants to correct those things and all of us and stop uh talking yourself out of just simple faith in God's word stop overthinking things can you say Amen God's God stop overthinking God's already thought all of this through before the foundation of the world you're trying to think things through and you're trying to overthink it and I'm here to tell you tonight I'm here to tell the world God has already got everything thought through is that all you make you say well praise the Lord I don't have to overthink it I just submit my life to the thought of God of walking his will God direct me tell me how to make decisions because guess what you've already thought it all through and how many remember the scripture in Jeremiah I should have read it tonight but you know it so well When God says to Jeremiah hey my thoughts are higher than your thoughts my ways I higher than your ways and I'd rather trust in a god who's got it all thought through already to try to work it out myself did it ever occur to you that nothing has ever occurred to God he's got this and if you let him he will take matters in his own hands I wrote a song shared here all right then I'll have to sing it he's taking matters in his own hand when I'm overwhelmed he understands well my boat May reel and rock until Jesus Takes command and he takes those matters in his own hand he's taken matters in his own hands when I'm overwhelmed he understands well my boat May reel and rock until Jesus Takes command and he takes those matters in his own hand did it ever occur to you that nothing's ever occurred to God did you ever latch on to that thought tonight that says why do we have to overthink stuff because God has already thought this all through sometimes we are quenching what God could do because we're overthinking it we're too nervous about it too nervous about where this can go now it can go a lot of places but for you to be nervous about it we can't get ourselves into just resting that no matter how bad a disease no matter how bad the sickness no matter how bad the condition a person's in no matter how low they've gotten no matter how far that child has went out in the world no matter how messed up and mentally they are no matter how bad a a child is thinking immature thoughts and not thinking like an adult like they should it doesn't matter how bad it is we have to rest in our prayer that God is bigger than all of this has everybody ever thinking thoughts even sometimes when you're being prayed for and I think we need to bring our thoughts and lie and say listen Nothing Else Matters right now God if a body of Christ a member of the body of Christ and a minister like Sunday touches them that's why I said before the service do you believe that your pastor could lay hands on you or a minister of the Gospel or even another member of the body of Christ the worst disease do you believe in simple faith that if they touched you you can be completely healed do you simply believe it it doesn't even say to pray it just says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover doesn't even say to pray we pray but it's just laying on as they referred to one time he says for a Believer he said science shows that light passes from one member of the body of Christ Light passes through their body when they lay hands on them now I don't believe you have to lay hands on I think as the uh the one man in the days of Jesus said just speak the word can you say Amen but then we got the way of laying on hands but it's not it's the faith of it it's not what you say in your prayer power behind it it's the life behind the name if we've got the goods we don't have to be afraid of cancer if we've got the goods we have to be afraid as parents to lay our hands on our kids if we've got the goods we don't have to be afraid when we pray God deliver save my kids from this direction they're going whatever it is we have to have simple faith and when I say it and pray it it goes to the throne of God everything is under the blood I'm asking forgiveness for everything that's there and now I stand with boldness before my Kinsmen Redeemer before my high priest can you say amen and I don't there's no unworthiness to this he makes me worthy to pray a prayer of faith sometimes they say and when I go over there and lay hands on that person I'm not even going to pray I've already prayed I'm going to lay hands on them and that's it I believe they're going to be healed lady howdy I've I've learned a lot in the last 30 years friends of listening to the prayer lines I've learned a lot it's not only Built My Faith but I learned how God deals with his people through the prayer lines because God he's the same yesterday today and forever and the manner he deals with people in manner he deals with their nervousness the way he talks to them the holy spirit's a gentleman he doesn't want to embarrass you children remember that Holy Spirit doesn't want to embarrass you but when there's a call that you need God you need the Holy Ghost and you need a deeper walk it's not to embarrass you it's calling for for Christ for you to come closer to Christ if there's an altar or call come and get more of Christ thank you for watching our message today if you
