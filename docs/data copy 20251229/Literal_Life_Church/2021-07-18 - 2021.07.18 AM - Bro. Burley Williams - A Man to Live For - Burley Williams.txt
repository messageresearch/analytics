========================================

this morning and uh it's good to have my wife with me this morning where is she all right bless you and uh appreciate brother paul allowing us to be here by his grace and mercy we thinking man but paul we got a long way back and he's a real friend amen and it's good to see each and every one of you and uh i pray that the lord will help us this morning um if you will i want to turn to uh first peter chapter three first peter chapter 3. we want to go to we'll go to verse one who was ministering yesterday on a woman to die for and uh it's the law will help this morning i want to just preach on a man to live for amen and we just see how he leads amen because these things are very important in this day and time uh there's i think paul you quoted it yesterday but actually i quote it myself i always believe if you want a strong church you need to have strong families because church is made of families changed the same as the children of israel even though it's 12 tribes but god look look at them as one and so it's the same as the church we're made up of different families but we look that as one and it's very important because i enjoy the mysteries of the message i preach on them a lot at home myself i enjoy revelation i enjoy stimulation from revelation i i love it but i do know one thing if life is not there character is not there you have no power it's just uh i've been in the message now 31 years i believe and i've seen a lot of things and one thing i have always observed as coming in as message young i always look at life regardless of what a person could say what do they live or about what they're saying and the bible tells us in the book of hebrews you know you're supposed to respect those that are over you and but it says but consider the end of their conversation and that conversation means considered the life that they live themselves and we're living in a time even around the message i've noticed um i think things have been forgotten it's easy for me to preach to you who the bride is what she is what a purpose is it's easy to preach those things can make you we can preach how revelated we supposed to be we can jump high in the sky all of those things are fine but we're not born again you just only know about who you're supposed to be but without a birth you can't be that one thing in denomination what they have mastered they can preach prosperity and make people in denomination they literally because i do studying on certain things they can make a center feel like a saint and walk right out of the service and feel just like a saint but with sin still in their lives i kind of find this creeping up around the message you know i'm right i'm right i'm writing brian i'm about whoa but are you born again that's what it's gonna all come back down to is that life of jesus christ inside of you it's gonna come all the way back down to death because we have learned i better read the scriptures let's just read the scripture first peter three and one likewise you wise be in suggestion to your own husbands that if any obey not the word that also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wise that's interesting this is what it says that obey not the word that also made without the word be one a woman can win her husband without the word see in our mentality no i got to take them to the word take them to the word they got to see this do you see this right here in the scripture but according to this they can be one without the word how could that be because instead of them speaking the word taking them to the word they're expressing the word the word is being expressed through them they actually become that living bible to the unbeliever and it says it verse 2 while they behold you'll chase conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of planting of the hair and of the wearing of gold putting on the power but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which in the sight of god of a great price for after this manner in old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection to their own husband if you look at verse 5 again you see the key of it it said who trusted in god so their whole life was based on in the fear of god trusted in god and by them being that way it expressed things through them and he says verse 6 even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and not afraid with any amazement likewise your husband dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as into the weaker vessel what's so honorable about that honey i'm gonna give you honor because you're weak i don't think that's what it's saying it's taking acknowledge she's the weaker vessel but not weak because we have to go back to what the prophet said he did say the easiest person to be deceived is a woman now he said it i believe it could he say amen that don't now that means not deceived for his election because the elect can't be deceived but there can be some things in life she don't see that she should see the devil can get a little slip in there you don't understand what i'm saying so they don't mean you're weak and you walk around fragile they don't mean that but i will get into that in a moment and it says finally be all of one mind having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for reeling but countrywise blessing knowing that you are there to call that you you should inherit a blessing you may be seated if you look in verse 8 again when it talks about love it said love as brethren so we was talking last night in the uh back with that a husband and wife most of the time we look at each other as husband wife husband wife but we don't look like this is my sister this is the son of god this is a daughter of god and you look right here in the scripture it says love as brethren so we're supposed to look at each other's brothers and sisters in christ amen so i pray that the lord will help us how long i got to preach for i'm a little slow this morning well when brother paul used talking about adoption that's what i was studying this morning i said wow and i said well i told him i'd do a part two so we'll do a part two but it all actually works in together adoption which we know is like the prophet taught us very well adoption is not your birth it's your positioning but there is no adoption without a birth because the holy spirit is your tutor and it and it trains you to teach you and guides you and it leads you to all truth and uh we we're in the time brothers and sisters you have to be very dependent on the holy spirit not on our knowledge and trusting what and the lord speaking to our hearts and what to say and do amen so just to give a little background well i got a quote that i would like to read this is a very familiar quote i was thinking about it this morning if i can find it it's come from the greatest battle ever fought fought he said i thought in order i thought of the order of the heavenly host not one of them is out of place everyone keeps its time perfectly he said god's great army i thought of the soldiers how that the moon would happen to get out of order the earth would be covered again with water just in a few minutes he said the earth would be just like it was when god decided to use it for to us for to have us here on it it was without form and void and darkness and water was upon the brightest of the earth and that moon would ever move it would do the same thing again when the moon rocks a little bit away from the earth the tides come up when it goes down just follows the tide it's god's great army it's when i thought about that being god's great army there now we went he said now we went to bed then i began to think that not one of those get out of their place they all set in place in other words they're in their adopted place they're in their position where god for the foundation of the world put them to be he says they all set in place and if there is a moving anywhere of them it's for a cause and it will affect this earth we just see the results of it now from some of them moving into their other spots it's it affects everything and i thought then if that great heavenly host like that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorderly of the earthly host how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of god is upset when one member gets out of order wow the whole program of god is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually we should continually to strive to keep the order of the spirit notice he said keep the order of the spirit not the order of emotions every time something goes wrong you rely back to the same emotion to deal with the situation no the order of the spirit people say man you see some people are you see one thing you have to learn we have to understand about the devil uh you got to understand he studies you he studies me he knows your ups he knows you're down he know how you built up satan actually knows amen and then you remember them spots in our life you have to protect we all know your weaknesses you know your weak spots we all know that in them spots that you have to protect and uh you can know you can every believer if you be honest you can know when you get in the wrong spirit you know you can feel it coming you can feel it coming you know it but what we do we say well i'm going to get out of order for this minute god you're just going to have to understand but i'ma have to let this theme off i'm just being honest with you see but what you have to understand when you even see it coming you're getting ready to get out of order you go back to the holy spirit you're leaning on the word say lord that's that's not where i'm supposed to be that's not how i'm supposed to act let me line up with your word you're you're having a victory then instead of heeding to their own spirit you're heeding to the right spirit can you say praise the lord you see we all like to paint a perfect picture of ourselves in church that we are perfect but don't nobody know you better than god the devil your husband your wife and your children this exactly right we know each other did you like brother paul was talking yesterday in marriage life you know how to push the buttons you know how to make one another mad your children know how to make you mad your children know how to upset you your children know how to ask you for things they know when to ask you for things they know how to catch you off guard when they want things we all study each other that's what we do can we say amen just like your children they love to catch you on the phone conversation they love that especially when you get to hey brother hey man hey man you're on that then the children be like man it's my time uh daddy can i go over with such and such yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you go go go go and when he gets off the phone hey what what that boy he's always saying what are you doing over there you told him he can go in do you argue no i did not tell him that and when you thought son i didn't tell you to do that yes you did when you was on the phone i asked you and you said i could go he studied you so we study each other we do praise the lord this might might be like a normal service to you but it's going to be a service i'm just going to be honest with you you know and uh i can preach revelation but that ain't what god telling me to preach right now and i actually love it when we were talking about the book of ruth i started getting excited no no i know i'm here for a certain purpose because family is important and uh we grow all of us grow and uh to me the mistakes ain't so much the problem sometimes it's trying to it's how you handle the mistakes makes the problem and but we got to grow and uh i know i probably said here at your church before but i i always tell my church if you're going to make mistakes that's fine because the prophet god said as long as we're in this flesh we're going to make mistakes i said but don't take that quote and stretch it so far and then you become justified in making mistakes i said if you're gonna make mistake make new ones don't keep making the same ones over and over because it's not mistakes it's somewhere you need some deliverance but you want to say the prophet said the prophet said no you need to dig a little deeper now you you keep doing the same thing there's some deliverance need to be taking place so you can get quotes and stretch them the wrong way too far and it gets out of balance and we have to be honest can we say praise the lord amen let me finish this see there is power in position when a person knows their position there is a power that actually goes with it let me just finish he said and i thought then that great heavenly host has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorderly of the earthly host let me just verse 50. he said i would to god this morning that we would bring this to a real healing service that we could keep this part group that we have gathered under this roof this morning in such a harmony that the holy spirit would place every member of the body that's here this morning in such a harmony there will be such a spontaneous healing of soul and body if we'll just hold our positions now i want you to think about this now he start talking about the spontaneity spontaneous thing can just take place if the believers would hold their position because by you holding your position that brings a power now if you ever thought of the word holding your position really that's an army term and he's speaking about this great heavily hosted soldier it's an army term because in the army what is the enemy job what is his purpose is to take your position defeat you on your own land defeat you in your position so he can take over you remember goliath that's what they told the the philistines told the israelite if you come beat us we'll serve you you we beat you you serve us each one want to have gain and control so a position holding your position like even in the army when the enemy don't start rushing in that you'll get the sergeant scream out man hold your position other word don't run you stand right there it's a fight going on to hold your position it's something coming against you but you got to be strong enough to stand right there i am not moving i'm going to take this challenge i'm going to stay right here i'm not going to break i'm going to hold my position and then that and the enemy say why they don't want to give in they don't want to break that's the way you got to be when pressure comes it comes from everywhere you got to say uh i'm a wife in my house and the devil's not going to make me think little of myself i'm going to hold my position as a wife i'm going to hold my position as a husband even pastors problems start happening in the church your position is a pastor but the devil is going to make you not want to be one no more but you're going to have to stand up no i'm going to stand right here i'm going to hold my position i'm not going to let the devil gain grounds see holding position it lands on every one of us you have to put your foot down and stand your ground because it's a fight how many of you like victory but how in the world you're gonna have victory if you never have a challenge there has to be challenges before you could have victory but you and i don't know where the challenge is going to come from most of the time just things just pop up sometimes we just don't see it but you know what it actually didn't just pop up the devil been working all along he just finally came to the place and now bam now i can get him he's always working on something that's why you and i we have to keep ourselves consecrated in prayer staying in the word amen because so many things out there in this world to distract you now and uh to get you from your concentration this is the age we're living in but let me tell you buddy and sister out of all the parables that i read when they start talking about the seed being planted the most crucial parable i believe it is to today when jesus would start talking about the seed he said it's the cares of this life the deceitfulness of riches has choked the seed and that's what's going on now don't choke the word cares of this life want to keep up with certain things because the world got so much to offer you know even in technology and all these things technology is good but it can take you away from god if you use it wrong facebook is a killer i just can't understand that people can't stay in church an hour but can stay on facebook four hours don't get sleepy don't get tired or nothing to the church of faith books dude come to church man here is the devil it's the devil telling you here you're tired oh come on no friends look where our attention is being drawn to in this day and time hey man that wasn't it wasn't in the notes but this is very important about holding position i thought it was pretty nice but paul i was thinking this morning i said well we got a youth meeting tonight so it's okay to still stay on this topic with husband and wife and then deal with the youth tonight so this is perfect so when we talk about things even husband and wife lives some of you are not married but these some things you can still listen to and glean from it and when you one day you do get married the holy spirit will bring your mind back to certain things that different ministers have said and that's what helps through marriage when you listen to the word problems come up and then you can say wait a minute i remember somebody preaching about something and then now you're going back the holy spirit is taking you back to the things that you have heard that's how god does things because sometimes you know you could sit in a service a minister preaching you might not even be understanding it ain't even getting nothing but then later on it's just why that's what he meant that's how god works what you're doing sitting in service you're storing things in your hard drive and then one day it comes back up by the holy spirit to remind you of what you heard is that right but now let's get to this i want to i want to turn the first first let's go to first john chapter four and then we're gonna go back to first peter a man to live for and a woman to die for and some of you that probably wasn't there that put it in a nutshell a woman to die for we just took the characters of some women in the bible they had no good reputations bad scars in their lives but their husband married them because they seen something else in their life worth dying for regardless of what they don't been through what they've done they said this is a lady that i'm ready to take the reproach for her i'll die for her i'll do anything for even though it looks bad i'll do it but we're just bringing it right back to christ there's nothing you and i did good for him to accept us nothing he loved us at all bad we were yet sinners he loved us so there was taking it back to the relationship how a husband should even be with his wife lord he has to look at her faults and look at her this is a daughter of god i love her and i can and love covers the multitudes of sin error and fault it does so that's it that helps out in the marriage stop looking at one another physical things and look at spiritual things about one another it actually helps and we went through a lot but i can't go back over all that now but just just a brief uh thing but what i want to get to about uh uh a man to die for now that goes i'm sorry a man to live for that's gonna go back to her sister saying i want to live for this man just getting on my nerve i want to live for this man and every man wants his wife to live for respect him honor him every man wants that but i find something in the bible and in the nature of god there's something man actually have to do to make a woman wants to do that not only that she knows the word that she's supposed to do those things but there's something about a man that he can do to make her actually wants to do it so we got to type everything with our relationship with jesus christ they all have to go back to death because we are his bride he's our husband and in marriage life to see how he treats his bride we can relate that to us and we should just follow that same pattern now i'm gonna ask you a question why do you love god why what's this reason according to the scripture why do you love god why do you want to serve him why do you want to just give him your all what made you that way why do you want to do it according to the scripture i'm going to show you according to the scripture why you do it and you bring it over to your marriage it's the same thing first john chapter 4 verse 17. herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear has torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us because he first loved us and he expressed it to us you know what it meant you and i do melt look what he done for me he gave his life for me shed his blood for me he understands me i can't help but submit to this man i can't help it i just because what he what christ don't express to you and me unlocked submission in our lives to submit to him praise the lord so now you would say that's a man christ i am willing to live for it's because of what he done makes you want to do that now look at as a man want his wife to submit be submissive to him but what are you doing brother to make her want to do it what is she seeing in you hello what is she seeing and you say i just i just love this guy oh i just want to be be more submissive it had to be something you're doing to unlock that now we used some characters yesterday we use rahab we use eve we used mary and uh seemed like it was another one but we used different characters of women but i'm gonna use the actually the same characters but show you the other side we was talking about eve uh well first we're talking about ye eve how did adam when he even seen eve have fallen he seen it but there was no thought in adam's mind how can i get rid of this woman she just done messed up he didn't even think about it he was just thinking how can i get her back to me are you with me the same with rahab look how marred her life was but simone he didn't care he was looking at something down in her heart he said i want to doctor this woman this is the type of woman i want to die for so then mary with joseph telling her she's going to have a child that wasn't good news to joseph unto god open up joseph i by way of a dream for joseph was concerned you you how could you do me like this i can't believe this but when god opened his eyes and then he realized this mary is willing to accept what the angel of the lord has said about her and according to the word she's willing to stay with the word and push me aside he said i i want to die for that type of woman but now look at the flip side of all of it think about it brothers and sisters with adam and eve when adam forfeited everything for her and they were walking out of the garden of eden walking out hugging his bride he could have looked at adam how bad it was but they walking out out of their home out of their inheritance he hugging her walking out of the garden and then she looks at him but you could have stayed you didn't have to do what you did because the prophet god could have gave him another life but adam you you did this with me could you just go in the ease heart now she was this man gave up everything for me what a man i can't help but be submissive to him i want to live for them it's the same thing but christ has done for you and me so brother look what adam sacrificed he gave himself for her adam was fulfilling ephesians 5 and it wasn't written yet in paper it said husband love your five give yourself for her even as christ gave himself for the church adam was fulfilling that before it was written on paper and by that it unlocked a submission and heard what a man what a man think about rahab same thing being with simone he could have had any israelite sister he wanted very easily like some of the young boy i think in the message i can get any girl in the message i want he could have but he was interested in one rahab with a marred tore up life but could you think as him and her she's married to this man and she just looks at him what a man he could have had anybody that he wanted but he chose me and really i have nothing to offer this guy but he chose me i'll submit to a man like that because he gave himself for me that's why we submit to christ he gave everything for you and me see it unlocks submission now everything i'm saying there's a balance to every bit of it it is balance because it's so we get so much into emotions because it's some struggle when you know it as a even as a sister you know the word say be submissive to your husband and then your husband can literally be treating you wrong then a fight comes with you in the word god i know what you're worth but just just god i did the prophet of god gives a story he gives a story you remember this man he was a drunkard him and his friend they drank and then they the question come up it comes up there's no real christians no more and then this man said here it is there is one i know of and they said who he said my wife here is a man been treating her bad all alone but yet she was witnessing to him she was fulfilling peter by her conversation she was winning him even though he treated her bad now for she knew this guy just a rough man is he ever going to be saved i don't know but she hold her position and god was working he treat she even sometimes you have to understand when things get worse that don't mean it's worse it's actually getting better sometimes when it's getting worse amen right before dawn you know but we when words come we're like whoo man no this is messed up the devil wants you to stay just like that because that's going to show you you ain't got faith your faith is not where it needs to be we've been taught very well because things get dark that don't mean that it's the end that means things because god he shows his best in the darkness light shines best in the darkness amen so when things going bad just keep holding your position amen so she comes he comes and told now here's this man testifying for her and she don't have an idea he's doing it and then he goes home you know the story they pretending like they drunk comes staggering in there and she go fix his food the guys you know i don't like my eggs like that who threw it on the floor now what would you do if you don't do that what you know i don't like it like that fix it yourself the next time buddy but she just got on her knees started scraping it up let's jesus bow the cross along and all the world go free and all of them got converted just because of her compensation her life but she hold her position that's powerful see we this is not stories i believe god anointed the prophet god tell little stories because of the it's an impact behind every story sometimes people brother brother you dramatize too much you do that dude i said paul call them allegories jesus used parables can we say amen i said there's a meaning in everything in the bible that's why the prophet god said you can't see christ on every page go back and read it again it has to be something you remember even in christ the mystery god revealed how was the seventh seal revealed he said it's revealed through the believers through the stories in the bible it's revealed through all of that it's revealing christ that's why we go into all of the stories we learn from it because it's a purpose and it's for the bride of jesus christ how many of you know we ought to be the most grateful people because god used them for examples faults and failures so you and i can look learn don't have them same thoughts and things that's what paul said they was awful examples for you and i i think first corinthians 6 don't do the things that they did so we should be more overcomers being able to look and see wait a minute i don't want to go that way i see what happened but yet we're still falling in some of them same traps can we say praise the lord so that woman that husband looking at her he realized this is already testifying this is a woman of god she was already winning him before his friends come over there but god put it away they needed salvation too so let me bring all the right down with him god know how to do things can we say praise the lord i'm trying to get started i want to go to ephesian five ephesians 5 we're going to go down to this very scripture we all know it but i just want to read it again we're going to verse 21. so submitting yourself one to another in the fear of god why submit yourself and to your own husband as unto the lord we was talking about that yesterday submitting yourself to your husband's ass unto the lord that goes back remember it's a quote the prophet god said as you serve your husband is as you serve god i mean you remember brother branham saying that there goes the scripture that backs that up listen what it says submit yourself unto your own husband as unto the lord so how you submit to the lord you should to submit to your husband the same way and what makes us want to submit to him because of what he's done for us are you with me giving thanks always of all things unto god and the father in the name of the lord jesus christ i'm sorry go back to verse 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church that he is the savior of the body i remember when i was a young christian first coming the word and i sing that scripture the husband is the head of the wife oh that was power on your head i'm your head you're supposed to follow me i'm your head follow me but at that young time am i immature life i wasn't mature giving her something worthy to follow but yeah i had a big head i'm the leader but i wasn't falling under leadership myself so be in the head you got to have a head above you which is christ are you with me i was going about it the wrong way why say something i didn't like do something like you you supposed to respect me obey me and submit to me that's what the bible says write scripture wrong application see then you try to beat somebody into submission with the scripture that don't that's not love that's putting fear into somebody i do not want my wife to be my wife because she's afraid it can't be perfect love she's afraid hello that's why we don't serve god because we're afraid to go to hell we're serving because we love him and knowing we deserve to go to hell it's the same thing if we could just take these simple principles and apply to marriage it makes things works out a whole lot better but when one uh both in the flesh it's gonna be my way or the highway it ain't gonna work would you tell jesus that oh god you're gonna be the way see that's another problem we got too we like to tell god our plan then we want him to anoint our plan when we should take our plan to him and ask him is it okay what is your perfect will see that's what we mess up right now don't work that way it just don't work that way praise the lord that's why i believe in the unity in the home husband and wife and unity and that unity going to have a foundation that is based upon and it had to be based upon the word amen praise the lord i believe that even in the beginning we understand even in the fall adam and eve were co-equal but when the fall took place that's when god changed it and told her he shall be a ruler right he put the man over the woman but now what we have to even understand about that scripture it is actually true but when it comes to the spiritual side now with the bride of jesus christ in jesus christ he brought all that back together that the bride in christ she can speak not just preachers get adopted sisters get adopted too not just men have power sisters have power too but there's perimeters that god had put to balance everything out but the man still is the head with christ being his head not trying to run his house by his own intellect or his personal feelings it don't work that way it had to be the leadership that god give you to run your family the same as a pastor a pastor can't run his church by his desires he runs it by the word what the word orders it out can we say amen because i can tell you if a pastor runs the church by the way he thinks things are supposed to be within himself and when it don't work he's going to get frustrated hello now i'm a pastor too so i can say these things so i learned i learned i see things in people's lives god wants to do i sit back and watch before i say something because sometimes there can be something god doing in a person's life a pastor can see it he can speak too quick he said god put that down and then by that person respect the pastor he's going to try to operate in that because the pastor thought it was good but if you wait for the time and season and the pastor has a right to brother sister i need to talk to you brother the lord been showing me something when that season is right that anointing will drop right in and everything will work out perfect see we can speak too quick sometimes and sometimes we can wait too long because it all goes back leaning on the holy spirit win the same thing and i know some in my church get mad at me because they think i should say things and i don't say it see that's their challenge do you really believe me i'm your pastor so why you want to push me to move quickly that's your challenge not mine i'm waiting on god not you hello see when it's a work of the holy spirit we'll learn to respect each other and just wait because when god does something it always works out right can we say praise the lord oh i go through these things too i think you should have said something quicker so you think i think one of the most funny incidents i tried to deal with the situation it'd been a while ago and then the parent come back to me and say i i think you handled that wrong i said really yeah that's what we would have done i don't know so you think i heard it wrong but you don't know what you would have done that don't make sense do it i said forget about that you know i've done what i said what god allowed me to say can we say praise the lord i don't know why i'm getting on this one brother paul but we're there let me explain something brother sister christ and his bride is a relationship husband and wife is a relationship pastor in the church is a relationship and all just drops right on down but in all the relationship is the holy spirit operates at all that's the way it's supposed to be the holy spirit operating it all hold your position even in mary's life could you just think when she looked at joseph how joseph was willing to bear the reproach of all the things people are saying about her joseph walking around smiling and people probably shaking their heads just man come on be for real and then marriage and look at joseph what a man what a husband he ain't caring about what people are saying he's just caring about me i have to submit to this man he unlocked that in her life now here's the scripture i want to get to back to ephesians verse 25. let's go to verse 24. therefore as the church is subject and to christ so let the wise be subject to their own husband and everything look at the comparison he's just taken aback how the church relationship it was christ so should the woman had that same relationship with her husband and also the husband with his wife then he give us a good example god gave us an example all through the bible what kind of man he is he's a supplier he's a comforter he's a supporter amen he's also a corrector he's expressing husband he expressing fatherhood he's expressing all that's why man we look at how god do things and we do the exact same thing verse 26 i'm sorry verse 25 husband love your wife even as christ also loved the church gave himself for it so the way christ loved us we have to love our wife the same way amen and then he takes it to the woman he talks about how that she should submit herself subject to herself to the husband and how the church should be the christ it brings everything back in and this is our pattern right here but we get so much into our own little uh books how their wife ought to be how to hub and not be we write our own books we write our own rules and if one of us ain't lining up to death say you're not going by the book the question is what book your book or this book is supposed to be this book because we're all different different personalities god made every one of us different i don't think the world could handle two burley williams just one my wife deals with me it ain't easy to pray for sister denise amen let me you know let me finish this this is all right but paul i'm just relaxing to be be on it with you because i'm just following out wherever you need to go i'm just going to say it i want you to notice verse 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word how is christ molding his church not a word now watch this right here now what's the purpose though verse 27 that he may present it to himself a glorious church now a spot or wrinkle any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so christ gonna present his church to him so if he gonna present his church church to him shouldn't he have a right the way he wanted presented and how is he doing it by the word you and i we create each other by our words whether good or bad you create each other by your words i was talking to a guy counseling he was telling me what his wife was saying to him when he was telling me that i'm like sound familiar he was getting mad but then i thought about it months and months ago he told me some of the things he said to her and as i listened to him she was repeating to him what he said to her and he's getting mad i said brother that's your creation you created that she giving you back what you gave her and you get mad see in marriage it's also you reap what you sow that's why we should sow the right words and then we get the word back one to another the right way we create each other how is god creating the bride by the word we created each other by the word the prophet god said no church is any stronger than what it inheritance is it has to the word it's no stronger than that so whatever word is being preached that's how strong the church is going to be so that's why even in the ministry we create the church our church is strong through the ministry of the word that you're receiving it all works the same way that's why god gave us a revealed word in this hour to let us know what the mind of god is because he know what bride he will present it to him a perfect bride some of you might be sitting there saying this man the way this man is preaching is like we should never have no problems in marriage i don't believe that that is not what i'm saying i'm just trying to show you how to handle your problems so they won't get ridiculous because sometimes the problem ain't the problem is how you try to solve the problem makes it the problem and you know what when flesh gets in it that's what ruins everything why do i want to let you know how i feel well i won't let you know how i feel do you say why you go first no you go no no no no no it's come to battle marriage supposed to be fellowship not battleship that's right how many do you battle with god my lord i felt like you like no no no no you won't do that with you you'll humble yourself even sometimes you don't understand you just humble yourself and wait all right let me uh try to simplify this a little more here i want to go back to holding that position to me that's very important holding your position because when a wife gets out of her place it caused chaos in the family when a man gets out of his place it caused chaos and the children they they grow because when they're young they don't understand their place that's why you have to teach them as they go but as a child begin to grow and when they start understanding responsibility it kind of balances things out as the family goes but the husband and wife is important both for them knowing their place so it's more of an advantage for the child growing up when their parents are stable they actually mature your child a whole lot faster see me and my wife we were young we were immature in a lot of things and it affected i could look back now and see how it affected the children because of our immaturity it affected them so the children need something mature to look up to they're going to help them to grow in their lives and things are very important let me you know as a believer this goes for man and wife it goes for all of us do you really understand the importance for you to stay on the uh the right level of maturity so that you can help somebody it's very important because god could send somebody to you that need help but if you are all tore up yourself you ain't going to be able to help them too good so that's why we need to be stable in our heart mind and soul knowing where we're at so we can be able to minister to somebody that has needs in certain areas it's important for a woman to love their husband many ways many purposes many reasons because god might want to use you to minister to another sister but if you're struggling with your own husband you're gonna have a problem ministering to that sister i'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do you got a problem with your hug and you're mad and upset and and just just saw all of a sudden a sister say can i talk to you in a moment i'm having problems and you already got him you'll say what is it and if she start talking about her problems and some of them are familiar with what you and your husband going through i'm going to tell you what you're going to do you're going to fall into emotions and reasoning and you ain't going to be able to help that sister because you're going to start telling her i understand what you're going through these men you're not going to help that sister because now you're going to feed her all your emotions or the feelings you got to get your husband that's why it's important as a man brothers and sisters we be in our place in maturity in our marriage so we can minister to others same as a man got a problem with his wife you know men look different i call it pep rallies when they talk to the brother listen brother this is what you need to do get in there and take home control of your family you're the head of this house did anybody say that yeah yeah yeah so you get there you go you take control let the devil know this is your house you ain't gonna let him come in there that's you're the man of this house you understand brother yeah yeah yeah yeah he all pumped up now he goes home wrong spirit we need to have a talk we're going to sit down and talk so you got the wrong spirit all over where did that spirit come from they come from that brother that's why my brother got better saying oh brother let's talk let's go to the word this is what the word say listen brother start telling that man about his position this is your position according to the word you're the priest of your home and you have to handle it that way if things are out of order don't take your emotions take the word go back to the word let's talk about the word i said that word will come in the holy spirit will come back all the spirits in your house if you handle the things the right way but we want to do it with flesh our way our thinking it won't work battle's in the house i say it all the time never argue in front of your children just don't do it people think you know people hear you tell them that but when they get mad child can be right there they say i'm sorry baby when it's all a little mama sorry daddy sorry but it's too late it's too late then you're gonna come to church in the presence the children be like that ain't the president we was in at the house it's a total different presidency you know marriage is reaping the sword family is reaping and so i believe you know especially your children in public school it's rough demons man spirits rough they need to be able to come home and let that steam up and a lot of times they come home want to talk and the parent not now not now it's not now not a little while go by mama be on facebook mama mama not now you're gonna say so many not now and then they're gonna find someone else to let the steam my phone is going to be the wrong person and then they get married and you call them hey this is mama how you doing mama not now cuz now they on there mama calling him right in the middle of the game mama not man i call you back mama call it mama i call you why are you just what what now she doing what you did to her when she was a kid not now read what we saw you shouldn't be with them kid come from school daddy have a hard day mama have a hard day we all have a hard day but when it comes to family we need to make that a sanctuary so we can talk about what doesn't happen what doesn't went on and when they when you start them a little like that you know what happens they depend on that when they go through things they'll always care they'll even be at school i can't wait to go home so they can know they can talk to mom and dad and let that pressure off but when we go right now not now it's bad praise the lord i tell you brothers and sisters these are very important things none of us don't want to be pretenders we want to be real see i'm the type of person if i'm struggling and you ask me i tell you yeah but i'm going through something right now i'll just be honest but if i'm struggling with something but my faith is high and i know i already see the end and you say you're all right i'm gonna say yeah i'm fine because my faith is there but if my faith is not where it's supposed to be and i'm really struggling i'm going to say pray with me not only pray for and pray with me because i got a situation here that just being honest but we want to be superheroes oh nothing wrong with me and you know you're dying inside you can't be helped like that if you ever want to read a story if you get a chance some of you probably i'm sure you don't read it but if you want to read a story about a struggling believer until everything looked at bad until he got back to god and things changed read psalm 73. it's about asaph that is a powerful song it's an honest it's a believer being honest that i'm struggling with the world i'm mad at the world because they got so much more than what we got a man and what makes this story more interesting he was a levite one of them one that carried the ark of the covenant but yet he was looking at the world and as you read that story on down he was giving the world praise what the world has i did he said until i come back into the sanctuary he said then i understood their end other word he got his spirit back he got his heart back right with god then he realized this world ain't got nothing to offer me that's the same as you and i brothers and sisters it's a pull on the world of many different ways and things in each one of our lives but you keep your heart consecrated on the word you'll be ready to realize the things of this world turn your eyes on jesus and the things of this world will go strangely i like the way that song said that we go strangely dim other words the more you stand in the word these things just start vanishing away the world don't even mean nothing to you no more i don't want some kind of love story book and pattern my marriage off of it i don't want to perish my pattern my marriage i'm some kind of author don't wrote some kind of marriage but i don't want a parent i want to pattern my marriage off of the revealed word of this day that's why i want to pray that's what god give it to us for to bring everything into perfection do you believe that this morning because every one of us has a position and when the positions find their place it's beautiful the children of israel they knew canaan land was the area they knew that they knew that what was promised but neither one of them knew which one was their lot they knew what the place was but they didn't know their life because their lot had to be divinely revealed to them through the ministry of joshua to give them their place and position the same thing you and i we know the message we we know it but hasn't been revealed to you what your position is in the message that's what the power is that right there can we say praise the lord we've been through some things recently i don't mind i'm just one of those i guess transparent person and uh it's interesting let me tell you something church i'm a pastor paul didn't tell me to say these things but i preached you know when you when you preacher get out you're kind of a little free because when your own church you got to be careful what you say i know i don't want to say that that's bad but that's the complex pastors have i will not go that direction they're going to think it's bad but i'm telling you it's pressure it's a lot of pressure being a pastor it's pressure being a pastor's wife it's pressure being past the children it's pressure ain't no other word to put to it it's pressure you would never understand a pastor unless you're on you'll never understand a pastor's wife unless you know what you'll never understand pastor children unless you do with one you have to be one to understand it we're we're no privilege no more privilege than you are we're just servants of god that comes with a lot of sacrifice i had an incident with my own daughter i don't go into detail with nothing bad bad she was doing but i told my daughter you just recently me and her was talking and uh there's some things that i don't want to go into detail i'm not trying to offend nobody but it was something she was wearing that i didn't like it and it wasn't necessarily that it was bad bad but it's representation so i wasn't going to get my daughter and say you're making me look bad wearing that you're making me look bad that's the wrong approach you just put a complex in her cause she have to grow herself and i have to let her grow are you with me so me and her was talking i said becky i want to say something to you i said when i said i said you're looking at things wrong when i correct you about certain things i say you're looking at it wrong i see you looking at it i'm correcting you because people in the church saying something about you or people in the church think something about you i said that ain't got nothing to do with it what people think because i don't let what people think dictate my thinking i can't do that if i do that i'll become a puppet i'll be trying to cater to everybody's thoughts and you can't do that in ministry i said maybe i'm correcting you because of the word so i'm taking you to the word of how a pastor's family is supposed to be it's right there in titus and timothy explains it how the children impose the bible is so perfect it explains how everybody in their position is supposed to be and i began to read it to him explain things to her and i said here's what you're missing we are all privileged to be called to this message every one of us are but i want to express something to my daughter i said it's not that there's more of a privilege but you got to really look at the privilege your dad i said yo god called your father to preach this end-time gospel this is something i wasn't looking for as he called your father i said you ought to take that consider it in your heart god you call my father to be a pastor and i want to do everything i can to support my father as a pastor line up with the word whatever i do because you called me into this family of a pastor i said when you're looking at it as a burden people look at me i said don't don't no no that's just the wrong way just don't look at it like that i look at what god called you because it's pressure being a preacher kid it's pressure but even the child if they look at it wrong don't understand it it's going to break them they're gonna make them do things they shouldn't do say things they shouldn't say if they can't catch division you can't look at it i'm burdened my dad the pastor i can't do no no don't don't don't look at it like that you ought to say lord i think you've called me into this family what can i do to contribute to it regardless of it people gonna be people people gonna say things people are gonna be people but stay focused on the position and god take care of the rest this is like right certain thing my wife want to say i know she's going to say i'll tell her don't do it because being the pastor i can look down the road know what it's going to cause if she said it's not that she don't have the right to say certain things it's just being wise because the devil life of things to get out of cater and a bunch of talking started going but never want to get to substance and base it on the word but it's talking that's what the devil liked to do called chaos if you look at the bible if you go to numbers uh i think chapter 23 you remember the story when uh balaam was trying to get bailiff uh bailout trying to get baylon to curse the children of israel you remember he never do it he couldn't do it but balaam was smart he knew god won't compromise with his word so what did he do balaam taught balak it says in the book of revelation how to cast a stumbling block but if you look in genesis you're going to hear him verbally talking about it you're going to hear him talking about it written but the book of revelation exposed what was behind the scene what he did he knew god don't like mixing so he taught him all you need to do get them to mix with the medianitis people god don't like that that's what it called the feast of bear poor so what he did what he did if you go back and read the story you remember that medianitis girl and an israelite boy come together came up amongst the congregation of israel and disrespect even to the prophet it caused the plague to come but if you keep reading that story i think one of them named zimri one of them named cosby watched the writings of it they both come out of a family where their father was the chief so the devil chose two children come out of a popular family to bring it amongst the congregation to bring the influence that's how the devil works if you are gifted if you're influential and the devil know you got influence you can put on people he gonna hit you harder he gonna come at you harder just to get you to fall for that position so you can cause damage and people say look at that look at that so you have to be very very careful that's exactly right so even being in in the deacon's office the children will get attacked it ain't so much the children it's the office that the devil won't attack but he'll have to use whatever he can use to get to it in the past of the deacon that's how he attacked because he wanted to kill the influence of the individual that's why even as a congregation that's where our maturity comes in and we begin to realize this is my pastor i understand he's my pastor he ain't going to compromise we're going to be praying for not criticizing we're going to pray for him we're going to lift his children up we're going to lift him up because you got to remember if the devil can get get to your pastor he'll get to you he'll try to come down through the congregation some of the pastor's temptations i had to learn this over the years but people do things and got on my nerve so bad so so bad and i'm tore broken you know what the devil does when you're studying this is how crafty the devil is while you're studying he will give you scriptures that'll go against that person don't get on your nerves he will give you a sermon title it just right for that one person sitting in the congregation because they don't get on your nerve and if you ain't mature you're going to take his sermon with scripture rightfully divided but wrong motive and you're going to get up and preach at that person and you're going to lay you're going to preach and ones that don't know what's going on because a boy pastor was evangelist this morning what pastor dunn got in his own spirit and failed and preached to one person in the congregation is what he's done that's exactly right those are challenges that's why i was a pastor when you see that it says satan that ain't gonna happen see i can tell you that because i failed before on that exactly right hey now i was preaching too and that one individual they just yeah smiling because they know i was going at them and i was anointed too by who wasn't god jumping in the pool one person and i failed these things are very important see sometimes you don't know what goes on behind the scenes sometimes i don't know what goes behind the scene in your life that's why i would rather talk to you instead of just making a judgment talk to you what's what you know what's going on how many of you ever thought something about somebody you thought something about it you thought you was anointed and spiritual and you received hidden information about a person god don't really inspire you and then when you finally go talk to him i i was thinking i want to talk to you you know are you you know the lord was you know such well you ain't gonna say lord at first because you want to make sure you're right then when you talk to them about a situation they say sister bro i don't have a clue what you're talking about i wasn't thinking nothing like that and you go oh oh but anyway how are you doing today see you don't build up a whole story about a person and never talk to them about it that's how the devil just come in and crush stuff we're in the message elite pride but this it's as little as foxes that spawns divine that's right and i believe in all of my heart god want us to know these sheep go back not we this is nothing we don't let me know i'm just stirring your mind by the way of remembrance lord that mercy what time i come up here brother i couldn't remember what time what time i came i asked my wife what time did i start she could she keeps all the time she's my corrector well sometimes i can be preaching i might be talking about a character saying her own name i just be preaching i just happened to do like this you go and i said then i hit it right she go you see her being my wife want to make sure i'm saying things right and if i say something wrong it's kind of embarrassing get it right same thing in marriage if i see her falling somewhere she reflects me i said get it right let's do it right it all goes the same way this is the killing right here right it's flesh this flesh we just have to identify saying no i'm the bride i am the bride and i live above these types of things this is immature stuff i live above this i guarantee you it'll help your life can we give god a hand but probably gonna stop [Applause] i'll just stop praise the lord i promise you it's a whole lot more but we're just going to stop god bless you bye paul
