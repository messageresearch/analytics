========================================

i need these oh bless me now i say you're yes you we need you lord we need you lord we need you lord right now oh in worship praise the lord let's read in our scriptures tonight if you take your bibles first chronicles chapter 13 and i had a couple of prayer requests that came in from my aunt that lives in michigan here and uh have giddy and take it off my voicemail we'll pray for those at the end of the service a couple urgent needs and i was just privileged that she felt good that she called us and called me to um to call upon the lord for those things so i want to take the into account and i just forgot to write it before so let's we'll get to that at the end first chronicles 13 there's a couple places this is mentioned i want to read both places of course there's the chapter where david goes and tries to take the ark takes the ark and of course he does it the wrong way it wasn't the season and uh does a few things here and we're familiar with this from the message that was preached uh doing god of service without his will but uh just a couple verses here at chapter 13 first chronicles 13 and verse 13 and 14. so david brought not the whole the ark home to himself to the city of david but carried it inside into the house of obadi obadidam the gite and the ark of god remained with the family of obadidom in his house three months and the lord blessed the house of obaditum and all that he had now let's go back and read it in ii samuel in the same account there's just a little bit more wording given there so i want to read it both places second samuel chapter 6 and should be here in verse 12. yes verse 11. and the ark of the lord and i'm second samuel 6 and verse 11 the ark of the lord continued in the house of obadidham the gethi three months and the lord blessed obadidam in all his household and it was told king david saying the lord hath blessed the house of obadidom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the ark of god so david went and brought up the ark of god from the house of obadidom into the city of david with gladness amen let's pray together our lord jesus we thank you lord for this time that we spend together lord each wednesday night and sunday and we cherish the times we're able to get together lord and to be able to share in your word and every day we want to find that portion that you have for us lord and we're thankful lord not only for the meat of the word that you've given but also the milk of the lord as well and father whatever is needed at the time you're able to provide it for babes in christ or those who've grown to full maturity leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ and moving on to perfection you provide the bread and the food that's needed for all and lord you also are so mindful of all the needs that you're able just if a minister will yield himself and the people will yield themselves you're able to flow the service into a way father that it would be designed to be able to meet the needs and answer questions and lord we depend on the holy ghost for that that isn't man that's your holy ghost and that's when we really like to see you have the preeminence lord because when you do then father needs can be mad we thank you for that lord we brought our petitions to you we've brought the different things and also our voices of praise and our hearts to you and lord i just pray that it would be received from the into the depths of your heart tonight and that we would feel close to you and that your presence through the word of god would speak to us lord and we just commit the service to you now and all who would be listening into your loving hands in jesus name amen amen once you shake somebody's hand before you seated god bless you all tonight for coming out to the house of the lord we're continuing our series here on the blessed families abraham's promise of in all the families under his faith all the families of the earth will be blessed and so we're also glad to receive many comments and different things of the application that brothers and sisters are taking from the things we're preaching here wednesday nights and applying them to their homes and just uh looking at it from the perspective of going through the bible and seeing these little nuggets in here for our families i'm learning a lot myself and i pray that our families will be better because of it now last week we talked took the subject of during the time of joshua and uh i felt like that subject about what the uh we had a family called the aiken family and the aiken family decided to bring a wrong thing into their home or their tent and i felt like that was a very important subject because we've seen the effect of not only at bringing a a curse for them but also bringing a curse on the whole army of israel it hindered their battle and so many things that came because they justified bringing something into their tent that wasn't right that's a great subject for family because we all always have to make choices don't we every day we seem to have to make choices and we have to pray about things and look at whether we're going to incorporate it we live in a world that's constantly upgrading and constantly bringing out new things and new inventions and some people are bent that they love that they love the new things that are coming out and so because of the nature of the age we really got to be prayerful to make sure that something that we're bringing in doesn't have trouble that comes with it because that's really what a curse is it's bringing there's trouble that comes with something and when trouble comes with something we start to see the trouble crop up in our children and our relationships with one another our relationship with god how we interact with one another our attitudes start changing so if you watch that fruit start to take place you realize wow something something's happening something's wrong and that's actually what joshua did he started to say what is going wrong here something's wrong we just fought a battle and we just lost 36 men and god said that wasn't going to happen god said if we went to battle he'd fight our battle and when he realized they lost 36 men innocent men he see he was saying stop hold wait wait a minute something's wrong and i pray that we could have parents moms and dads that have that kind of sensitivity to the lord that when they know trouble is happening to say whoa to be a joshua and say stop a minute something is wrong i don't know what it is but we're going to get to the bottom of this thing and that's what joshua was saying and boy did the holy spirit ever get to the bottom of it and so they started with the tribes and then they went down the heads of the tribes then they went down the families the heads of the families trickling it down to every household and the holy spirit just scanned in that whole thing to find what the trouble was and friends if you don't think that's still happening today in this hour i'll tell you it's still happening every time we get together for church because the holy spirit doesn't bring us together just to pass on the back all the time it's actually sniffing out those things and looking for those things that are hindrances to our lives and so he kind of systematically does it to our hearts as he just peels back the layers to see if there's anything there that's displeasing to the lord same god that was in israel the same god tonight can you say amen and so joshua said wait a minute and so now the aiken family brought something wrong into their home and into their tent and it brought a curse it brought trouble and if you'll notice there that's they when they killed the family and they stoned them after it was over then as a matter of fact let's just read that a minute joshua i want to pick that up and get that last verse there in joshua chapter 7. joshua 7 verse 26 and they um yeah and they raised him over a great heap of stones unto this day so the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger so in this incident in chapter 7 it it angered the lord that somebody had disobeyed and brought something into their tent uh aching his family that was a a a garment that wasn't right and also a wedge of gold and silver and so it angered god god is the one that got angry with it and so when they took care of it and purged it from the children of israel and this family then was taken away then it says the the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of acor unto this day and that acorn means trouble so the very valley that they were stoned in and god ended all this and ended his anger was called the valley of trouble because that's what israel got into was trouble because of someone incorporating something that affected all the all the all of the congregation of israel so listen now the valley of trouble you how many has been through the valley of trouble and how many has been through it and after it you realize that you got into the trouble by it wasn't god doing it it wasn't anybody else doing it you got into trouble yourself you've been through a valley of trouble there's nothing worse than being a valley of trouble that it seems like everything's cursed everything is nothing's blessed and everything's turning bad can you say ma'am you know life can be like that sometimes but if you've been in that valley of trouble uh then we realize that in that place uh like it was back then god got angry at this they lost the victory of the battles there was no victory in battle they lost the victory of ai they lost 36 innocent men and god said all of israel has sinned in other words it wasn't just one family he when god looked at it all israel has sinned that's the way he worded it that's how serious it was it affected the whole congregation i appreciate the brokenness of some brothers saying that man i didn't realize this impact of what this says is that i i had brothers say they've scanned their home and prayed because you know why they don't want anything to hinder somebody getting healed they don't want anything in their lives that would hinder somebody in the congregation getting their healthy or getting their deliverance because they realize it does affect the rest of us and these things do have a a a significant thing to the rest of us so the whole the congregation was affected aitkin's family was affected and of course died and i i'd say that's a lot of trouble that come from one garment bringing a garment and a gold wedge and a silver piece uh that's a lot of trouble from a garment i said that's a lot of trouble that came from a garment but it does it's not about the garment it's a garment that had a curse with it it's a garment that god said anything that is in in jericho is cursed and so now once god cursed it then to bring it out it had a curse that went with it it traveled with it spirits travel in things spirits travel in music spirits travel in uh the intellect of the world spirits travel on the internet spirits travel in garments in clothing that's right if you don't know that then you're gonna have to read your bible more you're gonna have to get in tune with the lord because we find it in the bible we find it's true today the right spirit or the wrong spirit can travel in these things and they are important but god looks at the heart of course god looks at the heart he looks at the heart first but it doesn't get away from the essential fact that spirits travel in certain clothing and we have to be as christians mindful of that all the time look at all the trouble that came from a garment look at all the trouble that came from a gold wedge and aiken's family thought this will make it held a little bit better off for us in case we get into trouble financially or something and uh maybe we can use this garment i don't know what all they wanted to use it for but it was nice enough that they wanted to keep it but look at the trouble that came with it is it worth it was it worth it all the trouble was it worth it and that's why people is it worth it to hang on to this little thing i want this i want to wear this i want to do this is it worth it you better take a good look at that that's right praise the lord so so now it affected the whole congregation so now uh there's a theory in the world then if we would look at this principle there's a theory that says that one thing doesn't have to do with the other so in other words you can't tie the two together come on now all that trouble came from just this garment so there's a theory says one thing doesn't have to do with the other it's a very worldly point of view we can't have it as christians there's too much in the bible that shows us otherwise that that many times one thing can have to do with the other so it says that solomon one day because of all the women he began to get from other countries and begin to marry him and begin to do all these other things and they turned his hearts towards idols remember this is in a millennium with god's people that the queen of sheba when it was in its prime came and said this is god this is the wisdom of god this is this is the greatest you could see the children of israel is in that time of solomon but later on his heart was directed towards other gods because of the women he was getting involved with and two or three scriptures later it says because of the women god turned an enemy against solomon and right amongst his own kingdom he got an enemy against him that began to begin to work to tear down his kingdom and the two were tied together because he let his heart be drawn by these women then their enemy raises up to destroy his kingdom that's right and so we cannot believe this theory that says one thing is not tied to the other the aikens chose to exercise i'm guessing the aikens chose to exercise their personal rights i guess and their personal rights to have this and so but but but we really got to watch that because within the body of christ we have to really make sure that our personal rights don't affect somebody else and that's in the book of that's in the new testament too when paul speaks of certain rights and somebody has a liberty to do something they have faith to do something but if it offends your brother you better be sensitive to that then paul say it that way that's my that's the lafontaine standard revised version there of that but you're familiar with that scripture is that we're we don't know what that scripture says we don't live to ourselves we don't say i do my own thing brother and i just this is what i do and i don't care who it offends that doesn't work in the body of christ and paul says that and so he's got faith to do it so you may do it and but then the other one should not criticize the one that would do it because then he's he's putting him down for having that faith to do it and see all this all all the rights the american rights and the whole tone of i've got my rights never seems to work well in the body of christ and really when we come we become a lamb saints we lay down our rights to the great lamb can you say man it's not about i'm gonna exercise this right so i'm guessing that was maybe part of it because i know us human beings and the aikens just thought it doesn't matter what god said we want to take this in and so they exercise their personal rights and maybe had other reasons for doing it as well what we have in our tent won't affect everyone else and they found out the hard way that that's not true now is it true in the new testament yes it's true i was reading it there in butler on saturday it's true in the new testament too because in first corinthians we find there was an incest or there was a sexual immorality going on in the church the corinthian church and everybody's kind of ignoring it and let the guy continue to come to church just let him come and he was blatantly doing it blatantly trying to take communion and everything else living in a bad situation with his uh stepmom i believe it was and so paul rebuked the whole church he says listen uh this is going to affect all of you you can't ignore this you're going to deal with this you've got to be mature sons and daughters of god and deal with this thing and here's the term you use a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump is that not bible and so the same principle in the old testament applies to the new that a little leaven in other words a little lemon affects the whole body paul said you better deal with it all right so we do know that the principle is true in the bible that we we one thing is many times tied to the other that being said i thought i would offer this warning to us that we are not prophets and because we are not we can't see many times all the details of what is related to one another right away a lot of times we see it later that something was related or god shows us or something but but to see that because we did this then we start getting into this mindset because i did this then this is the outcome and this is god's punishment to me we have to be careful that because we can be psychoanalyzing all the time everything that we do and tying it together with something else and we don't fully know all that all i'm asking you tonight is always be referent to this principle that's true that our actions and what we take into our life does affect somebody else and can affect other things in our life how pleasing we are to god it does affect sometimes the blessing or the curses that comes in our life the principles so true but i wanted to warn we're not prophets so we don't think we could uh uh we with that we can't see exactly what's related uh i remember someone had said in the hospital to somebody hospital room to somebody years ago i had a friend in toledo and uh he does he hasn't come to the church for many years but he he said that his family quit coming to church completely i think they were baptist and it was because someone up in the hospital had said because you had done this and his sister was there in the hospital and she had an accident she's in terrible condition and he said the whole family because you did this that's why she's in this hospital sick well he there's no way for him to know that exactly and that family lost all confidence in god and church and never come for years gator gator my friend was the only one that had confidence to come to church but he says i constantly plead and pray for my family but one comment that was made like that destroyed their trust and so that's why we have to be careful that we don't read into things in our minds a lot of times we don't do it with ourselves we do it with other people that's right we got it all figured out when it comes to other people's lives you know make it really easy on ourselves come on can i get a witness tonight we make it real easy but we become prophets to other people's lives well if they hadn't done that then they probably wouldn't been hurt over here a little accent with that i don't think that we should live in a constant wondering which things that we did had a cause and effect in other parts of our lives because we can be defeated all the time trying to do that i had a thought i had a bad thought about somebody so that must be why the car got totaled today or my kid spilled his ice cream on my new suit and it must be because i paid my taxes late last week something like that and so now you know we can't figure all this out and i'm only saying that because people do that the devil gets people's mind in a mode that they live in constant defeat trying to figure everything out trying to figure out what god's doing with them and we just need to submit ourselves to the lord because uh whatever he allows in our life is going to be good for us is that right we do reap what we sow you can't change that law all right and so i and i'm i'm still and you probably you are i'm still reaping uh some things that i decisions that i made years ago i'm still reaping those things but i was i loved it when i heard brother barry uh teach us one time that the only way to change it you can't change the harvest you're getting from bad decisions you can't change it you're gonna reap it but you can start sowing good seed so that you can get a better harvest down the road and that's what i've been trying to do so i can't change this harvest but i can make a new harvest for the future because the principle still works if we plant good seed praise the lord so you know that gives us a relief to understand it but what i want us to see tonight is that we we need a reverence for the principle that some things are tied to the other can you say man and when we have a when we have an irreverence for that principle we tend to give ourselves our rights to do things too much and to act on things and to incorporate things or to take something in our life without prayer or without thought of how it would affect others i think that's immaturity to quickly take something in your life because you your flesh wants it but there's no prayer there's no thought as to how it would affect others i think you can should consider that as a mature christian that now how will this affect my family in the future how will this affect other people in the congregation how does this look to other people well i don't care what people think what you look like well that doesn't fit with the whole christian walk friends because it does matter i was just telling someone the other day he says we can't have the attitude to say well i don't really care what other people think especially when we're in ministry we can't do that we can't take that attitude it is important what we put out before the public because we're representing jesus christ and we didn't want to stumble somebody can you say man that would be the worst thing for somebody look at my life and they're stumbled at my christian testimony so when we have a reverence then we're more prayerful and consider what we incorporate into our lives that would be a bad example so if we know the examples in the message we see that we must be prayerful that there's many examples in the message that we must be prayerful about these things because it's brought out in many things disrespect to god's servant sometimes can bring something can you bring a disease can bring a cancer and brother branham's own wife uh experienced that one day he says one day i come in and from the house and i come in to do something i turned around and went out and i said she said my wife can you go downtown with me bill and i said not right now honey and he said and she said what are we going to do about becky a certain certain thing and that hannah i don't know what just what to do now and there is something that had come up and she was so nervous she could hardly hold herself together people at the house all night long night on the night before all night until one o'clock in the morning hear people in around the house around the windows and she'd become nervous and she'd become upset so when she was real nervous and she said something to me snappy that she she shouldn't she ought to have said but you see she said like then bill you're you're always gone and i have to take care of these children myself and she said you're never here we can't make decisions together you're either out and gone and she started crying and went in and shut the door right then i said oh poor little fella i said my i ought to and i started out and went out to talk to her and it said in second chronicles it was when miriam rebuked moses for marrying an ethiopian girl be better that her father had spit in her face and to do this and i went back and i said sweetheart you said the wrong thing and she was crying and i said you said the wrong thing honey god is going to make you pay for that you shouldn't have done that i'm all tore up myself uh oh no excuse me she said i'm all tore up myself you shouldn't have said that and she said well bill i just get so tore up and i'm sure she was apologizing and i i just turned and i walked back out because i know she wasn't in the mood to receive it so i went back out and the next act the next examination at the doctor about a month after that showed a tumor and the lord actually spoke to him says because she said that now this is friends listen now and this is not meant to scare anybody this is just to bring reverence in our heart this was a snappy remark she made to her husband and he didn't even get offended by it but god did now i know it's quiet right now but you know what it's a good lesson for all of us that's right because we may offend the lord's spirit more often than we think and this is the reverence that i'm preaching to you to be sensitive to is that and i'm going to get to this at the end the presence that god is not just this bible but he's a person christ the person and if we consider a person then we have to reverence that person's presence when he's around all the time that he's around can you say amen amen and so our treatment of one another how brother bram says how we treat one another is how we treat christ so that's why you have these examples and just reverence for a principle and gaw of god that still stands sometimes one thing is tied to the other and that is a principle that we see here so we see that through the bible so now the aitkin family experienced what to go through in this trouble when they decided to do this and let me just say this why you don't want to put your family in the valley of acor can you say man you won't be blessed you don't want to end up your family the in the valley of acor the valley of trouble and their end was not a good end that's for sure so but the aiken family experienced what it was like to do that now let's read deuteronomy chapter 7. there's a great place here that expounds a little bit on this um a bit we want to get a little bit more specific so god says in deuteronomy 7 here and i got a few scriptures couple scriptures written down that i want to get to but look at this at the beginning when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whether thou goes to possess it and hath cast out many nations before thee the hittites the gergashites and the amorites and the canaanites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites and the websites seven nations greater and mightier than thou and when the lord thy god shall deliver them before thee thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them thou shalt make no covenant with them nor show mercy unto them neither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son so when you go into these places and have to mingle you're going to go in there to take your land but there's going to be such mingling sometimes god's saying i want you to stay separate i want you to stay separate i want you to smite them how do you destroy them show no mercy and don't let your children marry their sons or their daughters so the theme is separation for they will turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods so will they anger the lord be kindled against you and destroy the suddenly but thus shall you deal with them you shall destroy their altars break down their images cut down their growths burn their graven images so none of that stuff he wants incorporated into your life he wants you to destroy us all that stuff that they use all the stuff that he the nations use we don't use it for thou and this here's the reason for thou art a holy holy means separate holy means special holy means set apart you are a holy people under the lord thy god the lord thy god had chosen thee to be underlined it a special people unto himself now i don't know what you understand about god's uh god's word about separation but god is a separator amen the first abraham our father the first thing he did was separate him from his family and got him out into his land so god could speak to him amen separation is the first thing god is a separator from anything that keeps us from our promise amen if we eliminate that principle of god we eliminate the access even to the holy ghost because we have to lay our life down and die and separate from all things that would hinder us from receiving the holy spirit that's the first step and so now we see we see there's grave and hymns all these things separate but what's the purpose because you're a special people unto me above all the people that are on the face of the earth the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than the people for you were the fewest of all the people but because the lord loved you separation the purpose for it is because you're a special people unto god now listen i didn't say that we're not saying that about ourselves god says it about us you know if we said it too much we get proudful right we would get proud folk to say i'm special but we didn't say it about ourselves god said it about you and his reason for separation is not a reason to to that he wants to make you uh proud for his reason because he loves you and you're a special people that he wants set aside to do something through and because he loves you set his love upon you and because he'd keep his oath with you and all these other things so now the reason for separation is you're special and you're different and he wants your lives untainted by their things that they do he wants it that's why he calls for separation now when we get to this verse 26 and uh yeah verse 25 and 26 the graven images of their gods shall be burned with fire thou shalt not desire the silver or gold remember that's what the aiken desire ache and family desire don't desire the silver or gold that is on them oh that is on them thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto thee lest thou be snared therein for it is an abomination to the lord thy god continue on neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house lest thou be uh lest thou be a cursed thing like it now here we are in deuteronomy we read later in joshua where the aiken family did this so obviously they ignored what god said here it had already been said obviously they either hadn't read that scripture in a long time or they had read it and ignored it and said that doesn't count anymore that doesn't count in these modern times we're in the inheritance now brother we've moved on we're over in the promised land with joshua now that doesn't count anymore yes it did can i get an amen we're over here man where moses is gone we've moved on to the inheritance here we are now that doesn't count any war yes it does he said it back in deuteronomy and the principle still applied in the promised land and he says take the graven image and don't bring it in the abomination in thine house lest thou be a cursed thing like it but thou shalt utterly detest it and thou shalt utterly abhor it for it is a cursed thing look at that detest of you gotta pray that god so fills you with the holy ghost that you detest things of sin and the things of the world like god does that it actually makes us sick like it does god that's the problem today we don't have enough holy ghost because the things of the world are not making us sick we're actually attracted to them that's right there's a problem with that right when we get the same spirit of god it is his spirit living within us and he hates those things that's why i said if you love he said if you love the world or the the things that are in the world the love of the father is not in you amen the same holy ghost will hate it like god hates it praise the lord you can't have a seminar on hating things of the world you can't do that you can't legislate people into that you can't you can't have a class on that you have to pray for the real holy ghost in your life the baptism of the holy ghost will be your answer to living above sin can i get an amen that's your answer the baptism of the holy ghost anything other than that your life will head back towards the things of the world the only answer is the baptism of the holy ghost graven images means they carved images back then and so the images of curse were made of all their gods but the image brought something into their home that was visible to their eyes so that it reminded them constantly it was all ever before them of all their gods so they carved out these images or they had a molten carter molten image and molten was set it set in a certain you know brass thing to to mold it or they were carved out of wood or other materials and they made an image so that you could have something constantly put in your mind and constantly direct you to all the different gods that people serve so the children of israel were warned against this when they first even come around the heathen and for a time they kept it up but after a while they started to become attracted to these images and these other gods they must have been very i don't know they must have been very attractive on the outside for them to go on the market and say you know what that would look really good in my home that fits the decor because i can't imagine somebody in children of rivers are just saying i want to serve other gods i want to serve their gods i don't think it was always like that i believe that it was some attraction to the outward look of it this really looks good this can't possibly hinder my home but then you realize that's tied to a god can you say amen it it was to all their gods they served and so now the reason they brought it is because they could constantly be reminded they could constantly be looking at that image to remind them of the god that they served something that sat there in their living room and constantly flashed images of the gods people served images of all the gods people serve i wonder if we have anything that's close to something like that today being sarcastic of course i wonder if this generation then we could say that this applies that the actual one of the ten commandments applies today more than ever because they didn't have images like we have them today we have images flashed in front of us constantly not just in our homes but on our phones on our computers it's a continual flashing of images all the time and some of those images in fact a greater portion of them are meant to be there for an intent to grab your mind and draw you into the covetousness that sometimes lays in your heart to cause you to say i want that that's something that i want i want to i want to be so now we have images that's placed in front of us a constant uh uh uh what's the word there's imagery placed in front of us constantly and uh it's placed before us all the time flashing images of all the gods people worship today i wonder if we watch them long enough would we desire their gods too that's what happened to israel but we're different we are no we're the same human beings our heart is built the same way and i wonder if you looked at something long enough and images long enough you'd want it i think so because of the way we're built i want it i want it i want it i want it because why it's placed in a way that it's constantly flashed in front of you it works the same way and i would venture to say well let me say confidently that this scripture just like i said a few months ago about the wisdom of this world in first corinthians one when paul in two and three where paul breaks all that down the distinction in the mind of christ and the wisdom of this world i would say those the scriptures apply more today than they did in paul's day because of the wisdom of the world so being readily available all the time on the world wide web i mean it is thoughts of the wisdom of this world ever before us ever planted in our minds so evermore we should we there never was a time more than we should really value those scriptures because they're more significant today than they were even back then i would say this is another example wouldn't you i would say that the graven image thing and images in front of us that could possibly draw us into worshiping other things and remember an idol is something that comes in between you and god i would say this applies more than it ever has and so i wonder if we watch those things long enough would we desire gods too uh oh no not us not us i'm built different brother paul i i'm a different human being than those back there in the old testament i'm different than the children of israel and yet the images and the gods displayed before us immorality illicit sex bodies of women the naked bodies of women half-dressed women the gods of covetedness the gods of uh adultery is placed before us fornication fornicating situations constantly people sleeping with one another constantly and it's just presumed that's normal life the wisdom of the world is flashed before us and and the image of a new improved cool jesus is placed in those images as well right to attract somebody who's looking for that the image of a of a church that we could go to that has the image of a new improved cool jesus becomes attracted to millions of people that fill mega churches images attract him and it's all they're visible and it's constantly flashed before the people you want religion we've got this you want this you want you want the new status car it's just flashed constantly in car commercials to where someone goes and gets it and they have to live with constant car commercials again that a few days later they're wondering if they bought the right one because there's a new model it's a constant worship of bowing down to things other than our god come on now let's be honest the preachers tell it like it is tonight we don't like to hear it sometimes but we're like those human beings in the old testament we're not built any different when it comes to a human being and so these scriptures apply and he said the way to deal with that is that if that's one of those images set no evil thing before you and he says don't bring it into your place because it's a cursed thing to test it utterly abhor it for it is truly a curse thing amen so prayer having the thought will this affect us because friends we live in a time that and you know what there's some families that decide not to have any any uh bit of uh movies or anything in their home i respect that and i i i thank god for it i don't think we should ever criticize anybody who does that right that's a wonderful thing they're not uh weirdos that's right they might be a little stronger than you but i had brother tell me last year said you know what some of that stuff is all some of that stuff's hope wholesome is good he said but i know me and i know my kids and we're just better just to go without any of it but then you got some that make choices about wholesome things i like to have the high standard if i can and you know i have kids and so i have the pressures of stuff trying to creep in sometimes and uh you know but i i like to see i like something that happened like history or something that reflects our values something that sends a strong message of of christianity or something that's wholesome or something you can sometimes laugh with but it sends a strong message i like to keep the standard up high because i know my flesh too is that i would easily sway into things that are not not valuable things sorry sorry i'm just being honest with you tonight maybe you're you know maybe you have reached a plateau or something i don't know or but some people they'll incorporate certain things in our home here's the principle here's the principle you must pray and you must think about what effect this would have does this reflect what the presence of the lord uh does this does this invite the presence of the lord or is this going to send away the presence of the lord just that simple praise the lord and some of you young people will have to make that decision pretty soon when you get married yourself so you can't depend on the decisions of mom and dad you say lord say lord i want to be filled with your spirit and i want to make decisions daily that are pleasing in your sight so it says don't bring those images in your house constantly before your eyes all the time and your children's why it's cursed and we've seen what the aiken family weather did now let's switch to our text if you'd go back to that in first chronicles 13. let's switch to the obedium family we've talked enough about the aitkin family let's talk about the obaditum family say that with me obadidam you know you might not be saying it right because i just taught you it but for tonight it's the obedient family okay obedient i couldn't find the translation how to whatever that's called where you figure out each thing in the the the what pronunciation of it i can't even pronounce pronunciation can't even say that but the obadinum family is a positive story because here we find in first chronicles uh a great thing and that is first chronicles let's turn there again first verse 13. that is that when this ark was kind of here they're trying to bring the art back and uh when they're bringing it back david has his situation where there it wasn't the will of god for him to bring it back that way and we could go into that tonight um you know under the message uh there was the great revelation of chapter 13 of first chronicles was revealed in the last days by the message doing god a service without his will that chapter i believe was really brought out and light was shed upon it in a way that really applies to today as well so you should read that you should pray with that message because it's wonderful david wanted the ark it was a pure desire it was a sincere desire but he made some mistakes how he approached the ark and how he brought the ark and so the private taught us that something can be the right thing but it's got to be the will of god we got to work within the true will of god it looks like something well we need to do something we need to do something but is it the will of god so it teaches us that and it teaches us that the word and how it they brought it on a new cart and he wasn't supposed to bring it on a new car it teaches us that the priesthood have to handle the word and someone else reached up there in touch and an innocent man died because they were doing things outside of the way that god's order had for carrying the ark so all that story is there and so but they finish up here and uh what happens is that david didn't want to take it to his house so he gives it to the obadin family and the oba needham family take this ark into their home and they they welcomed it and the bible says that david brought not the ark home to himself in the city of david but carried aside into the house of adam the get diet and the ark of god remained with the family of obadim in his house three months and the lord blessed the house of obadidom in all that he had now the ark represents not only just the word of god but what came with that ark was the presence of god so omadeedom's house their family became blessed because this ark was in their home i say praise god because obviously here he's a gentile i believe he's one of the 600 men the gentile warriors that came with david to make him king and so here is a a gentile family here's a family that wasn't really in the children of israel and we would think that's not going to work for them no that's a there's we got a monopoly on this thing and it only works in the children of israel well this proved that it wasn't true and i believe with all my heart when the presence of god and the word of god is truly welcome in a home it brings the presence of god in and that family becomes blessed i don't care who they are amen there's a blessing that goes with it if you welcome him and i mean really welcoming and i want to talk tonight before we close in a few minutes about welcoming not just the word because i've been preaching about blessed families having the word we went back to deuteronomy 7 the mandate that it gives to parents that we're supposed to teach the children the word of god talk about what moses said talk about the laws of moses talk about all the principles you brought talk about them when you get up talk about it when you go to bed talk about them in the afternoon talk about them at work plant them upon the doorposts of your house put them everywhere put them in front of your kids all the time talk about them talk about them till you're out of breath that was the principle it's not just they hear it at sunday school but integrate the word in their life so we've been talking about that but this ark represents more than just teaching them the bible and the word this is the presence of god amen and this is actually even more important i would say more important because you could teach the word of god all the time to your kids and not be inviting the presence that goes with the word what our children need to see is which i preached on sunday is a manifestation of the reality of god not head knowledge not intellectual things of the word not a code to live by but the real jesus christ that they could really get a hold of his presence because it is the presence he is a person the word this is just to help us to introduce us to the person i believe the message was to help us introduce us to the person but once we meet the person can you say amen we want to know him more we want to stay in his presence so it's not about the bible's just being there up on the shelf and we say we believe that bible children and we're going to take it down and we're going to read it to you and this is what god means this is what he says but there's a heart that says god make that presence real to my children and family and that's what it means by bringing the ark and their family obedium family for three months was having a good time because they got to have the ark of the covenant can you imagine the ark of the covenant i've got a little one in my office back there i love it my wife bought it for me but they had the actual ark of the covenant in their home for three months and everything for those three months in their life was blessed somebody say praise the lord somebody give a handclap to the lord praise the lord and that's when we invite his presence into our homes when we make him as the person welcome in our homes when he doesn't then everything becomes blessed in our lives and we get over our troubles easier don't we we get through our trials easier because he's welcome in our home he's welcome now i'm going to have some specifics to what it means to bring his presence in our home that you may get a little uncomfortable with i probably won't have time to bring him tonight but i'd like to through this series be more practical and say what we need to do and what we need to say and what we need to not set amen amen to welcome the presence of god in our homes praise the lord this the fat the the obedient family i i'm jealous they got the actual covenant ark of the covenant to be there in their home for three months and so um they welcome the right thing in their home and this is a simple principle to catch they welcome the right thing in their home and it was blessed and they made a home for the word and everything pertaining to them was blessed you know there are choices that we make as a family choices where the word is welcome and his presence is welcome and choices where his presence is not welcome and his word is not taught but it's not just the word as i said his presence comes with it he is a person his ark is his presence coming his ark is his presence being real to us how many want to invite his presence how many want to just not just invite his presence into your home into your life but also make him feel welcome remember the pharisees that invited jesus to the the party there but they invited him but he wasn't welcome remember the woman went down and washed his feet with her hair she not only invited him but she made him feel welcome they didn't wash his feet they didn't treat him like he was anybody you're just you know we just invited you that's good enough but we want to make jesus welcome in these houses in our houses at home larry christianson wrote a book on the christian family here many many years ago and there's one paragraph here a couple paragraphs uh that i'd like to read in closing tonight and uh he brings out a really good point on this particular line here first part of his book dealt with uh cultivating the order of god because god has an order for everything god's a god of order god's not the author of confusion the first part of the book he says he talks about the order there's an order for a man a husband there's an order for woman it's a different order than man from the woman can you say amen god has an order and you'll be blessed in that order there's an order for a man there's an order for a woman god has an order for the children a divine order uh he has an order for the family he has an order for the church we have church order here praise the lord a lot of it has been set up by the prophet of the last days and encouraged us to do certain things to keep church order we appreciate those things why because god is a god of order he set the order for the age and so now we find in this divine order he says we set the beginning that the secret of a good family is simply to cultivate the family's relationship with jesus christ that's a really good statement that the the the secret of a good family life is to cultivate the family's relationship with jesus i'd say that's pretty good i say that's our goal to have a family constantly cultivating a relationship with jesus christ we begin with the consideration of divine order but divine order alone is not enough as god's order begins to shape the outward form of a family's life the presence of jesus must be given false way to transform the inner life and here's where we face a fundamental problem and friends both of those things are important we have watched through the years where the order of the outside was emphasized so much that somebody forgot the the the change of the inside that's right but but we can't just go it's just a change on the inside and that's it and there's no order to it that's not true either that's right they both work in harmony together they're both important especially for the family so as god's order begins to shape the outward form of family life the presence of jesus must be given the false way to transform the inner life and here's where we face a fundamental problem precisely what do we mean by the presence of jesus just how does a family live together with jesus christ our little niece martha was about three years old when she reported a simple and profound discovery to her grandmother she pointed to a picture of jesus on the wall and said that's jesus i say hi to him but he doesn't say hi back to me her sister nancy younger by a year picked up the thought and de and proclaimed at the table one day jesus jesus jesus that's all i hear about here but he don't say nothing that's what the little three-year-old said i can't say it like she said it jesus jesus jesus that's all i hear about but he don't say nothing with the innocent candor of childhood they put their finger on a deep mystery and paradox of christian faith christian faith is a personal relationship with jesus but jesus does not behave like an ordinary person we think he's a person i'm telling these young people who's a person here tonight well where is he some of them in their childlike way would say okay where is he if he's a person like your person brother paul then where is he then so we may not be able to interact on that same level when we call him a person like that but he is a person invisible as he may be he is a person he doesn't come around so i can see him he doesn't speak to me he doesn't write me any letters he doesn't call me up on the telephone a person is someone i can talk to and be with but he doesn't say nothing it is not that the child is a skeptic he is simply a realist he hears jesus talked about as a person in prayers he hears jesus addressed as a person so he expects jesus to behave like a person but time after time this does not take place so as the child grows older he begins to accommodate his thinking to the actual experience jesus was a person on earth long ago one day we will meet him in heaven as a person but in the meantime he don't say nothing a personal relationship with jesus alternates between nostalgia and hope but does not touch down in here and now in the here and now so if the truth were known many adults would confess the same sense of puzzlement and frustration voiced by children they know about jesus and they truly believe in him yet the experience of a distinct personal relationship is vague and lacking and that's because there's a lack of an experience with him why is it for instance that so a few christians can speak simply and confidently of having experienced clearly clear guidance from the lord in the matter of their own life many even protest piously that it is presumptuous to think that we can know the specific will of god you see so i could read and read more and more and i just want to get to the back here because our time is running out but i think it's a great presentation to see it from a child's eyes and a child's understanding is to realize if we call them a person then we you know they want to be able to experience it like a person that they know he is a person and he's so real that we can invite him into our lives and in our homes in such a way that i believe that we can feel his presence and there can be identifications to the child as they grow how god is real if parents are the parents of faith and they live by faith and they make the priority god in their lives not just the word but his presence in their life those children will see through financial troubles through trials through things that they call upon through prayers that they ask and god comes through they see hey there is a person here there is an there is a a presence that's present with us beyond just our family here sitting down for dinner we're addressing someone that is real can you say amen so it's about that's what the ark was about as they experience not just that being there but the presence that goes with it i think that's that's what that type speaks of that's what it shows now i just read a couple other things if we could ways that we can do this presenting god to our children through example said hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and you shall love the lord your god with all your heart with your soul with all your might if you live that in front of your kids that's probably enough in itself that you live so passionately that you love him with all your heart soul mind and strength the familiar passage of scripture is actually the beginning of an instruction to parents note that it begins by describing the attitude which the parents themselves have towards god the lord knew that without a fundamental love towards god on the part of the parents their teaching of the children would be hollow and base the starting point and the foundation for the priesthood of parents is the parent's own love excuse me and this is the parents their own love and their own devotion to god if parents do not have a living relationship with jesus they cannot hope to convey such a relationship to their children is the parents relationship to the lord one of dry rules and regulations a stern moralism and nothing more a dreary round of religious duties and exercises evoking little excitement and nothing of real joy a thin veneer that is tacked on the outside mainly for show children are far more perceptive in spiritual matters than adults sometimes realize they do not respond merely to words and formal beliefs of parents they sense the inner spirit of their faith and that is what they react to oftentimes young people who rebel against the christian faith are not rebelling against god at all they have never had the actual encounter with god with the living god to rebel against it so they're not rebelling against god they're revealing rebelling against how god was presented to them no do we have a lot of cases of that even going on now have a lot of grace and prayer for people that are even leaving this message because i think a lot of them they got the wrong perception of what the message is through their parents or through a church and so it's a reaction to say now the message is all wrong it's not true but you've got to pray with that and be careful that there's been people that's done that big circle where they've been under a really uh uh dict dictator type ministry in the message just just an abuse a mental abuse preaching the very message but a spirit of dictatorship the spirit of nicolaitanism and they're on that for years they've been mentally abused by it when they leave it's just like i don't want to hear the term message in my life they become vic vindictive they're just i'm out of here i'm finished with it go away and then all of a sudden something comes around and there's story after story about this friends all of a sudden now they come around and and through some some source they're able to build the value back of what god blessed us with in the last days and it's not tainted anymore by how they were raised or what church they were in and when there's a true baptism of the holy ghost i'll say it again that's the answer that's the answer they sense the inner spirit of faith and that is what they react to oftentimes young people who rebel against christian faith are not rebelling against god they have never had an actual encounter with the living god to rebel against it they are rebelling against the dead religious formalism which merely imposed upon them a certain set of rules or rituals parents who want their children to know god must cultivate their own rel their own relationship with god first and foremost this means a life of prayer because when you're praying you're saying to those children and that family daddy when you're praying all the time about things you're recognizing first of all you're under headship but you recognize your dependence on god and there's another presence i'm talking to all the time amen what a what a powerful effect that leaves and not just saying you know at the table some quick prayer and that's all the time that's the only time to hear daddy pray is to pray for the food that's the only prayer to pray for the food you know there are other things to pray about i'm having a good time tonight some of you aren't i tell that but i can't make some of you laugh for the life of me so now no amount of moral instruction firm discipline religious instruction or church going can make up for the lack of a praying parent this is well said amen for it is preeminently in and through prayer that we passed the realm of theory into the realm of reality and personal experience how can we convince our children that god is important if we never give him any of our time how can we pretend to love him when we scarcely spend a minute with him alone our children may dutifully learn our rituals and chant their meal time grace grace god is great god is good god is great let us take thank him for this foot but down in their heart where the real attitudes are formed are prayerlessness excuse me prayerless lives have taught another message god is great but he can wait gotta hurry or i'll be late god is great but he can wait i gotta hurry or i'll be late happy the child happy the child who happens in upon his parent from time to time to see him on his knees who sees mother and father rising earlier going aside regularly to keep times with the lord that child has learned a lesson no lecture could impart he has seen that god matters he's important enough to take up our time and he is personal you don't just obey his rules you actually communicate with him who's bringing the word let's stand together well said you can say amen to that end say amen to larry christensen i love the lord so much don't you tonight amen i love the lord key of f and i left my voice to him yeah that's the prayer request thank you gideon i love you though and i lift my voice to work take your my may be surely the presence of the lord is in this place i can feel his mighty power and his grace i can hear the brush of angel's wings i see glory on each legs of the lord is in this place oh surely the rest of the lord is in this place i can feel his mighty power and his grace oh i can hear angel's wings i see glory on each face yesterday surely the presence of the lord
