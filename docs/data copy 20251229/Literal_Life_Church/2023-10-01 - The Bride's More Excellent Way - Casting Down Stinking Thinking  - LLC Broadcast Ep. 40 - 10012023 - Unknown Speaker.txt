[Music] in everything [Music] preciousness name is [Music] [Applause] [Music] days [Music] second Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 3. for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds and that's a reference to something in war where you have strongholds we have walls in the Old Testament different things that are are blocking us and so we have a power within the word and within the spirit of God that will pull down strongholds and we're thankful for that but remember we don't walk in the flesh we are we are fleshly we are human we make mistakes can you say Amen so but though he said we walk in the flesh verse 3 we do not war after the flesh so we cannot fight demons with fleshly power we can't respond to demonic forces and what Satan brings us with just an intellect or something human it has to be something more powerful so even though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having an a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled that's quite a statement in itself that having a Readiness we're prepared to Revenge all uh all disobedience so no that now that's you know we we talk about revenge we're not supposed to take revenge on our own hands towards someone else but any Disobedience that's in our life Disobedience and our thoughts that's something we can take revenge on and come against so the whole thought here is as Paul's thought to be able to bring these thoughts captive to him to be ready to Revenge all Disobedience and that our obedience was fulfilled I personally believe this scripture speaks of a final Victory also uh in when he says when your obedience is fulfilled someday your complete obedience will be fulfilled when the love of God moves us then we need to go without and we need to watch what it does can you say mom when the love of God moves you you need to go with that and go because we need to trust that and then watch what the love of God can do supernaturally and don't let your thinking talk you out of it do you know that your thinking can talk you out of good things that's supposed to come your way your fears can influence your thinking and talk you out of something really good that's supposed to happen to you God's sending something your way and you can talk yourself out of it amen so think about how powerful that is that's Well what we'll speak of but we don't want to let our thinking interrupt and we want to apply in every situation during during the day uh what we're what we're we're learning can you say man that love is flowing through us it should flow out of us and that we need to apply it to every situation my problem I don't know if it's your problem but there's certain situations come up I'll Resort back to I'll figure this one out myself but but we're supposed to say Lord but now here's another situation I'm speaking to my child I'm speaking to this one or that one or speaking to someone else and every situation we just lay back say now what would the love of God want to say here I was going through the Valvoline Instant Oil last night and doing getting my oil changed and my mom's van there and so I won't be long on this but I was just sitting there and when I told him it was a church related vehicle this young man this young man just began to really talk to me and I told him as a church but the talk was very bitter uh he let me know clearly he was an atheist he let me know he grew up in a Conservative Christian Home In Georgia and said well you don't have an accent anymore and he'd only been here just a few years I said usually my wife just still has her accent you know and he said he don't have that well that just opened up and then he talked about his the legalism of his childhood and his parents and just he went on and on and on and on and luckily he had other guys working on my car to get the job done but he just talked and so then you know this is how I thought I'm just being honest with you not my first thought was that that's a ton of scriptures came to me that I could address this I could correct this I could respond quickly because I you know I've fed on the word since I was 16 years old and that was the first but I just sat back said no wait a minute this is an opportunity to say what what's God want to do here instead of just giving a bunch of scriptures and he might associate we me with his family and his childhood and I said Lord what are you doing here because this man's really opening up to me and I don't know him from from anybody and he just really is letting me have it he didn't know as a pastor but you know I was a church related and he just kept getting going and I said I said well isn't it interesting I said I felt the Lord led me to say this isn't it interesting that God you're an atheist Now isn't it bad that somehow in this world God has to be tainted by some bad things that the church does it's too bad that God got tainted for you because to me God should be separate than that he's pure he doesn't have anything to hurt you but yet you associate it with that you know I just said that's too bad and then he went on and on he did all the talking and uh kept going and I said what what was it what was the re what's the real deal he's showing me a tattoo of joining Satan's church and all of it's in retaliation let my parents know I mean it this was this guy was he was a friendly guy but man was he ever bitter and I just said nor let my love reach out to this young man what do you want to say to him and I just begin to feel I'm going to just to say a few things I told him I appreciate you sharing your heart I knew I'd be through there again I said I'll see you next time and just plant the sea a few seeds there that's what I felt to do but I said what was it what's really what what happened he said I'll tell you he said he said the church was trying to be put on such a such a front to everybody and make me put it on he said when I was molested sexually by my uh by uncles or whoever it was as a little boy the church covered that up they wouldn't talk about it they wouldn't deal with it they wouldn't preach against it and he says that's what I said I and you know what fella I understand how you feel because I said that should never happen and so he still was very cold and everything but you know what I got a chance to say a few things just to look past all the front all the bitterness and look past and the way he was talking to me it's almost like he felt like that he was reaching out for something and unsettled and that's what I said and so I I'm going to say I'm going to leave and leave him with some good words and I'm gonna I'm gonna pray for him I'm going to prayer for and I don't know his name I wouldn't say it here tonight but I'm going to pray for him so every everything nothing should be left out of in our lives of something we come up against of praying saying now Lord how do you want your what that which is within me to come out in this situation it might be your husband in an argument with your husband may not be the guy at Valvoline it might be your husband or wife the subject that Paul brings out here is actually first related to Paul being misread by uh a few Believers and so This Is How They misread him back in the first scriptures if you want to break it down in second Corinthians chapter 10 he said I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who Am presence and base among you but being absent and bold towards you I'm going to pick it up in the Amplified and read it so I want you to catch why Paul's writing this chapter and the theme behind it it's it's some Believers that were Mis uh misunderstanding Paul and this is how they must understood them uh now I Paul urge you to by the gentleness and graciousnesses of Christ I who am meek he said now I who am meek so they say when I'm with you face to face but bold outspoken and fearless towards you when I'm absent so it's not he said that they're actually criticizing some Believers and saying Paul he's so different when he's in the Pulpit he's so different when he's face to face and he's so he's so humble and he's just so gentle about things but the letters we're getting from him my goodness he's raking us over the goals and they were they were clearly misunderstanding his love and misunderstanding him and these were Believers that were doing that and he goes on to say then he says they say when you when you're face to face you're humble and meek but bold when you're out smoking a Fearless when you write us your letters I ask that when I do come I will not be driven to the boldness that I intend to show towards those those few who regard us as if we walked to the flesh like men without the spirit so he discerned that these guys were being these brothers were being carnal about how they were viewing Paul and he said when I come I'm praying that I will be driven to be bold towards those men and also the the how they've misread me for though then he goes into for though we walk in the flesh as mortal men we are human we are mortal men we are we are we have mortal weakness can you say Amen we are not but we are not carrying on our spiritual warfare according to the Flesh and using the weapons of man so they were misreading Paul in what he was saying that somehow it was some carnal agenda that he what he was saying uh in his letters to them and uh I I just can just tell you I have been there and done that and I feel that feeling sometimes people misread your motives and misread the things that you're saying and sometimes would even take it personal and I never intend to want to do that if I do it I apologize for it but I not never want to intend to do that but you know I've met ministers and you can sit across the table from them and you can't hardly get a word out on they're just so quiet uh and they're just they don't hardly say nothing you can't hardly fuss with them because they're just so humble and so quiet we see humble is quiet that's what we associate it with and and but then you see him in the Pulpit just as bold and you know just say it like it is you know and so sometimes the anointing will bring a minister to do that and he's saying things that might appear carnally to you that might hurtful but you don't want to take it as hurtful you want to say this may be the Lord speaking to me but you know he goes on to say here for though we walk in the flesh we are not carrying our Warfare according to the Flesh and using the weapons of man the weapons of our Warfare are not physical weapons of Flesh and but our weapons are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses we are destroying listen to this we are destroying sophisticated arguments and every exalted and proud thing that sets itself up against the true knowledge of God we are warring against sophisticated arguments on the internet today that's what we're warning at but we're not warring against it with reasoning or or the spirit of argument can you say man we're coming at it with the love of God and the weapons of our Warfare are our spiritual not carnal you can't fight anger with anger you can't fight carnality with carnality you can't fight an evil spirit with another evil spirit you can't do that it has to be something greater than that evil spirit and so I loved how he this is worded in the Amplified we're destroying the sophisticated arguments and every exalted and proud thing that sets itself against the knowledge of God and we are taking every thought and purpose captive to The Obedience of Christ being ready to punish Every Act of Disobedience when your own obedience as a church is complete so now what we pull out of this section of scripture is something beyond what Paul was saying that these men are judging me carnal he we get the lesson that our the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal they're spiritual and we don't fight back with something carnal Paul's saying I'm a human being being but I can't fight back with something human it has to be something greater than that it has to be the love of God it has to be the the knowledge of God and so now but we take a lesson out of this and what's the lesson we learn Paul is giving the power the the huge power of our own imagination our power comes when we bring this body under subjection to him that that uh that every channel is cleaned out and ready for service for the Lord that the devil doesn't know what channel to get into that's the victory for the bride then let God do what he wants to do through that but our vessels got to be submitted to him we can't have a Victorious Life over to the devil if our imaginations are going wild we can't have a Victorious Life of a reasoning with the word all the time we have to bring those things in our spirit under his leadership so the power of our own imagination in our spirit realm and the worst thing about this realm of imagination is when it will exalt itself above the knowledge of God can you imagine the arrogance Lucifer did it at the beginning he got thoughts he was the right-hand angel of God and he got started to have thoughts and those thoughts got him into the different thoughts of lifting himself I will be above the most high can you imagine the arrogance and so his thoughts became so powerful that he actually begin to a a connive a plan to somehow bring in him lift himself above the knowledge of God and set himself above God and so now we shouldn't always we know the devil did that but it shows the power of a human mind that can be in us even let me just say it this way if the Lucifer did that at the beginning his own thoughts eventually got so arrogant that I will lift myself above the I will sit as him and be worshiped of God if if if your thoughts exalt itself above the word of God who are you being inspired by so this is you know the worst thing about it is it lifts itself above the knowledge of God that's a serious thing that's a tragic thing when it's happened it's actually to me the worst thing that a Christian can let happen is to let our own thinking or Satan's thing thinking lift itself above the knowledge of God what does it do it quenches the spirit of God from moving in you it quenches the spirit of God from moving in the church it's stunts your growth it keeps marriages and families from finding that key to get out of the rut that they're in to get out of the spirit that's with them for years it stunts and it keeps a marriage and family from the key because sometimes there's just a key of faith that unlocks and all of a sudden in a moment's time forgiveness comes in and things are changed and Everything's changed can you say man but if our minds interrupt that it quenches that from happening you see and people can live in a miserable marriage for years sometimes even living together living separate but it's because there's something holding them from getting that key that unlocks Faith to change the situation and so when our thoughts lift themselves above the knowledge of God it quenches the love of God it quenches the spirit of God it stunts our growth it it hinders families it brings bondage to marriages and families what what is it your own thinking has the power to do that your own thoughts our thoughts are to be under the spotlight of God's word and his spirit all the time always subject to to uh to being corrected always subject to the scrutiny of the Holy Spirit always because of 9 11 happening in our country we will never ever enter an airport again without walking through the scanner you realize that we'll never have a day when we won't be walking through something to scan what's on our body after 9 11. because we learned the enemy can get through so now we have to scanner you're not an enemy you might not have a gun you're not a terrorist but because everybody's suspect right we all got it for the rest of our lives we're never going to change it we'll never enter an airport again without a scanner and if that's a lesson Force we realize if you have a 911 in your life and you have a jolt in your life of what the enemy did to you to tear up your marriage or tear up your life or make you fall that's a 911 that says from now on every thought is captive to the Lord and every thought is scanned scanned and checked by the Holy Spirit because it was my thought life that got me into all that it was my thoughts in pornography that led me to adultery it started with my thoughts is anybody listening tonight it starts in the thought life nobody goes and sins right away it starts in their thinking it starts and then they think that I want more of that Allah so I'm going to look at pornography I'm going to look at this magazine I'm going to look at this woman I'm going to keep doing but it started in their thoughts they let their thoughts be uncontrolled and unchecked by the Holy Spirit and then it turns into sin and so if you have a 911 you better start saying every thought comes under the Captivity of the Lord there is no thought allowed to think on my own it's scanned by the Holy Spirit and if it's a negative thought it's a thought to put somebody down if it's a thought against me when you've got everything under the blood and Satan's accusing you if it's a thought from Satan you're an unworthy believer you don't deserve to come and worship God you don't deserve to even pray today because of what you've done that's a thought that originates in the pits of hell and you quickly say that's not of God it gets scanned it gets out of here it's Satan trying to be bring a gun through the airport can you say man he's bringing a weapon against you in the airport but it gets scanned and it gets confiscated that thought gets confiscated and will not be allowed to go any further into the airport so this is our text casting down imagination for the weapons of other casting down imaginations and and everything that exalteth itself above against the knowledge of God it's contrary so we cast down that imagination we cast down that stinking thinking we cast down what's lifting itself higher than than the leadership of the Lord can you say Amen you think I'm not talking to you as a teenager tonight or as a young man or as a young woman say well I don't even know about what what you're preaching I you know I can't catch all of it you can catch this say I'm only 12 years old you can catch what I'm saying here because guess what when you leave here and even tonight while I was preaching your thought just wandered off somewhere what am I going to do tomorrow I wonder if my my school is going to be difficult tomorrow you have a mind you have a brain you had thoughts and if you looked at something dirty today then your mind's going back to that and I might go back and look at that when I get home so this message is for you tonight this message is for you teenager and it would be better that you get filled with this Holy Spirit and bring your mind under control when you're 10 12 years old it would be better you listen to this fat preacher now and get you now and you could live a lot more Victorious the rest of your life because when you get to 25 30 years old and you fed on wrong things and your mind is all messed up it's a lot harder for the Lord to get a hold of you becomes concrete you'd be like that guy at Valvoline oil Instant Oil Change that is so bitter and atheist I don't even believe in God anymore that's how far mind can go but I'm going to keep loving because there's a there's a force of love of God that can change that and when your thoughts are led to the exalt itself above the word of God then what inspiration are you under that's under the same one as Lucifer from the beginning can you say Amen so we have stinking thinking we have we're to cast down any stinking thinking when it has a smell on it we need to admit that it smells you ever had somebody that smells and they don't smell it but everybody else can and so they need a shower or they something you don't need something and and so but it smells and and so we need to have a sensitivity when thoughts are stinking thinking that's a thought that's stinking that smells that doesn't ring with the aroma of God amen we need to admit it when something a thought doesn't smell right and it's pretty bad when we lose our smell for stinking thinking we should be able to see so sensitive we can smell sin when it's coming we can smell a Temptation when it's coming at us and we can smell stink and think in a bad thought that Satan's thought we can smell it when it's coming and get rid of it watching our message to more information please please in our website
