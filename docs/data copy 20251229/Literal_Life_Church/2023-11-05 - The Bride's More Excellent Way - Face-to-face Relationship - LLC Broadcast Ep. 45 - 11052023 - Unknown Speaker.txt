perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away what he means by that that one day which I believe we're in that time uh we will come to a time that's not seeing Christ in a partial Revelation but a perfect Revelation and that's prophesied for the end time that's Paul's prophecy here when that was which is perfect is come so aren't you happy this morning that you live in the time that we will see a perfect vision of Christ not just the partial Revelation when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly and this is the scriptures I'll get to today for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part in portion in in a partial uh Vision now I see a partial Vision but then but then shall I know even as also I am known we want to uh preach on these things today because what a great Revelation to see and to be known by him but not only will he we we we be we are known by him but we will know him in his fullness he will know us in our fullness and we will know him in his fullness because it's a face-to-face relationship and now abide of faith hope charity Divine love these three but the greatest of these is divine love so we want to just uh try to wrap up the last few verses of 1 Corinthians 13 and if you're a Christian I'm sure you've studied the scripture and looked at these things we've enjoyed looking through the whole chapter is has called it a bit of a window outside of the correction that Paul was given to the Corinthian Church who had leaned towards emotionalism and leaned towards 's prophecies and made such an emphasis on those things U that Paul right in the middle of all of his correction to put the gifts in order and all that right in the middle of it he has this little window into the more excellent way he says he says that all these gifts covet the best gifts they're wonderful they're of God but yet I show unto you a more excellent way and then he breaks into what that more excellent way is and ends the chapter with a prophecy saying that we'll actually come to a more perfect way at the end time and when we see him in that way face to face we will the bride will come into this victory in Divine love how many believe that this morning so because it's a prophecy for our day then it becomes a very significant thing for us to look at and to realize and I would just like to talk about this face-to-face moving into a face-to-face relationship with Christ and I'll just say that it's really the only entrance into this excellent way how many would raise your hand and say I if God said I could live in this victory in Divine love and live in this more excellent way how many raise your hand say I want to live there every day and so Paul shows us the entrance to this more excellent way is a face-to-face relationship with Christ not a partial and when he uses the term we see through a glass Darkly it's a symbol it's a it's a word picture to show us uh it could be a mirror it could be a looking through a window that's clouded uh if I had an example this morning I have a window and so it's nothing worse than trying to look through a window and see something clearly and it's it's clouded with something something sprayed on it and so you have a partial vision of who's behind the window you can see it's Jesus you can see a works of Jesus you can see someone's back there but you never can see it perfectly clearly and he says throughout Seven Ages we've seen through a glass Darkly Christ has done things he's manifested his power we know it's Christ behind there but we we a prophecies is seeing him in part we we're living at a level of seeing him in part but there's a a more powerful relationship coming to the church at the end time that we don't see him through a glass Darkly but we see him face to face for years it's feel I feel like there's so many conventions says we got it we got it we're the bride we got it but you've got to find a you got to harness that into an everyday life praise the Lord you may have something and you know what I'll tell you when you have the perfect word come to you you do have something but it doesn't mean the Perfection has come to you yet person see he's not just he's not just bringing a perfect word which he has but he's bringing his people to Perfection and maturity and remember when Jesus said be ye therefore perfect it didn't mean Flawless or or something like that in the flesh it meant growth to maturity that's what he meant said be perfect as your fathers and it's growth to maturity if we're not growing in the word and in the vision we see of Christ then then we're not going anywhere and so that's what he wants to take his people to perfection I got it I got it I got it but he didn't know what he had we need to know what we have but not just praise and worship and Shout over what we have and that maybe we're better than everybody else get rid of all that i' I've got something I but let the Holy Spirit take what you got and bring you to a perfection in it is that okay with everybody so what what we are what we are called to in this present time what are we called to living in a more perfect understanding of him with Divine love love as our motive for everything that we do living in a more perfect understanding of him this is what Paul's saying living in a more perfect understanding of him with Divine love is the motive for everything that we do every gift everything that we do every every reaction to people we've been preaching this everything that comes in life every trial if we're in that realm of divine love then our reaction is divine love and that's because we have a perfect understanding or we're growing into a perfect understanding of who Christ is we're wanting that to work through our lives if we I I and and listen now if we don't have distinctions from the rest of churches in in our character then we are really like the rest and sometimes we can put down the other churches and I don't think that's right either say well we're different we're better we you know we have we're better than denominations we're better than these other churches well let's see the character of Christ because the distinctions isn't that you have a building or that you have good music or that you have good preachers the distinction the distinction there has to be a further distinction is Christ himself living in the people Jesus said something interesting in Matthew 5 he said for if we love them if you love them that love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same so he's saying that you know if you're have the same characteristics of only loving those that you want to love and you're selective in your love then you're really not any different than the rest of people Jesus is teaching it I'm not and then he says and if you salute or greet your brethren only what do ye more than others the publicans do the same they have their click they have their Clan and they greet one another and kind of ditch everybody else we're the elite group and he says if you're doing that amongst yourself as Brethren you're really not much different in character than what they are praise the Lord I'm always safe when I'm teaching what Jesus said can you say Amen because you if you're a Believer you have to say amen and Jesus said you better watch it because you get amongst yourself and then you become partial you become selective you become I got my own group here and so now your love becomes selective to your only your friends can you say amen I used to say say it this way you invite so and so your real friend over and you serve them steak and the other people you're a little leery of but maybe you have them over and you have them over hot dogs see that's being being it's showing up your attitude towards them is showing up and we don't have to a right to be respector persons like that we can't come into this if you salute your brethren only why do you're not doing anything than the different than the others do not even the publicans and then his next script next thing he says is be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect perfect in other words we're moving out of that that selective love we're moving out of that partiality we're moving out of that that thing that is a respector of persons if that's working amongst the kingdom of God and the people of God then it's not the maturity of divine love yet what do ye more than others how are you different than denominations when we say we have the only way when we say we have the only way now now there's no other way through than through our way how are we any different than a denomination the word is the way the word is the only way Christ is the only way a glass Darkly when we have God doing things through the seven Church ages and he Paul says we see through glass Darkly now showing gifts showing wisdom showing the supernatural praise God all the manifestations of God for seven Church ages but he says still we're still seeing Christ through a glass Darkly even though all these manifestations of God has happened and are still happening I praise God for it but we're still only seeing him through a glass Darkly seeing him through a cloudy glass at its very best and then because we can't completely see him we start to get off track to other things other than him be ye Perfect by the holy ghost moving into you that's what that means that growth to Perfection be ye perfect means by the Holy Ghost we move into something deeper than uh the denominational Creeds has to offer we have not moved to Perfection just because God has given us a perfect word we have not moved to Perfection just because God has blessed us with the perfect word but we have the right thing to look at we have the right vision to look at we have the right vision of Christ to look at so that it can change us and that we can move into more Divine love can you say in mind we haven't reached Perfection because we have God has given us the perfect word by Divine Vindication he has given us that and I'm going to read that quote to you in a minute if I get to it we have that that perfect inter interpretation by Divine Vindication we're blessed with that but you see now just because we have that doesn't mean that we have moved to Perfection but we have the praise God this morning we have the right thing to be looking at it if you look at the right thing and look at this vision of Christ God will change you from glory to glory we see through a glass Darkly and it's that means it's an imperfect view of Christ but when he starts removing the Veil uncovering The Book of Revelation means unveiling Revelation means unveiling he he begins cleaning the glass whatever you want to call it when it's it's it's not just that we become greater intellectually when God does that than the rest of the churches when he starts unveiling it's to bring something deeper in our lives Christ The Mystery of God revealed Christ in you the hope of glory and so when he unveils it's not just to make us smarter than everybody else it's not to give us more Pride but it's to bring more of the mystery of Christ in your own life manifested every day that's what he sends it for so you can see Christ clearly and when you see Christ clearly in Perfection then God can transform you in your life say well what's my problem brother Paul you're probably looking at other things more than you're looking into the word and I say that as a as a conviction to my own life we are so busy we are so distracted we have so many responsibilities how much time is spent looking in the word of God because that's how we see this picture the word the message can you say Amen we see another portion of Christ how much are we given to do that because that's the thing Satan makes us Overlook it Satan makes he puts uh he he taints the message he makes people afraid of the message and he does that for a reason because the power is looking into that character of Christ through the word and we catch something Satan does not want that to happen that's right you become a Powerhouse for the kingdom of God so we might be looking at the wrong thing can I have an amen this morning morning you might be took looking too much instead of into the message and into your Bible amen but when when he starts unveiling and uncovering it's more than just to make us a greater intellectual Church than the other churches then I will know him as he knows me this is the final thought ends that Paul ends and I'm trying to make it a final thought too this is what he ends on is that I when I see him face to face then I will know him as he knows me right I'm going to elaborate on that in a minute this is the final thought Paul brings in this a full knowing a full knowing of Christ and Christ fully knowing you now that's a given that he knows us there's two main revelations in a Christian Life that a Christian that a Believer needs and uh these things are Beyond any gift or Beyond any knowledge Beyond physical healing by the atonement of Jesus Christ this is deeper and first of all we need a revelation that he knows us he knows me he knows my name I have a maker he knows he knows my every thought you say well why are you saying this because there are people that even in tend church and they don't realize God knows you inside and out am let me say it this way God does not have a partial revelation of you he doesn't see you through a glass Darkly even though there are some people that would like God to be looking at them through a glass Darkly because they can hide some things but God does not see you in your life and your past he doesn't see you through a glass Darkly he knows you 100% completely he knows what you done and then the power of forgiveness that God forgive me I put that under your blood then he forgets that he can't remember it anymore boy that's the love of God praise God that's the love of God and when I talk about him knowing you then transfer it over us knowing him because when we have a face to face like he has a face and sees your whole life the love of God kicks in it must because he says if you'll repent and bring that past under the blood I can't see that anymore that part's over can you say Amen talk about a complete picture of you he doesn't see you through a glass Darkly he sees you face to face he sees everything that you are amen so that's the first part in a Christian is coming to and you would like to be able to say that all the Believers and everybody everybody sees how much God knows them but a lot of people think they still have a private life that they're hiding from God and they have a a little secret thing that they do it's not healthy it's wearing out spiritually and but they're going to hold on to that because that's my little private world all the time thinking when nobody at the church sees it the pastor I'm really glad he don't see it and then you buy into the thing that God doesn't see it guess what I hate to be the messenger of bad news God sees everything he seen what you looked at last night on your phone every detail he's an infinite God he knows all things from the end to the beginning he knows he sees it why does this need to be a revelation before the revelation of seeing Christ clearly because you need to know that God knows you and there's nothing that you can hide from God this morning in church and it gets a little bit more exposing when you're in church because the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart I'm preaching with that word this morning and that Holy Ghost is upon me and it could I don't know you but it could say anything right now that exactly pegs exactly what you're doing there was a mom that come to me and says thank you for two or three weeks ago so when you talk to the young people and just gave them a little warning about what they're looking at she said thank you she said because God dealt with me the Wednesday before of the same thing and her and her husband just the same thing and I said that's just the Holy Spirit not just speaking through the preachers but he's speaking through the mothers the fathers if we're in tune with him he's going to drop things in our hearts can you say Amen the word is a discerner he's not going to let things just happen under the current he's going to expose it when you come to church I don't know if I like just going to church because it's too exposing yes because he's here and he knows you Paula fante doesn't know you unless you share something but he knows every detail of your life this morning and yet and yet he has unlimited love for you he loves he knows you here's the song Gloria Gaz wrote the one who knows you the most loves you the most the one who knows me the most loves me the most you see when I talk about these things and how he looks at us I pray you transfer over now that when we're really looking clearly at his face it should bring this Divine love that we look at we won't look at God or one another with a partial revelation but with the full picture it's what happened with the woman they found in adultery and they threw her down using the law and say okay we found her this is it and then Jesus says let him that's without sin cast the first stone what's he doing the love of God is actually expanding their Vision because all they see is through a glass Darkly but Jesus is looking at the whole picture amen okay and that's why he can offer something else because he's looking at a predestinated daughter of God he's looking at the PO potential of what she can be because why he 100% there's no partial revelation of that woman down on the ground they're ready to Stone God doesn't see a partial Revelation or they see a partial Revelation and they're judging her based upon her acts and they caught her in the ACT but you cannot have the Divine love of God and judge by a partial revelation of anybody else you must say God help me to understand and see the whole picture and let your love motivate me God knows everything about you your ins and outs your ups and downs your life your story your your past your present your personality Satan God knows you completely he knows how you tick he knows your bench he knows your weaknesses but Satan has studied you and how you tick how to tempt you right so both of these have had long studies in you but you won't take the time to study it as much as Satan does you won't figure out you and your weaknesses and how Satan can get you how your mind works praise the Lord so he knows you this morning and he knows everything about you and he you can't hide that from him you think you're hiding it on your phone you think you're hiding it in private you think you're hiding it on your computer but I'm here to tell you you're not hiding anything from him he sees everything every detail of your life grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption Paul teaching that shows us that we as Holy Ghost Christians can grieve the Holy Spirit doesn't mean he doesn't love us doesn't mean he's giving up on us but he just he just just he's grieved by what you're looking at the reason you do it the reason I anybody would do it is because you feel like there's certain places rooms quietness dirty little secrets there's certain things that are not under the visibility of God and that such a lie he sees it all and he's and he he's already has a plan and a word in place for your life you going to keep going down that road you're my son I have a plan already for you you can buck up against it you can resist it but if you're a son you come hard you come easy I've said this for years if you're a son and daughter of God you either come hard or you come easy but you're coming because all the father hath given me will come what does that Force demanding no love unconditional love that's what it is so he knows every detail of your life maybe that'll help somebody live different this week in their privacy amen can't hide it from God he knows you inside it out and yet yet when he looks at our lives and sees our weaknesses and sees our mistakes he would give up except for he sees the whole thing which means he's seen a predestinated seat of God oh if we could all look at one another that way if we could all have that kind of divine looking but he sees and I'm so glad he seen me that way beauty is in the eyes of the beholder he sees me for who I really am so the Revelation that he knows us he knows us and yet he loves us yet there's something reaching out in his heart to to look at us with the whole picture of a predestinated son and daughter of God and so now there's the two knowings that a in a Christian Life is n number one and when the son of man was M man manifested this day showing he showed us he knows everything about us knows our house number knows where we live He Knows My Name he knows my every thought I have a maker can you say amen he knows my name he knows my heart he knows my every thought praise the lord it's not just a song friends it's a revelation thank you for watching our message today if
