========================================

what a nice time of fellowship sunday and we want to say thank you to sister sharon i don't know if she's the sharon's here yeah she's so tired she's sitting down right now she's she's still wore out but um let's give her hand what a wonderful job with the children on sunday just and all the staff she had a lot of helpers and different ones and sister tina and sister lindsay i think helped greatly and all the others and the children who did it it was just a superb presentation i wish it had been a lot more visitors from the community so we'll try to push that a little bit more next year but what a wonderful night we just had a great day together and tired and body but we were just revived to see what the lord did we appreciate that day and if you have a great day like that then it just helps you the rest of the week amen encourage you good to have you all out tonight uh we're reading from deuteronomy chapter 19 we'll read together certain scriptures and ask the lord to bless us in the word tonight when the lord thy god hath cut off the nations whose land the lord thy god giveth thee and thou succeedest them and dwell us in their cities and in their houses thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it thou shalt prepare thee away and divide the coast of thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee to inherit into three parts and that every slayer may flee thither and so now he's going to explain what he means by the slayer and this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither that he may live whosoever killeth his neighbor ignorantly whom he hated not in time past as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbor to he would and his hand stretcheth forth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the hell and lighteth upon his neighbor that he die he shall flee unto one of those cities and live so this is a category of someone who had an accident did it by accident and it was not intentionally done it was something was done and they were guilty but it was a bit a bit of different guilt because it wasn't an intentional thing it was an accident and god god thinks of everything can you say man god has already in his mind he he thinks through everything even for today he knew this day and he's already has his plan in your trial that you'll hit next week he's already got an answer for it so that's our god amen so so as when a man go through the wood then verse six it says lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer while his heart is hot and overtake him i'd say i say his heart is hot and his temper is a bit hot too as well and a bunch of other things and he overtake him because the way is long and slay him whereas he was not worthy of death in so much he hated him not in the past so here's a category that this person was not worthy of dying of this because his intent was not to do it it was an accident wherefore i command thee saying thou shalt separate three cities for thee look at this now and if the lord thy god enlarge thy coast as he has sworn unto thy fathers and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto the fathers if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them which i command thee this day to love the lord thy god and to walk ever in his ways then shout thou add three cities more for thee besides these grace grace here's a bounding grace you're walking with the lord and you're growing in him and you love him with all your heart make three more cities to run into when the devil's after you i love it that innocent blood be not shed in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and so blood the blood be upon thee but if any man hate his neighbor and lie and wait for him and rise up against him now here's a different category and smite him mortally that he die and fleeth into one of these cities then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood that he may die different category whole different category thine eyes shall not pity him but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from israel that it may go well with thee i want you to remember this statement here's the purpose i want you to put away the guilt of innocent blood the guilt of one who's truly guilty is one thing but i want you to put away the guilt of the innocent that's our god i i want to talk a little bit and teach a little bit tonight on god knows how to deal with guilt god knows how to deal with guilt heavenly father we ask you to help us strengthen us and we place our souls in your hands tonight bless every ear that's listening tonight what the spirit is saying to the church and we pray that you help us to yield ourself in such a way that lord you could bring us as our brother was speaking on sunday about the vision being a revelation and without a revelation without a vision that people perish give us a vision of your word tonight give us a revelation of your word we ask it in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated now i'm going to go back just a little bit and catch the end of a service that i was doing titled the difference between condemnation and conviction and we received a lot of good response from that service and so that was that's the difference we spoke on the difference between condemnation and conviction there's so much more to explore in this subject and also satan certainly does not like a minister dealing with these certain subjects as satan is a professional in using guilt and using condemnation to mess up people's minds especially a true believer satan is a professional i hate to compliment him but he's a professional in dwelling in the realm of guilt satan is professional in dwelling in the realm of confusing believers minds i said satan is a professional in dabbling in the subjects of guilt and condemnation and mixing it with conviction and you remember that's why i spoke about it is just to give a black eye to the enemy and and show the believer his position and to help in a healthy way separate these things so that we understand them the devil understands them but we must understand them we must understand in our battle every day the difference between condemnation and conviction we must understand that or the devil will wreak havoc with our minds and our and uh and our our condemnation and the different things we experience and the voices that speak to us so satan sure likes to mess up people's minds in these subjects especially the true believer and to where the mind and the spirit you know remember the mind and the spirit is all satan has left to work with in your body when you're born again and the soul is sealed in by god the mind and the spirit and your flesh is all he has left to deal with and so god's got the best part can you say man isn't it good to know god's got the the best part and god sealed himself and your soul you know if god was in in the flesh in the sense he was only in my flesh then that wouldn't be a victory but the victory is is that he's sealed in my soul the best part and from there there can be such a power to take over my spirit to take over my mind to take over my flesh can you imagine how supernaturally it is to happen that a human being can live so yielded to god and filled with the spirit that actually the holy ghost can bring a body that was never that will never inherit the kingdom of god never go in a rapture but it can soul control the body and the mind it'll bring this body under subjection to him human beings can live in victory with this body under subjection i'll tell you that's a supernatural miracle that's a great thing but god's got the best part and satan is left with the bodies our spirits our minds and so whatever he's left to work with he'll take that's if you let him take it can i get an amen it's what territory you let satan have that he'll take you could give your mind holy over to god and say i'm going to think on good things i'm going to think on positive things i just had a negative thought to me and so i'm going to change that right away by my own choice and i'm going to replace it with a good thought i just had something depress my spirit somebody said something or somebody didn't say anything but i feel depressed i know it's a depressing spirit that's come around me but by choice i'm not going to let that do it i'm going to go over there and put some music on and in a matter of a few minutes of holy ghost field music i'm going to draw myself out of that spirit of depression and i'm going to be rejoicing the lord because i have a choice of what i let satan get involved in and whatever you give him he'll take you can be in depression all day long all week long all christmas season long if you let satan control it or you could have a good christmas and happy and thankful praise the lord so i'm going to go back and read some things that i feel are worth repeating before i go into the subject of guilt a little bit i was going back in my notes and i read some things real quickly at the end because i didn't have much time left there's some good things here about conviction and i already talked about condemnation that's a final condemning there's no hope it's over and god doesn't dwell on that but he deals in conviction and you have to know the difference because somebody can begin convicted by god and say i'm feeling condemned i'm feeling you're not being condemned by god but conviction of god is different and you want conviction of god you want you want that in your life you would never want a life without conviction amen so you got to know the difference so some people said some good things they said different writers and i collected some of the things what gives us conviction uh of sin is not the number of sins we have committed it is the sight of the holiness of god martin jones said that and then it goes on to say here's another writer henry blackaby said when a holy god draws near in true in true revival people come under terrible conviction of sin the outstanding feature of a spiritual awakening has been the profound consciousness of the presence and the holiness of god you when you come into his presence of a holy god then all of a sudden your sin is exposed and that's a good thing that can bring a revival because what happens is people don't just get convicted they repent and when you start repenting remember what brother bannon said a revival was he said it's it's like a big ocean out there and he says when all the winds come in the ocean he says it washes up by the waves it washes up all the trash up on the shore and when you have a hallelujah time and wash all the trash out of your life on the shore then you can really have a rejoicing time a revival is happening in your life get rid of all the trash let it all wash to the side and then you feel a revival amen conviction is part of that another writer said conviction of sin is god's way i love these now conviction of sin is god's way of inviting you to restore fellowship with him because obviously you're away from him you're distant from him you feel convicted and you repent say god bring me back brings you back into restoration of relationship so conviction is a good thing that's not condemnation conviction is not repentance conviction leads to repentance but you can be convicted without repentance that's from martin jones another one from martin jones i think that's a good quote some other writers said conviction is more than the mere feeling and this is what i'll speak a little bit about tonight conviction is more than just the mere feeling of guilt for something we have done wrong it's normal to have to feel guilty after doing something that we know we shouldn't have done so so the tonight i'll talk a little bit about the feeling of guilt but we must distinguish the feeling of guilt over real guilt if we did something wrong and we're convicted of god there are good there's going to be guilt that goes with that but then satan dwells in the realm of a feeling of guilt and you not haven't necessarily did anything wrong but you got a feeling of guilt how many has ever met somebody in your life and they're professionals that making you feel guilty don't look at your husband or wife next to you please don't do that not in a service tell them when to get home but if it's not your husband or wife it's your children that make you they're they make you feel guilty all the time or it's the parents to the children making them feel guilt their kids they never measure up you always making them feel guilty always talking about what they do wrong and never what they do right but there are other people in our lives there was one fellow in my life years and years ago and he worked in the church here and he was very good his mom i better not be personal here he was very good at making you feel guilty and hit our personalities clashed a little bit but he could make me feel so bad and make me feel like i've done so many things wrong and then when i got away from him and i thought it through most of the stuff i hadn't even done but i felt like i but when he got done with me i feel like i had done it and that's a good lawyer in court you can be innocent but a good lawyer after he talks it's like i wonder if i did do it that's a good lawyer i'm starting to feel like i might i wasn't even there that night but maybe i was that's a good lawyer right there and i'll tell you satan is a professional lawyer against believers satan is your voice in your mind someday every day and he is a professional lawyer can make you feel guilty the feeling of guilt now i know i'm not talking to anybody here tonight none of you ever have the feeling of guilt that's only me i'm sure but anyway the feeling of guilt is not necessarily the conviction and the guilt that goes with conviction see why we got to talk about these things because you might be feeling might be from the enemy and not from god but you're just beating yourself all up and you're depressed and you're i wonder this and i wonder that in a wonder wonder wonder and you just become a wandering star because you're wondering all the time so we gotta really talk about these things so conviction is more than a mere feeling of guilt for something we've done wrong it's normal to feel guilty after doing something that we know we shouldn't have done conviction goes above and beyond having a feeling true conviction goes above and beyond having a feeling convict in the greek is translated into elencho which means to convince someone of the truth to reprove to accuse in other words it's there's truth to it a feeling most the time doesn't have truth to it but true conviction has a truth to it it's it's to convince someone of the truth so we see that conviction brings out the truth it accuses us of our wrongs and rebukes us of our sins as we have seen through the verses we have discussed conviction is good brokenness is good it always draws us closer to god if you find yourself in deep conviction for something don't ignore it young people can learn this early in life if you find yourself in deep conviction about something and it's coming from god don't ever ignore that go to your prayer closet get right with god today today is the day of your reconciliation don't wait two weeks don't wait two years don't wait 20 years when you feel the conviction repent before god and reconcile with god our lord wants to be with you he wants to manifest himself through you and he cannot do that if you're not right with him yes brokenness is painful but it's necessary and it's beautiful thank god for conviction how many would raise your hand say thank you lord for conviction thank you lord there is a clear difference between conviction and condemnation conviction comes from the lord and it leads to life and joy condemnation however comes from satan and it leads to despair conviction is intended to lead us to the lord but condemnation drives us away from the lord so listen if you're feeling i'm i'm getting out of here i'm going you know i'm i'm going to turn to things of the world i'm going to do this or whatever and because i'm just feeling condemned that is not god driving you away that's satan using it to drive you further away when conviction is involved god is doing it to draw you closer to him condemnation drives you away condemnation causes us to look at ourself conviction causes us to look to christ when someone is experiencing condemnation there's no solution to their problem you're just doomed you cross the line it's over you're done there's no hope for you some of satan's voices with condemnation there's no solution to the problem but we know with christ with everything there's a solution there's grace can you say amen there's an answer our bible says that with every temptation he will make a way of escape for you [Applause] every time and so when someone is experiencing condemnation there's no solution when we're experiencing conviction it's meant to draw us to him to receive his love his grace his forgiveness in conviction there is hope because on the cross jesus christ died for all of our sins when we look to the cross we find freedom and hope and john 12 47 says for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him there's always salvation through god's conviction but there's always uh damnation and condemnation with satan's condemnation a final a final word praise the lord you love him so i thought i wanted to go back and just ring those those are just ringing true with my heart for sure now if we just look at now we just want to go go into guilt a little bit tonight and just expose it guilt has the power to go beyond convicting the really truly guilty guilt can plague the innocent so we have to recognize when satan is using the thing of guilt and i don't even know necessarily what it is but we know it is something because we feel it and satan knows that feeling and satan with his voices gets in that feeling but the the thing that can be way too powerful and satan using it is the power of guilt can go beyond convicting the really guilty which it should but it also can plague the innocent so when you look closely at the dynamics of today what's going on with the believer now you can see why there is not more visible victories sometimes than believers just ahead lies a greater place of freedom just ahead lies a greater victory for them just ahead just through the soundberry just just across just a little remember i was speaking a few weeks ago about your potentials sometimes somebody's full potentials are laying right there and they're just a step away from it and satan's keeping them from greater potential satan's keeping you from a greater walk with the lord because you're held back right there it's just it's just stunted right there and there's a greater place of freedom but sometimes there's a cloud of guilt that lays over a believer sometimes we bring it on ourselves sometimes other people bring it bring it on us and there are ways that we bring guilt on ourselves and other people can bring us we you know sometimes and i'm just going to be real honest with you tonight sometimes we over examine ourselves because we want to please god so much out of his desire that he put within us so now here's just a real dividing line here we're supposed to examine ourselves because the bible says fourth corinthians let a man examine himself it's before the lord's supper but every day let a man examine himself so i'm not knocking that but be careful how you're examining yourself and how you're measuring yourself do it with the word of god but don't do it by other people's measuring stick and don't do it by your own measuring stick because those of you who are real extreme legalistic and or maybe ocd or whatever nature that you have that kind of especially you people you can set yourself in expectations that you'll probably never measure up to and when you don't measure up that week or that day then what do you get guilt just the thought just come to me that monday morning i woke up and sometimes i try to make out a list a lot of stuff i need to get done for the week this week's list because i had a week off last week this week's list was a whole page and a half a page on the other side and i looked at it today and i only scribbled off like three and i've been working hard all week so i got a whole list but i'm preaching this tonight and you know what i don't really care i'll get to it when i can because i'm preaching and i'm not going to bring more guilt on myself i'm just thankful i have a list i don't usually have a list and i'm trying to work on that i'm ju i think it's a great accomplishment and i can relieve myself of guilt tonight that i even made a list of stuff i'm supposed to do praise the lord brother josiah praise the lord thank you thank you yes if i can just do that it's half the battle but you know we got all this we got a couple we got this you people that are ocd you better be listening is that the bad part of it great be organized get it all done but when you don't and a lot of times you don't self-guilt guilt and you start measuring your character by it and then satan comes in and says what oh yeah i just feel like a loser this week and say it says yeah you feel like it but i really feel i know you are a loser you get all this stuff going on you're feeling guilt and he's he dwells in the realm of guilt so he jumps in and agrees with you yeah you you're really man who do you think you are you just can't ever measure up to stuff that you're supposed to get done guilt is a real thing that's in our lives that sometimes we bring on ourselves so i want to separate and say if god if you've done something wrong and god brings conviction about it make that right and bring it under the blood of jesus christ even god asking us to do that you know why it's to do it so that you don't live with days of guilt god does not want you living with any guilt so whether it's self-inflicted or whether it's someone else because we examine we over examine ourselves we have people around us who know us too well and put guilt on us we're afraid to not keep examining ourselves if we don't examine ourselves enough we get too confident i might get too confident it might get too arrogant so we just keep examining ourselves we shy clear of really enjoying our sinless place in christ lest we should get off track i said way shy clear of really enjoying our sinless place in christ because we're afraid that we might get off track i got a quote in a minute for you it's going to blow your mind you see so much guilt the devil uses that is not necessary there's a necessary guilt that comes with the conviction of sin but most of the other guilt is not necessary and even the true guilt and conviction is only temporary god wants you to be relieved of it when you truly sincerely bring it under the blood of jesus christ god forgive me i made a mistake i'm appealing to my great high priest who can be touched by the feeling of infirmities i'm leaving at your butt i mean it lord and i mean it so much help me never to do that again that's a repentant heart and then he washes it away and the bible says if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive our sins so that our guilt can be relieved can i get an amen from someone hallelujah so the bride in this hour can i let you know where the bride stands the bride in this last days received an announcement in the first person from god saying you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ you never sinned in the first place you are justified that means you have been declared righteous and you have been cleared in court as the brother priest said sunday you can't have it both ways you can't believe that christ became sin for us unless you believe that we become the righteousness of god that act at calvary did two things that's to take our sin but it's to make us the righteousness of god and you can't have one without the other the bride is the pure sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ you never sinned in the first place you're justified declared righteous and clear that means to be cleared in court that you are innocent you are a virgin you are in good standing with god it is an unchangeable verdict it can't be appealed can we give a handcuff of praise tonight can't be appealed [Applause] satan buffets satan yells he doesn't like the pronouncement he doesn't like what was said by the prophet unless that stays about the bride he doesn't like that at all but he can't appeal it he can't change it it has been declared can you say man the life in the blood of jesus christ who is the word has picked us up and placed us back into an innocent pure state in the eyes of god and i'm not talking about the person who's sitting next to you just them i'm talking about you tonight i'm talking about you that the blood of christ has placed us back into the innocent pure state that's the bright standing with god now that's what he said about you those listening on the internet that's what he said about you and i'd rather believe what he said about me in court than what i even believe about myself let's talk about your enemy each day who's this who is this creature who is this accuser of the brethren well he's a creature who's had a pronouncement on him too he has been exposed in the last days from the garden of eden actually before that with lucer he's been exposed from the very beginning before the beginning he's been exposed from the garden to the antichrist spirit at the end through the message of the hour he's been exposed from the garden to the antichrist spirit and everything in between the fivefold ministry today the true fivefold ministry not just any christian preacher we appreciate all of them but there is a fivefold ministry that are preaching the trail of the serpent the last 50 years until we have seen satan as the judged one as jesus said you can read it in your bible the prince of this world is judged jesus said it the prince of this world is judged there's been a pronouncement he is the god of this evil age and he's being exposed and by being exposed he is a creature who lives with guilt he's a creature that's under condemnation because he's been condemned he's a creature that never really even had a chance even though he wants one so bad he's a creature that wanted creative power like adam and eve had and he can never get it he's never had it and he will never have it can you say man he's a creature that's been condemned and lives under guilt no wonder he talks to believers every day and spills over his guilt over to you because he's a creature of guilt he's a creature of condemnation unless we give him power he has no power he sits in a corner some way all just shriveled up and down and can't have any release in the believer's life unless we give him room and then he steps up and starts to try to take over every time but when he's in his condition without any place or power he stands as a condemned convicted guilty creature judgment pronounced all the way back in the garden even on the serpent can you say amen so he being jealous of your innocence which you didn't even earn he's jealous of your innocence he's jealous of your freedom he's jealous that he can't be free like some of your sunday in the service was so free i mean when they sang that special the holy spirit came down and can you say man we had church just with the special [Music] and satan's in the wings saying i don't have that freedom and he's jealous of the people who do i'm preaching tonight whether i get amens or not i'm telling you i'm exposing this guy that talks to you every day is a guilty creature he's condemned his days are numbered and there isn't any reason to continue to listen to his voices [Applause] he's jealous of your innocence he's jealous of your freedom he seeks to transfer some of his guilt on you you ever meet someone who is guilty and they're trying to transfer some of that guilt on you because it makes them feel better that's right passing the guilt over blaming somebody else the blame game they're the victim they're under a lot of condemnation a lot of guilt a lot of things and they try to distribute it on to other people they're the reason that i'm doing wrong and they're the reason i'm not living right the church yeah they're those people at the church they're my problem and and you better be careful because you got to own up to where you're at satan's a creature that wants to transfer the guilt so all of this and i hope i've talked about it enough all of this in this atmosphere i think we can be affected by it to the place we carry too much guilt i said we carry way too much guilt i said you you carry way too much guilt on a daily basis we're actually probably carrying more guilt than what we should be and boy the psychological side of it which i'm not allowed to talk about that because people think i'm a psychologist but the psychological side is it has all kinds of spillover of fruit it can be different fruit in people's lives you know some people they just talk too much or some people don't talk at all and they clam up and there's a lot of different results that come from somebody who's really under complexes and under guilt and satan has beat them down so much and they don't realize god doesn't want them to live every day in a state of feeling guilty when we're under this friends and i just want to say that we carry way too much guilt and some of us dish out too much i'll take a drink of water on that one maybe we dish it out too much because we're under it it's not right to just keep making everybody else feel guilty it's not your job to make somebody feel guilty if god uses to speak somebody in christian love and brings godly conviction great but that's a different story than constantly putting guilt on people that they never measure up you'll never measure up you'll never be anything look at you failing again look at this you tell your children that you see how your children turn out maybe you're a person that got that from your parents and only the hope of the cross of christ and the believers and images in the body of christ can help build that back up where you get you find your identity in in the word and in christ but that affects the human spirit to be beat down all the time to be told you're a loser to be told you'll never be successful in life you'll never make it you'll never do all these things and guilt is passed on in other words it's dished out and when we're dishing it out or we're giving too much of it i ask you to examine your life tonight when we're carrying too much ourselves or we're dishing it out it's time to step back and say why do i need to carry any of this or dish this out why do i need to feel bad all the time why do i as a believer have to continue with all this guilt i'm living under a different covenant i'm living under a covenant that there's no guilt in that covenant my desire is resonating inside and it it's a it's resonating delighting in god i know my desires i delight in god can anybody say that here tonight because i think it would be good if you truly know that what resonates deep down in the regions of your soul is a a burning desire for more of god i ask you to raise your hand to the devil right now just say i know that that's resonating in my soul all right thank you praise the lord don't raise your hand unless you yeah and to you might need the holy ghost or you might need you might need something greater or greater feeling i don't know but god knows what you need but i'll tell you you need to tell the devil sometimes if you know that desire is resonating for more of him then you've got to tell them that's why i say raise your hand again some of you are too i'm surprised you don't have to participate i guess so i know that no matter what my mistakes are i know that i have a desire in here a burning desire for more of god amen so you can do it in church but when it's getting heated with the devil that's when you have to remind him wait a minute wait a minute god's looking at my desires here i brought that under the blood the other day satan my desire is burning can you say man my desire read it delights in god delights in the law of god it's not tainted it's pure and when my flesh gets out of the way my loving father is going to correct me so when i satan when i do make a mistake my loving father is going to correct me and bring him out back on track satan if you're telling me you're getting off track you're getting off track you're getting off track oh my i don't want to do that but i got a loving god that if i listen to him he's going to bring me back on track tell the devil this god he's going to bring me back on track [Applause] but you said something wrong the other day look at the thought that you did i know i did but i brought that under the blood i'm sorry for that and now my god's going to bring me back on track because that's my god i sir praise the lord amen supposed to stay behind the pulpit on wednesday nights i can't wake some of you up tonight i don't know what i'm going to do i'm a believer when i make a mistake i have a place to take that mistake are you thankful tonight you have a place to bring your mistakes [Applause] there's a lot of people that don't have that place they don't know about it i'm saying but you know and you have a place you have a scripture that says if you'll sincerely confess i'll be faithful to forgive you of that mistake i have a place to bring my mistakes hallelujah i have a place to come with my sin and my mistakes i don't know about others but he's given me a place to bring it i have a city of refuge it's in jesus christ he gave me a city of refuge to run into and i say to the elders i didn't mean to do that i'm so sorry for doing it there was nothing in my heart that i wanted to do that but i made a mistake and the elders say you can stay in this city of refuge and the enemy can't get to you hallelujah [Applause] amen i have a place to go with my mistakes but this feeling of guilty when i haven't done it nothing that's crazy i want to lay something in here there's two sides to this guilt in the webster's dictionary there's two sides to this one side of guilt one meaning of guilt is a remorseful awareness that you have done something wrong a remorseful awareness that you've done something wrong so we have that and i'll let you know this guilt a remorseful awareness that you've done something wrong was so deeply ingrained in us when we were born condemnation by representation before you did anything wrong you were born with condemnation so guilt came with our birth you start growing up and you you already feel there's a there's a cloud you're born with condemnation you're born with guilt by nature you're born with the guilt of sin by nature that serpent nature is tied to satan and his condemned defeated state has been on us since we are cursed because we come under the curse and that's where it all started satan felt like dirt and makes you feel like dirt because he was cast to the dirt maybe the reason you feel like dirt is because the one that was cursed to dirt is talking to you every day we're born with that by representation it's called the guilt of sin but i got to quote if you guys would bring it up the guilt of sin and we're guilty but calvary came through with not only an atonement but a release from the guilt of sin how many can say man that calvary came through not only with an atonement for our sin but a release from the guilt of sin can you say amen calvary not only paid for our sins but it released us from the guilt of sin that's what you see in this scripture that i read and which i won't have time to talk about now but you can see the type is that he says when you go into the promised land now remember they already had a sacrificial lamb they already applied the token in egypt they already had a lamb that was until they carried the lamb they brought the lamb for their sins so they had a lamb for their sin but that wasn't enough god says when you go into the promised land build three cities they're the cities of refuge because the lamb is taking care of your sin but if you feel guilt he's saying i'll take care of the guilt as well god does not only want to take care of your sin but he doesn't want you to live in guilt he wants you to run to the city of refuge every day i have a place i can run and live guilt-free you know for the last 30 years we have all this guilt-free food did you ever notice it was never called that to the last 30 years something like that and you know the bride comes into her guilt-free living and all the natural types of spirits so now we have all this guilt-free food why because all the stuff you ate before it brings guilt on you and now you can eat guilt-free ice cream which tastes terrible i'd rather wait a year and have a real ice cream thanks brother joe he agrees with me guilt-free this and guilt free that and guilt free this and i tell you god took care of not only our sins but he gave us a city of refuge every day that we can run into and be safe from the life of guilt oh i'm enjoying this tonight all right you got that quote up there sis listen to this this is so powerful just one quote tonight oh here it is hey how you doing now you you are a believer but god doesn't recognize your faith until he proves it to you amen oh brother let me tell you something when your faith it might be recognized in your own thoughts but when it sees you can in your own thoughts i'm saved and all that but when it comes into god's thoughts god seals that faith by the baptism of the holy ghost abraham believed god and it was imputed to him for righteousness and god give him the seal of circumcision as a sign that he had accepted him hallelujah and so god it's just once again this so just leave that up there if you would god is just sealing when you're using the word seal he's sealing this up it's no haphazard thing that you're gonna you're gonna get saved but you're gonna live with guilt the rest of your life no he seals it and he comes back and identifies by the circumstance of the holy ghost that evidence of the holy ghost in your life he seals this up brother brahm says it this way in one place he seals god in and he seals the devil out it's a seal it can't be changed it's pretty settled and uh the seal of the living god search the scriptures and the baptism the holy ghost upon the human heart ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed unto the day of your redemption the seal of god god's recognition as you as a believer seals you into the body by the baptism of the holy spirit then if you haven't been deceived to believe some theory some feeling some something or another which is all right i have nothing against it whatever god uh give it whatever way god give it to you that's god's business and yours you see but when a man is ever born of the spirit of god you'll find him just as boldly and humbly as he can be walk up to the throne of grace and know that he has a right to eat from the tree of life i like that boldly but humbly and he has a right with the baptism the holy ghost he walks up he's not afraid of the enemy he's not afraid of the indies condemnation can you say amen he says just as sure for something has happened to that individual that is experienced of him that he never found anywhere else in the world and every man or woman that's born of the spirit of god has an experience within themselves that they know directly when it happened how it happened and what kind of effect it had on them every man and woman that's ever been born in the spirit of god something happened just something changes it's what is it it's a conversion as we said this morning you got an o sheet there just as dirty as it can be full of ink and everything else nothing can take it away you dip it that down in the full box of clorox full a can full of clorox or a tub bring it back out it's just as white as it can be that's what the blood of jesus christ does to the believer that confesses his sin it is there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins when sinners plunged beneath the flood lose all their guilty stain then when god shakes the sheet and sees that it's dried out by the holy winds of god coming like a rushing mighty wind from heaven he takes the holy spirit seals that to the day of redemption like that then the devil looks upon that seal he can't come to it he can tease it and buzz at it and fuss at it but he can't get into it that's right he can't get it because there's a seal of god that forbids him hallelujah forbids him to touch it that's god's private property [Applause] yes sir that's what makes men walk boldly they're not scared of backsliding no sir they're not scared of what the devil says i want you to leave that last statement i want you to leave it up the rest of the service we're going to close in a minute this is what makes men walk boldly when they have this revelation they're not afraid of backsliding are you afraid of backsliding tonight are you scared of backsliding no sir they're not afraid of scared of sliding they're not scared of what the devil says i love that friends so this is the guilt i believe that the bride deals with because when we make a mistake we have a place to take it but when we have it and the devil or anyone makes us feel inadequate we're not to live in that defeated form i say this not only because god has a lamb in the old testament for sin but he also gave a city of refuge to run every time the hounds of hell was running after you to place guilt on you for something that you did even in innocence so i'm just gonna have to skip some of this now because we come to our time here god says i don't have to live in guilt and if he says that then i don't want to carry it and i don't want to dish it out the world is full of people trying to relieve their guilt of their sin and we have a place to bring ours the holy spirit conviction brings conviction you can repent of that but then the devil brings it over to a guilt trip in a judgment that something evil is inside your heart you can't let him do that can't let him do that can you say amen so others some other things in here on guilt maybe that i'll touch another time mary and martha were there and mary was sitting listening at the feet of jesus martha was a worker bee working for the master i find it interesting about martha that she was it's all wonderful that she was working so hard for the master but that wasn't good enough she had to try to make mary feel guilty she wasn't doing what she was doing anybody ever had any people like that in your life i've had way too many and i've probably been that to other people you're not doing enough you're not serving enough you're not you're not you're not punching out enough you're not carrying your your side of the deal and she's making her because the bible said she was encumbered which means she was driven about mentally to be over occupied to be too busy cumber means that to draw around to draw away to be driven mentally to be distracted in essence to be over occupied too busy about a certain thing but it wasn't good enough that she was too busy she made mary feel like she wasn't doing the right thing and jesus said mary has chosen jesus wasn't saying being lazy and don't work but he says at this point it was important for her to choose this and she chose the right thing if i don't get to all the sacrifices and i'll tell you i'm a lafontaine we dream and we're constantly thinking of stuff that we can do for the kingdom of god it's a part of our blood but if i don't get to all the sacrifices i can make for others but i made it a priority to sit at jesus feet when the time came jesus says there's no guilt about that you chose wisely our text says put away the guilt of innocent blood in these places to run these cities i tell you this is a god rich in mercy in god's heart was to provide a place of peace for the innocent so they can live without guilt and without the hounds of hell talking to them and running after them you did something wrong you did something wrong you did something wrong did something wrong you did something wrong there's something wrong and they can all day get something you did something you're guilty you're guilty you're guilty i find it interesting in that scripture it's about the heart because in that case they did something wrong but it wasn't the desire of their heart to do it so they came before the elder said i am so sorry i i did not mean to do that and god says i'm judging them from their heart put away the guilt of innocent blood do not apologize for it make it right but once you've done that put away the guilt put away the guilt don't let satan hound you with the guilt can you say amen let's stand together [Applause] live without the guilt god wants you to do that live without the condemnation god wants you to do that it's not god condemning you live in freedom live in victory if you've done something wrong to god or to someone else make it right god i'm sorry i bring that under the blood of the lamb you gave me a place to bring it and i'm bringing it there i'm not going to bring it to psychology or bring it to something or i'm not going to ask advice and google it i'm going to bring it to the cross i'd done wrong lord forgive me but look at the heart and look what god's saying is that even when you do something that his intentions was not to do that god says i'll forgive you of it but don't you dare let satan hound you with the guilt because in god's eyes you're innocent once it's confessed it's just the bleach just and you can't find a stain of it can't find a stain of it can't find a trace of that anywhere it's a white sheet that stands there is there between you and god and satan can't get it he can't penetrate it and all he can do is just buzz around it just hit it a little bit ruffle with it a little bit but he can't get past that white sheet he can't get past how god looks at you there's only one way god can look at you and that's through the blood of calvary there's only one there's no other way god can look at you is anybody listening tonight there's only one way that god can look at a believer and that's through his blood oh i remember a minister bringing up one time the three the three crosses there and one on the other side he's not being humble but this guy over here and they had been blooded and i don't know if they got a crown of thorns he did but they had blood all over them and this minister said it's so wonderful he says the first time he says this blood was around there was blood on all of them and this person's reaching out and says lord hadn't even been saved hadn't been baptized remember me when you come into your kingdom and he said the first time that jesus eyes look through the blood he looked at him and said today you will be with me in paradise [Applause] first time he looks through the blood and the man gets salvation in the kingdom of god [Applause] that's the power of when he's looking through the blood he only sees you one way i tell you this has been a good wednesday night service this is like a sunday on a wednesday power power [Applause] power power wonder working power in the blood of the land there is power power wonder working power in the precious blood of the lamb yes there is when i said there's is oh would you be free from your passion and pride there's power in the blood i know there's power in the blood [Applause] in the precious blood of the lamb one more verse would you be wider much wider than snow there's power in the blood i know there's power sin stains are lost in its life giving flow somebody shout hallelujah just now oh somebody give the devil a black eye i send this power is [Applause] glory be to god yes lord thank you father why don't you raise your hand before we go and say thank you lord for the power of your blood thank you that you give me a life without guilt lord i pray that every guilt feeling and everything would be washed in the blood of the lamb tonight someone just holding on to something from the past let them let it go i pray let him be free tonight i pray lord this is more than just a feeling this is more than just some sensation or some feeling that we get that's passing but lord this is a reality that we can anchor our souls on lord and that we have a city of refuge in christ to run into when satan's hounding us and we can run in and be safe we love you lord tonight we close the service but lord not from this atmosphere and presence let it be a part of our lives every day if the people heard nothing else let them hear that your heart said put away the guilt i don't want you living every day with any
