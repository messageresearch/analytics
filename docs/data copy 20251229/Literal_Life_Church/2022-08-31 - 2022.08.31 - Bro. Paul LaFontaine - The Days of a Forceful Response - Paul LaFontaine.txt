========================================

trust that the lord's blessing you you're following him along the way and we appreciate what he's done this week received a testimony i was trying to get it on my phone there but wonderful testimony yesterday and hopefully i can just read through some of it maybe sunday but god is doing some mighty things and even in some of the services we're talking about deliverance from certain particular things and sexual temptation and things like that and you know the devil is angry you know the devil's upset but when we talk about it according to the word of god and god's spirit is there there's going to be deliverance for those who are yielding to it and those who are listening with open heart those who are confessing amen we appreciate what he's doing matthew chapter 11 and verse 11 and then we'll go to luke 16 16. matthew 11 and verse 11. sure nice to see a nice turnout here tonight god bless you all those are listening online all over wherever our saints are god bless you each one at home there tonight verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he what a amazing scripture tonight to realize that when we take someone like john the baptist who had the spirit of elijah on him and such a powerful ministry to introduce the messiah coming the first time then we realized that he ends this verse by saying there's not risen greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than john the baptist so this we look at things in levels and certain positions and they the world teaches us we're in certain high positions low positions but in the kingdom of god the least the least one among in the kingdom of at least one that we would feel as the least and has no popularity has no position has every bit of the power of god available to them can you say amen and that's why you can see the least in the kingdom is greater than he god certainly puts his prophets in a place in a special place to speak through them but the prophets are not a special place where they get all of the power of god from calvary every believer gets that from the greatest to the least can you say man this is a scripture i wanted to uh preach a little bit on tonight and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence i quoted this a couple weeks ago can't remember all that i was preaching on but i know i was talking about the dimensions and how that the dimensions of demons the dimensions of the demon demonic forces increase more and i quoted this scripture and i have a few things to say tonight just relation to this scripture because the bible pinpoints the time of elijah who john the master had the spirit of elijah since he came and began speaking from that time the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence from the demonic realm so something triggers all that demonic realm and i was talking about uh you know just the dimension of health spilling over into our dimension and those things and this this gives the trigger for it where it becomes worse and that is when john the baptist came and began to speak with the spirit of elijah the kingdom of heaven suffered a violent attack from the demonic realm which should hold that thought tonight and then here i wanted to add this one in luke 16 and verse 16. if you wouldn't mind luke 16 16. it says here the law and the prophets were until john since that time the kingdom of heaven is preached and every man presseth into it so here's another pinpointing time to from the prophet john with the spirit of elijah and when you hit that point because of the increase in the demonic realm from that point of elijah speaking then we realize that i'll just word it the way they say it here the king he says it here the kingdom of god is preached and every man does what if you want to get a hold of it you got to press into it every man press it into it amen heavenly father bless us tonight in the word of god it's nice to see those who have come and gathered and those are gathering in their homes lord from far distances lord we just pray that they would be praying and lord their hearts will be opened to the word of god tonight we want to thank you for the testimonies of what's coming in lord from the camp and lord just powerful things lord and change has taken place and even this week hearing the great testimonies and lord we know that the world will not hear these things but nevertheless though these testimonies the scripture says they overcame by the word of god by the testimony lord when they proclaim that then we realize satan's kingdom is is damaged father because we know your power is getting through to the people we pray you'll bless tonight bless our hearts take our tiredness away lord as we give focus on the word of god tonight we pray in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated tonight i want to finish that scripture in matthew i'll finish the rest of it it says from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and i didn't finish it and the violent take it by force so i want to look at that a little bit tonight and i think it's interesting to realize that this is referring to john the baptist as being uh uh when he spoke his word for the for the messiah to come there was a turning point in the the pressures and a turning point in the demonic realm to begin coming against the kingdom of god more than it was before elijah spoke and i want to just emphasize that to you the the scripture pinpoints a time that when elijah speaks something and he and that word goes into the land that that from that point there is a there's an anger there's a there's a stirring up of the demonic realm there's a change that the demonic realm was always there and it's always come against the word of god it's always thwarted the people god trying to hinder the people of god but there's something increased after elijah's word goes out into the land and so there's something very significant something very special about elijah's word how many can raise your hand and say tonight i know we're living in the same time because elijah's word has went into the land so this is very important to us now because we realize through the bible god trusted that word trusted that spirit so much that it would deliver his word that god used it five times god is going to use it one more time he's used it for three times before used it in the end time and now he uses it you're going to use it to the jews and it's because there's something very special there's something about elijah's word that has power in it that when it goes forth once that word is spoken and it is sent out then it's in the land and one of the things that devil don't like about it as he's watched this pattern of elijah when he speaks something god's word doesn't return void and elijah's word had such a power of god behind it that satan has learned once elijah says it and it's in the land elijah can even die but the word is there and the word will not return void in other words elijah can die but the word is going to accomplish everything that elijah said and now we have a history to watch because every time that spirit was on a man everything that it said ended up coming to pass so there's something about it and maybe that's why the demonic realm gets so tense and increases its pressure against the people of god it's not just because of you satan doesn't satan doesn't come against you because he doesn't like your personality or your looks or some personal thing or it has nothing to do with that it's the word that you received you are becoming that word and satan knows if that word is in the land and you're becoming that word he's learned through history there's not anything he can do to stop it he still tries for some reason i don't know the devil's really a dummy isn't he he hasn't learned his lesson after all these years he's really stupid he he just he hasn't learned his life he keeps coming against the the people of god who surrender to the word that's spoken that word becomes power in their life because brother brahma says we become the word as we let the word go through us can you say praise the lord how many want to become the word tonight the bride becomes the word as she lets the word go through them she receives it and she becomes it not by some standard that she has to do herself or not by whipping herself into shape she's just letting the word go through her and that word is so powerful that you become the word as you feed on the word as you let the word go through you and you have a choice in that you could stay away from the word you can stay away from church you can stay away from elijah's message you you got your choice but the people on the face of the earth who are letting that word go through them and trying that's why brother brown says at least you're trying you have to try some people don't try but people are saying i may have mistakes i may stumble and fall but this word is important to me i'm going to keep listening to it i'm going to be obeying it can you say man and when god corrects me i'm going to do everything to go back even when i fall i'm going to go back to him again there's something about when we try and keep trying and let this word go through us then we become the word i want to become the word and it's just simply when we let the word go through us now elijah's word was so powerful that when it's in the land it affected the whole land his word went out elijah could go off the scene and it's still his word is still laying there ready to be fulfilled now if you go back in your bibles to the days of elijah when elijah spoke something the first elijah when he spoke something he said it's not even not even dew will fall there's no rain until i call for it okay now he might have spoken that in a little hut beside a tree i'd have to go back and read to remind myself where he spoke it he might have spoken at just a few people but it affected the entire land this one man who's elijah he's a nobody elijah is a tishbite tishbite who's a dish bite never heard of this guy where did he come from but guess what his word was so powerful it stopped rain in the whole land you can't mess with god's word you can't mess with god's messengers and when he spoke that rain no rain all of a sudden everything stopped up a famine in the entire land people wonder sometimes what's going on in our world and so they read commentators they read the book of revelations they're reading this i'm trying to figure out prophecy i'm trying to figure out what's going on i can tell you safely tonight there's a lot going on in the world because elijah's word is already in the land and it's being fulfilled what he spoke in the last days 50 60 years ago is an echo of his word for this last generation and a lot of the thing the famine for the hearing of the word a lot of the the tear down of america a lot of the the things we've been talking about sunday about the homosexual spirit and america falling away from truth and all these other things it's all it began to unravel when god gave mercy through his prophet and when there's when they reject his mercy then judgment follows we're living in an atmosphere and a lot of the trouble has come because elijah's word is in the land somebody say praise the lord you can look in the news all you want to but i can tell you everything's happening according to the word of god affected everybody and the no rain affected everybody and then elijah called for rain again and then he had the showdown boy i could go into elijah's life but i just want to make one point when he began to speak it affected everybody and guess what it made the jezebels mad i don't know what kind of woman she was before but when elijah spoke is when she become angry and the demons increased i don't know she might have been a nice person i don't know before that but it was elijah's word that triggered this vicious anger i'm gonna kill the man i'm going after him and actually elijah he just kind of went and hid a bit you know and uh but but that's what triggered is this anger that's coming up what's why why would the world council of churches and the union begin to start and begin to form a union of churches in christianity against the bride of jesus christ it's the jezebel spirit it becomes angry at the word of elijah is anybody with me here tonight there's a jezebel spirit it's in the book of revelations and it increases in anger i'm going to come against i'm going to kill this message i'm gonna destroy the influence of this message i'm gonna come against it what is it it's all satan and his demons who can't stand the word of elijah and he's coming against it if you believe it you're a target if you believe this message you're a target of the enemy you say well i don't i'm not living where i should be completely but i believe with all my heart i believe god's going to deliver me i believe i'm going to be a full matured adopted son of god i'm going to keep seeking the holy ghost i'm going to keep seeking him when you confess that you become satan's greatest target not because of you but because the word of elijah and the word of god you've taken it into your bosom i'm resting in his word you become a target a lot uh jezebel gets mad and so there's an increase in anger there's an increase in demons i've been talking about just the increase of uh homosexuality the increase in the last 50 years everything's increased anger has increased in the political world anger is increased in the person in the car next to you road rage has increased people giving you the finger people pulling out guns and shooting somebody because they went in front of them with their car chasing people anger has increased it's because the word of elijah is in the land now and judgment is in the land and demons increase their violent attack against the kingdom how many believe that we're in the kingdom tonight we're in the kingdom of god we believe the kingdom of god i don't care what you feel about yourself we believe the kingdom we're in the kingdom and there's a violent an increased violent attack against the kingdom of god and the people because jesus said he said don't look for it somewhere else the kingdom of god is within you where's the kingdom it's not out here in the air it's in the people i'm preaching to you tonight his kingdom is within you and there's a violent attack against you because you hold the kingdom there's a when when john the baptist spoke he said elijah spoke as soon as that happened there was a triggering of all the demonic realm and since then it's increased look at where we're at now 50 60 years past elijah speaking again in this generation and look how the demonic realm has increased plaguing people's minds placing not just sicknesses plaguing mind sickness of the mind why is it it's the enemy increasing his demonic forces against the elect now speaking the truth friends can you say amen but one of the reasons it increases is because elijah in his word once it goes in the land he knows he can't stop elijah's word from coming to pass and he knows it's going to come to pass you know why i think you know we got a scripture here that says since since the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffered violence i believe when you've had elijah's word in the land and you've had the people of god it's kind of like elijah and elisha because elisha was a type of the bride he said a double let a double portion of thy spirit come on me that's the type of the bride so when elijah comes then he goes off the scene god didn't go off the scene a double portion comes on the bride of jesus christ so you tell me is satan going to decrease when it comes in the bride no it's actually going to increase more because now we have this word not coming from one man in his voice in his mouth and a tape or a book now we have it for 50 60 years now the bride feeding on it and where's it going not in their head but in their soul no wonder the devil is fighting us so much no wonder the demonic realm has increased against your family now he's not just dealing with one man he's dealing with a mini-membered bride who for 50 years now is letting this word that has power in it go through them oh the devil don't like what i'm preaching tonight you think it's going to decrease when the bride gets it no now he's got i always like to say this you know he had 120 that come out of the upper room and uh satan was going you know what am i going to do with these because i had one to deal with in jesus and now i got 120 to deal with and then thousands of souls were saved and and this was multiplying by the hour and satan's going i had one to deal with i thought i put him in the ground he must be alive because the same spirit's in these people it's because when you plant that seed in the ground a crop is going to come up it was just a few days instead of one jesus to deal with instead of one jesus to deal with he had 120 jesus to deal with and within days he had thousands of jesus to deal with they took note they had been with jesus the world says these people they're like jesus we're going to start calling them christians which means partisans of christ followers of christ but it wasn't just they were followers of christ they could see the same works the same raising the dead the same walking in the shadow peter come in they come in the shadow of peter and someone come back out as a leper miracles took place where's jesus at now satan's having to deal with all kinds of i believe that demonic forces increase in a violent way against the kingdom when this bride gets a hold of the word powerful the power of elijah's word but the power of it being in a mini-member bride and satan doesn't like it because he's never been able to stop it i got an interesting scripture here second kings you can just second kings 10 and verse 8 and this after the days of the original elijah this is way after gone on now and he how many knows elijah spoke he spoke doom for the house of ahab all right he spoke doom for the house ahab and they pronounced judgment they tried every way ahab and his sons lived for a certain amount of time even going way past elijah's ministry okay but guess what elijah spoke his word that's right okay so there's this war going to take place and this king asked certain was to do things come come down the line to verse 7 and said all the 70 of ahab's sons were killed and they're going what's what's going on and one fellow pipes up and says there's came a messenger totem saying they have brought the heads of the king's sons ahab's sons and he said lay them in two heaps at the entering of the gate until morning next verse and it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood and said to all the people ye be righteous behold i conspired against my master and slew him but who who slew these seventy of ahab's son who did this i did so they who do this know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the lord which the lord spake concerning the house of ahab for the lord hath done that which he spake by his servant elijah even this guy says now i know why it happened because not one word of elijah will fall you might have to wait 50 years to see it fulfilled but not one word of elijah will fail and he had to acknowledge it he had to say why is this happening i killed one and now all of a sudden all these how did these get killed oh it's the word of elijah go back and read the spoken word book that's right go back and read the spoken word book elijah pronounced judgment on the whole house of ahab now we know why they're killed because not one word of elijah will fall short it'll happen it's happening now we're living in a world that elijah's word is being fulfilled can you say man god so trusted it god so used it and so let's just take a couple minutes and ponder this now let's ponder this this triggering point of as soon as elijah as soon as john the baptist as soon as his ministry went forth from that time from that time the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force i'm hoping just bring you a short message tonight and call this the days of a forceful response now i've mentioned a few things the last few sundays and and i humbly say them i don't say them to make anything better than anybody else but a lot of times people don't talk about convictions and principles when it comes to sexual temptation and we've been talking about those things a lot of people don't talk about them but i've tried to make the point that when you're living here in satan's eden and you're living in the manifestation of sodom and gomorrh the complete manifestation of it and you're raising children or you're a young person okay just think about it now if you know it's in the last thrust of satan with demonic power of sexual temptation nakedness homosexuality pornography all these things easily available then how should we be responding to that kind of onslaught of the enemy i tell you it'll take more than just laying back and saying i'm the bride of jesus christ praise god i go to church on sunday morning glory be to god i'm just going to live my life no i think if satan's kingdom increases a violent against us that's the days of a forceful response back from the people of god and that's what i said that's why i've said that people criticize a bit sometimes that we're too strict our church is too strict about courtship about dating we got all these guidelines and oh every time i turn around there's another rule i just ask you a question i don't want to become a legalist but how legal how how strong can you be to speak about these things to give our young people some boundaries why would we have loose boundaries in a day that's increased in sex such lustful sexual uh perversion can you say amen why am i being criticized for being too strict can we be too strict that's right and you'd have to say amen to that but can we be can we be to the place that we gotta we shut our mouths and just let them do and let them all work it out i'm sorry my friend i love them too much in this age and i know demons too much i'm gonna give them the word of god and practical things to live by so they can overcome in this age now if i was back in luther's day if i wasn't in the full manifestation of sodom and gomorrah then i may not preach on those things i might not give specific boundaries as far as a guy and girl and dating all that i may not talk about it but in this age under these modern conditions we got to talk about it according to the word of god because when the kingdom of heaven is suffering a violent attack the violent take it by force i got to get the kingdom i got to get a hold of it i got to give it to the young people and and as he said since that time the kingdom of heaven has preached and and those people press into it what's the other scripture he said the law and prophets were until and since that time the kingdom of heaven has preached and every man must press into it you're not going to get it by just a lazy you know lackadaisical kind of yeah okay i heard that before yeah no every man has to press into the kingdom of god it's a forceful response to the enemy it's it's satan it's it's a confession it's a forceful confession back he's talking to your mind and talking to your heart and beating you down there has to be a response to that devil speaking to you there has to be a forceful responsibility well i i just feel weak and i'll let the preachers do that i need to you know i'll tell you you can get enough strength that if you're not around a camp meeting you're not around a prayer line you don't have to wait till next year to the prayer line you get enough faith in your heart you can start confessing satan satan get out of here that's the kind of body of christ we need that every day we're given a forceful response an aggressive response to this enemy not a lazy response a four you know and there there's situations that come up sometimes that uh make us that should make us angry with the holy uh indignation towards the enemy not towards one another but towards the devil you know uh they press us into it right after the night that brother brandon preached in the morning the token he preached that night in desperation and i believe they're linked together here's the token here's the holy ghost the kingdom of god comes to us the token returns in the evening time how many god god brought the token in the evening time token was applied in the evening time creeds and dogmas had taken the spirit away from us but now in the time he's restored the spirit that the people can get the true holy ghost again but he preaches desperation because jacob when he had to get ahold of the he had to get a hold of something he had to wrestle with the angel you say oh lord the holy ghost is here just give it to me give it to me it's pressing into it by faith it's saying lord this was for me i want it i'll die my bones will be here until i get the real thing it needs an aggressive response to this enemy how many believe the enemy is aggressive he's relentless towards you he doesn't care about you he wants to take your family he wants to take your finances he wants to take everything precious to you and when he gets that aggressive it's time for us to be aggressive like i was this past week when the devil was trying to do something in my family and i said you can cry and i cried and i prayed but after a while you get angry at the devil and what he's doing and you start standing flat-footed and say no this is my family in the name of the lord jesus christ i claim satan you're not taking them this is the days of a forceful response it requires a forceful response not a lazy well i'm a believer and i've been to all the conventions no we got to stand in faith against this enemy he's relentless he's got a violent attack against this message and against us and so we have to hate to say it be a little bit violent back it's what the word said didn't he say it and the violent take the kingdom by force hallelujah a heart that's desperate will get the holy ghost can you say amen it's desperation like jacob said i'm not letting go of you angel i'm not letting go until you give me the blessing he wasn't sitting there saying i i'll see you in church next sunday see if we can get hopefully something will happen to me now he said i i got you in my tent tonight and he grabbed the hold of his thigh and he he wrestled with them and he said and the angel is trying to get out of there and he said no i'm not letting you go angel gets a bit irritated and he i said i'm he said i'm not gonna let you go i'm gripping onto this it was a battle it was a fight i'm holding on i'll tell you friends today when the presence of the lord comes in your home or comes in the church or comes in your car you ought to just pull over and say god i'm going to enjoy this presence we don't feel it that often i'm going to get a hold of it while i can get a hold of it the spirit of the lord is lifting from this earth and i'll tell you when we feel it and when it's doing things we ought to jump right in and say satan you're defeated in jesus name enjoy the presence of god take a hold of the presence of god say lord i'm glad to be in here tonight i'm glad to be feeling your presence god is good can you say amen praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah so now other things can be let me just move along here so that you know when we see these promises of god i just got mad at what the devil was doing i hated what the devil was doing and i cried out for god for a miracle for a defeat of satan and i tell you it's wonderful when he comes on the scene and he does it that's right but we have to it's sometimes sometimes we don't get fed up enough with the enemy and when we're not fed up with him we don't rise with a forceful response and he just walks over you every day because we're not fed up with them we're not angry enough about it don't get angry at people don't get angry at one another don't get angry at your husband get angry at the devil i give you permission you know us preachers we preach be nice to people be kind bring your anger to the lord don't let the sun go down on your wrath don't get angry and all and anger is bad except for i'm giving permission tonight get angry at the devil all you want to because some of you need to be angry at the devil you're not mad enough you're not angry enough so he's walking all over you sometimes because you're not mad enough at him trying to take your family time to take your marriage trying to take your joy you don't get mad enough about it you get angry about it can you say amen i be the times that we live in friends i wonder if we should stay mad at our enemy we preach against anger stay sweet stay loving but i wonder if that crosses over and how we treat our enemy who keeps robbing us and taking us things from us we get too lovey-dovey and accept things for life just i just accept it that we really things that we don't have to really accept can you say amen some problems we do as we spoke on sunday some problems we do and we we thank god for his grace but there are other things that we just say no i'm not going to let the devil walk all over me push him back get back stay back trying to get my granddaughter's attention because that's what she always says stay back ellie stay back stay back that's what we tell the devil stay back don't tell your parents that stay back devil stay back satan stay back bad thought comes to your mind stay back i'm a child of god you don't belong in my mind you don't belong in my heart you don't belong in my house you don't belong in my car can you say man nobody gave you permission to come around stay back stay back now i got her attention praise the lord you love the lord tonight and sometimes we just don't get fed up enough with the devil you know and uh we get angry at others people get angry at other people pretty easy but they're not angry at the devil people get easily angry at other people anger at their spouse there was a couple that that were working with financial counseling many years ago and the financial counselor showed them all the stuff they needed to do to get out of debt i think it was the dave ramsey program that he put him on it's a great program to get out of debt we might run some of those videos here maybe again this winter on another night those who want to look at it it's a it's a good thing and it has scriptural principles to it to help you get out of debt and uh so they were instructed but at the end of the counseling he he said this thing he says now the instruction was you'll never get out of this even with all the instructions you'll never get out of this unless you get mad at your debt unless you're really angry about being in the ditch and being in the hole that you're in financially you'll never get out you have to be fed up with yourself you have to be fed up with the condition you have to be fed up because debt is a load on you that's terrible debt is a bad thing but to get out it's more than just just taking a seminar it's more than psychology you have to be mad at the condition you're in and this counselor every time they met together he would say are you still angry are you still mad because if they lost their madness and their anger against the condition they were in they would never get out so part of his counseling i've never done this but it's i love it and i think i'll incorporate it in all my counseling and they come in the office are you i'm just gonna all right first of all are you angry at the devil that's beating you up are you angry what the devil's doing in your life and in your family's life because if you're not angry and you don't have the grit and the faith to get out you may not get out we've got the word it has power we got the support from the body of christ we've got the principles we've got the boundaries we've got we've got materials we've got scriptures we can hand it all to you but there has to be a faith to say i don't want to stay where i'm at i want to get victory over the enemy and i heard brother timothy preach that the last service i love it when they end the camp because it's not just getting a victory at camp it's what you're going to do to get victories at home can you say man it's about the victories every day and you have to be mad at the enemy when he's trying to take you over you have to be angry at your debt as he told the counselor told him but you have to be get angry in it can you say amen you have to get upset and i wonder if god desires us to just quit living on surges just surges of confidence every now and then and live in confidence all the time live standing against the enemy all the time god help us to grow that we stand every monday morning every tuesday morning i'm standing angry against the enemy and i'm standing with the word of god today i don't take vacations from this as i told you in a few services satan's not taking vacations from badgering you you don't take vacation the demonic realm doesn't it's actually it's alive more at night the prophet taught us that uh creatures of the night come out at night demons come out at night that's why depression gets worse at night it becomes dark so that lets us know the demonic realm does not go to sleep because it gets tired we do but the demonic round doesn't take a vacation doesn't take a rest it actually increases at night you better put on some good music you better pray you better not forget family altar with your family what if the devil comes with all those bad dreams and everything inflicting your children and all that what do you do you apply the token to the home say we're gonna pray together even if it's a prayer you got two year olds five year olds whatever the tensions man you can't read the whole seal book all night no you can't do that but listen we're gathering together here and the devil's gonna know and god's gonna know that we're binding together because whatsoever we bind on earth is bound in heaven everybody remember the commission to the church he said to the church whatever you bind on earth will be bind in heaven satan i bind any spirit that would try to bring my children bad dreams i bind any spirit that's trying to bring a bad spirit in my home he stops at the door here i apply the blood of jesus christ over this whole household tonight you see what i'm saying it's not a lazy response it's a forceful response i mean business with this devil if he's going to violently attack this kingdom i'm going to violently respond to him say well it's just not my nature to be that bold and everything i'm quieter nature it's all right i'm not i'm not trying to change your nature i'm just saying you have the same nature of god that i have and brother ram says faith has hairs on its chest so if you've got faith it has hairs on its chest it's bold your faith and god needs to be bold and that's not because you're a shy personality no no it's bold to say the quietest mouse christian can get hairs on its chest and faith and say satan depart in jesus name amen you see what we wait for everybody else to do it for us we wait to come to be prayed for which is fine we wait for the next camp meeting but in this hour you're going to have to be bold to reach in force for your victories sometimes when you're by yourself hallelujah praise the lord i remember when my daughter amariah stopped breathing she was only a few weeks old and i was upstairs because my wife was she was sick in the hospital salmonella and mri got salmonella she's only just a few weeks old and she's just she they brought her to the emergency room she was downstairs that flower right here she was downstairs at flower hospital and mri was in the emergency room laying there just just a preemie just a small little thing laying on that table and uh my mother-in-law had come in to help take care of her while becca was in the hospital i was upstairs seeing so i just slipped off upstairs i actually went in the bathroom upstairs and i just began to cry out to god because i felt that very spot that brother branham was in that i could lose both of them because my wife was was dying and then now it struck my she wasn't even strong enough to to come against us as little as she was this disease in her body and i just cried i said lord if you take him then i pray you'll give me the strength that you gave your prophet to lose his baby and lose his wife all the same time and i just cried out to god and then i went in to see my wife but my mother-in-law's testimony is that she watched and mariah stopped breathing there on the table she just stopped taking breaths and she rose up and she says satan i rebuke you in jesus name watch tamari take took a big breath like that [Applause] sometimes you get mad it's not a problem with that rise to the occasion the amari is here tonight by the grace of god serving the lord amen god's spirit of life [Applause] god spared her life for a purpose and you see but you see mama mama got a little upset at the devil at that point just a tad glory be to god i love him so much our god is real friends our god is real but we need a forceful response to the enemy sometimes a forceful response to the enemy and what he's doing amen so now from the time that john began to speak the word went into the land let me just skip some of this and bring it to a close praise the lord i just want to say that i believe that it was easier to get the full ceiling of the holy ghost back in many years before this age why is it harder today because there's so many distractions to it and people won't be desperate enough for it there's so many replacements for the holy ghost so many distractions to the young people so they have to press in to get it they have to be serious to get it can you say amen now god as some minister said god's not just standing back holding things back and teasing you or playing with it no god's more willing for you to have it than you are even desiring it so it's not god doing i'm talking about the age that we live in the spirits that everything is against you pressing on to more of god that he wants to keep you from doing that if you need the holy ghost if you need more joy if you need more love in your life if you need what calvary bought you're not going to get it easy can you say amen as i've said before my love of god comes easy in other words it's natural god put this love in me but if i want to stay in revival that's not easy in the time we live in because we live in a lukewarm age and because we live in lukewarmness it's always trying to take us over and so we fight against the lukewarmness my love comes natural for god but my revival i got to fight for it every day no i'm staying in revival get out of here satan i'm putting on some good holy ghost music in this house putting on some good holy ghost music in this car and when you get now for you're going to have some of the best holy ghost field music you had in a long time i'm enjoying listening to it and getting all the corrections made i can't wait to get it out because i'll tell you there's some anointed music that you're going to enjoy in your homes and your cars and your earbuds or whatever praise the lord your beats gideon wants some new beats for his birthday so i'm going to buy him a can of beets that's what i'm going to do that's the only beats i know of yeah i'd rather pass those out than the headphones any day i believe it's it's it's it was easier to get the full ceiling of the holy ghost many years ago today you got to really press in to get something from god you got to press in with prayer that's why we're praying every morning 7 30 every thursday morning together we're praying we're gathering in our homes anybody wants to come to church we're gathering because you have to what we're fighting against is not just a casual thing it's a violent attack so we're going to say satan we stand the blood of jesus christ stands against you we stand with it praise the lord the same it was easier luther's day see you could be burned at the stake back in those days this but the same relentless devil today that would burn the believers at the stake that was a pressure that was a pressure they went under but the same relentless devil has become high tech he would rather get you to stay home and just watch tv shows or something now luther never had to preach about that it was elijah this hour that says you stay home wednesday night and watch i love lucy luther never had to say that it's this age of lukewarmness it says we would choose to do something like that rather than listen the word of god so elijah had to say it why because we're in an all-out attack against the lukewarm spirit when the prophet of malachi 4 released to us the full restored word in the last days the kingdom begins suffering violent demons thus it would no longer be easy to get things from god that are truly ours we would have to press in to get it can you say amen and as i close this tonight i want to read a quote you guys don't have it up there but i'm going to read it there's one man in the bible that we can use in his example and you know who he is shamgar he got mad he lived in the time of judges and that was in the day after the great leader joshua came and then the days of judges and they had a huge revival under joshua and so then as time went on the people get a begin to get lacks the people in the days of judges they they begin to the revival spirits begin to go away and so then when they were not standing like they should the enemy started to come in and take things away take their fields take their crops take all their goods sometimes take their wives take their children and it wasn't like joshua's day when they were rushing towards the enemy now they got lacks a days ago now they they kind of lost the spirit of revival and they quit fighting back and when you quit fighting back satan just takes all he can take and in the days of judges that's what it says and remember all the judges all the judges if you read all of them deborah there was even a woman they weren't a prophet they were people that rised up uh samson and shamgar and and and deborah and these different ones it wasn't prophets or great people it was just believers actually the days of judges there was a few believers that got tired of the enemy and they rose up in the streak of god sometimes by themselves and said i'm tired of this the type of the bride because we won't have a national revival but we'll have individual revivals when somebody rises up in that sick bed or that little sick baby in that bedroom some mother rises up and says satan i rebuke you in the name of the lord jesus christ you're not going to take my child he said i think of old sham guard during the time of the judges over here in israel why he was over there and every man done right in his own eyes that's what it says about the days of judges that's how they got away from god everybody done what was right in their own eyes they got away from the prophet got away from joshua and every man did what was right in his own eyes i tell you what you do that we're in trouble and the philistines would come up and take all they had and go back with it israel would raise their crops and put it in the barn the philistines would walk right up and that's just like the devil to rob you of everything some of you pastors get your little church built up just about you where you think it's right and some old devil will come in there and say why there's no such thing there as the old holy ghost religion i don't even believe in that such that such a thing brother what i mean what i mean to tell you if you don't believe in getting angry then let your righteous ignition rise up that's right call black black and white white i see old shamgar standing there and he not very much was wrote about him in the bible but what was road is enough he was standing out there had his barns all fixed up and everything was going fine and he was standing there looking and thought well now maybe every year them philistines has come maybe they won't come this year and i see my family is all starving and they look so poor and thin and while he was standing there he heard a noise he raised up the window of his house and he looked down the road and here come those 600 armed philistines again they've been coming every year stealing the crop everything out of their barn doing all this stuff tramping down their land and here they come again he looks out the window here they come me he said here they are at trump he said with their spears and army the big old heavy feet there with armor on trump trump trump trump trained men warriors from birth spears in their hand swords hanging on their sides 600 coming up shangar you had a nice crop this year we're glad you worked for us here they come up like that that's the way the devil does take everything you've got if you can that's him and shamgar looked at him and thought oh here it goes again he stood there and he thought well look down at this his poor little old wife little sunken face maybe in his little children they were hungry their little sleeves were ragged their clothes were gone his poor wife was starved to death what will the winter be this winter without their crop what's got the winter going to be like every year the devil came and stole it from them now year after year they've come and here they come again we've just about starved last year now they'll take what i've got now what will we do just what the gleanings i have out here in the field he stood there and he thought here here he come closer and closer trump trump here's the enemy coming closer closer closer the philistines coming and after a while see you don't believe in getting angry then let the righteous ignition rise and he began to feel it coming up on him shamgar began to feel it coming up on him and he said here i'm a jew i'm circumcised i've got a right for this long this land belongs to us and i tell you he wasn't a warrior he couldn't wait till he learned how to fight he was a farmer he wasn't a fighter but he knowed that the promise of god was with him and he was circumcised and if every man here tonight would realize that the things that the divine health and everything else god gave it to you at calvary every born-again man is circumcised by the holy ghost you have a right to every redemptive blessing let not the devil rob you from it anymore set grit to rise up that's that grit that just arrives that force rises and now wait a minute satan amen wait a minute i'm a circumcised holy ghost-filled believer and everything calvary bought for me belongs to me you're not going to rob me of any of it your brothers you think of changar's position and you think of you you receive inspira i pray you'll receive inspiration because it's the fathers and the heads of the homes and the men that really catch need to catch this more than any of them today you think of the inspiration that rising up the anger in shamgar that little farmer who didn't know how to go against 600 philistines but he did he grabbed an ox gold shamgar didn't have any sword he didn't know nothing about how to use one he didn't have a shield but if he'd had a shield he wouldn't have known how to use it but he reached up and he got an ox gold that's an old stick that's got a brass lump on the end of it they beat the ox through the coral with it and he jumped out of that window out there in the middle of that road against 600 armed philistines and killed every one of them hallelujah [Applause] that's my brother can you say man that's my brother shamgar and the sham guards need to rise up tonight and say that's devil that's enough jumped out of that window grabbed an oscar because that's the only thing he knew grabbed an ox goat that he used he he knew it for the cows all the cows and guided him the way but he grabbed that thing because that hard end on it jumped out in the street and killed six six a farmer because god could see his anger god could see his confession you think is this supernatural this is supernatural god put the supernatural in an ox code god put the supernatural in a man that was a farmer to go up against 600 men that had swords and shields trained servants my god is a mighty god i mean he wasn't gonna he's gonna finish him off they all had to be finished by himself brothers you don't have you don't think you have strength to lead your home and cast devils out you've got power to cast devils out apply prayer apply faith apply love don't forget your love can you say amen apply what you've got you say well i got the holy ghost god did something if you've got it in here bring it out of your mouth confess it can you say amen satan you know i put my mistakes underneath the blood because satan will always bring up like he did the prophet remember he lied the prophet lied and when he went to pray for somebody then that condemnation was there you can't pray for that person look what you did which because you told that lawyer last week and it was right there was something satan could hold against him but then he went and confessed and he said lord forgive me that forgive me that mistake i made i shouldn't have said that once that's underneath the blood you go directly back and you pray because everything's under the blood as soon as you go and have that force satan's going to remind you of your mistakes but if they're under the blood now you have every right to pray for that family to pray for that person [Applause] and when the odds are against you all it takes is a little bit of righteous ignition against the enemy to say devil i'm mad watch out you're in trouble now i love the lord don't you what was it in shamgar the holy spirit came on him hallelujah there was a need there was an emergency something had to be done and he couldn't wait until he got an education he couldn't wait until he learned how to fight to be a warrior and get trained up he had to take what was in his hand and go and do something with it saints of god take what is in your soul rise up and do something with it can you say praise the lord let's stand and worship the lord that's like he said to moses what is it in your hand right what is that in your hand take what you got in your hand that staff in your head you say now what's that in your hand take what you've got in your hand rise up and go against the enemy let the righteous ignoration i'm tired of the devil i'm tired of him taking things away from me i'm tired of the devil robbing me of the things that he's trying to rob me of and i'm going to take back what's mine in the name of the lord jesus christ i'm going to take back us god bless you god bless you just a little thought tonight and these things have resonated with me for years i bring him back up every now and then and preach them because we need a reminder unless the devil should just stumble up just take take us over we've got to rise up in faith amen speak it and then let god do the work in his time it might not be a miracle it might not be 600 philistines right there at that moment he might take it one philistine at a time but you've got to keep standing with the word of god with the whatever he's put in your heart you got to stand there with it confess it say i'm a son of god you say well i don't have a position i don't sing in the church i don't preach no no no no get that out
