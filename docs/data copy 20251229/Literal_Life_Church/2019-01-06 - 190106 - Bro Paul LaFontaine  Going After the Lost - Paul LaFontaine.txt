========================================

in the scripture here from Luke chapter 15 you love the Lord this morning a man hopefully I'm not forgetting any of the announcements we have communion or the Lord's Supper this afternoon at 4 o'clock is it rather than 4 o'clock so if you want to get a lunch and come back and participate in that I'm sure that would be a blessing to you so we'll come back enjoy that together and then I didn't have a special today but if I get done preaching you will have a special after I'm done preaching I wanted Wesley to sing the song he's saying Monday night there in our watch night service we had Luke chapter 15 and verse 1 everybody there everybody here ok don't go home don't worry about what's cooking at home don't worry about what you're gonna do at service everybody needs to be all here oh alright good Luke 15 in verse 1 then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners to hear him and the Pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them and he spake this parable unto them saying what man of you having a hundred sheep if he lose one of them does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it and that'll be my text today going after that which is lost going after that which is lost until he find it and when he hath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and neighbors saying unto them rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was worst I say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth I want you to notice what makes heaven rejoice it's not the mysteries it's not how much we do for missions can you say man it's when a soul the lost sheep comes and repents that's what makes the Angels rejoice amen so we should be focused we should be focused on what makes heaven rejoice as well we want to be focused on the right thing so I say to you verse 7 that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons notice which need no repentance what a shape to be in they don't need repentance anymore either that woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece that not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she has found it she calls her friends and her neighbors together saying rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I had lost likewise I say to you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth can you say praise the Lord may God bless the reading of his word Heavenly Father we feel your grace and your mercy coming to us this morning the Lord we pray that you'll lead the church by the Holy Ghost Lord we pray we just take these moments now that we have and really listen to the Word of God and what your Holy Spirit is saying to us Lord that we could be guided and receive leadership in these last days and Lord God that we could be an instrument that's more effectively used for your kingdom Lord we could be yielded to you Lord I'm just sharing my heart my vision is you broke these scriptures to me Lord I'm sharing my vision with the church father and it's not about buildings or or anything like that Lord it's about our heart in the earth and what we can do for your kingdom and how we can be available to you lord I just pray that you anoint this and bring it to pass that we'd understand what our position is in this hour according to the scripture we commit the service to you in Jesus name Amen god bless she may be seated I'm just going to read a section of a prayer I don't normally do this but a section of a prayer brother Branham in the message look away to Jesus and he's explaining in there the three poles of Jesus ministry and the three poles in the last day the first pole healing and the Holy Spirit began to work through that first pole was the first pole of healing in the second pole the wave of God using discernment that you could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart but the third pole is what Jesus came to that was beyond the first and second pole beyond the healings and beyond discerning the hearts there was when Jesus sat down and in John chapter 6 and he begin to break the word except to eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you and begin to direct the disciples and all of his followers towards a deeper thing coming and he says my words I speak and you they are spirit in their life in other words the breaking of the word is greater than miracles the breaking of the word in the opening of the word is greater than discerning can you say man we don't eliminate healings or discernment it's part of the body of Christ but we have the opening of the word which comes to the third PO and that transit that those transitions of the three poles happened in the last days as well and so the he looked at the things that we're looking at and the things that we come to the full restoration of the complete truth how many believe the full restoration of the complete truth is here today according to Scripture promising it and bringing it to us we're no longer waiting on that but in this message he expresses what you have seen temporarily will be manifest in the fullness of its power it won't be used in a great way until this council tightens up and he's referring to the World Council churches when there's a blending and them agreeing together to put pressure on the true elect and pressure on the churches who won't join with the Council of Churches and we know we see that in Book of Revelations and all that we understand so he's saying that we won't see this third pole in full manifestation until this catches up and that council tightens up which is happening by the way it's happening it's already in its initial stages and so I want to say to you that we're holding something here but at the end of his sermon he praised this and I think this lays the foundation for the scripture I want to elaborate on he says Lord were at the end time I see the doors will soon be closed and we're 1963 here Lord wrought the endtime now here we are in 2019 beginning the year and in 1963 the doors are closing we're at the end time where are we at in 2019 I see the doors will soon be closed the doors of opportunity and while it is daylight I can still get into some of these places so I want you to notice the doors will be closed and the doors of opportunity will close and while it is daylight and I can still get into some of these places lord help me to go I'm getting old give me strength renew my youth Lord help me that I might do something out there now that I'm waiting for this great time to come that will be here help me Lord as I go out that I might be able under some way to catch that last predestinated seed that will bring back the Lord Jesus help Oh God so you can see his desire and that is our focus his focus was the last elected seed the last child of God the lost sheep that hasn't come in yet it would be easy when you have the opening of the word to focus internally on yourself and say alright we got this now we're holding this and so we close in within ourselves but brother branham's attitude was not that way in his service to the Lord Jesus Christ he said no I want to go out I want to take the last opportunities that I have to find the last one to find the lost sheep praise the Lord that was his desire so his focus was not internally but actually outward even towards the end of his ministry to take opportunities to focus outwardly to see if I can share the word with somebody who's hungry for more the word so his focus was internally excuse me not internally but outward his revelation of what he had and who he was did not produce a closed door us for and no more an attitude that we have a truth and and that type of attitude us for no more and we will just close in here and wait for what needs to be manifest we'll just wait for it to be manifest and we have something but we're gonna close in and just wait for he's not got that attitude he's saying we have something here but we have opportunities and he's focused on the last ones to come in I want to let all you know here this morning is that we're not getting out of here so the last sheep comes in we're not leaving this place in a rapture until the last one comes in and whether that's sitting among us or out there it doesn't matter we have to be focused on it and the reason I believe is I break it down the reason Jesus is addressing this is because we in are what we haven't been blessed with sometimes can become so internalized and so self focused that we lose the vision of the lost sheep everybody on board and this is what Jesus is dressing and I'm gonna break it down because I believe it would be if there is any attitudes that are internally into needed correction I believe this would correct it so we see in Luke 15 if you want to read the chapter this week I'm gonna dwell in this chapter 15 quite a bit and I'm actually headed towards the last part of 15 it's three parables and the last one is the parable of the prodigal son and at the retreat this year the Lord just opens something to me that was so actually personally a personal rebuke to me and I want to share a lot of that but I want to share what the Lord opened that we read over this parable we don't catch sometimes all that's laying in it of the prodigal son coming back and our attitude towards the prodigal son coming back but but I want you to notice all the parables and everything that's said in Luke chapter 15 they have a theme to it and it's ministered to me recently to read this in my devotion and be able to read over and over again in chapter 3 it's three parables and they are revealing the attitude that we take towards the loss that's what they're revealing the attitude that we take towards the loss and and we have to realize that we need to focus on something that the incompletion of missing sheep the ones that are lost still lost or the missing coin in the case of the parable of the missing coin that this woman and notice now you've got a man in the first parable but you got a woman in the second borough woman is the type of the bride can you say mine and she's got over 10 coins she's but then she has nine and ones ones missing and her thrust and her attention and her burden is not satisfied to say well I've got nine and I'm good to go she becomes almost obsessed with sweeping the house so she finds the last coin how easy it would be to say I've got nine I'm good to go that's everything I need if I missing this and focus completely on being settled I don't want to take the work I don't want to make the sacrifice to try to find the last one no it's not that at all I'm not happy with just the nine I'm not happy with just what these sheep that are here already they've already they're already in can you say man but the focus has to be on what's lost can I get an amen so so it's amazing so we have that something is incomplete and these are the people that notice that something's incomplete they're not satisfied with just the numbers that they had there's still not a complete group until the lost sheep is in I want to tell you you're not complete until all the bride is in you're not going in a rapture till all the bride is in we're not complete say well we got the word we're complete we got the complete word that the foal of what Paul spoke of in first Corinthians they are speaking of that which is perfect is come then that which his part is done away perfect interpretation by the perfect restored Word of God brings it to perfection not us not our interpretation but God blesses in the last days with about ten scriptures I'm thinking of of a restoration of truths that were lost for 2,000 years of church history he said in the last days I'll restore I'll restore all those truths I'll restore what happened in the garden you'll know what happened the garden I'll restore the Godhead you understand whether it's one God or three gods I'll restore the truth of predestination it's all been laying there but he says I got to restore it and bring it back to my people again because churches have messed with those truths and got rid of those truths and tore pages out of the Bible but in the last days I'll restore truth to my people we're living in that day but we could say well I'm complete we have the word we have the truth these people who are not complete until the last ones come in I want you to look at that look at it just that way that we're not complete and this comfortableness to come to church and say man it's good to see my friends here I'm happy to see my friends sitting next to me it's good to have you all here we're all sons and daughters of God praise the Lord enjoyed the music enjoyed the musicians head back home to your jobs I think our burden needs to go deeper than that I think it shouldn't be asked for no more I think we need a vision to say lord help me find the lost sheep so as we start in the first two verses if you want to look at him again in the first verse I could preach all afternoon on just the first verse that says then drew near unto him the son of man Christ who drew near to him publicans and sinners were attracted to him now friends that to me it doesn't seem normal in our eyes that our Lord Jesus our Lord Jesus when he was around here in this fleshly body of two thousand years ago that there was actually a comfortableness of sinners and publicans to want to be around him it doesn't say their Savior if I have to stay an hour just on first one I'll do it I'm gonna take more time continue this next next time this there's something wrong with this picture because when I view this and when I view some message ranks and some churches the same Jesus that we're claiming to serve the same Jesus that's here in the Bible's were claimed living in us and I'm here to tell you the sinners and the publicans comfortable to be around it it doesn't say they're saved yet but there was some manner that Jesus was that they wanted to hear him I can think of some message atmospheres and message situations that sinners and publicans don't feel welcomed at all they don't feel comfortable at all can you say man but I'm gonna say the same Lord Jesus we claim to serve the sinners and publicans were drawing near to him not even saved yet but there was must have been some manner there must have been something about him that there's a supernatural drawing that they wanted to sit down with him and be with him and they just wanted to hear they weren't even saved yet but I like being around this guy and there's something of it there was an attraction going on even before they were saved if we claim to have the same Jesus then I pray let that same manner be at us [Music] that people would like to be around like to talk to me that I have something of life within me that they're feeling attracted to they've been attracted to the world for years they've been attracted to Hollywood there if they're a hungry heart they're tired of all that but when they pick up on something different within you the Christ in you they want to be around you same Jesus that we claim to have in our we should see the same results everybody understand see it's not that message it's it's the Christ of the message that attracts a hungry heart it's the Christ of the message that attracts the hungry heart our people that attracted to you or do you turn people off I'm gonna be asked them some questions like that in the service today won't be very long but I'm gonna be asking some jolting questions is the sinner and the publican attracted to the Christ in you I'm not talking about your personality people like me yeah I'm good time I laugh that's great no no I'm not talking about you I talk about the Christ that's in you being drawn to it being there there's something there's a drawing so it's amazing to see sinners and publicans coming around that my Lord had something that attracted them to him he didn't repel them they didn't feel repelled this is not normal for sinners to to me it's not normal for sinners to want to be around Christ and and and we think that they stay we think that the center stays as far away from what we believe and who we are the center stays as far away as they can but that's not what the scripture says here and and we write people off they'll never they'll never come to what I believe they'll never come to some of the things in we stand for some of the ways that we dress and some of the I'm not talking about the ways we dress it's a secondary thing do you have the life of Christ but we think they're never gonna and you ride them off before before anything I'm over here and I believe this and this is unattractive to the world we know that we're oddballs the Prophet preached that we're oddballs all that's there so I'm gonna so you stay over here at oddball and they'll never then they don't never receive it you don't have a right to write them off like that and I'm reading a scripture to say the same Christ of the message the same Christ living us the same Christ that lived 2,000 years ago and the sinners and publicans like to be around him is that okay amen kind of quiet today but that's alright I'm determined I got it all I got what the Lord gave me to preach you claim to have the same Jesus in you I have a question our sinners drawn to the Jesus in you or are they not drawn to it or do you have to do you give off such an air about yourself that they don't want to be in your presence at all there was a manner about Christ that made them feel comfortable enough to be around him his approach to them his way with him something must have been attractive and I don't believe Jesus compromised I believe when the time came to tell truth I believe Jesus spoke truth I don't believe it's a compromiser by hanging around these sinners in public I don't believe he was compromised or not how many would believe Christ was compromised he never compromised but I'm here to tell you with all he was truth he was the very embodiment of truth he knew all things and yet knowing all things and knowing all truth his manner in his way attracted the center tracted the publican it's amazing friends and so they come and hear him and so this was the manner they want to come here and not they weren't a saint yet but they were drawn to come around then there's a reaction in verse 2 from the Pharisees and scribes murmuring then saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with him so now you have the other side of all the public all the the religious people we call the Pharisees and scribes they're supposed to know all these things they know it but but they criticize Jesus and they they said he's eating with sinners and he receiveth them well that was a lie that was a lie because he didn't go to them they came to him so the first sees are already telling a lie on Jesus because they're critical they'd understand they don't have Christ in their hearts themselves can you say man so got a murmur and complain I can't believe that he's invited those people to come and eat with him or he's going out to them he didn't go out to them he didn't even invite them necessary but he has such an attraction to him they wanted to be with him so their accusation is a lie and and that's true to scripture because there is a scripture in Hebrews I believe it says Jesus was separate from sinners Jesus in a lot of times the church world uses that we need to go out there we need to be in the bars we need to have rock and roll in the church we needed this we can attract the center Jesus never had to do that the church world has bought into all these modern ideas is that we made make us look like the front of the world to attract sinners the sinners are tired of the world and on a supernatural God they want a reality let me see the reality of Christ let me see it live not by religion let me see somebody to dress modestly but because it's in their heart because Christ lives in their heart see we get off track and our thinking don't we we get off track so many times that our thinking and these were critical of them being around but Jesus wasn't going out to them necessarily although we're preaching on the fact that we need to go find the lost sheep he was finding the lost sheep because he was creating an atmosphere that they could feel comfortable to come and be saved and come and repent and so now we see him the reaction they're blaming him for being with them it was a lie he didn't go be with him they came to him the Bible says Jesus was separate from sinners Bible says Jesus was separate from sinners so he didn't go on their territory oh you ever heard of the you're heard of a mission dating he ever heard missionary dating nobody's ever heard of that I'm gonna go date this person in the world because I'm gonna get him saved it's called missionary dating yeah I'm gonna go to their parties they invited me to because I can be a witness to them can't be a witness at a party they're drinking and everything you went on their territory the Prophet taught us and the scripture now teaches and it's not necessarily us going on their territory but it's just us having such an attraction to invite them into our world in our territory that they feel comfortable enough to let the Holy Spirit deal with their hearts it's not you saving them it's the Holy Spirit but you got to get them in the right atmosphere they gotta feel loved can you say man and we don't love them by giving them more rock and roll we don't love them by giving them more things of the world and making our church look like a community center instead of a real church we don't compromise those things we should have the goods that attract a sinner to us without compromising the way Jesus did it anybody on board here this morning I can't get enough amens for this I think this is good I think we need this teaching especially in the message of the hour because we're not above growing into pride to say I internally look and keep my mind and all the message movement and all that's going on internally and completely lose our vision for the lost sheep and lose our vision for the center can you say me we're - that means I'm going ahead and say it we're you wouldn't believe how - we're too focused still on ourselves if you way your life today and you don't get anything else of this I ask you to go home and pray say Lord show me in my life if I'm so focused in any way because I'd say when we get to praying we're more self focused than what we realize we're not here for ourselves we're here for others we're here for others right down to every penny you make it your job brothers you better pray and say Lord I want to feed my family I thank you Lord for this job but Lord what can I accomplish for the kingdom of God in my children in my church and in my life this money belongs to you this salary belongs to you this home that you gave me belongs to you it's not mine I'm just a steward over it God can take it away from me just like that we must live with the priority that everything that's given to me must be used in some way to accomplish something for the Lost sinners everything must be gone to come through that filter can you see or elsewhere just like the world so they react to him and I'm gonna get past that now he was separate from sinners but he didn't get on their eternity they came to him but they felt comfortable around him I want to emphasize that point yet so now he was going to correct a group that had become so isolated Pharisees and Sadducees everybody still listening I'm gonna be brief here today I'm gonna try to be brief he was going to correct a group that had become not they they murmured doesn't say they told him openly didn't say hey Jesus you're saying no they murmured but he hears everything and because they murmured and criticized him he's going to give three parables to correct their attitude that had become so isolated to themselves we're the only ones that's right we are satisfied with ourselves can you say man and closing in with him selves they had become so isolated and comfortable in their own world and how it functioned that they had no vision for an atmosphere of place to invite or to have sinners come they did not have the drawing power or even a desire for someone else besides themselves now Jesus does refer to the Pharisees one place and rebukes them that they would encompass land and sea to make one proselyte and they wouldn't even proselyte the sadly the Sadducees to become a Pharisee because there's different groups you know a lot of a lot of the church growth is kind of people going from church to church come on can you say man and proselyting people to come and make a change over to the Presbyterian Church over here it change your membership over here and do this that and so this is what the Pharisees did is that it's it's proselyting it's it's trying and I want you to know what that word means because that's what the Pharisees did and it means a prospect means a person who has converted to one opinion or to a party or like a Democrat becomes a Republican Republican because they never got there's no supernatural God in that for - for repentance that's just changing your opinion that's what religion has become change your membership over here change your opinion okay I believe in God that's that's fine and so now I want to say it again they did not have the drawing power and so a process is a person that is converted to one opinion party or religion to another they were about numbers more than true repentance they were about changing people's opinions than they were about true repentance that's not what the sinners need and that's not what the sinners are looking for the world of religious Jews and sinners was so divided it had no place or regard for the loss I'm saying the world of the sinner and the world of the Pharisees and Jews was so divided there was no attraction to draw them in and they created that world they created unapproachable have we done that are we comfortable with our own world so much that we've lost a little bit about thinking Lord what what can you put in me to draw someone who has not been blessed to hear the truth yet maybe a different message for you this morning different what you expect I want to say over time even a move of God can become closed and exclusive and people can become proud and isolated in their own comfort zone we know denominations can come that way because we see the Pharisees into it we know they can become that way but I'm going to tell you that even a true move of God Luther Wesley can turn into domination ilysm and become isolated that they lose the main focus even a move can God of God can eventually become closed exclusive and people become proud and isolated in their own comfort zone and completely forget why we have this Christ within us they forget why the message has came the messages come to us to have life within us and to impart eternal life for brother Boaz mentioned this in the youth meeting Friday night is that brother brems says that the purpose of the Holy Ghost the purpose and God giving you the Holy Ghost is to impart eternal life to someone else what is the Holy Ghost given for well it's to change you it's to convert you of course but that's not the end of it it's to impart that we could actually impart eternal life to someone else and in the message we forget what the purpose is we forget what the that it's to have life the message is Christ and it's to have life within us to impart eternal life that's what the Holy Ghost was given for but over time a message Steven from God sent by a prophet can produce fanaticism an exclusive and an exclusive monopoly on truth can you say Amen I don't believe we need to present things that way I don't need to present the attitude that we have on the monopoly on truth because truth God you cannot put God in a box that God cannot reveal himself to somebody even if they're not in your ranks I believe that the truth is in the light of the hour I believe his blood is in the life because the scripture says that he if you walk in the light as he is in the light then you have fellowship with one another and the blood cleanses you from all sin can you say man so the benefits to the blood is walking in the light if you're walking in darkness can you say man and you won't walk in light you're gonna lose the effects of the blood of Jesus Christ that's what the scripture says I believe all that but I think it is wrong to present this message as an exclusive thing that God can't deal with someone else besides the ranks of the message I think that's wrong to present it that way I know a lot of preachers are disagree with me that's fine III just preach into my own congregation here I think that even a god-sent prophet can eventually the move of God can turn to fanaticism and an exclusive monopoly on truth and then become a thing you have to do certain things to gain acceptance into that group but not repentance and the only thing I see there for sinners is a requirement first is true repentance can I get an amen the nominations that no no yes you got to ten steps to go through and you're gonna have to correct this you're going to get your dress right you're gonna have to do this right and you're gonna have to do this and you get off those cigarettes and you could you who we got all these steps to go through you better get rid of all out because the scripture just said the center of the first thing he needs and heaven rejoices when he truly repents heavens already rejoicing oh my somebody better get into this now I'm giving you the scripture now we're not rejoicing until they dress right we're not dressed we're not rejoicing and having a good time until we go ahead feel like they've conformed away though the way we look that's not what the scripture says our heart and prayer is to bring them to true repentance that's first can you say amen let the holy spirit come with this power and move that heart to true repentance and if it's true repentance you don't have to worry about all the rest God will bring that Saint on to the fullness of himself the first thing I notice in these scriptures is that heaven rejoice oh not just a sinner because he that would be more of a Baptist presentation look for sinners go for the center get the sinner no no no it's the one that truly repents it's more about repentance than it is the sinner we're praying for an atmosphere that God can move that heart to true repentance and if it's true repentance I'm telling you the power of God is gonna change that life you don't make them from a sinner to a saint you don't have to do it so I'm encourage you on training you this morning what should we be praying for with all the truth we have we should be praying that we create a right after I told my leadership here's my goal for the year in the coming years is that I want to present the best presentation and atmosphere of what this message is in our whole church I want to get us to work towards creating the best atmosphere of the Holy Spirit and the best representation of this message how many will join me so souls can be changed they can walk here and here in here to feel the presence of God can you say man God will clean them up God will do the work you catch them God will clean them like fish can you say man aren't you glad you don't have to do the cleanup but we all should be praying every service we get together and every day when we go out into this word God how can you just let there be a radiance come from my life let there be an attraction come from me Lord when I walk into my job when I walk into my school Oh Lord let me be so in tune with you doing my work but somebody is attracted to the presence that I'm bringing when we meet together in this place you just stagger in here and you just barely made it no lady you ought to come a little early you ought to pray you ought to pray on the way to church you ought to sing some songs in your car with your children don't talk about your problems and all that sing some songs create an atmosphere with your children till the time we get here we're ready to create an atmosphere that when people begin to come through these doors you don't have to say very much what's not being said is speaking to their heart already would you join me with that because it might be unless selected seed would be right here among us that hasn't repented yet I talked about going out there and finding the last exit might be among us right here one of these young people one of these children one of these old people they haven't truly repented yet that's what this is about you know you're still a center even coming here if you haven't truly repented yet you still I love you but unless you have truly come to a true repentance in your heart you're still a sinner but I'm in the message it doesn't matter you're still a sinner unless you've truly repented before God it's about repentance that they rejoiced over right there was that's when the Angels rejoice you know they they didn't they don't strike up the band with any old occasion at hand there's a song about it and I'm trying to remember the words and I'm having a senior moment and I'm only 52 heaven doesn't strike up the band with any old occasion and had to be a special thing to make the angels sing but when a sinner makes the lordís choice that's when the Angels rejoice we can't see him but when the center somebody truly repents there's rejoicing going on in heaven so I'm asking you change your focus that's what we begin to rejoice not if we get over all the dress right or I don't get everything let God take care of that but when someone is so broken sometimes they're moved to tears but we know that there's been a true genuine of repentance of the heart God I'm ready to give it all to you we should be rejoicing over that somebody say praise the Lord that's the direction that's the vision that this pastor has for this church I don't want to be a message status quo Church I'm not concerned with what's going on out there I don't really care I'll pray for people but I'm not concerned with fashioning our church after what they're doing out there let them do what they do can you say man but we've got to get to the right atmosphere for the lost sheep can you say mine we got to find the last predestinated see it's not all about preaching the mysteries that's seeing the mystery come and draw people to Christ I'm gonna continue to preach the mysteries of God here we're blessed with the mysteries being unfolded according to revelations 10 7 we're blessed with the mystery of God being revealed in the last days we're blessed I'm going to continue to preach it and I'm going to continue to preach about Bible modesty and all that but listen now that's not the emphasis as much as creating an atmosphere that if I speak for 20 minutes which I won't be today by the way if I speak for 20 minutes or an hour and a half I've created the atmosphere and you have to for repentance to take place somebody say praise the Lord over time the message even from a god-sent prophet can produce fanaticism and if you're listening and watching I'll tell you there's a lot of fanaticism that's taking place there's cultish cultish things that are getting worse we bear the blunt and the the reproach of that unfortunately under the same message name I was looking up the meeting to a cult the cult there's many definitions but one dick Shea said a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs that are considered strange or sinister by others and I thought this was just interesting in and a cult is a misplaced or excessive admiration for a person or a thing and notice it says now a misplaced or excessive admiration for a person we have that going on we have idolatry going on say well it was that just today no it happened in Daniels day Daniel was a true prophet of God I believe in true prophets of God I believe they bring the Word of God Daniel Nebuchadnezzar built an image and that image was unto Daniel Shadrach Meshach Abednego says listen gun I ain't bowing down to my friend and my brother Daniel he's a prophet he's God's prophet for the hour but I'm not bound and worship to him this has happened before fanaticism to follow a true man of God and we're having it happen so much in this message idolatry I don't follow William Branham I followed the God of William Branham the truth had been stored through his office in his place of Malachi for revelations since seven scripture being fulfilled you'll never get me to deny that because somebody had to fulfill those things he said well what if it's a lot of preachers well it wasn't in John the Baptist day because his Elijah was spirit was on John the Baptist it wasn't on ten people it was on one man John there was a man sent from God whose name was John and he had the spirit of Elijah upon him one man now today it's not about one man it's about the bride of Jesus Christ but it starts with one man see it's a secret in the scripture that many churches ignore but you can't get around it it's Isaiah it's Moses it's bang bang bang bang it's Paul Paul in the New Testament there's no prophets than to pose a prophet Paul was Paul was had a special ministry besides the other ministers there he didn't make himself that but we got 14 books of his writings in the New Testament we got Peter and James and they're all men of God all used by the Holy Ghost Paul why does he get 14 books in the New Testament he said the word that I received from the Lord if a man comes preaching something let him be accursed if an angel come preaching something letting be a curse let him in know he says if I come back and say something different than what's been brought I'd be a cursed that's how much he believed it was the office it was the place he is a man no confidence in the man no confidence in the man no because he's flesh like we are he's a human being like we are oh if I preach that in some message ranks here this morning I'd be blackballed probably my life threatened but I don't deify a man that was born in sin shaped and iniquity I don't deify a prophet I take what God spoke through thus saith the Lord from God I say thank God take it in my heart may it bring me to Christ in my life you understand now with the deepest respect for God's man for the hour God uses that can you say men so much more that I could say on that but I don't want to be airing I don't want to stay negative so many things that I feel I could correct going on in around the world well it's not my job necessarily don't want to be too negative what I want to train our group of people here and whoever God puts it is that our focus is the last elected seed our focus is it to preach the mysteries every service so everybody's dazzled by what I preach I don't preach any more so I can dazzle the other preachers in the message and say this is the only place that's bringing it this way boy this is you got to come here because this is dazzling oh this is well this is deep it's not my desire anymore but this is the focus here the last days prayer the even brother Branham saying Lord we have this now the third poll has been revealed we see it vindicated we have this what's his desire Lord let me take every opportunity that I can to find the last elected it's not focused internally let's focus Lord how can we find I can we find my children bring him back to the Lord the prodigal sons are coming back the attitudes become so so focused I got to get off this but addict who's become so self okis sometimes even in the message that there's no room left for the sinner to come he's saying leave your comfort zone and self focused mind and go after the lost one no matter how good we have it we're all still incomplete with the loss without the lost ones coming when we're satisfied with just our circle and what it is even if it's the circle of our family because families will do this we're focused just on our family strengthen your family in the Lord but you can't be focused only on your family if your focus on your family and no thoughts of the lost ones we're becoming a Pharisee even in the message grab that back I should have said that it came out probably getting trouble for it but since I'm not worried about that let me say it again if we're focused on our own circle and just our own family and no thoughts are the lost ones we're becoming a Pharisee even in the message makes some people uncomfortable have someone in the church for a service that doesn't look like them are they in the message are they in the message where did that phrase come from where did that phrase come from that we're starting to judge people whether they're in the movement of the message or whether they're not and by doing that we make it a movement that it's just as long as they're in the movement and coming to a message church that's good enough I'm here to tell you that's a lie because this message isn't about to start of denomination or a movement this message was to bring us back to Bible faith Bible restored truth and that we have the life of the resurrection power living within us that souls can be transformed and changed I just gave you the whole summary of why God sent the last day's message can you say man but what are they in the message and I think in the words that come from you see it comes from developing something it's a replacement for the real thing we should be asking are they saved are they filled with the Holy Ghost can you say man and I'm gonna pray are they saved are they filled with the Holy Ghost and I'm gonna keep praying if they don't I'm gonna pray for them cuz that's what they need they need true repentance see war about all the message I'll tell you they get the Holy Ghost they won't have a problem receiving all truth that God is brother cuz there's only one spirit that can live the word and that's the one who wrote the book and that's the author and if you have the altar then the author you can live the book can you say man praise the Lord there's only one spirit that can live in us the Spirit of Christ and the first thing people need is the genuine spirit of Christ repentance baptism can you say man to be saved to be filled with Christ's life if not if they don't have it I'm gonna pray and I'm gonna love them right into it I'll jump to my subject real quick of that prodigal God changed his heart and he headed back to the Father but he felt so unworthy to come back and the Bible says before he was back to the Father he felt hesitant the father ran towards him because the father discerned his heart had already changed maybe you couldn't see it on the outside yet and he actually was hesitant to run towards the physis I'm just gonna see if I can ask him just to be a servant in his house I'll be glad to do it I'm earlier unworthy I've walked away from all this stuff I've got all this but but father could see his heart was changed so if the hearts changed that's the first step can you say man before even repented the father's look at him he ran towards the Sun can you say man son fell down and he says Lord I'm unworthy make me a serve I'm worthy to cover your house he starts repenting true repentance and that's all the father needed can you say man he was as predestinated son of God that had come back what was his father's answer yeah you know you know I'm gonna give you a few days here I've thought about this and you really you know my goodness you have really mess yourself up bud look at you I know what all you did I heard it I seen into the newspapers you brought a reproach on my name you did a bunch of stuff my goodness I can't believe that father just forgive me well you know I'm gonna forgive you but there's gonna be some time involved makes me broken this morning to see if that don't correct this I don't know what can I tell you friends we need the father's heart when it comes to these people you need to do this you need to go to the 10 steps you need there's a seminar I know you need to come through the steps here and build your way back god help us said Lord you know what can I do you know it's restful responsible kill the fatted calf bring my best robes it's time to rejoice rejoice I feel unworthy rejoice look what I've done no my sons back he's repented it's time to rejoice he doesn't have to come through the ten steps of psychology to work his way back repentance will bring them all the way where repentance will do the job he was my son before the foundation of the world bring the robe bring the fatted calf let's have a rejoicing bring the musicians get Boaz on the organ get brother Mike on the piano get Weston Solomon on the drums it's time rejoice it's time to have a good time praise be to God can you say mad hallelujah oh my that was a hint for the musicians to come you should have taken that because if you don't I'm gonna keep preaching the joy comes when there's true repentance can you say man there is no joy I want you to notice now there's no joy over the ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance they don't need to repent if we've lost the desire to repent even as a Christian we've lost almost everything can you say mine so I'm asking for a move of God to focus on the one I want Wesley to sing that song he's saying Monday night if if I'm asking you to pray I'm asking for a move of God in our congregation are you with me Saints to to get our focus on the one instead of the message movement as it is now I'm asking the church to get your focus off of what's going on in the entire message and get your focus on the one the sheep can you say man that is lost I'm asking you to pray and to be broken to make this assembly the best representation of this message and the best atmosphere for a sinner to come if the truth were told we on the message are more self focused than what we'd ever omit can you say Amen praise the Lord and and people don't want to hear all the mess that's going on I remember being in a meeting years ago and there was a great controversy I was asked for it's a bunch of ministers to come and discuss it to try to settle it great controversy of the messages in Charlotte and I was there with a bunch of ministers and so it was a thing going on attention and brothers are going back and forth and they were sending messages across the internet and preaching it on the internet to go back and forth and I won't mention names but I'm just here to tell you it was a great controversy but I remember staying there for the ministers I felt something come my heart just this I said some of you have very popular ministers and you're on streaming and thousands of people are watching you I want to just share with you when you get across the pulpit to preach and you only preach the negative and you only trying to correct all the message problems there's some so over in China that's streaming in and they could care less about these problems now I wasn't very popular in that room but I wanted to say it for all of us preachers for all of us Saints a hungry soul could care less about all the controversy and all the message stuff going on that's so over in China when they stream in they want to hear truth they want to hear the positive truth they want to hear God that how God can restore can you say man they want to be changed by the supernatural power of God so when we only have an hour to preach I think we ought to preach the positive Word of God that's why you see me not having to address we had a big thing that happened ten years ago in the message I didn't even address it across the board just left a note because most of you iack marked my carnation didn't even know it existed it was going on I didn't need to talk about it I got the brothers together and discussed it with them but I tell you we only have an opportunity here for an hour well you only have opportunities just to talk to person a few minutes one thing I have learned in talking to people is that we're more anointed than what we realize I said you're more anointed than what you realize and you've got got things in your heart that sometimes just a few sentences to that person in some cases it'll never go away from him they'll go back to it and think about it over and over again because there's power in the word of the bride I said there's power in the word of the bride so I'm asking us let's forget let's get our minds off of social media and all the stuff and debates that are going on over this that and the other and Christmas and on fighting battles with quotes back and forth I had a couple in the church when I first started pastoring and they were having bad arguments and I was just a young pastor I didn't know how to what to say I wasn't even married yet said what do we do with this is the head Lord I said I don't know how to do this but they said they got talking and they said in our arguments we're kind of shooting the Bible and quotes at one another to defend each other and go back I said well I have one bit of information I can tell you may not know a lot but I know the Word of God and the message is too precious for you to bring in your carnal argument leave the word out of it it's too precious not meant for that our message is not given to us to argue about to fuss about let's quit arguing about the resurrection and let's get the resurrection within us I want to be in the resurrection I want to have the resurrection power I don't want to debate when it's gonna happen in all these other details and we have so much knowledge and the message and revelation but we have more knowledge people get puffed up with knowledge we know so much that it brings us into immaturity that we're supposed to fight on one until we convince one another of what's right and we've completely lost the main focus and that's to create an atmosphere with the Holy Ghost someone could be changed and repented and they could receive this truth how many raised hands say make me Christ in me that sinners are attracted to be around me oh yeah sinners are attracted publicans are attracted he's got something to say I want to hear it every one of you I'm asking you to take your mind and your sometimes it brings depression I'm asking you to take your mind this year off of your problems when you're focused on your problems you're not focused on somebody else to help somebody else I'm asking you to repent and focus off of your problems and focus on the right thing and when you do that you're gonna see God work out your problems you're too focused on your problem do you focus on your complexes to focus on yourself self focused god help us to die to that this morning and become focused on the main thing there's somebody still out there and we're not complete somebody's still here that hasn't come and we're incomplete until they're in everybody in agreement this morning now blush I know it's been a different strange service strange but that's my vision my heart I'm tired of trying to meet the status quo and fit into some mold of other churches let's find what the Bible says what we're supposed to be and take the I told the leadership in the dinner a few weeks ago we have been given the greatest message and the greatest truths that any generation has ever received but what are we doing with it what are we doing with it what are you doing with a young person what are you doing with it you're blessed what are you doing with what you have all the singers come up here and sing with Wesley this what's it called keep on let's stand I know you've been sitting a long time [Music] [Music] my sister seems that I just can't succeed so while you're down there on your knees cheap on me [Music] [Music] you [Music] my brother it seems that I just can't succeed so while you're down there on your knees you keep praying for me my sister needs your help she can't do it by herself I'm gonna pray till I break through I'll keep praying for you gonna cheat I'm gonna keep on praying for you [Music] go to three breakthrough I'm gonna keep [Music] gonna keep on [Music] gonna celebrate together Lord we need your help we can't do it by ourselves we're not afraid to eat break through [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] pray [Music] you [Music] [Applause] to breakthrough he says to go [Music] [Music] your feet [Music] we speak [Music] it's gonna keep [Music] here now we're standing on our feet [Music] with that story too [Music] we [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we [Music] oh my the Holy Ghost inspired that song with brother Wesley that's for sure can you say man is that your prayer this morning pulling the miracles down can we pray together just now it has to be a repentance in our heart to say Lord I'm sorry Lord let me have the right focus let me be focused on the right thing let's not this atmosphere just affect us here this morning to bring those things before the Lord I want to pray together I want to just pray myself but I want to close this service as we just get ready for the lord's supper tonight it says the examine ourselves to examine ourselves whether we be in the faith that which is wrong and needs to be purged out of our lives we have the holy spirit to do it how many will raise your hands say help my lord help my focus to be changed from self focused to the lost coin such a fervency for the lost going to sweep the house to be seizing opportunities not missing opportunities brother brems says how do you know that that harlot how do you know that if you don't invited a church it wouldn't make a daughter of God out of her how do you know that how do you know your boss if you wouldn't invite him to church something would affect him your classmates your co-workers your mom your dad your children how do you know we have to take the opportunities this morning I'm gonna raise your hand say Lord make me a vessel used of you for your kingdom oh let this be more than a mental exercise let the Holy Spirit convict our hearts and change our hearts can you pray with me Heavenly Father we're gonna keep on praying Lord we're gonna keep on pulling the miracles down a brother and sister in need Lord and we want to be that vessel that's used Lord God we want to keep on bringing these strings before the lost sheep Lord the lost ones that our focus should be on the ones that are coming back or the ones that are on the way back or the ones that don't know truth make me a vessel used of you Lord this year this year I want to change in my heart and Lord I want to take my mind off of sometimes losing sleep over the controversies and losing sleep over there whether we have this just right or not oh god help us not to be that way but help our burden to increase as we look in Jeremiah Isaiah there learn says that mark them that sigh and cry for the abominations done in the city that would be the seal of the Holy Ghost is the ones that are sighing and crying for the abominations that would be the seal of something within us that would be Abraham crying out Lord if there's 50 Lord if there's 30 if there's 20 would you spare him Lord crying out for a lot Oh Lord we need a deeper experience with you Lord we thank you for the unveiled truth of the third pole being open to us we thank you for the seven seals being revealed to us Lord we're thankful to live in such glory subsets truth Lord but God what have we done with it father what have we done with it Lord some hungry heart Lord may they be drawn to us I pray and may you prepare the ground of their hearts that the words I would say even if it's an invite to church it would be the trigger for that heart to be changed draws to repentance as we've asked for the sinners but Lord if there's repentance needed in our lives we repent before you Lord forgive us and may our may be we rejoice over the right things Lord we rejoice over this and that and the other nice things in life that we get and that's fine but help us to really find the real rejoicing that's when someone Lord finds the cross finds the power of the Cross granted father change our church this coming year make us different lord help us to to walk closer to you and I pray you'll draw the elected seed in this area Lord so we invite them may they come and may they found true find true salvation Lord it's not just that they come Lord that they find repentance we thank you Lord we're gonna pull miracles down we're gonna tell those Lord that are in need thank you Father in Jesus name god bless you was seeing this song as we go and God bless you and then we've gathered together at four o'clock for a short Lord's Supper foot-washing tonight and fellowship together looking forward to it he loved the Lord this morning god bless you all I pray that this is not offensive to anybody I pray that it was taken in good a good spirit and you understand my heart don't always bring it just the way that I want to bring it but we need to be focused on the right thing and that's my heart is that we focus on our problems too much focus on ourself too much our own prayers sometimes so we focus on someone else's need then God has a way of blessing us for the desires that we have god bless you even if they don't believe you just even
