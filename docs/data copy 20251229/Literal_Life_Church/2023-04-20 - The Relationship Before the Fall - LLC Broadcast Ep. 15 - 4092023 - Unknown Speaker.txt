hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literallife.church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today House of Glass seems to be my home all I ask is that you're careful with that storm I struggle just like anyone else my greatest enemy is myself [Music] now this may come as a bit of a shock you may think I'm perfect but I'm not hey I'm just trying to do my best but it's hard to breathe beneath this mask it's hard the truth I need us just like you do so please excuse this work that isn't [Music] I won't pretend with you [Music] I don't have a clue what you're going through it's got me thinking it's best to not judge you cause we're all called to very different lives your faults are not at all like my [Music] I'd like to thank the academy for this new role in honesty I'll pray for you and you and you pray for me until we're all just aware we need you please [Music] I need a savior just like you too so please excuse this work that isn't true and I won't pretend with you thank you [Music] oh it's hot [Music] you knew the truth I need a savior you're just like you do so please excuse this work that isn't true I won't pretend with you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] verse 21 and the Lord God calls this deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man so God did all of this and then he separated into him into two vessels they started out as one Spirit created in the image of God which God's a spirit so man was a spirit man first and then chapter two then he he breathes the breath of life into a vessel uh Adam and both the feminine both Adam and Eve were in that one vessel then he made him a vessel so that was the next stage and now he takes something out of Adam a rib out of Adam and he makes a second vessel so now you have the same The Same Spirit masculine and feminine and also part of the nature of God and now you have two vessels though but still one and notice what God does this and then he brings this woman to the man after after this sleep and he performs surgery on him and and and brings this one now he brings the woman and now Adam's going to speak and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh now this is an interesting way to look at it because we know that they're standing there now as two vessels so we could say in our minds no they're not one flesh they're two two vessels but the Oneness is so strong and they're still of one spirit that the conclusion to God and the conclusion to Adam is there's still one flesh and I want you to catch something in this in speaking about relationships because if we catch this then the way that we look at one another will be changed and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed I'd like to bring in the New Testament in second Corinthians chapter 5 Second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 14. For the Love of Christ constrainteth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead spiritually speaking now uh we we see what Paul's saying that there's the love of Christ is motivating us and he's he's really going to be talking about how we look at one another how we look at others the love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judge if one if one died for all then we're all dead how many know we're all in the same state we all need the Lord and then when he went to death that we could die to ourself we all die to ourselves and the new man comes to life if that happens within the Holy Ghost filled Believers then we have if God looks at it that way we have to look at it that way that we've all died to our old man in Christ and the new man is living in this brother or sister I'm looking at if we look at the old man if we keep looking at the flesh we'll be stumbled God's not stumbled at looking at us he can Overlook our flesh he looked beyond our faults and seen our need I'm glad God's not looking at my flesh today so if God's looking at us that way then we have to begin to see and this is what he talks about whether he says uh and they excuse me if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they would which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them rose again wherefore henceforth from now on from henceforth know we no man after the flesh he's picking up the original principle that he could look at two vessels Adam can look at her as a different vessel now but he still said she's she's one flesh with me it's still one flesh and he doesn't even look at the flesh he's looking at we're one in spirit okay so and and so wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we know have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more so he's fulfilled his fleshly body days Paul knew Jesus in a deeper way by the mystery of Christ even greater than the disciples Paul never seen Jesus In the Flesh we would think all the disciples they got a higher position they were with him and fished with him in the flesh but he said Paul actually had a greater Revelation or a greater view of Christ and he never seen him in the flesh so we move to this mystery of what it's not that you see what's going on in the flesh but you see the mystery behind it let me finish this wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we know we have known Christ after us yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away and behold all things are become New Calvary has opened the way to bring us back into relationship again and these are foundational statements many of you know them but I'm assuming maybe many don't because I I need you to catch the foundation I want to tell you again that everything that the fall brought in the beginning Calvary has the power to restore us back to all of it again God is taking us back to Eden again and he's not stopping halfway with you he's taking us all the way back before the fall he's reversing all everything can you say Amen so if you've got broken relationships and you've got broken things and you've come from baggage in your family and all kinds of divorce and everything like that that's all as a result of the Fall can you say man but I'm here to tell you in our soul level and then God bringing us back to New bodies the power of Calvary is restoring us back to everything that has been lost amen so that is Calvary and so Christ died and he made a way to come back into Union by the Holy Ghost and that is the only way and the only basis for coming back into relationship with God can you say Amen the only basis into coming back into relationship with God is Not Just Calvary because Calvary took care of our sins so that we could receive the spirit of God it is only by receiving the holy ghost that we come into contact and relationship with God that we lost in the garden it's not by religion it's not by do's and don'ts it's not by what you wear it's not by some denomination it's not by shaking the preacher's hand it's not by doing good works there's only one thing that would bring us back into relationship that Adam and Eve lost and that's that we receive his spirit and his nature in our soul that is the only way back in the relationship now I know people can say well I talk to the Lord I love the lord it's interesting on the street if you ask somebody if they love Christ most people will say yes there's no evidence in their life they don't love the word they're not they're not ever around the word but if you just said I love the law I love oh sure I love the Lord do you pray of course I pray but you see now that's not the relationship Adam and Eve had there's there's a relationship that's a Oneness by Nature that you come back into that is not just a religion that you pray and you hope God answers back this is a God that answers back and you say amen and one of the ways he answers you back is to fill you with the holy spirit that you have the same desire that is in this Bible to live the word and there's no bucking up against it there's no rebellion in your soul there's no desire says I want part of this and I want that's what people do is micromanage parts of the message by the way I want this no all that's gone but the Holy Ghost and down here it says I'm ready to submit to the word of God I'm ready because I love him because I want him I I love him so much the only way the only grounds of Fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself in his church is the Oneness of himself in the people that's the only grounds of fellowship and the only way that you can have those grounds is by a union to be United with him forever and that Union takes place by the filling of the Holy Ghost everybody in agreement not by religion not because you go to a message Church you only come back in contact with an Eden relationship by the true Holy Ghost so now it's by spirit that we're joined together in this Union no other way to be in Oneness with God there is no other way you can try the ways you can try works you can try mental discipline you can try vows the Catholic Church makes vows of poverty the Catholic church has pennants they're the first one who begin to develop ways to try to get in relationship with God through works you do pennants uh you do you you you pray the rosary you take vows of poverty and that's why Luther was so distraught because he tried all of his life to do this he was if you watch the movie or study of his life you become distraught uh Mother Teresa was the same way if you watch or die read her diaries now this is available this is a woman that actually died without peace and without settled in God and she's a hero as far as what she did in India in places with how she served and all of her life she served as that was the way her entrance and relations with God but if you read her Diaries she's a she's a dying woman and she's a woman who never ever felt satisfied and made contact with God now I'm not putting her out of Heaven I wouldn't do that I don't have a right to do that but what I'm saying to you is that you can do all the works and be a hero in good works and still not come back to that relationship of Eden there's only one way that it comes the true Holy Spirit his nature comes in your nature your old nature dies and now he's living on the inside it's the only way back it's not psychology it's not through ten steps to getting better it's not through any of that now I believe that there are certain things that can help people I'm different than some preachers that I believe that you there's certain things that help people I'm not against anything that helps somebody whether it's a physical doctor or an emotional doctor I'm not against it because with the end of the day if they help a person if they help a young boy a young girl they help you in some way to help you through things if some medicines help you I'm not against that because at the end of the day I'm going to give the glory to God but I'm not going to accuse somebody and be against doctors and psychologists that would help somebody and if it's about a new birth it's about relationship can you say Amen and religion is a far cry from relationship religion is a far cry from relationship it's it's not that I love God I talk to God he's done miracles for me it's by the experience of the Holy Ghost coming into you by nature and changing your nature the only way to love and to live his word is through the Holy Ghost because the other way is miserable you try to take the principles of God and the principles of this message and you try to live them without the Holy Ghost that's a miserable life you think the guy out in the bar is living a miserable life no it's more miserable to try to live this word without the nature of the spirit that's why people exit they leave the message whatever because they've been trying so hard trying I'm trying to do this right I'm trying to do this right and yet if you haven't asked deeply enough the Lord I forget what all I have to do I'm going to have one prayer I'm going to stay here and keep seeking what I need by the Holy Ghost until you change me Lord you're going to be like Jacob with that angel can you say Amen I'm not letting you go until you change me that's the prayer that you need and I'm not speaking to everybody in that I know some of you have the Holy Spirit in your life and you'll see the evidence of that by obeying you know saying Amen to the word of God you'll see the fruit of it but I'm challenging you this morning not to make you afraid of it but I'm challenging you don't try to get back in a relationship with God by just nodding at the word or just going to Brother Paul's church I won't let you be deceived like that go before God and say God give me what I need to change my nature give my children what they need and quit playing all these games to justify him I'm not justifying my children I love them I will never not accept them but at the same time they need what I got at 16 years old they need a personal relationship with Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost they need a new birth so I'm encourage you to seek It Whatever age you are here this morning because religion is not relationship it's a miserable life to try to live this without the nature of God within you as I said we have been restored to this type of Oneness again all believers with the true Holy Spirit in them here's here's one that you can remember this week how many is a Believer this morning all believers with this true holy ghost in them have in their soul have fully been restored Back to Eden in a soul level I'm now in a soul level you still got this flesh to bring under subjection but in their soul you're not working your way back to Eden if you've got the Holy Ghost you're already back to Eden already because you're already in fellowship with him sin has been removed from the your nature the nature of sin the conscience of sin has been removed at the control tower and now the nature of God is there and that's how you have True Fellowship and relationship with him can you say Amen you are already back to Eden you've already arrived back at that relationship already you're not working your way back you're back that's powerful I could preach on that little wow you can become a new creation inside the nature and consciousness of sin is dead but we are similar with the man and the woman just before the fall as I refer back to it again they were one with God and one with one another but they were in two different vessels right now we don't have our full Restoration in our body yet we live in a world that judges people by what they see in the flesh I read something this morning and some writer said he said he said what a world we live in he says now we're I'm going to get to the word honor here in a minute honor do we live in a world where they honor the poor we honor the rich the rich people get on or whether they deserve it or not just because they're rich they wear the right clothes do we honor the people that are unpopular in this world no we honor the movie stars we honor the sports stars we lift them up and praise them and a lot of them most of them are just frankly dirty living people so 6 000 years of this of judging according to the flesh judging according how much money we don't honor the poor but I can tell you that the Bible says as we come into the New Testament Paul speaks about the body of Christ and you know what he says he says the one that's in the body of Christ that's dishonor or least likely to succeed or the least Among Us that's the one that we should be honoring the world doesn't function that way that's the one we should honor the one that doesn't have the money doesn't have the prestige doesn't have the right clothes doesn't have very much money even when I make a mistake and ask forgiveness because I'm on the path headed towards him God's obligated to me friends God's obligated to you you're following that word and walking in the path of Duty not out here dabbling in the things of the world and going the opposite direction when you know what the word says to do God's not obligated to you're losing your protection that's why sometimes people they dabble and we're only things privately and think it's not going to affect them it's not going to affect their family so they're doing it privately thinking this is my own deal I can do my own thing no you watch things happen in your family unconsciously because you're not in the path of Duty you're not following him and you watch that start to unravel in your children and and it passes it on to other Generations you think you're just yourself no things pass on to your children you got rebellion in there and you haven't overcome it then then watch the path of the children not always in every situation but these things trickle down and so you can't privately hold something that you know is against this word you know it and you're you're going to privately go the opposite direction you're going to feel the fruits come from that you're going to start seeing fruits come from that it's better you own up to it yourself I don't know where my children are but I got to get myself straightened out here come on parents let me hear you say Amen amen you can blame your children you can blame the preacher you can bring the church you can blame everybody else but you need to be singing It's a me it's a me it's a Me O Lord standing in the need of prayer because if you start with that I believe God will start to you honor God honor his word honor his servants then you'll watch that sometimes it takes years you'll watch that honor begin to trickle down to your children it's you had it's not just you believing the word but you're heading in its direction not the opposite direction not Rebellion not I'm not going to do that I'm going to feed and taste on these things privately When The War the word warns you and you know what's wrong with the word while you're on the word Journey he is obligated to you to protect you to forgive you but if you're going in the other direction you lose relationship with God God is not obligated to you now here's some points from the text in Genesis 2. they were one in spirit and God called their name Adam okay second then God breathed into a vessel in Genesis 2 verse 7 and the Lord formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life The Man became a living Soul so now he becomes a vessel he was Spirit man first with Adam and Eve inside him now he's a flesh man with one vessel but the spirit is all one with masculine and feminine inside of it still all right so then then God comes down and says in Genesis 2 he still called Adam then he says it's not good for a man to be alone I'll make him a help mate right and then he he then God causes of sleep to come on Adam and he takes the rib out he takes as many ministers have said I don't mean to repeat but it's a good thing to repeat you know he didn't take apart out of Adam's foot to make the woman or the brain can you say Amen but something right real close to his heart did you ever notice they took that Spear and pierced right up there under Jesus and water and blood came out because the spirit in that was going to come back on the day of Pentecost this would be the second Eve coming back that's one with the second Adam by what by spirit took that rib right something very close to his heart and he forms this beautiful beautiful feminine part in a different vessel look different even acted different and a few weeks ago I went into the differences and and I'm not going to get into that day today again but you just I the Lord keeps bringing me back to this this this situation or this Oneness just before the fall because it's close to us and that we deal with different vessels with different personalities and different backgrounds and we can judge people based upon fleshly things and miss that we are one I want you to notice the surprise the honor the respect the praise the love the word honor in Hebrew is surprising it is the word kavad which is the word for Glory it means to be weighty in one respect that is bearing a burden of a weighty issue Glory the word kavad also means to be important we are to always recognize the importance in this Rabbi refers to the word honor it's throughout the Bible but it has a it's a deeper meaning than what we think and he refers to the children should honor their father and mother it's one of the Commandments and even in that he says we are to always recognize listen to this now we are to always recognize the importance of our parents no matter how good or bad they are they have a connection to us and we recognize they're important to us so when God used honor for honoring parents under our fallen condition that means they won't do everything perfect but we never ever dishonor them even though they've acted imperfect dishonor is never should never be tolerated it should never be justified in the body of Christ among preachers in your marriage disrespect and dishonor should never be justified in a Christian home speaking words of Dishonor speaking words of belittling I've even heard some cussing out their kids and they go to church I'm sorry it doesn't work that way in the kingdom of God honor should be there always no matter how you feel about their flesh no matter how much they may irritating you no matter how he's saying this Rabbi is saying that that honor your father and mother you may not feel like you love them sometimes because the love is not being in many parents many situations many of you come from and sometimes our own parents you don't feel loved you were abandoned there's a lot of broken situations but you see now God says honor doesn't change you don't have to tolerate if they're abusing you have to tolerate that but you should always retain it so if that's true in the word honor then we have this coming from Adam to the first time you see and says why such surprise such honor and even honor weighty glory even in that it it it it has a deeper word like you're in awe and I believe Adam was in awe and it expressed there's something about when you have it all about something and you you look at something that you honor and respect and this is important and this is supreme they see it in your eyes I think Eve seen it in Adam's eyes the surprise the honor the respect you are bone of my bone you're flesh to my flesh you're part of me more information please please contact us by visiting our website literallife.church and if you would like to come and visit us in person consider this your personal
