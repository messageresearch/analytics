hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literallife.church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today [Music] thank you [Music] for anyone who's ever seen the mountains of their sins just disappear [Music] for anyone who's ever felt the hand of having reached down through their fears and dry their tears foreign [Music] from Victory songs then you'll understand the reason for the way the saints of God will carry on shouting from a heart that's been washed [Music] so crazy but there's just no telling what he's gonna do Jesus [Music] [Music] for anyone who knows to have a future and a hope beyond the grace every Life's a different story how he brought us out of Darkness into Hallelujah there's no way [Applause] s [Music] so crazy things [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] come on and testify tonight oh despite [Applause] oh my past my past erased my name he changed let's testify race [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] in that moment [Applause] from the heart is [Music] [Applause] tonight [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] mind and having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing that's not how we respond is that they were evil to me so I'm going to respond with the same thing they deserve it but contrary wise blessing knowing that did he just say that we respond with the blessing to somebody being evil to us yes he did not many amens on that one but yes he did that's what he said that's how we respond contrary wise a blessing knowing that ye are there in two called so this is a calling as a Christian did you know as a Christian it's not just being a Christian that you're called to what the scripture says you're called to that this is a calling the rest of the world doesn't have a calling you have a calling you also have a calling to take this gospel into the whole world you have a calling to be a witness can you say Amen you don't live in your own little your own little world but we're called to be witnesses to everybody and so we're called to this type of Life of responding and blessing instead of evil for evil that ye should inherit a blessing verse 10 for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile let him issue evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it and this series is called the bride's more excellent way because Paul introduced something greater than the gifts and all these other things something better a more excellent way and I'm preaching that more excellent Way To You Paul introduced it to the church back in First Corinthians 13 and so I'm going to hold up more of the attributes of the image of Christ First Corinthians 13 just to bring you into the channel that we've been speaking of First Corinthians 13 in your Bible to me is a window it's a window into the deepest place a Christian can enter First Corinthians 13 is the deepest place that a Christian can enter in their Christian wall it is deeper than all the other manifestations of the spirit and what it does it's deeper than all the other manifestations of the spirit in the church and what it does what he presents is the more excellent way is beyond faith how many believe that we preach Faith how many believe that just stay back at the other screen we preach faith and we believe in faith how many believe that you can have faith to move mountains how many believe God can raise the Dead how many believe there's enough faith in this word that come that the blind eyes can be open cancer can be healed God is nothing impossible with God and we need perfect faith we need Faith to do that so we're not dumping out Faith how many believe that's important for us to read our Bible and to get knowledge of the word of course it is how many believe it's important important just to have knowledge read the word but to ask God to give you Revelation the word because reading is is one thing but Revelation is another of the word Jesus talked about Revelation the disciples asked him why do you speak in Parables why do you speak in Parables why don't you just come out plainly he said because it's given to you disciples to know the Mysteries Behind The Parables but it's not given to some and so I speak in Parables to draw the attention but if we'll ask God he'll give you the meaning for the parable and you'll understand the word can you say Amen so we believe in knowledge we believe in reading our Bibles we should do that we believe in faith but what Paul introduces here is deeper than the manifestations of the spirit deeper than the gifts it's beyond faith it's beyond knowledge it's beyond good works this is something for a Christian Beyond good works and how many believe we should do good works of course we should that's part of our Christian Journey as well we should do good things we should give to the poor but when he says though I give my body to be burned and give all my goods to feed the poor and have not charity I am nothing this more excellent way has to be our pursuit or all the good works that we do mean nothing so we can't pursue those things and a lot of those things sometimes feel better is to give to the poor you feel good about yourself it feels good when you're Anointed with some type of gift to the spirit you know all it's it's some it's it's it feels good but yeah listen Paul says you can have all that and not have Divine love and sometimes when you preach on Divine love what I'm going to do today it doesn't feel very good let me just warn you when I get into the traits today it's not going to feel very good because most of us most of us are going to leave the service today saying Lord I I need help can you say man I need help but nevertheless it feels better to give to the poor it feels good when you rise to a faith and pray for somebody lay hands and they're healed of cancer that feels better and God will continue to do those things but we if we ignore in our Christian walk this more excellent way we are a troubling person because we're ignoring the most excellent way and the the better thing for the Christian to pursue and so it's beyond faith it's beyond knowledge it's beyond good works it's beyond of what true Christianity has always produced for 2000 years it's this this love is greater than hope it's greater than Faith Can you say Amen let me ask you this this morning if we are in the end time and if we are on the finishing the Capstone of God's work in a people for two thousand years Christianity started 2 000 years ago and so now God has been in this work to take out a people for his namesake to take out a people to to bring them to a a culmination to a Capstone if we are in that finishing Capstone work on God's people then shouldn't we be entering into the best expression of who he is at these Final hours I'm asking shouldn't this be the time that we enter the final Capstone and the final expression of who Jesus is in a people and if Paul opened to us the more excellent way shouldn't this be our desperation more than any other thing that this be our expression as a Christian that this be if Paul opened it up to us shouldn't this be our desperation more than anything I think it's a good question shouldn't this be our Pursuit more than possessions more than careers more than School more than education don't dump any of that out but there's a Pursuit more than more than that that fishing boat that your brothers want more than that new address that new outfit your sisters want and you're you're given hints to your husband the next few weeks more than any other Pursuit this as a Christian should be Lord I got this lane from me God this is the final age is the final time God let the people see this Divine love in my life but you see that's the pursuit it is the more excellent way that a Christian will live We tend to fall back on our known our ways that are known to us of gifts in the church and knowledge in the church and good works we tend to fall back on that but this is a whole other thing altogether and it's also I've been preaching to you that this Divine love is not just a giving to the poor this Divine love is not a human effort it doesn't originate in us as humans it doesn't originate in our minds this don't try to mechanically put this on this morning this Divine love only comes through one source and that's the Holy Ghost himself living in the soul there's a lot of groups of people a lot of churches let me just say it this way and I think I said this when I started the church in Toledo 30 33 34 years ago I kept saying this because I was looking up in the phone book and I I was saying there's like seven or eight pages of churches well on one side you could say praise the Lord you know there's Christian churches that are preaching but then I thought as the Lord began to show me that that God wants something more than just more churches God's not looking for another church to start he's looking for a bride and then I was wondering where the statement holy Toledo came from holy toledo and I found out I researched and I found out that Toledo had more churches per capita than any other city I don't know if it's the same but at that time 30 years 30 years ago Toledo had more churches per capita than any other city in the United States and that's where the term came from holy toledo but I've lived here for 33 years and Toledo is not holy it's not holy there's there's a lot of Unholy things that happen every night every day and so you can't so how you have to be honest and say if you have more churches doesn't guarantee you have more holy people if you have more churches that are using the Bible even praise the Lord we thank God for that but we have to have a result that God is calling a people for his namesake he's not calling another church he's not calling people to religion but he's calling a bride to Mary in this last days how many want to be a part of that bride finally all of you be like-minded United in spirit sympathetic brotherly kind-hearted courteous and compassionate towards each other as members of one household he say no there's a lot of households here no really you got your household but you're when you become a member of the body of Christ you're a member of One household the body of Christ so now that's why we treat each other because this is brothers and sisters this isn't just some uh Alien that's sitting next to you here this morning maybe you might treat him like an alien I don't need that person I don't need to shake their hand I don't it makes me uncomfortable shaking hands I just want to come if you want to come for a while and you don't want to just talk to anybody then you you should come and sit on the front seat and then you'll be undistracted by people and you just look at me you're welcome to do that now you don't have to sit in the front seat you say whatever you want but listen now people kind of get this way but you you if you're born into by a new birth into Christ you're born into a household you're born into a body so just like at home when you got a household with all different brothers and sisters and kids uh young or old and it doesn't matter you're a household so now we see every day what it takes to make a household rung and I'll tell you you're not going to have a good household without without courteous compassionate forgiving kind-hearted brotherly if you if you violate those things what kind of home are you going to have so if it works in a you know it has to ask you have to have certain boundaries of respect you have to have certain things you have to love one another when somebody is unlovable you have to repent you have to talk it out if you want a functioning household well that works the same in the household because he says be sympathetic be brotherly kind-hearted courteous and compassionate towards each other as members of one household and humble in spirit and never return evil for evil or an insult for an insult avoiding scolding avoiding scolding berating and any kind of abuse it's interesting that abuse any kind of abuse but it's interesting abuse is used with something you're saying it's your words it's when you're scolding you're using your tongue your words when you're berating you're using your tongue your words can you say Amen so those when he says the abuse today abuse abuse is not just physical abuse there are many forms of abuse and verbal abuse is one of them so in our words we got to bring our tongue under subjection to those that we're supposed to be honoring and it has to express itself in being courteous and compassionate even when we disagree now some of you might have households where you you you agree on everything and everybody's laughing you know if you do meet me in the office because I'd like to ask some questions what you're doing right all right but listen so we don't agree on everything but when we disagree you don't have any right as a Christian to go the direction of abuse verbally just because you disagree and just because somebody's not doing what you want to do want them to do can you say Amen so so berating any kind of abuse I'd like to talk more on that because we have way too much abuse going on today even sometimes in Christian homes and because because people don't know what abuse is they don't know what they're doing they've developed habits over time habits in their home that they come from and they just do it because they think it's normal and it just passes on from generation to generation what your household was normal this is the way we did it so you just start abusing you start lashing out whatever comes from your past home and but as a Christian God stand still and say now wait a minute I'm the one by the grace of God would like to break the cycle of homes being in such a disarray giving it a normal status that it's normal to just scold somebody and walk away and never repent of it I need to know Lord help me because you're presenting to me a what a Christian home is and a Christian Body of Christ this is the way we should function if you want to leave today and ignore just this scripture and say nobody can live like that you go right ahead but for a Believer he's saying Lord I don't have all that yet but it's your word and the word does not come in just word only but power and demonstration and I want to see the Holy Ghost bring a demonstration of this word in my life avoid scolding berating in any kind of abuse but on Con on the contrary give a blessing pray for one another's well-being contentment and protection for you have been called for this very purpose this isn't just an instruction that you intellectually okay I'm going to go home and do this this is a calling you've been called by God to this you ever hear of somebody running from a calling a minister can run from years from a calling and he feels this urgency in the inside something's there I don't know what it is and and but they can run from a calling and usually the one that's running has the calling and you're never going to get away from it if God's called you you can fight for 10 20 years but if it's a calling he's called you to you're going to have to address that someday and unbelievers don't care about this but Believers you have a calling to live this way and to treat people this way and from the pastor down to the Pew from the pastor to the janitor whoever it is this is our calling for you have been called for this very purpose that you might inherit a blessing from God that brings well-being happiness and protection so love one of them today is love is not rude and the second one is love is not self-seeking this is in First Corinthians love is never rude Love Is Never self-seeking because it's not about you right lane it's not about you it's about Christ so love is not rude and love is not self-seeking both of these are complete opposite both of these tied together because they're the complete opposite of a self-centered person God's love is never selfish and never self-centered can I say it again you'll never find in the true genuine love of God self-centeredness or selfishness you can't find it in the love of God so if you still have some of that then it's not coming from the the Divine love that's in the Holy Ghost it's not coming from that it's coming from something else and it's hard to move into a life of divine love when you have self-centeredness or selfishness so now we're going to go into the first one which is love is not rude so First Corinthians 13 5 says does not behave itself unseemly that's the way it's worded in First Corinthians but it means love is not misbehaving love is not behaving it's about behavior when you're acting rude to somebody you're you're treating that person bad you're more about yourself than their feelings and it's about Behavior does not behave itself unseemly which means it doesn't love does not behave itself dishonorably or improperly Divine love of God is not rude to someone else Divine love of God is not rude to someone else it is not dishonorable it doesn't dishonor it's not behaving improperly and I'll add Titus 3 2 in the ESV to speak evil of no one to avoid quarreling to be gentle and to show perfect courtesy toward all people and so now love does love does not needlessly offend love has good manners love is courteous it is polite it is sensitive to the feelings of others and always uses tact the reason we are not courteous of course is that we are thinking only of ourselves and not of others not honoring the other person and so now this is bringing us into saying Lord help us this morning because every person has a right of my honor as we preached a few months ago every person I owe the love of God to every person I owe it I'm in debt to every person that's what the Bible says you owe somebody say well they I they don't owe me nothing and I don't owe them nothing you can't say that as a Christian you stay over there I stay over here I don't owe you anything it's not true if you have the love of God you owe them you're in death you owe everybody the love of God you're in debt to them because God gave it to you and it's not just for yourself can you imagine now I've got the love of God for myself but it becomes selfish with the love of God there's no selfishness in the love of God there is no holding back in the love of God so then this description of Love In First Corinthians 13 includes a list of what love is not and love is not rude we read that love is not rude in verse 5 love then has good manners the Greek phrase could literally be translated does not act unbecomingly that's why it says does not behave itself unseemly because in the Greek it says love does not act unbecomingly or does not act inappropriately notice it's not what you're thinking it's how you're acting this isn't about what you're thinking because you could say do you love them and you say your mind saying yeah I love them it's not how you think it's not your words but it's your behavior and your words that are expressed to say whether you love them or not love has honor love has respect love has a tolerance not for something off the word but it has a tolerance for that person's growth may God help us may God help me to have a tolerance for persons growth in the Lord and where they're at our attitude has to show something in our behavior that love cannot ever be rude to someone no matter what state they're in and no matter how rude they're treating you the Greek phrases does not act Unbecoming it doesn't act inappropriately Christian love does not seek to cause problems or it does not belittle others Christian love involves choosing appropriate actions and responses that help other people rudeness is finding more and more Acceptance in today's culture I'm reading from a writer now a few things on rudeness and I agree with this completely rudeness is finding more and more Acceptance in today's culture things have changed in the last 10 20 years in rudeness people are becoming more rude stay at a light too long texting and you find out how rude we get rudeness is more and more accepted today and become normal but it's not normal in God's Kingdom love is not rude and love is not self-seeking seeketh not her own Philippians 2 3 that's how it's word in the Bible seeketh not her own love is not self-seeking Philippians 2 3 and they have I do nothing do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit through factional motives or Strife but with an attitude of humility being neither arrogant nor self-righteous regard others as more important than yourselves can you say Amen it is not it is not selfish does not demand its rights one writer says the secret of every Discord in Christian homes communities and churches is that we seek our own way excuse me the secret to every Discord in Christian homes communities and churches is that we seek our own way and our own Glory rch Lesinski put it this way if you cure selfishness you plant a garden of Eden thank you for watching our message today if you
