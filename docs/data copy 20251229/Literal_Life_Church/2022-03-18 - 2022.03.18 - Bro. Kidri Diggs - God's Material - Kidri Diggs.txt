========================================

bibles let's turn to um second corinthians chapter three ii corinthians chapter three i'm kind of backtracked second corinthians chapter three uh let's let's let's start reading that verse 17. the bible says now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord i mean let's go to um saint john chapter one saint john chapter one familiar verse of scriptures let's start reading that uh um i started verse 11. the bible says he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name hallelujah but look look look at the way this thing is made next verse which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen may the lord bless you know his word you can have your seats and as we're as we're in john you know if we flip over to john chapter four i just want to hit a highlight a verse of scripture out of here john chapter four verse 24. the bible says god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth hallelujah god is a what spirit but did it but then the bible said god became flesh you know this this is where the theologians get mixed up because they'll say well how can god be flesh if he's a spirit he put his spirit in flesh hallelujah in the night church by god's grace we want to use for a subject god's material amen god's material before i go there let's let's let's um read revelations chapter one revelations chapter one i'm just hitting these scriptures and we're going to go as god lead tonight revelations chapter 1 verse 8 oh my god now does everybody bible verse 8 does your bible read read right there is it in red letters so this is not john talking this is not a prophet talking this is god almighty talking now look at his material hallelujah he says i am alpha and omega hallelujah look at what god is made of the beginning and the end he says i'm alpha and omega the beginning and the end sayeth the lord said who nobody can change that no matter what you go through no matter how many problems you might have if he's in your life he's alpha and omega hallelujah he's the beginning and the end and you know the scripture says if god starts a thing that he's obligated to finish it so if he's your beginning he has to be your end hallelujah and we have scripture amen we have promises we have promises that says i come from god so i'm going back to god hallelujah we're talking about the material of god now look church this is what catches me about this verse of scripture now now the verses i just read you in corinthians it talks about beholding god's face from glory to glory and then over here in in saint john 1 it talks about hallelujah for those of us who can receive god hallelujah there's something in us that gives us power to become hungry power to become the sons and daughters of god so when it comes to god there's something about him that changes us into what he wants us to be hallelujah in church i want you to believe that what god has been doing from generation to generation what he's been doing is changing his people back into his material who we're not just flesh and blood flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of god [Applause] so what has god been doing all this time he's been trying to get us to walk back in the spirit hallelujah because in the spirit he is alpha and omega he's the beginning in the end put that back up for me hardly but this is what i like he says i'm alpha and omega the beginning and the end says the lord which is he's god alpha right now now i'm going to shake you up a little bit for him to be god right now it don't take a special meeting they don't take a fasting and a praying it don't take some special preachers to come from out of town hallelujah he's god right now why because he's the god that which is and which was oh my so whether you want to believe it or not he always was whatever you need hello he's the god which is and which was and which is to come hallelujah church i want to lift up the almighty one tonight because i think we get so tested and so so over charged with trying to live down here in this world we forget who we're serving we're not serving some buddha or some allah we're serving the original we're serving a god with a testimony for generations over 2 000 years that he has risen and it's been proven that he has risen you say brothers how you how you gonna say it's been proven because i know he's in me i'm not what i used to be hallelujah oh my i feel my helper coming on church look when we think of god we have to understand holly that god is way bigger than the picture before our eyes hallelujah the the the scripture says hallelujah that he's greater he's bigger than whatever you can ask or think so whatever you're praying about whatever you're asking god for he's much more bigger than that however but when i figured i started thinking about this thought when i was in a hotel room thinking about god's material and thinking about what god what is god made of hallelujah now church what i'm going to talk about tonight it's not something that you could grasp in your flesh holy the revelation of jesus christ is something spiritual hardly and for you to grasp the material of god you got to see him for who he is and he's not weak he's not wishy-washy he's not a promise breaker holy everything about god is truth so whatever he said in his bible it has to come to pass church that's the material we're dealing with we're dealing with truth tonight we're not dealing with a god who's ever failed hallelujah he's never failed he's never failed no matter how big the situation was he's the god that he is and was and which is to come almighty but for you to kind of catch where i'm going i got to talk about some carnal things for a second because it's a challenge for some of you to just believe god for who he is because you got things in the natural realm that's messing with you listen listen what the what the prophet of god says i'm gonna read you some stuff i ain't gonna be too long on this but i just want you to be able to catch this listen now the prophet of god he says everything in the natural hallelujah is a type of what's going on in the spirit can we agree with that and we know how when he preached the message countdown he was showing that in each transition that things would happen naturally on the earth something spiritual was taking place he talked about the horse and buggy and then he talked about the car did he talk about the airplane then he talked about the astronaut age hallelujah and each one of those different natural manifestations was a type of what was going on spiritual now the greatest the greatest challenge that we've been fighting for maybe the past two years is something called covey but i want you to understand that there's a spiritual application behind clothes and i don't want you to fear this thing no more hell yeah it's only been here to magnify how great god is and you know what else covey did holly covet what it did is it's brought a fear all over the world fearing people's life fearing people's church harley and that's just a natural perversion of what really should be taking place the church shouldn't be fearing the church should be walking in the strength and power of god why because we have a god that doesn't change [Applause] church the prophet of god said for you to know god is you must first realize who he was holy so i'm saying to you that god even in this covenant era god was always a healer [Applause] always but what's happened is the spiritual mutation of the of the sickness of covet has overpowered our minds mutation holy let's look at it church mutation put that put that up for me brothers if you got that mutation explained listen look at what it says a mutation occurs when a dna gene is damaged or changed in such a way as to alter the genetic what look at the mutation of covet the whole reason is running all over the world like this and so it could alter the genetic message carried by the gene there is a genetic gene seed message in this bride that satan is trying to alter by something called sickness [Music] oh we're gonna snatch all the power away from it tonight we're gonna fear it no more we're gonna come back to that but let's just let's just let's just expose kobe for a second holly let me say it like this covet the sickness of covet the symptoms of covet have always been here it's always been here you say brother it just happened in 2020. no because if it was something new that would make the devil a creator and the only one i can create is the one who which was and is and is to come i am alpha and omega i am the beginning and the end he is the only one that holds the power of creation [Applause] so for doctors or anyone else to pronounce a sickness on the scene on the whole world it has to have already been here before and i know some of y'all gonna try to get real deep with me you got you got your scientist stuff you read and all this all these other things you're reading well let's let's well i accept the challenge tonight brother tony let's just take some symptoms of coffee has anybody here ever had a cough been here for generations can i get amen his oh my let's take one of the most powerful symptoms of kovic has anyone ever had a fever it's been here forever they say but brother digs the the effects of covet it does so many other stuff has have you ever heard of something called the flu it's been here forever and what you fail to realize what you fail to realize over 60 000 people die a year because of the flu and vaccinations is nothing new people have been getting a flu shot for years hardly and when they take the flu shot they still end up getting what the flu talk to me church am i making this stuff up or have we been experiencing this for years so what's making kovis so strong what's making it so strong we make it what it is because the flu has been here for generations coughing and sneezing and and dry throat and running eyes and oh my but what about this one brother jesus covet makes it hard to believe some people had fluid and they lost been here forever called pneumonia ever heard of that one so all the symptoms that they make up of covet have already been here but what's happened the sickness was mutating sherry what it was doing it was changing its form to seem like something it wasn't but what it is it changed its form into a cough but it was really just a regular coal it changed its form to the flu but it was really just a cough it didn't become any greater hallelujah it's still the same thing because satan can't create but what makes it strong is our confession [Applause] our confession makes sickness what it is earlier you could wake up in the morning and you can say oh i ain't feeling too good you better believe the rest of the day you ain't gonna feel too good because you just spoke that thing over yourself don't you realize hallelujah and we we might talk about some of this sunday hallelujah but don't you realize you have the power to create [Applause] and satan knows that so he wants your confession to be negative because whatever you say will take place [Applause] he knows who your father is he knows your genetic makeup how does he know that because god is protecting you you can't go through anything that god doesn't allow you can't get a cold you can't get a sneeze you can't get a fever you can't get a cough you can't get a high blood pressure you can't get none of it unless god said okay it's time for the trial he allows it why so that he can change masks so that he can step into another area of your life and still show that he's the god who which was and is and is to come right now so as satan mutates and changes his form god does the same thing hallelujah he comes and changes his form into sickness and god changes his form to healing hallelujah he comes and changes his form hallelujah to bondage and god changes his form to deliverance here satan comes and he changes his form to sadness and god changes his form to joy [Applause] oh yeah that's what his material is but look at it put it back up there look his whole job what these things are all about is hallelujah a mutation occurs when a dna gene is damaged sure how many message believers have left this church because they were damaged hardly they said oh the preacher did this so-and-so didn't shake my hand this and that and all these things damaged hardly that didn't mean that it wasn't gene but they let their hurts and their pains change their genetic message and now they're going to go through things that they wouldn't necessarily have to go through if they would have fought through that hurt if they would have fought through that pain because the trial does not change the life of the seed look carried a genetic message carried by that gene so i want you to understand church that we already have a genetic message inside of us i'm about to blow your socks off brother branham didn't bring it to us he was already there he was already there god used him as a masterpiece hallelujah to warm it up he said a mutagen is is an agent of a substance that can bring about a permanent alteration to the physical compulsive composition of a dna gene such that the genetic message is changed so when you come to church and you get hurt and you carry that stuff and carry that what is satan doing he's changing your genetics he's changing the way you worship he's changing the way you pray he's changing hallelujah your spiritual hallelujah walk with god all by some hurts a little bit of damage a little bit of unconfessed sins all these things happen because what is satan doing he's trying to get you not to believe in your message and we thought the message was books and tapes no clearly right here is saying it's a life hallelujah clearly the message is a life clearly your dna your gc makeup deals with a life and if satan can get you to alter that he can defeat you so what does he do he mutates he makes himself to be something that he's really not but he is i'm finished talking about him but let's wrap him up real quick brilliant what do you mean ain't no power in a cold ain't no power in cancer ain't no power and diabetes ain't no power in her blood ain't no power in back spasms hallelujah the only power the enemy got is what we surrender to by altering the message of god and if you don't let satan alter the message you'll walk out in power tonight he said brothers what message are you talking about i'm talking about the revelation of jesus christ that is the message don't you realize that that's all brother brother was talking about hallelujah oh the whole business was surrounded around what the revelation of jesus christ and satan knows if he can alter that hallelujah he can make you walk out on your promises oh my but listen we always hear about dna and connecting it with the blood and the gene and all these things and by no by by no means am i a doctor or any way in that field but i know one so i'm not going to talk to you tonight about the the the the makeup of dna no we're going to talk about tonight what dna does holly how many believe you've got the dna of god so we're going to talk about what that dna is to you holly what that dna should be doing in you and don't get nervous i'm about to close but i hope you catch it hallelujah give me the next part listen what does dna do dna contains the instructions needed for an organism to develop so if you got the dna of god in you there's something in you that gives you instructions to develop into what god [Applause] there's something in you holy whether you like it or not it's giving you power like the book of john said power to become something what is it doing it's changing us from glory to glory what's doing it the dna of god whereby tell me what dna is i can't i'm telling you what it does so if you believe you got the gene of god in you let's look at it what does it do it contains the instructions needed for an organism to develop develop is the first part and what do we say when we explain mutation mutation deals with a genetic message so hallelujah as god changes and he mutates in your life what is he doing he's giving instructions for us to what develop but not only develop hallelujah what does he want us to do he want us to survive hallelujah here we are two years later still serving god still having meetings still rejoicing in the spirit we survived in church how do we survive by god's dna hallelujah survive and reproduce why to carry these functions hallelujah what is it all about we're supposed to be carrying god to the next place hallelujah the development of god the survival of god hallelujah the reproduction of god holy now we're talking about god's material hallelujah look church dna sequences must be converted into what you mean to tell me i had a message in me before the foundation of the world gideon it was in my dna hallelujah brother told me it was in my dna even when i was a sinner out in the world i had a message in me let me give you young people something hallelujah when you were born you were born with a message in you oh we're gonna make the devil mad now before you got the holy ghost you had a message in you [Applause] they say these sequences must be converted into messages that can be used to produce protein now we like to work out holiday and everybody knows your muscles are never never developed without protein so what am i saying brothers what are you saying tonight that the message of the hour is our spiritual protest the more we eat the stronger we get hallelujah to carry out hallelujah what god wants us to do amen see you can exercise and exercise and your body will just flop but if you exercise and put protein in it you'll become a leaning muscle machine we don't want to just drop weight no we want to drop weight and strength bill [Applause] see a lot of people have just hooked on to ah i got the message i got a nice diet i got a good diet yeah a diet is all right but you got to have the right things in your diet because some people have diets they can't keep up which is only wishful thinking but the best kind of diet is a reality diet see my diet still has a little bit of chocolate cake in it just not more than what it used to holly still has a little bit of barbecue chicken in it see i'm a realist let's put scripture hallelujah sister let's put the scripture in the proper order the bible says be sober be vigilant what does sober mean sober means to understand what you're doing and some people got so drunk i got revelation i got regular god over the seal i got revelations rambling first trial pune they gone because they didn't have no endurance for the child they was eating good but they wasn't processing the whole thing oh my look be converted into messages that can be used to produce protein which are the complex molecules that do the most of the work in your body so what am i saying all this good preaching y'all good all this good preaching look it's not them it's not me it's not none of us what's producing it that good word you get it's the word that's turning you into what you're supposed to be the prophet of god said what the message of the hour has been doing all this time it has been positionally placing the bride of christ and what has happened to a lot of people through the battle they've got hurting and damage and they allow satan to genetically alter their message but if we got god's dna in us hallelujah we got overcoming power we got some serious material oh my listen oh my let's look at god's makeup for a second now the bible says that god is a spirit now let's watch god mutate we know how satan mutated we'll just take cover and see all the different things that he mutated let's let god mutate for a second are you with me when god when he first stepped on the scene he wasn't even god he was just eternal so the makeup of god is eternal so if you've got god in you you are eternal there's nothing about you that can be extinct there's nothing about you that can come to an end why because the material of god is forever the blessings of god is forever the healing of god is forever the joy of god is forever why because his whole makeup his material starts with him being eternal and if you're here tonight and you're not safe all i got to say to you is i'm sorry for you because if a man was telling me i had something eternal in me that couldn't be extinct that would do something to me church we have an eternal joy no matter what satan throws at you it always has to mute back into mutate back into the character of god it always has to turn back into its original hallelujah creation it's original material hallelujah hallelujah and in the original state of god there was no wrong he was eternal and then god started to mutate and then hollywood the prophet of god said he was so high he couldn't go no higher i want you to understand the god i'm talking about if you got the holy ghost is in you anybody here got the holy ghost oh you got eternity in you you got eternity in you you got to hold let me see the holy ghost hand you got eternity in you you got eternity in you before there was ever a while you were eternal you were made of it you were made of material that cannot expire [Applause] whoa i feel light for it you know the prophet god said when the disciples was walking down the mayor's road and jesus had revealed himself to him he said they walked out of that light for it why because they had been in fellowship with jesus they problems had no more weight on them why because they heard from jesus jesus had shown himself who they were who he was he said all the prophets talked about me church one of god's material is he's eternal but then as god began to change his mask as he began to mutate he couldn't go higher so he started condescending he started coming down hallelujah god's not coming down hallelujah and as he came down from eternal next next next form he mutated into was elohim now he's self-existent hallelujah he's god all by himself where he came to tell the church tell all of us that he don't need no help hallelujah he don't need no help from theraflu he don't need no help from vaccinations he don't need no help from sugar pills insulin shots he's self-existence hallelujah hallelujah church but what i love about it as god mutated as he mutated into elohim he didn't leave eternity up there he brought that with him [Applause] can you imagine that church that your god he didn't leave any of his material back he kept bringing his material with as he mutated he took the eternal eternal part of him and he brought that to the next stage of his mutation so now he's he's a eternal oh my god he's the eternal elohim hallelujah self-existing one okay let's just take that word self-existent if you really serve him if you really get a revelation about who he is these problems these trials we go through wouldn't mean a thing eternal elohim and then church he kept mutating and then only the bible says i mean the prophet god said that he was just all by himself but then there were attributes inside of him that he wanted to come out so he had to allow certain things to happen so he could express himself early hallelujah see he didn't want to keep eternity to himself he wanted to share eternity whoa hallelujah god wanted to share eternity with us so he didn't just leave it up there all by himself he brought it down hallelujah it didn't turn hallelujah he wanted to show us how powerful he was just being self-existent there's no god like me in all the earth he brought that and he shared that with us but we weren't even there yet because he was just eternal and self-existent and then the prophet of god say hallelujah what made him god was when he created things to worship him he created the angels and the angels began to worship but that wasn't good enough for god god don't want to worship just out of duty so although he appreciated the angels worshiping holy holy holy lord god almighty holy holy lord god almighty god began to mutate again now he's god he's an object of worship but he wanted to make it more personal so you know what he did he let the logos come out of his mouth whoa hallelujah did he begin to create hallelujah all right he's mutating that church he comes from eternal he comes from elohim he comes from god and now the logos is coming out of his mouth he's creating what is he doing he say let there be and it was let there be and it was let there be and it was and the last thing he created out of the logos was what a man god brought eternity god brought his self-existing character god brought the object of worship and then he brought the logos all the way down to a man everything that he is all of his material he put it in what a man because you've seen all of this material reflected in who adam because in the garden of eden there was no death why because god was eternal holy adam didn't need nobody's help as hell why because god was elohim hallelujah and he did who do they worship they worship him why because he was the object and the only object alone and god took all of his characteristics mutated down put all of that in a man but what i want you to catch after he got to a man he never mutated again hallelujah after he got to you god never changed his form again [Applause] so on earth we are the highest form of god are you with me church on earth we are the highest form of god because after he created a man the bible says that god willing what took his rest so god was satisfied giving you all of his material everything that he is he put it in a man he put it in a woman all of his characteristics all of his uh his ability everything that makes up god he put it in a man and he said it was good i don't know about y'all but that make me want to shout you mean to tell me i can i can go into prayer as a god but you know too often because we got spiritual amnesia we get in the prayer we were like oh lord this sickness oh my arm hurting i got a headache oh they diagnosed me with grace disease okay and if you got the holy ghost all the material of god and just to show you how powerful the holy ghost is the prophet of god said when you got the holy ghost the holy ghost is the earnest of the resurrection hallelujah so if you got the holy ghost you already in heavenly places you're already destined for a rapture [Applause] hallelujah let me show you how big this is just think about it because i know i got to go to a natural realm because i think some of y'all missing how great god is you you looking at me like this what i'm talking about deserves more than a smirk on your face if you really catch it you will never be defeated again if you really catch that the character of god hallelujah the whole gene genetic makeup of god he put in his bride if you really catch that you'll walk up out here like a rooster in the barnyard walk around say look my yard around here you'll go home tonight for satan's been troubling you too much you can't get no sleep you got to take metatolin and all this stuff calm yourself this will be the last night you take it say don't you know i serve a god who promised me a rest who promised me peace you stop watching all them crazy tv shows you will be all right when you go to sleep i wonder why you're having nightmares because the foolishness you're watching on tv we think about the genetic makeup of god and all that he put in his creation it should do something for us it's like this you ever heard of warren buffett he's what a billionaire imagine him imagining one of his children going to a ferrari dealership and just got on regular clothes started to walk around and see the most expensive ferrari it is he tells the salesman i won't doubt and sells me judging by how you look don't even know who he is just looking at his outer appearance see our outer appearance we look like nothing but there's a hidden mystery behind us there's something behind us in the spirit that whole realm is paying attention when you walk in the room angels are looking at you when you walk in the room spirits are checking themselves making sure they still got rights or they'll be cast out making sure you don't confess because if you confess they got to go hallelujah can you imagine hallelujah buffett's son walking up in there saying i want a spot i want whatever kind of fire whatever it is i don't know i'm a maserati man which has a ferrari engine in it but anyway can you imagine he going in there and talking to the agent and the agent is judging him on his appearance does not know the material he's made out of does not know who his father is hallelujah if he knew who his father was he'd be careful what he said and when you get the holy spirit satan has to be careful how he approaches you because your father has power to bring judgment on him your father has power hallelujah to make him change zip codes when you really realize who your father is and the genetic makeup inside of you you handle yourself different [Applause] when i go to the doctor i tell the doctor what's going to happen you're going to examine me and you're going to give me a perfect bill of health and i walk out with that every time i ain't saying it don't be challenges sometimes i have to fight for it hallelujah but that's my confession hallelujah my confession is hallelujah i came in here ho and i'ma leave out of here ho why because jesus is my father i'm made out of material that's called victory we are made out of victorious material we're made out of persevering material we're made out of overcoming material don't you realize the bible says that jesus was tempted in all points all matters so as we were yet without sin what are you saying believe i'm saying the dna genetic makeup of god cannot be defeated [Applause] all the other says just give the man this id and sometimes they don't catch it at first but they start looking at that last man buff it buff it by any chance you ever heard of warren buffett yeah he's my dad oh mr buffett what can i get what what you want you want some coffee want something to drink anything you need see the whole demeanor changes why because that young man reminds them who he is and i want somebody tonight to remind the devil who you are and i guarantee you he will handle you different when you realize who you are but satan won't back up if you got amnesia but if you realize who you are it makes him take note of it hallelujah and that's been the problem we've been down here having church so long we're not even walking into our promises it's bigger than church it's bigger than church and god the last place he got was down to a man he brought all of that before i close listen you know man they try to make light of god's mutation and they called it evolution they gotta take it completely away from god and say well it was just a big bang i don't know about y'all but i've had conversation with atheists and i'll just be honest no offense it's a bunch of nonsense because this one particular guy i was talking to he says i just don't believe that there's some higher entity that controls the whole world and i said well you might as well get used to it because it's the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god he says well now i just uh your your testimony it has to be proven you know i have to see the paperwork of you having cancer and did i have to see the paperwork where you were uh cancer-free he forgot he was talking to somebody who knew who his father was he's looking for me to give him something naturally didn't i tell you god is a spirit hallelujah so he's asking for paperwork and i started showing him testimonies hallelujah i said you see this cut this is where they did a biopsy you see this cut this is where they need a shunt you see this cut this is where they took the majority of the cast out i said i don't need no paperwork i am the paperwork will you see me hallelujah you see the testimony of jesus christ when you see me you see the revelation of divine healing when you see me hallelujah you see deliverance when you see me you see the manifestation of isaiah 53 i don't need no paperwork [Applause] hallelujah church we don't need a bible to prove that it's real prove it by your life [Applause] you don't need a book and a tape to prove that it's real moving by your revelation [Applause] remember all that god mutated to he said hallelujah in john 12 and the word became flesh he put it all in us but what i want you to catch what god has been doing all this time with every trial with every tribulation of me let me read this oh my don't get nervous i'm about to close you know what the guy told me he says he's talking about evolution he says well there was a a big bang five billion years i said oh oh oh oh five billion years ago so yeah five billion years ago was big stop stop stop stop stop breaking point for the breaks now you telling me i'm believing it's something that i can't see but then you're gonna tell me five billion years ago and you said me you told me everything has to be proven he said yes everything has to be proven i said okay and you said big bang five billion years ago a half knowledge he says yes i said were you there if everything has to be proven he would have had to be there for that to happen or else he'll be taking somebody else's word for it like i am [Applause] but once i believe in what i believe in it becomes a real life material i can say i was there hallelujah when he was on the cross because i was in his jeans hallelujah i was there when he went down to hell and he said satan where you at when he said drugs where you at alcohol demon where you at high blood castle where you at the master has come down to hell [Applause] the master is here in hell depression where you at suicide demon where you at the master is in hell now [Applause] hallelujah home problems and all these other problems all these other sickness and diseases where you're at the master is in hell and i've come to take control of death hell and the grave [Applause] that's what our god has done master went down in the hell wow think about the church hallelujah he mutated down to a man just so he could strip satan from all his authority let's go there for a second he's on the cross crucified gives up the ghost and when he gives up the ghost he changed dimensions he changed dimensions and he wakes up in hell hallelujah hallelujah his body is on the cross but his spirit now is in another dimension where satan thought he had all power and god starts to walk through hell hallelujah and they start to make a way like the red sea why because the masters is taking possession of hell church our god owns the hell that you're sitting in you say brother jesus i'm going through hell and i'm telling you god owns it i can see it brother paul i can see god i call this the the cavalry step hallelujah when he takes a step hardly in hell and you know when somebody see that you have authority all they can do is sit back and look and watch you stay up so jesus take a step holly and they looking at everybody moving out of the way as he takes a step and he's possessing and possessing and he takes a step and maybe a demon stands up and jesus said sit down the master is here and maybe he takes another step hardly and the spirit of heartache and pain stands up and jesus says sit down i told you the master is here [Applause] and he took a step and he took a step and he took a step all the way to satan's prison house and not only did he take a step but he met satan face to face holy look him in his eye hallelujah then turns him around and say you got no right [Applause] snatches the keys from him and then he says your house has become my house don't y'all realize god is the only one that allows people to go to hell satan don't even control that it's up to god who he allows to go because the scripture says he'll have mercy on whom he chooses to have mercy so satan can come and say well they did this and they did that and god said shut up this is my house better yet get out think about it i want you to catch this i know i'm very dramatic but this is what heaven's gonna be like think about it church think about it everything is owned by god he even has control of satan's destiny he allows him to be whatever he wants him to be remember he told job you can do whatever you want to do you just can't take his life and he's still doing the same thing today because that's the god he was that's the god he is today hallelujah in church you think about that's who we serve that's the material that's in this god the worst thing you can do to me it's trying to get me to back down on what i believe and i'm preaching that night because if i'm preaching that night and you didn't basically challenge me on what i believe my whole message gonna be geared towards you nobody else might not know but you gonna know cause i want you to understand it's the anointing that breaks yokes and if i can just get out of the way god can deal with you if you are have the dna of god if i can get out of the way and god can let that message go forth hallelujah and dictate and do what it's supposed to do harlow he'll get you even if you profess him not to be a believer and that same young man blue rap i preach i preach and i preach he's looking at me trying not to look at me and preach preach he looking at me trying not to look at me but i made sure he looked at me hallelujah and i preached and we preached and the holy spirit came down and his girlfriend who was a believer and she was backsliding and she was trying to come back but now she got this this baggage this unbelieving baggage that's what happens when young people get hurt they go out in the world looking for love and they pick up some baggage they pick up baggage with a genetic message inside of them that's pulling them back with this baggage oh my some of them come back with two babies three babies but you ain't gonna stop that message hallelujah you ain't gonna stop that message inside of you you might have a lot of baggage but you're gonna come back where you're supposed to be wow [Applause] church and as we preached that girl the anointing hit us she just started shouting he never seen her shout before what was happening she was connecting to the message whoa whoa that dna was coming alive hallelujah right there in the midst in her condition hallelujah with a backslidden boyfriend and all the stuff right there hearing the message she came alive that dna started developing right there overcoming and surviving to reproduce right there hallelujah with an unbelieving boyfriend everybody all right and i can see the look on his face see the reason why people say they don't believe in god because they've never been in his presence if you ever get in this presence it'll change what you believe and what i want you to realize his presence is in flesh now we have the ability to create an atmosphere that will save souls they ain't got to see a pill of fire don't y'all realize the pillar fire became a man hallelujah hallelujah as long as jesus was on the earth you never saw the pillar of fire why because he was the pillar fire church and that young lady started to shout then the girls behind started to shout the young people on this side started shouting next thing you know the whole church started shouting and dancing and he was in there like then they started coming to the altar to get right what was happening god was connecting with his material it started coming to the altar surprise surprise guess who came to the altar that very same young man who said he didn't believe in god was that the altar and you know what last i heard he was looking for a message church so you can be god's material and not even know it until you get in the right atmosphere [Applause] listen you just take evolution listen he says now when god made a man in his image he was a spirit man and then there was no man to till the soil then he created man out of the dust of the earth now chronologists and so forth and these people that search and get old bones and so forth believe in evolution this is what the prophet says i believe in the right kind of evolution listen he said man ever lose from himself but not at all from one cell no sir because a bird has been a bird since god made him a bird and a monkey has been a monkey a man has been a man that's right so what he's saying is man ever loots from himself not from another cell hallelujah so y'all see what evolution is right kind of evolution now let's look at the church in my closing god mutated down hallelujah all the way from eternal to elohim to god the logos to a man hallelujah are you with me that was god's evolution so when he got to man man also had to evolute but we're not evoluting down we're ever looting back up hallelujah so we're evolution hallelujah turn oh wow oh my we're evoluting also church army we're mutating church we're mutating with god's material from a man to the logos to god [Applause] we're mutating back up amen from man to the logos which is giving us a spoken word and the only ones that can speak the spoken word is a god hallelujah and to be god you got to be self-existing and to be self-existing you must be eternal so god mutated down to us so we could mutate back up to him come musicians i'm so you say where brother needs what is god's material his material is a spirit-being so when you live in the spirit you manifest the character material of god so that's the challenge to us when we come to worship we want to worship in spirit and in truth when we come to hear the word we come to hear spirit and in truth hallelujah see it's the truth which brings us back to god's original material that's why god had to bring a prophet on the scene because that prophet would unfold unveil what the truth because from generation to generation denominations were hiding the truth so god holly about for the prophet hallelujah with a sound amen that could only be heard by truth praise the lord we're here because we responded to what truth see you don't have to prove anything to anybody all you got to do is live your life you live your life in truth it'll show who god is hallelujah and i'm not i'm not i'm not trying to be deep but i want us to realize who do we search we all got needs i got needs i got something i'm praying about right now but in me praying and and all that i believe god this ain't a time to be backpedaling because god's character's made a victory hallelujah like i said earlier god's character is made of overcoming power that's who he was and that's who he is and that's who we shall be forever and satan can't stop it because what this message is doing this message hallelujah is connecting with my genetic makeup amen he said brothers i don't know about that i'm gonna make it real simple before i close it's probably not too many saints in here that were born before 65. i ain't gonna see that well it might not be y'all look like a pretty young crowd but let's just say you were born after 1960 right that was probably five years to hit a prophet and you probably didn't hear him then because he was a baby and then in 65 he died you hit me ken 65 he was gone right but look billy graham was still here preaching that word preaching preaching that word why didn't you connect with his message why didn't you connect with his voice it was a wrong message for your dna all robbers was here why aren't you in the pentecostal move right now because it was the wrong message for your dna but to show you how powerful the genetic makeup is hallelujah you could connect with a voice and a man not even be here oh oh my honey wow yet billy graham and all robbers on the scene me not connecting with them me connecting with a a man who's not even present because we didn't connect with flesh we're connected with god who is a spirit that's what we connect with we connect with the spirit we're not connecting with jeffersonville we're not connecting with belt buckles and hats and cowboy boots we're connecting with the word of god [Applause] and if you got belt buckles and cowboy boots praise god but that'll make you more genetically connected to me hallelujah because we're connected to a message that's god's material this is god's material this what makes us who we are and as long as this can come off the page and be a part of your life then you're walking in your truth holly are you with me that's about his you
