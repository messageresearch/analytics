========================================

hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literallife.church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today place was white as snow in pure's finest gold it had the look of new it had the look of old felt like I was home yet I felt so far away please I fear I thought to leave but felt the urge to stay foreign [Music] foreign [Music] then from my sleep awakens I looked into the night the darkness overtaken by a bright and Shining Light I couldn't understand it I couldn't reason how within my eyes [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] First Corinthians 13 and verse 6 Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth and I'll just read worthless now Divine love divine Capstone love rejoiceth not in iniquity it never rejoices in iniquity but it does Rejoice over something it rejoices it gets happy in the truth and when truth prevails and when honesty is there and the truth comes out that's where we Rejoice not in lies not in iniquity not when someone Falls not when someone makes a mistake there's no rejoicing in Divine love of that but when someone finds the truth and we know that the truth shall set you free and so that is divine love and action that we rejoice in truth and and that truth prevails just add a scripture in First Corinthians 12 the chapter before verse 25 and verse 26 as Paul is talking about the body and how it works together and the Natural Body and then he types it with the spiritual body of Christ verse 25 and verse 26 that there be no Schism no division that there be no division in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it so there can't be any jealousy if someone suffers we don't gloat over that we're not happy over that they got what they deserved no we suffer with them so there's a point to be made here and if I don't get to it again today there's a point to be made there if somebody else in the body is suffering then you're suffering that's how much we're part of one another if someone gets honored then we're all honored and we rejoice in that that's how much we're tied together now you can act separate next I'm an island to myself all these other things but that's not what the word teaches the word teaches by the Holy Ghost I'm tied to a body of Christ somebody suffers I'm suffering that's why I pray for them that's why I lift them up that's why I encourage them because if they're suffering I'm suffering if they're going through something I want I don't want to come down with them but I want to lift them up and I want to feel the pain of their suffering because they're a part of me I'm a part of them amen I'll say it like my dad used to say it you didn't put me in the body of Christ you can't take me out you didn't put the person standing next to you in the body of Christ so you can't take them out so he used to say it this way as much as some of you might don't not want me or someone else you're stuck with me you stuck with me amen so learn to love one another praise the Lord and so I'll just read that again he says there be that there be no division oh God hastened the day when there would be no division in the body of Christ but that the men members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it and one member be honored and all the members Rejoice with it last time we talked about the the more excellent way and this is the more excellent way part six hopefully we'll finish this up next Sunday but last time we talked about the more excellent way that Paul talked about it is the way of divine love and the last thing we dropped off of which I don't feel like we had plenty of time to cover the subject but the last time we learned that God's Divine love in US does not keep record of wrongs so I want you to remember that because that's probably one of the key things of all these things that we've been preaching on that that we that that love does not keep records of wrongs love does not hold a grudge for years but love forgives and the reason why this is an important one to re to to refresh your memory on is because this is the one I think we struggle with the most many times and that is we are bound when we hold on to a grudge of someone else we remain bound that person may be go on but we're not released we're not we're not bounds so forgiveness releases us and can release the other person as well so it's important that we don't keep records of wrongs and to clean the Slate of others just as God does with us to clean the slate and to forgive and to give others a fresh chance to release the wrongs through the true forgiveness of God to release wrongs through the truth you can't fully release them unless you come through the channel and the Forgiveness of God but when you bring your life through the Forgiveness of God then it releases the wrongs that others have done to you it's to wash the past history away to delete the past to click delete on our past debts with people it is very important to study this again and go back and look at it and it needs more than just a study I'll tell you this needs a real Supernatural manifestation in all of our lives some of us become professionals at keeping the score fresh in our minds of the wrongs that people have done to us some of us have it locked and lodged and it's it's blocked there in our memories and we're not even making any efforts to Let It Go but it gets lodged there I'm holding that 16 years ago they said that to me and they put me down and they criticized me and we hold it right there my friend I'm encouraging you if you stay there the other person isn't bound you're bound you're the one that's bound and the locked up of your mind of what that is and the Bible tells us love does not keep records of wrongs love pushes delete can you say Amen how do I do it brother Paul just ask God to help you just delete it just push delete erase the debts of others can you say Amen how can we not do that when God has done it for us when he pushes delete of our sins it's gone forever in the sea of God's forgiveness how is it that we can't do that for others you can't move on in Victory if you continue to hold on to these things and keep them in your mind and keep a record and keep these the history of people there was one married man that said to his friend you know every time my wife and I get into a conflict she gets historical and his friend said his friend said you don't mean historical you mean she gets hysterical when you have an argument she gets hysterical he said no I mean historical what do you mean by that is that when we get in this argument she rehearses anything I've ever done in the whole history of our marriage so I'm right she gets historical now I know none of you know anybody like that or your wife or husband you don't know anybody like that but listen for me I'm going to be honest if you're not I'm going to be honest is that this is a real thing is that when people get angry about something the the whole history is right there and they bring it all out and I don't know why we do but it's like a weapon is to get back at somebody I don't know anything else to say right now but I'm mad and all of a sudden I've got a whole list of what you've done then I'm taking you from after your salvation all the way through bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang and then the person listening is like he's being shot bang bang bang bang she gets historical not hysterical now you might have some wives that actually get hysterical at the same time and I don't know why they use the example for a wife but let's not get on the wives okay wives had an incredible memory for things that's happened in the history but and I don't know psychological what all that is but listen now I'm not speaking on that I'm saying every one of us have a certain level of keeping the history of somebody come on people say amen and this is what the Bible teaches us against because we don't have a right to hold the history of somebody if they've asked forgiveness or if they haven't we don't know we pray for them that God will bring them to that but we are bound when we hold a grudge towards somebody so I'm bringing that back up up again because this part of divine love we really need to ask God to help us to project this it will set us free it'll set others free as well because we are giving them a chance and we're erasing their history so that we're giving them a chance for a fresh start in the part of divine love that's spoken of in verse uh uh verse six we want to study this a little bit because this this meaning today of divine love really gets to the heart of what makes us really glad or what pleases us there are things that make us happy and please us and and things that make us rejoice but as Christians there are other things that should make us rejoice and one thing in Divine love in the Christian walk is that we should never have something that triggers happiness in us when someone else Falls we should never have something in this that triggers a joy in us that swells up when someone else Falls or someone gets payback for what they've done wrong this should not be a part of us this is not part of the love of God and it shouldn't be a part of us can you say Amen this gets to the heart of what we really should be rejoicing over and this is what triggers us to rejoice and it says that it never rejoices in iniquity but it rejoices in the truth the source of our happiness joy and rejoicing and pleasing and and and gladness should be truth prevails truth comes to somebody truth is preached truth is lived can you say amen that's why when when we have this world of such uh that's in such a mess and sin is glorified and sexual sin is glorified and living together as couples is glorified it's all okay and people play around with one another and sexually give themselves another before marriage I like to at a wedding emphasize to those there to in the whole world to take something that stayed pure until marriage and kept it that way under God's holiness I like to blast it to the entire wedding ceremony and everybody listening because it's not too often that truth and Holiness get praised in this world everything else gets praised you see now this world's messed up because it always praises the sin all along but it doesn't praise a holy life every day it doesn't praise when truth prevails can you say Amen it doesn't acknowledge the truth it doesn't rejoice in truth but Christians should rejoice when truth prevails not when lies Prevail can you say Amen but when truth comes to a person and changes their life when truth sets somebody free I tell you we ought to be shouting and rejoicing and happy when somebody gets free you shouldn't be happy when someone gets revenge or someone sin is glorified in this world whatever affects God should affect us When sin prevails it should grieve us can you say Amen when everything Turns Upside Down In This World which it has it should grieve whatever makes God grieve should make us grieve but whatever makes God happy should make us happy can you say amen and divine love rejoices in the truth not in the iniquity can you say math what Grieves God should grieve us what makes God happy should make us happy as well and when and I'll get to it at the end of the service but there are seeing things in the scripture that we know makes God happy and makes the Angels happy and whatever that is that's what we want to be rejoicing over as well Divine love does not rejoice and get happy when others fall in sin Divine love whether it's you falling in sin or making a mistake or whether it's other people iniquity is not anything to get happy about if God Grieves that Rebellion then we should grieve at Rebellion whether it's in us or someone else if God is not gloating that someone got what they deserved do you think God gloats when he brings forth a punishment or a judgment on someone that he's promised to bring and they kept running over God and rebelling towards the word and God had to bring forth his promise that you'll reap what you sow but do you think God gloats in the fact they got what they deserve I can tell you God doesn't gloat in it I can tell you God's not happy with it I can tell you God's not saying they got what they deserved I told them I warned them they give God is not thinking that God is not willing that any should perish God's not willing that anyone should turn against his word in Rebellion and he doesn't gloat or rejoice when someone does it his heart is grieved and so God is not gloating that someone get what they deserve and if he doesn't then we should not if God carries through on his judgment and by how many would raise your hands to God is the god of judgment we don't hear that in the church World very much today because we've eliminated all the scriptures about but God being a god of judgment and following through it with judgment but we have too many accounts in the Bible that once he gives the warning then he does bring judgment he brought it on Sodom and Gomorrah for their sin he's brought it before and he will do it again he can't let our nation that's resisted God and this world he can't let him get by or he wouldn't be a just God judgment is coming and so so if we look at God now many people misinterpret him and they only say it's only the Grace part God is God full of grace but he's also a god of judgment he's just can you say amen and if he broke his promise and let everybody get by with it when they won't take his path for forgiveness they choose their own way then there has to be a judgment to follow that he warns them and then God's warning and then judgment that's his pattern warning in the Judgment I say to you today if you're listening online if God's warning you over and over again for the life that you're living if God's sinning you are you ought to respond to that warning because that's God's grace to correct you and to warn you you keep turning it down then the Bible shows you come under the judgments of God but I want to say about the judgments of God he carries through on his judgment but the reason that God carries through is not because he wants to it's because he must be just and he must follow his promises if he lets you get by and made a promise I'll warn you then judgment's coming and he didn't follow through we wouldn't have confidence that God keeps his word how can we trust any of this as God don't keep his word but when he says something he follows through so when he says something about judgment he will follow through but he doesn't want to do that he is not willing or gloating that any should perish how many know the scripture in Hebrews God used to be first Peter God is not willing that any should perish and I'll tell you friends that that's in the heart of God why is it in our hearts that I'm not willing to see anybody perish I don't have anything to see anybody I don't care how bad they've been I don't care if they've been in prison I don't care if they've killed someone in our hearts we are not willing to see anybody perish because of that but we look and pray for redemption in a life can you say Amen how many believe in Redemption this morning I believe in Redemption of God I believe the lowest sinner can come to God and be changed [Applause] that's how powerful Redemption is it doesn't matter how low you've gotten God can redeem you God can save you but you got to accept his way you got to give your life completely over to you the Greek word for um the Greek word her for rejoicing is uh the Greek word is Cairo Caro c-h-a-i-r-o which means to Rejoice to be glad to be delighted or pleased so when it says we don't rejoice in iniquity we rejoice in truth it means to be glad to be delighted to be pleased and think about when you are delighted about something what you think about when you're delighted about something you're pleased with something you're glad about something if you're glad about something you may talk about it you probably dwell on it you'll bring it up maybe you even make a a big deal about it all the time you magnify it because you're rejoicing over it you're pleased with it you're glad about it you rejoice in it it makes you glad so that's the the Greek word to this type of rejoicing so you should now put that do you are you glad and delighted over iniquity in someone's life or iniquity in your life are you pleased with that does that make you please does that make you delighted hopefully not but we magnify so look at your life today look at your life today and say is there something in me that is pleased and rejoices as in glad and is delighted when iniquity prevails when someone iniquity is unrighteousness iniquities iniquities knowing to do good and not doing it and when that happens in your friend's life or a person's life or a Brother's life sometimes what is it in your heart what's your first feeling about it think about the things that make you happy I don't know what that is things that make you glad and if that's a part of it we need to hit an altar and a heart say Lord something's wrong with me if I'm gloating and happy and get a little happy feeling when somebody gets paid back for their Rebellion that little thing that says they deserved it right when we leave that up to God why don't we leave that up to God so many people lately I've been saying why are you so Bound by what that other person is doing you're being bound and they don't even know it it's between them and God what they did you pray every day for them and that's all you can do but quit living under the bonds of worrying about what they're going to do release it in the name of the Lord release what they've done to you it's time to go on it's a new year brother Bob it's the new year can you say Amen Wednesday night we're on New Year's Revelations New Year's it's a new time why don't we leave the past in the past why don't we leave it in the graveyard of all the crazy stuff why don't we set our hearts on this new year 2023 is going to be a wonderful year with the Lord and I'm going to be free of losing sleep all over this stuff I'm going to free be free of the bitterness I have towards people I'm going to let it go it's between them and God somebody say praise the Lord amen so now we look at our life as a Christian and he's we have to see what triggers the most Delight is it when somebody gets payback is it when a lie is told because that if you have the opposite of Truth we have a lie when lies are told then do we Rejoice over that and that lie travels around lies travel around faster than truth you know we're working to get the truth out all over the world we're sending Bibles everywhere but I can guarantee you lives of the scripture travel much faster than the truth and in a local church gossip travels faster than the truth people buy into gossip as soon as they hear it they don't know if it's full truth yeah but but but you you join in with it I'm gonna talk about gossip just a minute because you see now all those lies travel around and they hurt a person because lies are going around about a person and so you hear it come back and it comes back to you and you have a little feeling well they deserve that so I'm joining do you enjoy a conversation of juicy gossip that puts others down but you don't know whether it's truth or not I say hit an altar do you give yourself permission around your family to talk down anybody in the congregation and what's interesting they don't hardly even know that person in their own congregation but once they hear a little something they say something they join in with it gives a little little sarcastic joke and little laugh about it and you don't even know that person you don't even know if it's the truth of what you're saying or hearing I say shame on us shame on us for joining in Gossip what's interesting is you don't like anybody to do that to you do you you don't like lies told about you as a matter of fact I'm going to go ahead and say it is that people what almost demand an apology if somebody gossips and something said about them they need to apologize to me but what's interesting is you don't apologize for anything you gossip you talk you put down other people and not once if you went and made it right so we don't like people talking about us when we get defensive about it we get up but we give ourselves permission to talk about anybody whether we know it's the full truth or not that's when we're kind of gloating over gossip and what we don't know and we're kind of happy and we kind of get a rush out of that atmosphere talking the pastor's hitting on Gossip because the devil of Gossip is always around you know he's not left with too much to work with but he always likes to get in conversations when it's gossip so the next one says love does not rejoice with injustices or iniquities love to rejoices with when truth prevails so if you've caught that thought today this is that that channel of divine love that finds the the the the reason why it rejoices First Corinthians 13 6 this is our text and then I read to you in first Corinthians 12 there that there be no division in the body of Christ but that the members should have the same care of one another and when the whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it in other words we are so tied together that's why we can rejoice when someone is honored and we can rejoice when someone comes to truth in a victory and a Deliverance in their life and that's why we can grieve when someone else is grieving give them a positive word give them a text of encouragement Interlink with the body of Christ it's not going to hurt you to get closer to the body that you're a part of it's not going to hurt you to bring your young people and get them integrated and plugged in with the body of Christ not going to hurt you to invite somebody over why are you why are you so afraid of that why are some of you so afraid of it tell you something that makes me nervous no that's your uncle that says things like that that's a family member I love you and I'm going to encourage you some of you are too detached from this body and you're missing out you're missing out on what God's providing with friendships developed here
