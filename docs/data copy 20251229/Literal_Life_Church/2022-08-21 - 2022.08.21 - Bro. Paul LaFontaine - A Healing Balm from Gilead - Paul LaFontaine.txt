========================================

if you'd like to read with me and go to the word of god and we're thankful just to be here be his presence we had a very small crowd on wednesday night because some of them had already we're getting ready for camp and stuff and so but i just said hey i was glad to be here wherever he shows up it's church so i was glad to be in his presence amen just takes two or three and i trust the lord will bless you this morning we can enter into the word of god i don't think i have any other announcements we appreciate your giving to me mindful that for the the church and also the missions things that we're overseeing and is that i'd stopped in chick-fil-a last night and you know they're always trying to ask you questions they get personable with you and the one boy actually said if you had a million dollars right now and i handed you a million dollars he said what would you do with it and i said i'd send it overseas to build a bunch of churches we're building some now but i built a bunch more so it kind of took him by surprise you know that we would spend that money i think he was expecting another answer you know but that's my heart it's only the kingdom that counts now it's only the kingdom of what we do for his kingdom that's the only thing that counts and we're happy for that we have a little we had a trustee meeting yesterday and i'm going to make a need known to the congregation we've had a couple things come up that we need to take care of as the building is old and and i'm going to announce this one first for us to help out with um and join together as and i'm announcing this one because this is very recent that you felt the effects of it when we had 300 people in here and it was a hot day like it was a couple sundays ago our air conditioners we found out are not capable of keeping up with the entire building so we were sweating pretty bad all weekend and we want to be able in the future to have meetings like that periodically and so we didn't know that they were not capable we've done a lot of research on them and tried to do and we're thankful to have brother garrett frame in our church now who's very good at air conditioners and furnaces and just about everything else and he's been so good to give us advice on the different things we're glad to have him and now that i've announced it you'll announce that you'll be calling him when your furnace is down no doubt and you should he'd be glad to do help out he's good at it but we after calculating we need to put a couple extra units in the wall here to supplement and in the gym and the back area and with the electrical and with the units and also the um the labor it's going to be close to 50 000 to do that to supplement we we can't redo the units we have we have to just supplement the air so i'm making that need known to you whatever the lord lays on your heart to help out with it i told the trustees at the end yesterday the lord knows the need and we just put it before the lord and i believe he can do it praise the lord jeremiah chapter 8 and verse 18 jeremiah chapter 8 and verse 18. when i would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint in me this is the prophet jeremiah when i would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint in me behold the cry the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country is not the lord in zion is not her king in her why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and with their strange vanities this is the the children of israel and this is the the people of god living within their city but they'd slowly slowly turn to graven images and different idols and begin to provoke the lord by doing that because they knew that was wrong and so god says you're provoking me to anger and god's prophet said with all this going on is it the lord still in zion is not the king still among her and the answer to that was that question was yes the lord is still among us the king is still in her nothing's changed the lord is available can you say amen so despite our weaknesses and despite our mistakes the lord is still with us and the lord is still near us can you say amen the harvest has passed the summer has ended and we are not saved for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt i am black astonishment hath taken hold on me and then this is familiar scripture to you is there no bomb in gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered and i was going to read verse 22 again is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there and the answer to that question of course was yes there is a balm in gilead there is a physician there to be able to heal the people why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered and of course he's not speaking of a physical sickness here he's speaking of a spiritual sickness in the people aren't you glad to know that when there's spiritual sickness god's already provided the balm and gilead god's already provided the help and the physician and how many believe the great physician now is here this morning the sympathizing jesus we believe that heavenly father bless and anoint encourage us in your word today we pray you'll bless those that are listening at the camp as well and the word of god going forth and i pray your kingdom would be furthered in satan's kingdom lord would be destroyed and lord the the effect of satan's kingdom would lose its power as young people and all of us lord get closer to you we commit this service to you and i pray your blessed and anointed this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask him amen amen once you shake somebody's hand before you seated god bless you wanted to say thank you so much to the we had a few musicians and song leaders out this morning and so we kind of got a second string but we didn't suffer at all this morning in our instruments and leading a worship we did not suffer at all it was good let's give them a hand thank you brothers and sisters for health helping us we had very very good we're so blessed in the gifts the lord jesus put on our heart a couple of scriptures this week after last sunday and it was just brought to my attention a couple things and so i looked them up couple was early in the morning i just looked them up on my phone and uh the one that came to my heart one was this is there no balm and gilead and i started to research a little bit early in the morning what that meant when he said the balm and gilead and why did he referred against the first time in scripture that a prophet refers to a balm but it particularly in gilead and why was that tied back to the city or the mountain of gilead and so i begin to look at it and and so then another scripture that came to my heart last week and we won't be preaching on this as such but that's found in isaiah 1 and verse 9. and there's an interesting scripture there from the prophet isaiah and he said except the lord of hosts had left us a very small remnant we should have become or been as sodom and we should have been like unto gomorrah and i was very encouraged by that this week to realize that it's god's grace that we've been left his grace we've been left a remnant and we've been left a word and if god had not provided that word for us we too would become succumbed can you say amen by sodom and gomorrah it's just his grace can you say amen and if we were not left something from the lord in this generation we would be overwhelmed we would be outnumbered can you say amen the demonic power that is in a flood this this uh generation in this last hour before the coming of the lord with that dynamic dynamic realm just increasing that we would become outnumbered we would become overwhelmed by it our children would not have a protection of that at all we would not be able to go up against it we are caught we would be caught in the webs of the mindset of the world and the wisdom of this world and what we see what we would observe unless we had the word and the holy spirit to deal with us we would we would follow what we see we would follow the norm and by following that we would open ourselves up to the spirits that are in this generation and i like this scripture it says except for the grace of the lord except he left us something we would have become as sodom and gomorrah but i want to proclaim to us this morning he gave us grace so that we had something a token that we would not be left to the spirits of sodom and gomorrah i preach against it almost every service because it's becoming so manifested and so prevalent and it wants to come and and and take the atmosphere that we have but we have a word we have a word from god can you say amen and we have availability of the holy ghost for our children something to hold that spirit back can you say a man we have it we ought to raise our hands and rejoice this morning that we have a token that would hold off the death angel that would hold off the spirit of sodom and gomorrah except the lord had left a very tiny small remnant we would have become like sodom and gomorrah i just raised my hand and said thank god that he left us a little remnant can you say man we would wear out over time we would give in over time it's the nature of our time and the nature of our time is not not a hose of water not a light rain as i read a few weeks ago when the enemy rushes in like a flood it's not a light rain it's not a trickle of a hose it's not even a hose it's a flood in this generation and when you are completely but when you are completely conscious of how brutal the denomic realm is against you against your family against your marriage against your spirit against your mind when you're conscious because you see we have to be by the holy spirit conscious of the time we're living in we wrestle not against flesh and blood our battle is not with one another but we wrestle against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places and trust me they're not they're not dormant they're not just sitting there they're active demons can you say amen they're against you they're against what you believe they're against your proclamation of the message they're against your children if they can't get you they're trying to go for your children these are relentless brutal enemies and demons against you and against this word and we have to be conscious that it's just that real as a christian we cannot be dormant ourself we can't be numb to it ourself we can't be numb like the rest of the world brother lonnie jacob said this to me one time the world has no concept of spirit the world has no concept of spirit so when they see bad in the world they see rape and they see murder and they see all these things they just well that's just bad people but it's demon power that has no restriction on a life that has no holy ghost and so it's the world has no concept of spirit and a lot of the church world now has no concept they don't want to talk about demons they don't want to talk about the demon in just in the other dimension there's a denominator realm that's against believers and against the word of god they don't want to they get a little scared talking about demons so that's spooky that's we but it's real and to a believer it's real and we can't be like then we must be conscious that this other realm is brutal against believers and children and families and churches in this hour and it's become worse i mentioned this scripture to you jesus said since the time of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and just stop right there since the time john introduced the messiah he said there's an increase and the kingdom of heaven is suffering a violent attack from the demonic realm isn't an interesting sense the message of john the baptist came who had the spirit of elijah we always had demons but when the word goes forth from elijah the dynamic forces increase so now we've had this word for some 50 60 years now restored word we've had our bibles for 2000 years but the restoration of the bible the restoration of truths we had it for 50 60 years and ever since it came forth the devil has been hopping mad he's been angry how can i stop this thing how can i put seeds of doubt how can i do it how can i get the people to backslide against it how can i get their children since the time that the message came forth that's when the demonic realm increased against us now we're in 2022 so i ask you has it decreased has satan backed off has satan got tired has his demonic realm got tired and said you know what i've been trying to wear these people out for some 30 40 50 years and i'm just going to take a few years break no it keeps increasing and the bible says since the time of john the baptist until now the kingdom of god suffereth violence violence but the violet take it by force so we need to have an aggressive response a violent response how do we do it through prayer through saying lord fill me with the holy ghost lord this i'm conscious demons are fighting against me but lord increase my prayer life increase my hunger for the word of god let me lay aside my phone and all the other entertainments let me grab my bible let me grab this message let me be in it more than i ever have because it needs a violent response it needs an extreme response that's why last sunday when i talked about dress and things like that i got to think i thought can can i possibly be too extreme in talking about dress when the when the world is the way it is i don't want to bring a religion about it but listen could i be too extreme about convictions and standards and how young people should conduct themselves i'm not sure if i could be too extreme when we know the devil is so extreme to take their lives and i'm thankful that i had amens from most of you last sunday i'm thankful for the text and the response i received this week i have been so overwhelmed to the support to say preach it say it like it is let's not mess with these standards preach it brother paul thank you sometimes you feel like you stand alone today and sometimes that thing says don't talk about that period preach the rest of the message but don't talk about that that's legalism that's not legalism it's god's standard praise the lord and i appreciate it you know just i appreciate the response and just just the support and some of us that weren't here to see it so brother ian's working on that and i'll send it out again to you and i might send it with a few comments but i i said it from my heart just as reminders and i think we'll send all the quotes with it because you said there was quotes and scriptures with it but what i got to thinking is that quotes if you use quotes and you're trying to convince somebody sometimes even if quotes it's not going to convince somebody to change their ways you know how it would as if they have a value for god's profit and what he said but if they don't have a value for it they're not going to change their ways anyway i could read a million quotes because this isn't just about a quote this is about a life in jesus christ that has holiness in it oh praise the lord i'm not on that subject but i want to say thank you all for your response and you know i think god uh god wants us to talk about these things to combat these these spirits of immodesty and these spirits of homosexuality can you say amen when you are completely conscious of how brutal this demonic realm is right now 2022 then you start praying you start clinging to what god has given us you don't get further away from it you cling to it you say lord i'm all in can you say man like i said wednesday night we're not looking for ways around the word but david said i love thy law i love thy precepts i love the word how did he come there he made a mistake he stepped on god's word he committed adultery but after that he had a full repentance and he said lord i'm no longer for looking for ways for around your quotes i'm not looking for ways around the quotes i'm embracing it i love it because i know it's your love that sent it to me somebody say amen this morning when we look at the word the right way we know it comes from god and we love it we don't detest it it's not bondage to us somebody say praise the lord sodom has come to its full manifestation i want to correct something i said wednesday night and i thought that biden had elected this uh trans uh last sunday when i was speaking but it was the picture was sent to me last sunday in the article it was in january that he that he appointed and i was right in that in his administration he's appointed over 200 gays more than any other president ever in history and uh and also it was in january it seems president joe biden made history last month that's when sam britain i can't show you the picture i can't show the picture in church but it's it's it's it's an amazing picture to see this man woman whatever he is and he announced that when that's when sam britton announced the administration had hired them him as a deputy assistant secretary of spent fuel and waste uh disposition in the office of nuclear energy for the department of energy britain like many of the people quoted in this article uses the pronouns they and them and may be the first openly gender fluid person in federal government leadership first time january of this year if you can't see that the sodom spirit and the mixing of genders has come to the full manifestation and that ought to tell us one thing first of all i want my children and my life and my home protected from that spirit second of all hey it's the coming of the lord we're close to the coming of the lord we're just about wrapped up it's just about over every morning i wake up now this morning i say lord i've been singing that song sister debbie lately all i've got is leaving on my mind the windows and the shutters it all needs help and attention and repair but rusty goodman wrote the song it says i know i need to do all this work on the house and i got this honey-do list and i got everything but lately all i've got is leaving on my mind i want to get out of here i'm ready to go i don't want to be earthbound can you say man tired of this world tired of its pressure tired of the demonic force and i'm gonna keep fighting to the very last day but i know when this sodom spirit is at the manifestation that it is i know we're very close to the coming of the lord hallelujah and that shouldn't scare us that should make us rejoice if you're in the place you should be you say lord bring it on i am ready by the grace of god i am ready to go you should go to the altar in your heart if you're not ready to say i'm ready i'm ready to go accept a very small tiny remnant accept grace except god provided something in our time we would have all become as sodom and gomorrah or slowly accepting that the strict call for a dress code was not was was linked to where gender dressing demons would come and take over so he gave us the word and i wanted to say you can't there's something last sunday that kind of kind of dropped in my heart you can't acknowledge that we're in sodom and then make the quotes undress irrelevant today oh yeah i'm going to say it again you can't have it both ways yes amen brother paul we're in the full manifestation biden has elected these people we're in the full sodom and gomorrah and then you're going to back off from the quotes that set a modesty standard and separate the genders you're going to back off you can't have both worlds because it's that word that's been played put in place as protections against demon power i should get a greater amen than that he gave his word because he knew in 2022 this spirit would dominate our government our schools every institution all of them starbucks all the places we frequent all the places we go also come by that spirit and giving it room ymca the ymca young men's christian association it was set up as a young men's christian association and here in a city the other day an 80 year old woman was in the locker room the women's locker room and a trans came in standing in the corner watching young girls get undressed and she spoke up against it and said that's wrong i'm standing against it she they took away her membership they're blasting her that's the ymca every institution no matter how good it was at the beginning is being succumbed by this spirit but we don't want it here in our midst we don't want it here in our atmosphere [Applause] be conscious of where we're at be conscious of the word and what the holy spirit is speaking to us for the salvation of my children for the preservation until we leave here of my home my home's a sacred place thankfully i still have the choice of what i allow and what i don't allow in my home every day it's a choice thankfully i still have that choice because i can't choose you know even when i'm on hold on the phone zack i have to listen to music that i didn't choose now how many rights are being taken away from us i have to go in a restaurant and i if i were to ask they could switch it to the lafontaines they'd look at me like an idiot and they'd say who's the lafontaines but i am forced to listen to their music i'm forced in walmart to see immodest stressing i i i pay taxes i go to those places i pay to keep them in business but i don't have any rights as far as the atmosphere there's no place left that's holy anymore there's no place left hardly at all in this world so let's stand on our own two feet with god with the banner of the token of god and say we will hold to the token for our homes for our minds for our families because god gave us the token at the evening time and if he hadn't we would have become as sodom and gomorrah how many can say praise the lord amen so now in jeremy jeremiah 8 it's not the it's not the world that's slowly turning away from god it's god's people in jerusalem jeremiah's standing there as a prophet i don't know why i'm losing my voice but i'll preach to it's gone jeremiah the prophet is standing there at the gates of jerusalem it's not the world that's compromising it's the people of god that are turning to idols and he's saying why why why are you turning this way is there no lord still here is there no king still here why is there no healing and he's saying that you're you're in a condition of sickness spiritual sickness why is the daughter my people not being healed because the bomb is there no bomb and gilead available is there a physician here and israel if they had responded jeremiah they would have to admit no our king is still here our physician is still in our midst he is here hallelujah he is here amen he's still here they would have to say jeremiah no there's a physician here there's a bomb in gilead there's if we're sick spiritually there's something that we have here why is there not spiritual healthy strong people sometimes i ask myself why with all that we have that god has provided for us why is there not more spiritually healthy strong people in the lord i don't mean that as a to belittle anybody personally this morning but i i asked the same question in jeremiah because we they don't have a physician unless they turn to him we have a physician we have an answer we have the word we have the holy ghost like brother andrew down there at the camps i was listening a little bit he said he said that the demonic realm would be poured out in the last days the prophet said poured out more than it ever has but he also said the holy spirit at the same time would be poured out upon his people it's a good thing can you say a man in the last days i'll pour out my spirit and we're going to need that to go go up against the spirits that are coming in the last days he'll pour it out and then this holy spirit was bound for almost 2 000 years but by by the door of creeds and dogmas but he said it's to be released in the evening time by the evening time messenger what was released not quotes not a doctrine not a new religion not a a message movement no what's released to us the holy spirit is to be released in the evening time by the evening time message there's no limitations to the holy ghost there's no limitations to this holy spirit we just got to pray get in the word say lord i submit myself fill me with your spirit keep my lamps trending and burning i can't do that for your brothers and sisters you can live halfway all you want to borderline hashtag borderline believers you can do it all you want to i can't do it for you but i can preach it and tell you there's a holy ghost there's there's a life that can stay filled with the spirit of god and it is the only combat for our children and our families us we come like sodom and gomorrah i go ahead and say it you start compromising on standards you have your children marrying some unbeliever do you really want that who they associate with they're going to end up marrying because you haven't taught the standard first of all first of all teach them to become a believer you need to be born again by the spirit and then when you do then you will according to the word be looking for somebody who has that born-again experience as well that's what we teach our children if you if you're silent about it i guarantee you which direction they'll go and then you'll be wondering what what's going on there's a standard there's a word there's a holy spirit here and you can't mock it you can't minimize it you can't you can't compromise it with it you can't say you can't pick and choose what you want what you don't want you can't mess with it can i get an amen this morning i was i say lord help me not to be hard this morning last sunday was hard enough lord help me to not be that way but there's something i don't know what it is it's just churning within me maybe we're close but god is calling people that don't have the holy spirit completely in the born-again experience it's time now if it ever was time it's time to run towards god you heard the song that says he's running towards you how about you running towards him say well i've been in the message for 30 years i grew up in the i don't care about that now do you have the board and get experience forget about the drama forget about the politics and the message forget about what's going on in there in jefferson forget about that there's only one thing you need to know am i filled with the spirit of god and am i feeding on the word that's it it's not any more complicated than that god help my spirit never to cross over into an arrogance or a pride or something to be mean to you i don't want to be mean to you but there's just something churning my spirit spreads i will not stand by and not preach the power of this word for the people's lives see what about my children i'll pray with you for your children because the hours late say god bring them in now put conviction in their heart help them get over all the walls that have been put up towards the message and towards the pastor and towards the church god it's time break those well let them not think that anymore let them only think one thing i need god where can i find the reality of god yes i'm praying for a revival i'm praying for individual revivals will you join with me would you join with me thursday mornings at 7 30 at prayer would you join with me so it can be the worst of times which i believe it is it can be there can be many problems we could be fighting against a lot of demons mental mental illness mental sickness but the worst thing above all the problems and the mental illness above all the worst thing is when the people of god forget that he's never left us without a medicine to heal us it's here there is a bomb in gilead there is a token to put over our children in our lives he's not left us in this mess of satan's eden without uh without what was needed to be provided for us to escape and us to make it and us to stay protected he has provided it for us i said some things last sunday on the on the trust in the last 50 years in other words the the the thrust gives me the thrust of the enemy in the last 50 years of taking over the mind and that is not only the so so now it's not just the physical healing that we need today it's not just physical hand because remember in the the prophet's message and whenever god rose he rose with healing in his wings so a lot of it was healing lines prayer lines with physical sicknesses cancers and diseases and tuberculosis and my thousands of people healed under that healing revival that started with the with uh william branham and then trickled to oral roberts and different ones my what a sweep in this country of specific meetings just to heal the sick and god is still doing that and still able to do it but then you watch how satan gets into starting with the the the the fourth dimension he gets into television and then he gets into this and he gets into this and this is the way satan says if i can get closer to influence through the channel from the fourth dimension if i can use the fourth dimension i have a channel to bring more demonic power into lives and thus bring not only physical sicknesses but mental sicknesses mental anxiety not preaching you down because you have that i'm just saying satan knew what he was doing to make us busy to cloud our minds to make us scared to make us worried and now it's so shallow that we can't keep up with the joneses we can't have the vacation that they have we can't wear the and so now it just becomes this thing it's all taken our minds and it's not just the minds but he found a channel satan knew he could transmit demon power through the fourth dimension and incidentally friends from television to social media to our phones it's influence from the fourth dimension that is the fourth dimension so there's seven dimensions the first three are time light and matter right the fourth dimension is television which the prophet said is with us we just have channels now to pick it up bring it in our phones the fifth dimension is where people go that are unsaved it's hell as you could call it it's the place of the lost the sixth dimension is where the saints go that have served the lord and have the holy spirit to wait until the resurrection time they're in the sixth dimension and the seventh dimension is where god dwells this is truth so now satan takes access to the only really the one he has and he spills over from his demonic power from the fifth dimension it spills over into the fourth dimension and that's why brother brahman says the television would have been a great tool for the kingdom of god but satan got a hold of it so most of the ownership of it is satan so he poured his fifth dimension into the fourth dimension and now we live over here in time light and matter and so we start feeding on more and more the fourth dimension the problem is is we didn't know only satan knew the more that we fed on that how many were five ten years old and that's all you fed on was television that's all you did when you got home from school and were you affected by it oh yeah you were affected by it not just what you seen but what you couldn't see all those sitcoms that you watch even today funny sitcoms but full of sex and full of dirty jokes friends modern family all those symptoms that you feed on the devil knew about that si kim before you did and he filled it with powers of the enemy that when you feed on it you say well i'm different i i shield from all that stuff come on man i wasn't gonna preach hard satan knew he could transmit demon power through the fourth dimension he's still doing it and that's why the minds are going crazy the minds are affected he knew the mind is everything because it can transmit all these things and bring a spirit and so and bring physical illness from it i'm going to read an article in a minute a pastor heard my sermon last sunday he sent me an article from harvard medical university and says now they have they have proof now that there is sicknesses and symptoms of physical sicknesses that are directly tied to social media that's not a christian organization that's harvard medical university now they discover people with symptoms of this i'll read it to you in a minute but you know i just say this we would all be better off without any of this that's going to be extreme to you because you can't live without your phone i was sitting on my porch this morning holding my phone you know you do this you check the news you check your emails you know and i just looked at i said you you devil and then i started to think about going in a rapture and i and i thought this is a great thought when i leave i'm leaving this phone and that was a great joy in my heart i'm leaving it all i'm leaving that beautiful home and i thank god for it i'm leaving it all and the only thing that goes is the character that he's created in me by the holy ghost that's the only thing that's going up all of it stan including my phone including my rental properties including the businesses including it all sister jane praise the lord brother dana even my phone is staying does that make you a little nervous i don't know about leaving that we're leaving it friends it's done it's finished never have to look at it again [Applause] never have to use it as my alarm to get up in the morning again no alarms can you say amen some of you brothers ought to praise the lord for that trying to get you on board you know i'd like to preach we should we'd be better off without it i'm just taking my time here now we would be better off without any of it can you say amen i'd like to preach a sermon i've been thinking about later i'd like to preach a sermon don't you ever criticize the amish that would be the title of my sermon we go over to amish country ship shawana mostly we like it over there one of the things i've noticed the last few months when we go over took my mom the other day but it's it's i'm not going to christianize or de-christianize these people i don't know what the amish have but all i know is when we go over there we took brandon and tiffany we notice a peacefulness once we just come into the entire area you go try it when you get out of the city and get away with all this demon power and you have an atmosphere of a people who for the most part don't feed on these things don't allow their children to feed on them most of them they are allowed to have phones and they got business they're functioning just fine and you have criticized the image amish in their dress and oh i could never live that way without electricity and without all my makeup and all this i could never live that way you know you're right you probably couldn't live that way but don't you dare criticize them no matter what you think they are as christians because just the fact that they've applied some holiness standards has helped the atmosphere and i said it to a couple of them that were in the stores i said what i notice over here is the atmosphere and she said well thank you very much a lot of people say that that it's just different it's peaceful we drive out there we see the horses it's just different pull that quote up sister genie just so you know that we got something to back it up no wonder the voice of god is a rare thing today it's smothered out by so many different voices so many things that dim and take away it's got to be a place until it dulls our senses until we can hear the voice of god our senses of where we ought to shake ourselves and realize that you are men and women and you are the creation of god and you were put here to serve him but satan's voice and false prophets oh be modern as i was speaking a few days ago i was coming to a church and i turned my radio on and i heard a program out of louisville that said that they were teaching their children in churches to just drink moderately making them modern so that they won't go to the excess we're going to teach our children to drink moderation so that you don't don't drink in excess that's that's stupid all right man that waits upon god comes into his prayer oh wait i didn't finish it how could the voice oh i didn't finish it back please okay how could the as i was speaking a few days ago okay teaching the children making them moderate so they won't go to excess okay i was done oh they need to teach them christ not drinking and that will wreck and room and damn any home how could the voice of god speak among a family that's half sauce with whiskey and their minds paralyzed with smoking and drinking and all night long carousing men that waits upon god comes into his presence and to come into the presence of god is just like going out early in the morning when the dew and the honeysuckles are all sweet when you come in the presence of a person like that you know they've been with god my wife said to me coming down this morning she said billy i don't mean to say this to flower at anybody but she said last night i believe in one of the nights she said i sat by one of the little amish women and a little lady with a little cap on her head and she said and you could tell that woman had been with jesus for she was sweet her soul was mellow her eyes were clear there's not no sin or nothing to hide behind or anything she had been in the presence of god don't you dare mock holiness don't you dare mock the standards that they have because it can have a result can you say man her senses was not dull by whiskey and tobacco and all kinds of things of the world she was refreshed from the presence of god reading her bible and studying god's word we need more message people to have that kind of sweetness and that kind of not a dull of our senses that's why we're tired sometimes on sunday morning because we've been on up all night watching movies and our senses are dull to spiritual things but once you come out of that world and get into his world you'll really start enjoying the services more when am i going to preach that don't you dare criticize the amish would you dare do that you know what i read a book over there every one of their teenagers every one of them have a choice to choose whether to remain an amish or whether to go to the world every one of them are given a choice you know they have a retention rate of about 91 percent i read that i said wow maybe some of them without even the holy ghost i'm not going to de-christianize but without a real birth but just just a standard of of keeping from the things of the world just with that and 91 choose on their own i want this lifestyle of an amish what do we as americans even within our church sometimes young people i want the world i want to go after it i would something is wrong don't you dare criticize the amish don't dare criticize someone else and say they're legalists maybe some of them are but i'll tell you when we apply the word of god there are results that come from it that are benefits oh you understand that i'm not a legalist preacher and then you can make a religion out of your dress and not have the real thing you understand that but let's not swing that way and say there's not benefits to the spirit of modesty being talked to our children that if you if you if you stop feeding on these worldly things and you back off from it like i tell my children you do that you're going to pay for it you're going to you get certain age okay you go ahead and do it but you're going to pay for it because it only has one result clouding your mind with all kinds of junk and spiritually numb they have to make their own choice but i'm not going to quit saying it because i'm not a legalist people used to call tim pruitt a legalist and he said listen i'm not the one that legalized sin and that's just the way he'd say it bless god i'm not a legalist i'm not the one that legalized sin it's satan that legalized sin what we fill our minds with stuff can slip through it's the new problem in the world more than ever more medicine we have more medicines than ever and in itself it brings we have illnesses brother ed hememeister the pastor in edmonton sent me this article after last sunday you can look it up i don't have time to read it all harvard medical school ticks and tick tock can social media trigger illness just just came out i believe a student suddenly develops leg pain and paralysis soon hundreds of schoolmates have similar symptoms nuns begin biting each other and soon the same thing is happening at other nearby convents three school girls began laughing uncontrollably sometimes going on for days when nearly 100 classmates developed the same problem the school was forced to close down yet in each case no medical explanation was ever found eventually they came to be considered examples of mass sociogenic illness which many of us know by different names mass hysteria epidemic hysteria or mass psychogenic illness over the years many possible sources for these illnesses have emerged and today tick tock and other social media sites may be providing fertile ground just to confirm this next quote just to confirm all the way back in 1955 our prophet says just recently even cancer has been declared to be a fourth dimension disease that it's in another dimension sure it's demonology every disease is a fourth dimension disease the beginning of it so you got an illness you got a sickness and it doesn't always come this way sometimes you get an illness for other reasons but sometimes it begins in the fourth dimension what you're feeding on and then you develop a sickness from it and that's why i was saying we not only need prayer lines for physical healing but we need prayer lines for mental healing mental illness to bring back a sound mind to ones that have lost their sound thinking through social media i'm glad today to be a son of god i'm glad today to have the soundness of the word of god i wouldn't be right i wouldn't be right and i still make mistakes but i wouldn't be this right in my thinking unless it was the grace of god to give me to some something to feed on other than all the things of the world let me raise that i'm thankful for the word of god that i can feed on my mind is not a garbage can my mind is not a channel satan can use to bring more illnesses to my body my mind belongs to the lord my body belongs to the lord this is a temple of the holy ghost a lot of people yield themselves to wear the right dress and the right clothes and the right things and and have the right things in their home but their mind is privately feeding on things that are bringing in sicknesses and illnesses and mental illness and i'm encouraging you in the name of the lord let's let's be standing and filled with the spirit this is unbelievable to realize that these social media things can have the possibility of actually a channel to bring physical illness to our children and anyone else should read this next sunday when all the young people are back not to be mean but we better have our guard or the holy spirit up it's unbelievable go ahead and read the article but there is a bomb in gilead if we don't feed on and take the medicine he has given us our minds can't make it blair park a christian writer wrote this he said a healing balm as i begin to talk about this and draw it down to a close i'm only at 12 24 got lots of time praise the lord i got lots of time left blair park wrote this a healing balm was used as medicinal solution in ancient times which was probably administered by a medical man or wise woman in a village to help cure many types of ailments these early investments into bombs allowed present day doctors and nurses to reach new depths of healing for several illnesses and diseases over the course of time it is safe to assume that there were healing bombs used in bible times as they are used today so in the book of jeremiah there was one balm in particular mentioned by jeremiah here at the bomb of gilead of which the prophet jeremiah asked god why he hadn't supplied this treasured bomb to help the healing of his people and their ways as we learn more about the bomb of gilead in the multiple ways it's discussed in the bible we will start to realize that the balm is also a metaphor for the only one who can save us from a disastrous fate jesus christ the bomb in gilead becomes the type of the blood our atonement what our lord did for us and when he provided the blood the atonement it provided for everything you got this term now marijuana is legal it's for medicinal purposes but then people run away from the holy ghost right they run away from the presence of god but you see it's the presence of the lord his blood his word is for medicinal purposes you come to church because of medicinal purposes you need medicine you need the balm so they have it in these things and they have a cream and all these different things this i just grabbed at home today coco because this is what i use this is when i get a sunburn and it slews the sunburn just puts it on there and you know it feels really good and it comes from some cocoa and plants and they put it all together and put it on there and i hurt my elbow yesterday bro bob and that's the kind of stuff i'll grab some of those bombs sometimes and or anchors that's a big one my father-in-law sells this is unkers and it's just for pain you know and it'll be the older people in here right that understand the little pains that comes you get a bomb or you get even if you get a cut there's stuff that you put on it that helps with the healing it helps soothe it can you say man for medicinal purposes amen and you can put it for whatever is aching in joints so he put it anywhere i just this is a simple illustration but i'm just saying that god did not leave anything out for spiritual sicknesses for mental sicknesses i'm going to take that off because you're not listening to me today we have it all for every part of the body for everything isn't that say something that the bomb and gilead the blood what god provided is still good today and it's provided for everything including mental illness including anxiety including depression including loneliness including the spirits and i mean it's got it all in it the blood of jesus christ didn't just cleanse you from your sins but there's power in the blood of the lamb for victory can you say amen there's power in the blood for protection why are you going to church well it's for medicinal purposes but it seems like you're just so bent on that you're so you're obsessed with going to church yes i am i'm obsessed with being in the word of god i'm obsessed with being in this presence i need the balm and gillian to heal me do you know how many texts i get and i say this not boasting but i thank god for the texts i get got one last night get them all the time people listening in and saying this the bride they're so let me just say this the balm in gilead was for people that were sick and however remember what jesus said when the pharisees criticized his disciples and criticized them he said to them i haven't come to for the whole the people that are well i've come for the sick. i've given my i'm going to give my atonement for the ones who are broken the ones who make mistakes the ones who come from a life of sin i've come for the ones who have mental illness i've come with the healing bomb for the ones who are having anxiety i didn't come for the ones the self-righteous pharisees that got it all together and they're perfect i didn't come for those this message is not for the perfect people it's for imperfect people and i get texts all the time last night thank you brother i wouldn't mention the name but thank you brother we've been watching for six months and he said my wife and i needed such healing we needed healing i think they had lost a son and and and so your ministry has provided such healing and when i hear that word i wrote i'm so grateful because it's not me it's god has provided healing for every disease healing for the wounded heart healing for damaged message people why are you using that term because there's a lot of damaged messes people that have tired of politics tired of the legalism tired of this and they're listening in because why they just want to hear this message without any strings attached to it no agendas just preach it the way god brought it can you say man let it do its work in your life healing can you say man healing let me find this one part of what why he said gilead and then we'll we'll be bringing it down here he goes on to say this writer blair park he says i'm reading this christian writer here because it inspired me it was wonderful he said some good things he said as we learn more about the bomb of gilead and the multiple ways it's discussed in the bible we will start to realize that the bomb is also a metaphor for the only one that could save us from a disastrous fate jesus christ the place of gilead is recognized in the bible for being listen to this now and you're believers so you'll catch this the origin of it because to me you won't value the balm and the message and whatever we call it you won't value it unless you know the source of it so when jeremiah says is there an obama and gilead there was a bomb in gilead but why did he that's the first time in the bible that he mentions a bomb for israel's spiritual healing and he mentions the mountain of gilead the city of gilead why did he attach the bomb to gilead and that's why i started to research why why gilead what's so special about gilead you see you have to recognize the source of where our bomb comes from and when you know the source the source of it then you have value for it to listen to it to feed on it to to get in the presence of it to expose yourself to it whatever you can do you're going to be doing that more because you see the value this is the source this is where it comes from and the bomb of gilead is used multiple times but he said the place is he says it's it's it's the place of gilead is recognized in the bible for being number one the birthplace of elijah the balm of gilead the first place first reason it was which it's the birthplace of elijah amen the second reason gileads mentioned second thing that happened there is the place that jacob and laban met so if you don't know the story quickly jacob jacob he you know the lord calls him abraham isaac jacob he's got the promise over his life the same promise as abraham so jacob goes out he's going to find a wife and so he's he's laban has these two daughters he laban ends up deceiving him and then jacob's the deceiver so he deceives his father-in-law a bit he ends up with leah he wanted the racist they worked another seven years you know the story of god goes so then when everything prospers under jacob because the son of god the sheep and everything prospered that he decides i'm going to get out of here i'm going to go back to my home country so he grabs his wives his children his cattle everything and he sneaks out without telling laban his father-in-law and he sneaks out and heads and gets all the way down the road here and laban finds out about it he says i'm going after him get you get your things boys we're going to go after him we're going to we're going to do him in i'm going to be real quick with this he gets there to gilead and he's getting ready to take jacob out and god comes to laban in a dream and says don't say anything good or bad to jacob in other words keep your hands off of him don't touch him you remember that happened with abraham and isaac when they went down into when he went down into gorier and the king's going to marry his wife and god comes to the dream and said if you touch that woman you're a dead man but lord he lied to me he said it was his sister so i'm free i know what he said i know abraham lied i'll take care of him but he's my son and he's under a promise you touch his life you're a dead man you're finished i want you to notice now the protection that goes with the balm and gilead friends i'm here to tell you that there are times when you're clinging to this word that you do not know the protections god has watched over you and your family you do not know some incidences where things could have happened and god stepped in and protected you from it why because it's the bauman gilead and he said to laban he said you don't talk to him so the next day he just basically approaches it why'd you take my daughter's why jesus he's asking the question but he wasn't going to kill him because god had talked to him so all i'm saying is that when there's a promised son of god and he's under the promise that the covenant with god in other words he didn't make it was an unconditional covenant that was holding over jacob's life abraham's life isaac's life and when you have that covenant over your life there's a protection that goes there's a bomb in gilead and it's not just about elijah's message or elijah it's about a protection from demon powers that are hounding you laban was hounding and going after him and god steps in and says you're not gonna take him keep your hands off of him how many times when you're struggling in your mind and demons are coming and affecting your mind and you just pray and say god help me i feel too weak to handle this how many times has god stepped in it could have went further and god steps into the demon power and says that's enough you know why you know he does this you know why i know because i just preached it in the word god will do it for a son and daughter of god what does this bomb have in it what kind of power does it have in it that even sometimes we can't see the protections that's been put in place and god steps in for us all right the last thing that's in gilead prophet elijah's birthplace jacob and laban meet which means the protection of the lord from demons that we don't have power over the demons that we cannot they're hounding us and coming after us how many raise your hand says sometimes if he likes demons are hounding me there's a bomb in gilead there's a protection in the token hallelujah the last thing that happened in gideon is it was the battlefield in gibby in in gilead it was the battlefield of gideon and the midianites where gideon was named the victor so in our bomb in our atonement is not just forgiveness of sins but it's protection from demon power and you know what else it's victory for the believer there's victory in it there's victory in it why did jeremiah call for it the first time a balm and gillian well he just makes the secrets known to his prophets and there what he said in the bomb and gilead if the israelites or the people in jerusalem would have taken their bibles and they would have researched it when he said bomb and gilead kind of what i did the other night most people said okay bauman gilead no i want to say why did he call it the bomb gillian and he'd get there if they'd got their bibles out if they'd got their scrolls out whatever it was and they had to research it they would have seen wow this bomb for him to heal us has power behind it it has elijah behind it it's got a lot of stuff in it it's got protection from demons in it we ought to be interested in that but it's got victory in it and the thing about gideon i'd like to preach on him another hour because gideon was the underdog gideon was the guy with complexes gideon was the guy when god said you're a mighty man of valor and you're going to go up and give the midianites yourself he wasn't even anybody great nobody knew him and he said lord you've got the wrong gideon it's not me it's who are you talking to if i am not a mighty man of valor and and god said yes you are and gideon said no i am not i'm the least among my family i don't have any money and he kept bringing up excuses and excuses and excuses constantly his complexes i'm not strong enough to handle the midianites myself you got the wrong guy and god kept saying no i got the right guy and every time he would be bring up an excuse i'm not strong enough for this i'm not the guy i must not be like the other believers i'm not strong enough to to overcome these things every time he brought up god never sympathized with him god never had a pity party with him god just had the book of life right in front of him and the only thing he could read in the book of life was gideon here's your name bud i wish gideon was here get in listen up here's your name in the book of life gideon semicolon mighty man of valor but that's not me i don't have any money and my i'm the least of my brother and i don't have any strength to be able to do this and god didn't go say really oh okay maybe i better choose somebody else god does not have a pity party with you with your complexes and all your excuses for not serving god he's looking at one thing and that's the book of life your name in the book of life and if you're in there whatever it says you will be victorious but lord i'm not mighty man of hour but lord this mighty man of valor it's the only thing it says it doesn't read anything else your complexes aren't even in here gideon come on saints your mistakes aren't in here you're feeling the least of your families not in here your complexes aren't even mentioned in the book of life why are you giving so much time to them those things aren't in the book of life that's your other life that's your former life my new book can you say amen the new book of life your new marriage certificate brother adam says that old husband is dead that old life is dead amen it's none of your accomplice that's why all abraham's mistakes are in the old testament and none of them are mentioned in the new testament oh he says he was a man of faith he staggered not at the promises of god did you know that none of his mistakes none of going to career none of lying none of all the stuff that he did david all the it's it's gone it's gone and if it's gone for them it's gone for me talking about what's in the bomb this morning and i think you've got it i'm going to have prayer for you this way anyone who wants prayer you know what i'm going to do i'm going to apply the bomb i have a bomb here this morning for your healing what do we do when we have bomb we apply it what do we do have when we have the token we apply it don't come to church together praise the lord we got the token no you got to go home and apply it read the token it's not just having the token it's the application of the token i kicked this out and i kicked that out and i apply these things i'm applying the blood to my home so if you've got a a bomb you've got a soothing sauce salve it's not going to do you any good until you apply it in the balm first coming of christ and i'm closing first coming of christ what did it start with elijah i didn't finish on gideon he finally got the strength man i tell you i gotta finish stuff he got the strength and he went and there was he had 32 000 soldiers with him and they were getting ready to take the many nights and he felt pretty comfortable with doing it he still was a guy who liked fleeces i'm going to put out a fleece and god got anger in him god get angry at him because he's asking for these please i just need a little more confirmation i know i'm the one i'm in the book of life but could you just confirm it one more time a lot of people are fleece oriented like gideon was that's fine i can't find too much of it in the bible because when god tells you to do something his word you should just go do it but if i just get a i'm going to put a fleece out before the lord and guess what god gave it to him said keep encouraging him so he gets asked for a fleece but then he's got 32 000 men and he's getting ready to go take the minionites and god says you got too many because if you go with 32 000 some of your soldiers are going to say we did this we did it and i'm not going to let anybody say we did it i want the glory to go to me to god under your leadership gideon i want him to give glory so so he knocks down knocks it down to takes away ten thousand now he's got twenty two thousand hope i'm writing these numbers i'm sure some people correct me out but you see now then he's ready to go with twenty two thousand god says you still have too many people and gets them down on the water those that lapped up the water you know the story those loud and he's left with brother bob he's left with 300 men out of 32 000. this this is the bomb and gilead this is what happened in gilead this is the teaching in gilead is that my bomb my victory for you my victory is not going to be something that you had to do with i'm going to eliminate all the chances for you to say i did this but you're going to have a victory you're going to end with a victory in this runs in there with 300 men and overcome them won the battle gideon became a great hero and that all happened in gilead the mount gilead and so the last day's message excuse me second first coming of christ i gotta end first coming of christ started with elijah can you say amen start with elijah and then i was just looking here for a couple quotes and looking for something here that that was related because you see the same elements within the first coming of christ and that is it started with elijah so in the bomb is elijah in his message to introduce the messiah and then we find that jesus was protected from the demonic power even though they were out to get him jesus went in a boat and satan got in the winds is we're gonna i'm gonna destroy him brother says i'm gonna destroy that because he's in the boat i'm gonna destroy that vessel trying to kill jesus and all the time god god just uses him he stands up and says peace be still he had control of the demons but he couldn't take jesus because he was protected same elements can you say amen and then christ in the first coming goes to calvary goes to a resurrection and i like that song they saying the other week that choir said god has the final say god has the final say god got the final victory in jesus in the first coming who got the final victory it looked like calvary looked like satan did and then the resurrection proved he got the final victory you may go through anxiety you may go through hard times you may go through your mind it's not straightened out you may go through sicknesses cancer disease you may go through a lot of things but guess what you stay feeding on this balm and this this salve and this atonement i could i can tell you safely you're going to get the final victory because in this bomb you get the final victory the message of the last days the second coming of christ opens with elijah again introducing the elijah spirit comes with a great message it's part of our atonement it's part of the word that he brought and then there's a protection over elijah there's a quote and go away jesus he says in the angel the man with his back to the tent why did sarah laugh and she said she ran out and confessed i didn't say that she lie but you did now god could have took sarah sarah's life right there but he couldn't hurt her for she was part of abraham oh we'd be gone long ago if it wasn't part of christ all the things that he's done and we went around and said it's telepathy it's this that the other the message is this the message is occult all these other things you see sometimes people say things but don't give up hope to them something people get under an influence of somebody else you can say a lot of things it's telepathy it's this out there but he can't touch you see wrath can't touch you because you're part of christ when you're born again you see he couldn't do it it's because it hurt abraham i'm saying this for when the devil tells you they're hounding you they're after you and you're going to be overwhelmed and you're going to be overcome and you're going to be outnumbered but i'm telling you in our atonement when we're outnumbered we're not outnumbered god has a spirit there holding back the demons he couldn't do it because it hurt abraham his promise was to abraham and sarah was a part of abraham and the church is a part of christ the bride see he couldn't do it although her unbelief she had unbelief she made mistakes but because she was part of the covenant with abraham judgment even the judgment of god couldn't touch her the judgments of the world demons couldn't touch you i'm here to tell you if you haven't understood it yet that in our bomb in our atonement is not just the word of elijah but there's a protection for our children for our families from demonic power to be able to come in and take over because we're under the covenant and the last thing is victory in the bride at the last days we're going to get a victory and the thing about jesus the thing about gideon he was the underdog but he got the victory anyway the thing about jesus at calvary he went to calvary alone it looked like he was the underdog but he got the victory anyway so in the last days the bride the bride is going to get the final say out of satan's eden there's going to be a bride and god's going to get the final victory through that bride there's going to be a victory because in our atonement it's the final say the final victory last quote sister genie if you have it there and then you can come to a church where they're trying to preach the gospel and to demonstrate the power of the holy ghost they call us holy rotors and write them up and all kinds of things that they can say about them shows the devils on the rampage but god's church will never fail she'll move from victory unto victory until jesus comes for his bride hallelujah i'm going to read that again god's church will never fail i said god's church will never fail gideon you can't fail you will beat the midianites because that's what the book of life says you'll do and i don't care if the hounds or hell are speaking to your mind god's church will never fail and she'll move from victory unto victory until jesus comes for his bride and the rapture will be the final victory hallelujah hallelujah let's stand that's he's talking about you you'll go from victory to victory to victory but the big thing you get the final victory ah the musicians are coming but i'm just going to say if you have a special need i have the balm this morning you have the balm it not only has healing for physical it has healing for mental it has healing for emotional it has everything in it that's why i'd like to sing brother michael the blood will never lose its power that verse says it soothes my doubts it calms my fear that's a bomb the blood is not only forgiveness of sins it soothes my doubts it calms my fears it gives me the final victory the blood that jesus shed for me let's sing it before we pray and i'm going to ask if you want to come
