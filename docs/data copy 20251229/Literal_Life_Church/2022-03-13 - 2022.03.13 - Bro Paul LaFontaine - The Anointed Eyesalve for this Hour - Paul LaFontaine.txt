========================================

blind man and by the way it took me by the surpri by a bit of a surprise that the faith was raised by last sunday by speaking of that not only for people to come forward and ask for spiritual healing of their eyes impaired spiritually people asking for prayer and coming forward and maybe you did it in your seat but not only that for people receiving faith to come and ask for problems with their child or their their physical eyes i was amazed and i'm believing that every need that was presented jesus is going to open their eyes we have children that's having trouble already and i thought praise god that the faith was raised say if jesus could do it back then he can do it now he's the god that opens up the blinded eyes and he's the god that heals impaired eyes amen so but the story that we read was a bit different and that's why i read it it's different than the familiar story of blind bartimaeus or the other blind people that came to jesus it's a bit different in the sense that there had there was a second phase of jesus completing his eyesight that was better the first time jesus touched him but and and and we know that god can do that and god's able to do it the first time he's able to do a complete healing the first time how many believe that but yet in this incident we see another example here set that that after jesus touched him the first time he was still a bit impaired in his vision it was better but it was not completely clear yet and i was just amazed at that and to see that his sight that was better as he touched him the first time but it was still impaired so it says that jesus touched his eyes again jesus ministered to him again jesus came and laid his hands on again and thank god because impaired vision spiritually impaired vision spiritually is one of the to me one of the greatest issues with christians today is that they have impaired visions spiritually and thank god that jesus our same jesus can take someone who's impaired in their vision spiritually and don't see jesus right and don't see people right jesus can touch your eyes again [Music] thank god of that this morning can you say mom he touched his eyes he spit in his hands and he rubbed the spit in his eyes and he touched his eyes again because he wouldn't leave him there in a in an impaired state he wouldn't leave him that it wasn't perfectly 20 20 vision he wouldn't leave him that way it was going to be 20 20 vision or be nothing because that's the way jesus wants to do it he must see and he must see clearly hallelujah so and as we ended last sunday you can keep trying and i said these i want to say them again you can keep trying to view things through your past you can keep trying to view things through your past hurts you can view things free through your rose-colored glasses you can keep viewing things from your past denominational view and mind you that does happen in this message were people in the message for years but they keep viewing the message through their pentecostal slant or through their baptist slat or through their messiness slant and they see it all that way that's an impaired vision we don't need to run it through a filter of denominations past but we need to see jesus clearly without any taintedness to the vision can you say mom and so you can continue to view it through your pride you can continue to view this church and what's preached and the message through your self-centeredness or you can say lord touch my eyes again touch my eyes that i can see this clearly hallelujah amen i wanted to read the laodicean church age because like jesus did with the blind man in a second touched he touched his eyes again really the same thing happens with the laodicean church age because the church who once had what she needed in other words the church through the ages had clear eyesight the church could see things the church could do things but now they're in a blinded condition but they originally because god touched the church they could they weren't in this state in the other ages you don't hear of them being naked you don't hear of them being blinded spiritually the other church ages you don't hear of them being poor spiritually it's only the last stage that we have this condition and so they were clear everything was fine then they end up in this condition but just like jesus touched the blind man again he gives the laodicean church an opportunity to come out of their blindness to come out of their nakedness can you say man he gives another opportunity he touches their eyes again he said i'll provide for you some i salve for your eyes and if you'll put it on you'll see in this blind age jesus loves you this morning jesus loves his church and his love provides what's needed for the conditions that we're in you can try to provide it yourself you can try to go to other means you can try to work it out yourself but jesus is provided for conditions especially spiritual conditions spiritual states that people are in god can transform a backslidden christian backslidden sometimes and don't know it but god can god can love them back into what kind of life that he wants them to live never give up on backslidden christians you don't give up on yourself isn't that funny how we never give up on ourselves we always come out smelling like a rose but if you don't ever give up on yourself and say well i still love god and i'm fine i'll come around someday well give that same grace to someone else amen so a church that once had what she needed now fell into a condition spiritually one thing was blindness the blindness is what i want to talk about this morning you know you can't get more tragic than a man stumbling around that's the way brother bram said it you can't get much more of a tragic situation of a man physically blind and physically naked stumbling around walking around and bumps into things and doesn't know where he's going that condition that's what was described by a symbolism that's the spiritual condition of the laodicean church as a whole that she's stumbling around spiritually you can't get worse than someone completely naked and not knowing they're naked and completely blind you can't get much more tragic than that i'm going to tell you that person needs help that person cannot get out of it on their own can i get an amen this morning that's a condition that they can't get around they can't function they can't cl they can't do anything they need somebody's help to get out of it [Applause] amen and so that's when he says it won't be as a big church revival but his grace offers a way out to individuals a way out of labor say he will lead you out of it and if he didn't we would all listen if god didn't give us a way out we'd all be laodicean christians we'd all be caught in the spirit of laodicea even us if god didn't give us a way out because god could not leave oh i just i love this god would not leave his elect with impaired vision i mean it's the last age it's the last time and at the very final thing he would leave leave us in a condition of being spiritually blind in this day when we need eyesight greater than we've ever needed it before to navigate and see through all the muddiness of politics through all the the fuzziness of opinions the information age the opinion age and all it does is make we think you know there's a lot of people that think that this is great the information age this is wonderful but there's a there's a downside to it and that is so many opinions of millions opinions are thrown out there and for a young simple heart that just needs god it's confusion because i wonder if this person's right i wonder if this person's right why is that person doing and wearing this and they're saying they believe this and it's just confusion and it blinds and makes everything all fuzzy can you say man i tell you we needed eyesight in this hour we needed isab for our eyes praise the lord he wouldn't leave his elect with impaired vision not in these times they have to see things have to be cleared and that's why the seventh messenger angel could not just be a reformal reformer excuse me the last messenger the seventh everybody knows there was seven angels to the seven churches their angels their messengers the last one could not be just a reformer the last one had to be a prophet why does the last one need to be a prophet because the prophet in the bible is the eye i mean he knows the prophet and the bible's an eye he's the eye by vision he sees when we're bound by fuzziness and can't make clarity of what's going on when israel was under ahab and he become fuzzy and he was so fuzzy in his clarity he lost all of what he was supposed to believe mary to jezebel everything was fight if you marry a jezebel you're just all cloudy you don't see who to marry correct and abhabab the king of israel his vision become cloudy you can safely say that by who he married praise the lord you can safely say that his vision had become cloudy choosing the character he needed to to choose because his vision was cloudy he chose the wrong woman he led israel the wrong way and the only answer was an elijah prophet with the eye of god to be able to give israel clarity and call it what it was [Applause] praise the lord so things have to be clear and that's why the seventh angel messenger cannot be a reformer but a prophet the prophet is the eye the eye part of the body of christ that's the prophet how can we function without our eyes without an eye how can we function without a prophet given a vision for the hour psalms 32 and verse 8 psalms 32 and verse 8 says i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go i will instruct thee and i will teach thee in the way which thou should go how many can say praise the lord for that god will be personal i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way that thou shalt go i will guide thee by mine that's a prophet that's a prophet so the bride has to have 20 20 vision in these times we we must see through this fog of this information age a knowledge age you know information is not revelation more information isn't always good knowledge is not always revelation knowledge is not revelation you've heard the term i've heard it in the last few weeks the fog of war i didn't know that term until recently the fog of war and that we that that that says that in the fog when war happens there's a fog in other words about how information gets out a lot of stuff can be reported that's not really happening it's the fog of war and everybody gets nervous and everybody starts reacting and this is happening because of this and brother jared one of our ministers of the church has been sending me some things directly from the ukrainian consulate from here in the states because i would rather be making sure that we read accurate information when we report on it and so we see that it's a fog foggy time for the fog of war the wrong information can get sent in these times more than ever and daniel 12 and verse 4 if you'd pull the scripture up daniel 12 and verse 4 says but thou o daniel and he remember he has the mystery of what's supposed to happen in the last days and he says oh daniel shut up the words seal the book even to the time of the end so now there's a mystery about what all is supposed to take in place seal it up until the end time says it in revelations 10 as well where john sees it and he says no it's not time yet seal it up john seal with 17 seals but at the end time he'll give eyesight in other words in an end time he'll burst the mystery forth and everybody will understand well excuse me i should say the elect is going to understand can you say amen but oh daniel shut up the words seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased you know what that's saying that in knowledge will be increased because of that people will run to and fro inconsistent unfaithful jumping around you don't know what they believe from one week to the next because of all this knowledge can you say man but he says right at the time where knowledge will be increased that's when i'm gonna take the seven seals off and reveal the mystery of god because why my people are gonna need it because they're gonna live in the middle of many run and to and fro not knowing the right information not knowing the revelation and the knowledge will be increased my people are going to need clarity they're going to need vision they're going to need to see and so save it save it save it until the end time [Applause] tell your friends i'm going to get excited in a minute here the grace of god gives it in the end time save this unveiling they're going to need it through the eye of a prophet it can't be a reformer tmi is too much information should preach a sermon on that tmi our children and our young people it's too much information florida had to block a law they wanted to bring the teaching of homosexuality to four and five-year-olds and thank god for a governor says we better pass the law and stop this imagine the mind of a parent can you imagine that the pervertedness of a parent that would say first of all it should be in parents hands completely to teach that child about sex and to teach them from the word of god this is correct and this is wrong this is sinful this is an but abomination what news flash they're coming for your kids sodom and gomorrah is coming for your kids they're coming for their minds at five years old in this age without a prophetic eye you will be like gehey's a high heisei you said oh lord what are we going to do elijah's servant what in the world are we going to do we are surrounded we're finished and it was all about the eyesight i mean this isn't just an unbeliever this is the servant of elisha under the prophet there's somebody that close to him and his eyesight is impaired come on people he's in the message he believes elijah's the prophet he's a servant to him but his vision is impaired and all of a sudden he's a we're surrounded we're finished they're everywhere and the prophet says oh lord that's the way brother bryan said please open the boy's eyes and sometimes i'd say most the time that's what we need if we're living in fear god needs to open your eyes if we're living in the lust of the world god needs to open your eyes if we're living by the fashions of the world god needs to open our eyes if we're with him with a tainted view of this message god needs to open our eyes that's the answer can you say man [Applause] lord opened the boy's eyes and all of a sudden his eyes were open and there was a host of angels and a host of chariots surrounding that army and that's all he needed to see we're all right we're fine let me tell you today friends i don't care what's going on in this world i don't care how fearful things are happening i don't care how many men's hearts are failing for fear [Applause] i'm looking at something different can you say man and elijah said boy there's more with us than with them [Applause] that's the way we need to see it when fear grips our heart and we're scared of what's happening in the world we need i see eyesight and a revelation guess what there's more with us than with them [Applause] the world's crowding into my family the world the spirit of satan is trying to take my marriage and to take my family but you need that faith that says but there's more that's supporting us that's what the devil's coming against us there's more with us there's more standing on your side there's more angels than there is demons can you say man there's more of god behind you than what satan is against you [Applause] i tell young people you make the slightest little desire towards god all of heaven is backing you up all of heaven is backing you up devil tries to tell you you don't have any friends the devil tries to tell you you're alone there's nobody i'm trying to do this all on my own i'm in this little church that's by myself there's no fellowship and let me tell you something i don't care the conditions you are not alone all of heaven is backing you up blessed be his name it's the seventh angel that the mystery of god is finished so he has to be a prophet because we need the eye of god to lead us out i'm gonna pull a couple quotes up here now if someone you know what let me just stop here if someone is blind then it until their eyes are open it takes another with eyes to lead them out you don't get another blind man to lead a blind man this is i know this is common sense preaching but excuse me let me just get it straight if you're becoming backslidden blind spiritually you don't need to be commuting communicating with somebody on the internet that's blind themselves you don't need to be forming friendships with anybody that doesn't have any eyesight whatsoever they're not going to lead you out solomon go to the back of the church solomon you're blind you're blind as a bat so i have to illustrate here a little bit how god has given us great to lead us out of the conditions of laodicea we're not going with the solomon you're blind you're naked you're poor we're not going with the naked here in the service you should be thankful for that don't open your eyes now you're blind you're naked you're poor actually the poor one someone's in that state right now so that's pretty good he's a starving student trying to finish up and makes a big money someday you're poor naked you're blind but the blindness is what i want to get to today and so i want you to do your best solomon with your eyes closed to make it out of your condition and make it up to me i want you to come to me don't open your eyes don't touch nothing don't touch anything don't touch nothing you don't listen very well well you found the aisle amen so god says i'll take your hand you know you're in a condition if you live the rest of your life this way you're probably gonna hurt yourself and so you're in this condition at laodicea i'll be your eyes solomon right and i'm going to guide you out of this condition completely it's hard to trust me i'll guide thee by mine eye i'll give you a prophet with eyesight to take you out of laodicea if you give your pastor respects he's ordained of god to lead you through to the other side take a step take a step one more step three steps now i'm gonna give you new clothes for my righteousness i'm gonna give you the riches of the gold that comes out of your trials i'm going to anoint your eyes with isaf because i want you to know his friends now it's not just guiding somebody out of their condition the bible says anoint thine eyes with i said that thou mayest see you can't continue on and just depend on just someone else leading you he says no no no i'll give you isaf that you can see things right is that what the bible says it's not just the prophet at isaf it's not just the pastors have i said but i'm going to take it and if you'll let me i'll apply it i'll apply it to your eyes and when i apply the isab your impaired vision will come open and the first thing that you see is jesus christ the way you should see him rejoice shout rejoice [Applause] it's not just that he helps lead you out but he anoints your eyes with isabel isn't that the message isn't that what this is all about isn't it what i said last sunday is that unless you see jesus correctly nothing else will be right church this church that never be right we must be looking at christ in him alone thank you solomon god bless you let's give them a hand god bless you take those quotes i'll take those quotes here the first one in door to heart spiritual blindness is 10 million times worse than physical blindness if i had to go blind in my eyes and go blind in my spirit god take my eyes before my spirit let my eyes be open to see his glory anoint mine eyes lord with i salve don't let cold come in and set up infection and coldness indifference denominations creeds doctrines he's mentioning all the things that cloud the eyes spiritually doctrines and so forth that gives you pneumonia and your eyes have been all mattered and swelled up until now god can show his glory you can hear somebody enjoying it so-and-so got healed why can't i just open your eyes to see the glory he's here christ still lives the next one is i want to read in jesus at the door and another message he's preached on it here the other day a woman in louisville she was taking her little boy around to places and the counters of the 10 cent stores and she was saying look honey and the little fella set staring and she took him to another counter she said look honey and he just stared and the people begin to watch her and finally she picked up a little trinket that made a noise and she said look honey and the little fella just stared and she fell across the counter screaming and the people come to find out if they could comfort her they said what's the matter and she said he's a little human being said he's he's the offspring of our union husband and i and i said he's got to a place that he won't even notice things that pertain to human beings his mind has become add-on and he just stares here's a parent screaming and and anybody who is a parent has this start to happen to a child it affects us it affects us because you know i might be one thing at 55 years old and becoming vision impaired but to live the rest of your life that way that's a concern and now something's changing with his eyesight and his mind she said he doesn't even notice things that pertain to human beings something was happening and their reaction is just she's she's just screaming because she's about she's going crazy she's just oh don't let this happen oh i can't believe this is happening i can't believe i tell you parents need to be screaming in their hearts and crying to god because the devil's after your children's minds the devil wants to impair your vision the devil is after sodom was at lot's door knocking on the door we need some parents to arise we need some parents to check everything that their children are watching we need to be concerned about the hour that we live in in this case it's about our children just as much physically as this child is losing his eyesight but spiritually satan wants to impair the vision that the kids don't see marriage right and the kids don't see what a man and a woman is right kids don't see what a normal home is like kids don't see they don't they're starting to see another perspective because satan's going to teach them from a very young age just like this woman is screaming and concerned and all upset about physically we need to be just as just as concerned it should jolt us just so much that satan's taking the eyesight of my children i thank god for families here that have jerked their kids out of certain schools that have dirt their kids this way and it might be hard on the kids emotionally but they made the decisions based upon the spirit that's trying to take their children's minds god bless them can you say man god bless the governor of florida god bless people that are still have some eyesight [Applause] you may make hard decisions you might make hard decisions for your children it may be hard to hold up the standard in your home but listen hold to god's word and truth will always prevail someday that kid will thank you because they're too young to see the deception behind everything amen is there any more of that quote is that it no yeah and it if that ain't the condition of the church today god's showing billy grahams and oral roberts great signs and wonders and the church says that's not my denomination and they just stare because they're spiritually insane just stare oh this is my church that's not the sign that follows the believer they listen to their church and forget the spirit of god that makes you act christ-like that makes you love him and believe him but what happened their eyes are blinded they can't you say i have 20 20. but you see the blindness he's talking about is spiritual blindness he actually had a guy tell him and said when he's talking to him like this he said he says i have 20 20 vision i can see he said if you're a true prophet might be blind right now you imagine and he could have done it but he says no no he said you're already blind if you're saying the days of miracles are past and you're saying there's nothing to this and this is not scriptural you are blinded spiritually and that's a worse blindness than ever being blind physically i say amen when i'm talking about children i want to bring up disney not gaining any popularity votes this morning that's for sure did you read what the ceo bob chapek of disney did you read what he said this week when all this came up in florida did you read what disney said the guy that orchestrates producing all the disney films don't get up and walk out please stay where you're at just listen it's in the news he said it and first of all bob chapac didn't get behind trying to block the bill that the governor of florida put out and then he got such an uproar from his employees in the lgbtqu xyz community that he had to issue another statement well this is one of the initial ones he said and then he initiated a statement he's trying to explain himself why we don't get involved in that he's explaining why he wouldn't get involved politically to help change the social thing of the minds of people this is a reason i believe the best way for our company to bring about lasting change is through the inspiring content we produce the welcoming culture we create and the diverse community organizations we support there's a reason content is at the top of this list for nearly a century our company stores for nearly a century our company's stories have open minds inspired dreams shown the world both as it is and how we wish it could be and now more than ever before represent the incredible diversity of our society now i didn't say that somebody else didn't say that the guy who's in charge of disney now and he says the last century this has been the motive of disney amen we are telling important stories raising voices and i believe changing hearts and minds in kanto black panther reservation dogs coco soul modern family shang chi summer of soul love victor these and all of our diverse stories are our corporate statements well corporate statements i mean i thought you guys were just making some nice children's movies for my kids so they can laugh and maybe i shouldn't have read this this morning just let you know i've i've watched disney movies most of my kids lived on little house on the prairie until they were tired of it and vegeta veggie tales but we watch some dizzy movies and maybe there's some innocence to some of them maybe i don't know but i'm just reading what their agenda is is to change the minds of our kids and to do it slowly to accept things that are against the word of god i'm just telling the truth don't get mad at me if i'm telling the truth i'm telling the truth we watched them matter of fact the other day i watched through one with uh my daughter so because i'm critical you know i'm just trying to scan the whole thing and say okay what are they trying to stay here and i won't mention the movie but it was one of their newer ones and i'd say this is all fun and this is all great and my granddaughter ellie loves to some of these fun characters and it's all there but it was very hard to detect even with the holy ghost hard to detect how to put your finger on and as he says here he's trying to introduce things so i didn't get it's just hard to you know as it doesn't seem like there's anything wrong with this and then i began to notice this one character in it that was dressed in a way that you couldn't tell by his voice and by his stress you couldn't tell whether he was male or female i mean i couldn't tell i couldn't tell so then when i read this yesterday i thought now now i see but that's very subtle that the kid can't tell and they're teaching the kid you shouldn't be able to label them anything and you shouldn't be able to tell if they want to make it so you can't tell that's the way we want our kids to think in the future these and all of our divi diverse stories he continues our our corporate statements and they are more powerful than any tweet or lobbying effort they are more powerful what we're doing through hollywood and through these things are more powerful than any tweet or lobbying effort i firmly believe that our ability to tell such stories and have them received with open eyes open ears open hearts who wouldn't open their spirit to something fun like that music has a way of dismantling your thinking process and all of you know that's true right so we have to choose the music with us and do because whether it's christian music whether it's the choir singing or whether it's the wrong kind of music it still has a way of opening us up emotionally hopefully the choir is anointed enough to open your emotions that's not the wrong part about it opening your emotions to get your heart ready for the word that you open and receive and we were able to worship god freely that you lay everything else down all your troubles down and you open your spirit to receive the seed of god even if you've got a block up towards the word music can dismantle that should be all more open to hearing the word can i get any help this morning satan has known that from the very beginning so his music and his hollywood has an agenda to use that tool to open your spirit i need to laugh a little i need to break down life is too much pressure so i'm going to escape into this movie but be careful be careful i'm not against all of it but i'm just saying be careful what you're dismounting in your emotions and your laughter be careful the message that's coming through praise the lord laodicea i'm going to get off of it now which some are happy i'm getting off of it just chew on what i said we're in a different world than what we were even 20 years ago and these are the important things you need to look at in your life can you say man i think we should do everything around this church to keep our kids safe physically the congregation's safe physically how many agree with me that is my i'm telling you that is our motive to keep our children safe but there are more damaging things that happen through movies so i'm just asking you to examine if we're in the protection of our children then let's go the whole gamut and watch everything because we could protect them from a gun but we also need to predict them from what's getting in their minds praise the lord laodicea was a city and not just the prophecy of the age we live in but it was a city and possibly this is why paul uses the things of being naked and being poor and being blind because i found out that gold and clothing and ice have represent three major industries in the city of laodicea new inventions come in ioc that they didn't have before new isaf came there was a there was a scientist or a man who developed something because it was trouble with the eyes and so it was laodicea that a man was inspired to develop something that he he could actually and become it became used throughout throughout after that time because it said so they could go to this i don't know if they called him an eye doctor but he has this i savvy developed and if they had this he could put this on and it was helping their vision it was also that that their industries were banking money textiles and medicines laodicea had major industries of gold clothing and medicines this writer says gold spiritual riches contrast with poor and fire symbolizes trial so god advises the church to obtain spiritual riches produced through trials which the self-sufficient laodiceans avoid by compromising we're gonna there laodicea would give us some things to avoid going through trials to avoid to make a convenient life to make a comfortable life i want to be a christian but i don't want to be persecuted for it i want to live the word but i don't want to wear something that would maybe bring a laughing at me or being put down it's all right in this age we got you covered i'll give you a christian life you don't have to worry about that and you'll never get persecuted friends i'm telling you this morning i never expected to just be this straight i hate being this straight it's just the lord moving me just now i'm good this may be my last sermon i'm not preaching at anybody in particular i'm preaching to all of us and if this is the last sermon that i preached god help us to call for revival in our hearts and have our eyes anointed with eyesight [Applause] white garments contrast their nakedness clothing helps us to distinguish people in groups because of the differences between men and women's clothing sexual distinctions can be made amen clothing provides a measure of comfort and protection from the elements it hides shame clothing hides shame it hides deformity biblically god uses this symbol of righteousness he instructs the later scene to dress himself in the holiness of god to cover his spiritual nakedness and self-righteousness you can't clothe yourself spiritually with your own self-righteousness god said that won't work it says filthy rags but because of your nakedness spiritually i'll provide you with the clothes spiritually to address yourself in through the word dress yourself in the word take his righteousness over your own i'll give you true riches can you say amen i said it a couple services ago i can't remember now when it was but you if you're blessed in this message to have the word of god in the last days and you love it and you worship the lord on this then you are a spiritual billionaire you are a rich man you are a rich woman can you say man not because of how much money you have in the bank and how much your ira is can you say man we're rich spiritually because what god has provided in this age [Applause] you're a rich woman some of you wives say we're so poor we don't have any money for me to go get the things i'd like to get i'm saying the women because you know there's always something else that she needs or wants and it's not a bad thing it's not for me in my house when i was when i got married it's a good thing i married somebody because i would still just have basic things in there like one chair a cupboard full of mac and cheese the toilet works the bed and you don't really need to wash the sheets but maybe every couple months i'm told in myself didn't i just the basics that's it that's all you need but thank god for a wife that comes and says hey you need some things now i have this home and i have all this other and it's beautiful and it's decorated that's so much nicer matter of fact we have too much stuff and i won't get into that some of you wonder why my wife is still with me after all these weeks of saying these things she must love me but man i wouldn't trade it for anything in the world because you see and so i say there's always something else that she said we need this and we need that some of it needs some of its wants but that this is this is the laodicean the city they they said we see the need that the people need more money so we're going to provide loans and we're going to provide gold and we're going to provide banking a greater banking system because there's a need for more things laodicea was doing that that was the industry how many say this is our age and then the fashions become up in different clothing to distinguish men and make them prettier and all these other things that happened and they would see you and then paul says but wait a minute the church age you as a church in laodicea and the age that's going to come is going to have an emphasis on fashion and people will be emphasizing what they wear and besides that they'll be dressed in their own self-righteousness but when they're dressed in that they're naked they're not clothed right praise the lord he's still with me it's only 12 34 man i've got a half hour [Applause] and then and then the spiritual blindness a scientist or whoever did said in the city of laodicea develops an eye salve that's helping the people so the theme is laodicea could provide replacements for all their conditions of laodicea money and fashions and medicines we got you covered so paul used this god he said we'll provide you your need in these conditions not laodicea possessions and more money isn't always the answer following the latest fashions more medicated with things than believing in divine healing and you know i say that respectfully and the reason i say it respectfully about medicines he says because brother branham said god has allowed science god can use a medicine to be able to help you but the healing comes from god and don't ever lose sight of god being able to provide complete healing because if we don't believe that we become too dependent on the medicines that's what laodicea did you don't need to go to god you don't need to pray you don't need to ask god you don't need to have the pastor lay hands on you you don't need it you need more money we'll get you more money you need more fashions of the world we'll put out all the fashion magazines we'll change you every week can you say amen you need something for your eyes we'll give you something for your eyes so that you don't have to turn to god until they said we're good we're good we have need of nothing amen i could go home right now from this service and that house that's five minutes away be burnt to the ground and we know that for your home too there is no stability here we have no continuing city let's not trust in laodicea's riches let's not trust in laodicea's medicines [Applause] i'm not saying go off your medicine i'm not saying any of that i'm just saying let's not trust in it so much that it replaces you're depressed i got some new movies for you to watch that'll lift your spirits oh my following the latest fashions medicated with divine medicating without divine healing will never fill the craving for your spiritual walk did you know that entertainment music fashions sex cyber friends a boyfriend a girlfriend will never fill the craving for god in your life don't ever try to lean towards that fulfilling the craving for god god doesn't give you a boyfriend to fill your craving for the holy ghost and more of god that there wasn't god that did that you put the kingdom first and you're craving for god and you're satisfied in the lord completely and you wait for god to provide the right mate and he'll provide that too i'm going to say it again entertainment music fashions sex cyber friends boyfriend girlfriends will never fill the craving for your spiritual walk you know a few weeks ago i was delving into the thought life a little bit i think it's good to mention here again because we can talk about our thought life but beca because most things enter our fault life how do we know that most things enter our thought life through the eyes or through our hearing so once it gets in there and gets lodged in there then it becomes a part of our thought life but it came through a gate usually usually now i know we can get thoughts from satan and different things but usually things come through the gate of the eye the eye is the gate to the soul the eye is the gate to the spirit it's been said and so uh the eyes they get so so physically seeing something can connect with your spirit that's the thing about physical eyesight being connected with spiritual eyesight because what you see physically what you see physically can connect with your spirit and your mind so you see something but the message of it and the spirit of it can connect with your spirit and get lodged in your thought life get lodged in your spirit it's amazing how that kind of ties together and maybe that's why as brother boaz was bringing out the gates all the gates that's around the city for protection are gates of memory imagination conscience affection that's got to be sanctified by god and put under his control why why because because it is an inlet to get into your inner city so we can't just say i can just watch anything i want to watch no not really because over time it's going to affect you spiritually get enlarged in your mind get lodged in your heart and everything i'm saying here is all science proved even social media recently they're saying the damage it's done to teenagers social media so physically seeing can connect with our spirit and get lodged in our mind that's pretty powerful can you say amen that's pretty powerful i'd like to mention as i'm trying to draw this down now i'd like to mention a very essential service that the prophet of this hour preached in 1965 very god revealing something very very important to this generation and the title of it if you want to listen to it is in shreveport 1965 i have heard but now i see just the title if you just pray about the title i have heard of thee and he's quoting from job who said i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now job says i see thee what an important thing that there is a it's incredible thing that the prophet through the lord would present that a christian can go many many years and hear and be filled with the knowledge of god and fill their mind with the message and fill their mind with the knowledge of god but they don't see it yet and were they christians before yes was job a christian before he's seen spiritually yes faithful christian serving the lord bringing sacrifices for his children doing his dutiful things just doing everything he could a man that god so trusted that satan said let me have him i'll make him curse you to your face and god so trusted the son of god said go adam don't take his life but you can take everything else i trust this man he's a faithful man i pray that god says that about me but yet but yet there was something that he needed needed to be revealed further that he couldn't see because when the trial first happened he had he had he had been uh in relationship with god he had done everything he knew remember there's no bible back then so he's just going on just you know god inspired him this is what needs to be done he probably thought back into uh the sacrifice at the beginning and he's seen because of history he knew that cain brought the wrong sacrifice of fruits abel brought the right one of a sacrifice blood is what gets us back to god so he took that says if i'm going to have my sins of my children and me taken care of i'm going to keep bringing sacrifices i'm going to bring extra ones i'm going to pray for my kids maybe they haven't sinned now but maybe they're going to sin what a daddy maybe they haven't sinned today but in the future i'm bringing this sacrifice in case they sin god holds your wrath back from them what a daddy it's the way this man lived and yet it's not till the last chapter of his book that he says i have heard of thee all these years by the hearing of the year but now i see ye i see it i see thee [Applause] i just talked to someone this week and and i talked to a lot of people but this is just brings it fresh to me and that that grown up all these years in the message and someone so honest is to say this believers saying so honest to say from five six seven years old i know this thing i know the quotes i know what we're supposed to do i know what we're supposed to do what we're supposed to not do just filled with it goes on comes into marriage comes everything and feel it and i just realized he said i realize that i i know it all by head knowledge but he said still something has to happen in me because obviously i'm missing something thank god for honesty because they recognize god still loves me i still love god but they're honest enough to say i still got a lot of this as information and i've been going through and doing it praise god for that but i have to be honest with i'm not seeing something if my life is bringing forth private fruits that aren't wrong excuse me aren't right fruits of my life that aren't right then i'm lacking something no matter how much knowledge i have of this message no matter how much i say i believe god sent a prophet no matter how much i acknowledge it i'm saying lord i'm not seeing something yet because if i seed it there'll be different fruits from my life thank god for that type of honesty instead of smearing on this message and say i'm okay i'm good i want to get into a sermon here's another one of my sermons well i got such good response right now i might just drop into that one for the next hour oh to see jesus give the parable of a man a pharisee who comes into the temple and says lord i'm there's a sinner over there in the corner hiding and he said lord i'm thankful that i'm not like that sinner over there i'm thankful i'm not like him and then he gives all his stuff that he's makes him a good person self-focused all selfless all his own righteousness this is not an unbeliever this person believe in jehovah god he said lord i'm thankful i'm not that i pay my tithes i give i do these things he lists the things that he does and it's just you know there is nothing in there in humility whatsoever and then when he's done there's there's a there's a guy over and the bible says he doesn't even feel worthy to even lift his head up to god and he's smiting his chest saying god please have mercy on me a sinner that's the difference and that's all he said he was he wasn't bringing anything he wasn't trying to impress god he wasn't saying i'm i'm okay okay so i'm just it was zero zero she's asking for one thing i need your mercy lord i don't want your justice because if i get your justice i'm finished because i've heard that you have mercy i'm asking for mercy that's it there's nothing more to it i don't want to preach my sermon because it's i believe it's going to be really come out bring out some things but uh just know this it's about justification because that man's trying to justify himself before god and this man's trying to get justification before god and he get he's hoping to get it through his own i'm good and this person's just saying i need you lord i need you lord right now i just need your mercy jesus says after the parable lord jesus that's why i've been saying lately people are complicating this so much you on the internet and you hear today many years people have complicated this message so much and confuse people so much and i'm not here to take stabs at anybody i'm just saying what i want for you as a congregation for you under our leadership i just want that simple relationship with the lord and i want to say to him this morning lord if i'm to come to adoption and all these glorious things that you said the bride would come to and i'd go all these other things then i'm asking just for one thing that you'll give me mercy to go there that's all i'm asking for if we're close to a rapture and this is the last sermon i preach i'm just asking for god's mercy rapturing faith to get me into a man into a rapture there's too much pride in this message there's too much self-righteousness jesus says that this this publican this sinner it's all about justification how many knows that the message restored the truth of justification invisible union we're enjoying the glories of the truth of justification that means to be completely cleared by god he never did it in the first place how do you get it jesus said this man went back to his house justified and this man didn't this man went back to his house with his own justification and he was seeking gods but he didn't get it because he was good in his own i'm good but he didn't go home with justification i would love for every person here to go home and they brought repentance before god say god i heard your word today brother braham says the cry the zeal of the end time is to repent and i laid my life in that service before you and i didn't bring anything to impress everybody i just need god and i really need him i don't know about everybody else but i just need him i'm weak without him and i would love for you to go home with the peace in your heart that god has justified you what a tragedy when people go home from services and they didn't even get they didn't get what they needed just got head knowledge but i'd love for everybody to go home because they just fully and they got you know i feel god has forgiven me i feel he's justified me because i just brought it to god i i don't know about these services the last few weeks i said lord i just want to preach it i just want to be fiery and i want to bring something that makes us swing from the rafters and it just gets so solid i'm sorry friends it just gets so it's it's i don't want surface things for you i don't want surface things for me i want him to go deep and so if you were to separate job's life the last chapter is when he said i have heard but now i see long about in job 19 he has a revelation if we were to separate now i don't have the right to do this but if we were looking at timeline after job's trial he comes to after his comforters are telling them things and you know if you read job but in 19 job 19 25 he said that's where he says i know my redeemer liveth and now now i will stand with him on that day i will stay shall stand on and in the last days he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and i'll stand with him he has a revelation that he's a predestinated seed and if if the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i'll see god i'm going to see him someday i'm going to see him someday can you say praise the lord what a revelation because i have a redeemer because i have somebody that stood in my place he's going to stand in the last days and guess what i'm going to stand with him what a revelation in job 19 the revelation that'll take you through a trial i might die and skin worms destroy this body but listen i'm not finished when i die because i have a redeemer i have a substitute for my sin i know my redeemer liveth i have someone who'll stand with me by revelation he's seen himself in the last days with christ and will physically see his god that's the future but in the last chapter it's a spiritual eyesight because evidently before he didn't see but he says i have heard of thee but now i see thee it's a spiritual eyesight he got i'm going to throw you a little curve here before i close and i'm going to have you go to job 31 i'm aware of the time i run children getting antsy god bless you children young teens and young kids hey thanks for sitting quietly and listening to brother paul god will bless you for it thank you it's good he's living his thumb up thank you guys god will bless you for it what was it oh job 31 so this is interesting so you got he has a revelation that he'll be with him in the last days and his redeemer will save him at the end of the i have heard but now i see he gets his eyes are open spiritually that he can see christ and he can see things but here in the middle he says something i'm just throwing a little curve here okay here in the middle he says something job 31 i made a covenant with mine eyes why then should i think upon a maid that's a virgin or a woman that's not his wife so it's easier for me to preach some of you maybe you shut me down but it's easier to preach about job proclaiming i know my redeemer liveth i shall stand with him in the last days i can preach i have heard thee but now i see thee with my eyes praise the lord but this scripture isn't really preached on too much and yet this is a part of job's spiritual life that job had to make a covenant with his eyes that he would not look upon another woman that was not his wife this is job i heard about joel's trials heard about job's comforters i heard about job's daughters heard about job job jumped up job he knows his redeemer what a revelation but i didn't hear too many sermons in the message about job made in the process he made a covenant with his eyes that he wouldn't look upon a young young maid so this is another step in a man's life and the whole chapter is about a eyes looking at a woman if you continue on verse two for what portion of god is therefore from above and what inheritance of the almighty from on high is not destruction to the wicked or strange punishment to the workers of iniquity doth not he see my ways and count all my steps if i have walked with vanity or if my foot have hasted to deceit let me be weighed in an even balance that god may know mine integrity if my step hath turned out of the way and my heart walked after mine eyes he said if i live i'm a believer i know my redeemer liveth but if i walk if i walked after mine own eyes and if any blot out hath cleaved to my hands then let me sow and let another eat let my offspring be rooted out you know what job's saying i'm a believer but if i walk with my eyes guiding me in this world and i don't make a covenant with my eyes i come under the same sowing and reaping as anybody else in other words i'm a believer but i'm not in a different category when it comes to my flesh i got to bring it under subjection just like anybody else he goes so far to make an agreement with his eyes that's what a covenant is it's an agreement with his eyes anybody ever made an agreement with your eyes today i make an agreement with my eyes that i won't look at certain things because i know that's destructive to everything in my life i know that the eye is the gate to the soul so i'm making a covenant i make an agreement with my eyes that i will not look at certain things and when i see it i will turn my head because i not only have a covenant with god i not only have brought sacrifices i not only go to church to brother paul's church but when i'm home and when i'm by myself i make a covenant with my eyes amen all the same fruits will come from my life god will judge me the same way i don't get special treatment if i'm letting my eyes guide my life and look at the wrong things no special treatment because i grew up in the message i'm losing amen but it's probably because you're tired we're not under special treatment because we grew up in the message or because we know we're predestinated so he for worldly things especially a man looking at a woman other than his wife makes a covenant with his eyes i'm i'm saying the revelation job had is that the eye the gate to the soul was so powerful that he says i have to make a covenant with it before my lord verse nine if mine heart had been deceived by a woman or if i laid weight because remember the theme here is a woman other than his wife if my heart have been deceived by a woman or if i've laid weight at my neighbor's door then let my wife grind unto another and let others bow down upon her in other words i don't deserve to have a wife that's serving me correctly if i'm not if i'm looking at other women let her grind for another man because i don't deserve her i don't love her right for this is a heinous am i saying that right this is a heinous crime yea it is a iniquity to be punished by the judges for it is a fire that consumeth to destruction and would root out all mine increase what looking at women that you shouldn't look at it's heinous it's it's true it's terrible what a way to end this service but i must say our eyes can see many things in our world and be hindered but without a doubt the most destructive evil forces in our culture is pornography and sexual sin outside of marriage whether seeing it or doing it believe it or not that's my last thing i typed in in my notes and i really don't know how to end the service now how do you end a service like that except for maybe saying nobody talks about it very much but it certainly is a destructive force sometimes in people's lives because our pride has given us permission to look at privately anything that we want to look at and watch anything we want to look at and it's destructive for marriages for families for children it's sodom and gomorrah say how many scriptures do you have going on that's all through the bible including the first destruction by water the ark and what was the problem the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were pretty and then with the accumulation of their imagination and their violence and all this evil is where god says my goodness i'm just going to have to destroy the whole thing but i'll give grace to my prophet god always makes a way of escape so the escape was i'll send a prophet i'll have him build an ark because they can't get out of this themselves they are so bound by the pornographic messages by the beauty of women marriages are tore apart the families are tore apart it's a private thing that's going on but it's come to their imagination and they're actually becoming violent do you know the two are tied together you know anger some of anger is tied together the private sin going on it makes a man not free or a woman not free because i want to just preach at the men women sometimes are into this they said become violent violent you know how this world's become violence there's no control there's lawlessness they're walking into subways and just for no reason just killing an old woman in a subway just killing her just stabbing her and they can't be mad at that woman because the woman didn't do anything wrong but there's a festering anger and we got years of feeding on video games and pornography and this beast has risen up become violent i'm so under condemnation i'm so sick of myself i'm so sick that i can't be satisfied by any woman anymore now i gotta turn to a man i'm so blowing up that i've just got to take it out on somebody anger can have its root in the private things that's going on pornography is one of our greatest destructive things and it's in our culture the percentages in denominations you can read because we don't do polls in our own ranks the percentages are out the roof within the church and only because i deal with some things sometimes it's just lord when will preachers start talking about this from the word because there's more going on sometimes than what i'd really be comfortable with you're trying to fix problems and fix problems and then you realize here's the core and they haven't seen job said in my hour in my time and if i'm going to serve the lord the way i want to serve him i have to make a covenant an agreement with my eyes i love this message i love it people maybe think sometimes i'm taking i'm not taking stabs at the message itself there's nothing that's greater that's ever hit the face of the earth in the message of this hour but the reality is sometimes satan works in deceiving things in the undercurrents the privacy can't people be free why can't people free why can't why is it what are you feeding on what are you reading what are you looking at what are these eyes seeing so i can't talk about victory and the glories of the word unless we talk about what our eyes are really looking at praise god for people here has made a covenant with their eyes already god bless you and god bless you that are catching it by what i'm preaching that you're going to say lord i just need your mercy i need your grace i need help i need you lord right now that's when we become justified before god when we're honest when we're open he said i need you or i'm going to be caught in this laodicean thing the statistics and the denominations are pretty high for pornography and pretty high in ministers pastors pretty high so human nature is human nature right so i we don't take polls on my ranks i'm not going to do that but i'm just going to say we're called to something higher we're not called to be a laodicean we're not called to the age that we're living or call higher we're not called to be a part of those statistics what a shame if we were part of the same statistics but i'm not so sure it wouldn't be a bigger percentage and that's a shame we say lord you've called us to something higher than this so give us the answers give us your word give us the holy ghost fill us with your spirit lord i just need your mercy to change me amen amen praise the lord in our own ranks and here's another statistic 35 of protestant ministers resigned last year after the covet thing and the pressures 35 of protestant ministers resigned it's because of the times it's because of what we're going through and i can imagine it would be frustrating if you don't have any holy ghost there that you're preaching to change people's lives and you're seeing all this culture take hold in the peep you're saying oh god and you just give up the pressures of the coven the different opinions of covid that was part of it they're just saying hey you know what i'm done i'll go get a job at a auto place or whatever fix cars i don't have to deal with all this we're under an age of culture taking over laodicea taking over people's rights legacy taking over but what we really need is on every individual it's the simplicity of a submission to say i yield my life to the lord i have nothing to bring nothing to bring all my successes all the glories god done even god doing great things in your life i'm not bringing any of that because what it is is what you where you stand today where are you at today what's that song that says um i we sing it with you i can do all things through christ who gives me strength but sometimes i wonder what he can do through me no glory of my home to my own yet in my weakness he is there let me know yes lord his strength is heard when our strength is carry us [Music] raised in his power [Music] his strength is birth history verse 2. can you stand with me we can only know the power that he holds when we truly see how deep are we [Music] yes [Music] this strength in us [Music] again is [Music] [Applause] [Music] the become strong [Music] his strength is perfect [Music] here's strength i'd like to sing the second verse again listen to this lyric it's so wonderful we can think about this pray about it just now the power

wrong god's right and he's the only one that's ever right [Music] we can have that heart this morning says lord i just need you to change me i just need you my ways are wrong your ways are right my precious lord i don't know why you lead me these ways but i just want to yield to you may fruit come from the word may fruit in the people's life come lord i [Music] i love when people shout i love when we have times that we shout over the word dance rejoice i love faith messages that build our faith of healing reaching out and touching the very power of god to heal the sick i love that lord you can do all things lord my heart is not just as somebody dances in the spirit not just somebody's faith is built for healing but the depth of the glories of this word would go so deep into the souls and spirits of the people of god that we really begin to see the fruits of this message and brothers and sisters lord who believe it people's lives would be changed that families would be changed that men would become godly men that women would become godly women that we would grow in the maturity of the faith of god that you can trust us lord the third pull is here it's not coming it's here just needs our our surrender and our humility lord to see it work among us more it's here but it needs our surrender and it lord bless these lives that come and listen bless these children for listening so long bless these teenagers bless these husbands and wives and our our special elderly ones that are here just wonderful people those that are listening online that attend this church god bless them i pray may there be fruits i pray come from this word lord that we're preaching let us see the reflection of the fruits of god i'm looking for it lord and if this is the last sermon i'm still looking for it lord to be manifest in this bride i believe it father we trust in you we give the service to you as we're dismissed may our hearts be in that word and close to you may we always be ready to repent when we're wrong committed to you father in jesus name amen amen sure love you all god bless you once you shake somebody's hand in case you don't get you after service give them a hug around their neck christian love faith wonderful people of [Music] god amen this altar is open this morning and be glad to pray with you for one prayer his strength is perfect when our strength so [Music] is [Music] he'll carry us when we can't carry on raising is [Music] i can do all things through christ who keeps me strand but sometimes i wonder what he can do through me [Music] no great success to show no glory of my own yet in my weaknesses there [Music] [Music] he strengthens [Music] the power that he holds when we truly see how deep our weakness goes [Music] [Music] is [Music] he'll carry us when we can't carry on [Music] is [Music] is gone [Music] he'll carry us when we can carry on
