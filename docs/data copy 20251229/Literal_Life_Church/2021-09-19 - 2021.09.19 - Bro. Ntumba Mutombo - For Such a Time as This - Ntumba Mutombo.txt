========================================

mississippi but we got a lot of love i'll tell you that and i'm just so honored to be in the house of lord again because the lord said he dwells in the house of the worshipper and i count like a thousand here so god is here and he doesn't go back on his word amen so let's just trust him for that and i'd just like to thank the lafontaine family so much for thinking about us on this day and going out of the way to accommodate us matthew 10 42 says and whoever gives to one of these little ones those who are humble in rank and influence even a cup of cold water to drink because he is my disciple i truly just say to you you would never lose your reward and thank you so much thank you guys so much for just being here and for those people for everyone who traveled here and took their time and did all that just to be here in this in this house and this presence god bless you and give you safe childhood mercies to return home and if he said it i believe it and that settles it amen so let's trust god this morning if we could all just stand to our feet for the reading of the word we can start with esther 4 verse 14. i'll try to keep this as short as possible and my voice is probably going to be gone by the time i'm done anyway so but we trust god amen for if you remain silent at this time relief and deliverance for the jews will arise from another place but for you and your father's family will perish and who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this and who knows that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this amen you may be seated for a text today i've taken the title for such a time as this and i love this prophet the story that the prophet tells and doors and door preaching 1965 in february he speaks about a pro pastor a minister who every single day for for every sunday and wednesday for 20 years solid who would preach for 20 minutes and then be done and many people couldn't understand how it was and one morning he preached for four hours and so the deacons called him back like pastor um we really love you and oh we think your messages are all wonderful and he said but us as the deacon boards we watched you when you timed you every single day and for exactly 20 minutes every sunday morning but this morning it was four and we just don't understand and the prophet and uh and the minister responded to them and said i tell you brethren every morning when i go to preach whenever you call me to the platform i reach into my pocket and grab a lifesaver and i place it under my tongue and in 20 minutes when the lifesaver is gone i'm finished and i know it's time to quit and he said the mistake this morning was i grabbed the button so he took a button and put it under his tongue and so that four hours and i'm pretty sure this this afternoon i checked and i uh yeah i'm pretty sure and i did not grab a button but listen cozy i came here with a message of hope and a message of truth a history lesson of our present state and i pray that this message with all my heart today will spark a commission for someone in this room or even watching online now or later because i know god would redirect someone by causing a raging storm and redirect his prophet to stop in memphis tennessee to meet a mother of a dying boy my dad he was walking by feet and she had the faith of rashuna my woman and she pulled him and she drew him and she met him at the door and said parsons how would she know it was her faith that drew him to him that's exactly what happened and i know people that their timing was reset by 10 seconds because their child ran out the door and grabbed hey mommy i love you and gave them a hug and they miss an accident because their timing was reset by a mere 10 seconds i've heard stories of people stopping to the store on 9 11 to grab a band-aid on the foot because right before tragedy stuck out of light at the workplace this is the god that we serve the god that we serve is so analytical he's an absolute author of all things an absolute mathematician he is so technical in his timing he is so technical in his order and i pray that at least one verse and at least one story at least one quote will give you life and it will stick with you and stick in your heart and god is not looking for a theologian this afternoon he's looking for anyone merely anybody who is willing to forego their understanding their ideologies and their beliefs and their traditions and totally put their trust in his word and his promises and god is not a man that he should lie he is looking for availability and not ability he will use you yes you and your environment everything about it he simply asked moses the easy question what is in your hand and i'm asking you this afternoon what is in your hand oh i'm nine years old i just play fortnite and not know what is in your hand ask yourself that question god is not looking for age he doesn't care about how old you are he doesn't care about how much you know what is in your hand he took john right out of the wilderness and he was attacking the the priests and the the patriarchs and everybody with what he preached about trees snakes in the wilderness what else did he preach about to come with the messiah that was it simple as that god uses everything that you have and he manifests your gifts for his glory amen and i pray that this afternoon that god can use a broken man like me and a sinner above all things to share what he's pressing to my heart and who knows that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this amen amen the interesting thing about the book of esther biblical research states this about this book and there's only two books in the bible that are mentioned and the rule is mentioned multiple times and the author always fails to mention the name of god or jesus this book specifically esther the king xerxes or king of hazares is mentioned nearly 200 times and scholars said that his name was mentioned 170 times to be exact in this book 10 chapters in total and god himself was not mentioned once was god present in the time was god still working in the time you asked yourself that question but i know in my heart from genesis to revelation that this is the greatest love story ever told these scriptures in the 66 chapters combined the most beautiful thing in the world just absolute love about a father who loves his children so much that he would even give his own just so that we can live again if you listen to closely to the words you'll see the promises you hear the understanding and you can connect 8 000 promises in the bible and god is picking one for you one for you one for you like oprah you get a promise you get a promise you get a promise he promised you that believe it take him at his word amen this is just the highlights of god's love he's so beautiful according let i just want to kind of bring this into a drama i i don't remember the past about during the uh your installment of the church or the the first week here he speaks about the drama and i feel like the bible is just so beautiful how it to me it's like a movie i look at the words and i can kind of see the characters lining up and do you mind if i just share with you like that for a little bit and so according to historians the story of esther picks up around 486 bc before about 500 years before the birth of christ and there's a few extensions in this book because the persians and medes were at war and they were actively expanding their empire throughout the war with wars and various expeditions at this point in history they were stuck at the lion versus the greek and that was the biggest adversary and their biggest threat this particular character is king of hazaris he's also known historically as king xerxes the son of king darius and the grandson of king cyrus and if you read your bible you would know that king cyrus was famously known for being a very fortunate persian ruler who allowed the jews to return home after 70 years of captivity he knew the promise god told god already wrote it that the jews would never be in captive he told him that they would be out and king cyrus got the revelation he was not a message pastor he was not a message believer but he something just clicked to him he was a pagan worshiper and if we're being honest but something opened up and so he released the jews into freedom and this particular offer was this particular offer of freedom was taken up by many families and many families actually decided to stay in the land and i'll get back to that a little later and so this story takes place in souza and the capital is the persian uh the persian empire and this is the capital of the persian empire king built by king and hazarius father king darius and susa the king the city of susa itself was a beautiful city and there was just so much vibrance in the city the city was full of merchants traders caravans full of goods and full of treasures and neighboring provinces and areas almost like like envy this this was this place was beautiful the city life was unparalleled to anywhere else in the world and it drew people from all over the world to live just and some people just came to visit some people came to stay and the ground was fertile and the livestock was booming so people ate good they laughed they rejoiced and they were just happy all the time because the city was beautiful and even though there was prosperity in the city there was still the rulers and the people of the land at war we're in that situation now now right now our rulers and the people are at war at wits people trying to understand what's going on there's just so much confusion and though even though there was prosperity in everything in the land there was still war within the city and there was still life going on there was a devastating amount of sin that was taking place in this persian empire in hatred there was murder there was idol worship witchcraft racism classism and so many more flaws of mankind don't ever let the presence of prosperity take your mind off the weight of reality the prophet says in the message the way of a true prophet preached in 1963 january 19 paragraph 49 he says usually prosperity causes sin many people look upon prosperity as blessings it would be if we could handle it right but at least it usually leads us to sin and dishonoring god paragraph 51 says and how israel drifted off into terrible sin and gotten away from god and gotten away from his commandments his precepts and went off altogether on a tantrum the woman walked in the streets with their fine immodest modest clothes and the men went about gambling and drinking the roadhouses what we would call today a place of amusement a wide open city the capital of souza was inhabited by so many individuals from many different walks of life and there was already inhabitants because it was taken over due to war and many of the residents were actually there because of the result of war and others were forced there because of the detention that took place when jerusalem was destroyed the israelites were captured by the babylonians and brought them to live under the rule and some lived as slaves and some were were brought there and forced to study and train in the ways of the land and you see people like daniel and that's exactly what happened they were brought from royalty and put into royalty just to learn the ways of the politics the laws the magic astrology the trades and the businesses so that one day they could also become rulers and and kings of other provinces and i feel like i've seen that sometime in history before think about that a little bit i digress and there was always constantly a war between identity and i just love that this is always the biggest struggle for us as individuals always the biggest struggle for us as christians is our identity like we learned this morning he already knew who we were he shaped every last moment of our lives why do we question what do we have to question he already wrote it down but this is what happens people are taken from their land and their place into another land and then influence influence influence influence and people forget now they start practicing magic they start practicing all the different astrology zodiac oh i'm a cancer i'm a sagittar come on those sins are small this is the truth this is the truth open it up those things don't matter they're small yeah god uses it but don't depend on that trust in his word this has always been a war the other day i was reading a doctor from like the open university she stated that there was 57 different genders what come on let's think about that for a second 57 what is up with the attack on identity what do they what does the world want to do what are they gaining from this they just want to bring confusion they're trying to bring it into the church you have to know who you are 57 there's not even 57 states come on think about it and if you speak out of context if you say something wrong in the class your professor is like whoa whoa whoa i know you're paying 40 000 a year but you can't say that you don't have an opinion here you're paying me you say what i think my doctrine is yours i was just talking to gabby yesterday she was talking about something that she she had wrote and her professor was like nah i don't like your answer not the response and she had to try to mold it in a way in which it would make sense for the professor but the professor himself was like nah i don't like that answer you're paying for an education but they're like no you're taking this doctrine and that's it 57 genders there's so much of a crisis for identity this is our mirror right now take a look church we need to wake up parents teach your children the way of christ and their youth proverbs 20 22 verse 6 says train your child up in the way of god so when he's old he will not depart from it do you know what we are up against church do you know what we're up against do you know who we're up against we we have an adversary who's been fighting since the days of the garden oh actually before that right yeah before that in heaven he was fighting he just wants to be on top he wants to be number one so he's going to find his way into a church he's going to find a way into our schools a government into our homes he just wants to keep doing it but our identities should be in the scripture you should find your favorite character in the bible young guys young girls find it like our pastor preached this morning find them there everything that you've ever been to was already here this is a fixed fight we already know juwan don't give up on god because he won't give up on you he can do exceedingly and abundantly above all that we can ask or think all that all that we can even imagine i i imagine flying but he can do more than that i was talking to justin yesterday he's just like oh i just flew here from maine my arms are tired think about that don't let that go over your head that's beautiful but he says he can do more than that more than that so one day when we get that quickening faith it's because he promised it to do more and more and more stop limiting god he's god he's the creator of all things just trust him take him at his word amen the enemy found eve in the garden and he got it to doubt that's it that's why we die right he got it to doubt eve combated with the word she combated she knew her scripture too but then he said surely you won't die just a little bit of reasoning the prophet says in the contest preaching on in december 31st 1962 but even knew the scripture did she not well excuse me the prophet said but god said you would and that settles it that broke the great tug of war and it pulled the human uh human race unto death because eve listened to reasoning against god's word now it's the same that she did but that's in the past that's in the past church eve listened and she failed but you know that she did so don't fall trust his word find somebody that you can trust him find someone that you can lean on so find someone that could help you through this we try to get through this life all alone i i went to school i just graduated two years ago i'm kind of still going so but i was in school and i was in ra i was i was in charge of 32 uh resident assistants they gave me a promotion after one year it was kind of weird i don't know what they were trying to do to me but i was there and it's just one of the most loneliest places in the in the country they give you a freedom of time freedom of space alcohol a lot of bad decisions it's just a challenge and people are trying to find their identity always always and i just always try to remind people that there's hope and there's peace and we should all have that commission and i dealt with students coming into my into into my room space or whatever i had a safe space that's another story but i had a place in which i had to allow people to come in and and they shared with me some of their deepest and darkest secrets and pain and you wouldn't you couldn't imagine the world the pain that the world is going through people dealing with laws people dealing with suicidal thoughts people dealing with loneliness depression alcoholism and where's their hope self-love self-care it it comes to a level it comes to a limit the song we just said was the love of god it goes beyond all things but i'm sitting there listening to these stories and children these these students just telling me all these different types of things and i'm trying to find a place in which i can just interject a little bit of hope people coming up to me three years later hey that one conversation in that room that saved my life but what what well what did i do it's just because of what i learned at home right it's what i learned about when i met christ myself i had my burning bush moment and i was able to just to share a little bit about love guys you don't understand the weight youth tri-state guys you guys don't understand the weight of it your life is the most important thing people are going to try to try to push you away from your walk people are going to try to convince you into a way that will not line up with the word of god sister it's winter time you're wearing a dress yes stay modest there's beauty in that brothers come on that's the whole other vlog brothers my goodness this you have to stop you have to stop thinking that you're everything god is using you too just because you're not standing behind the pulpit that doesn't mean god is not using you come on you can be sweeping the floors you can be replacing the light bulbs god is using you too stop trying stop texting all these girls at the same time thinking you're going to get a wife come on god wants to use you for his thing and his kingdom be mindful of that be mindful of that let's get back to this please the enemy will always try to alter our identity redirect us from our calling he makes us doubt and forget about and even better yet deny who we are and where we come from and most importantly where we are going our strength is in our identity the many jews going back to this time in esther many jews hid the identities to create a level of comfort with the hope that one day they would be accepted in this great persian empire even with the history of destruction even with the history of abuse even with the history of exile and continuous acts of hate and multiple cases of isolation many israelites actually stuck around even after they were released from detention the law said you can go southwest says you were free to now move around the country they told him you can move around the country go back to your home the promise was in jerusalem but they're like oh man this lifestyle this persian meads lifestyle the traditions oh the foods oh the festivities were you at that party last week man that party was jumping that party was going crazy bro project x people were having such a good time and many people actually left their faith many people left their past and with the mindset and the notion that they're going to begin a new life and i can even say many people denied the message their ids were invalid as simple as that they said oh king king cyrus said we can go i got about two more weeks until my id expires but like nah you should try the steak or the vegetarian option leaves god forgive me there's so many things that people just wanted to hold on to god gave him a chance in egypt to go some stuck around he gave him a chance in babylon to go some stuck around he gave him a chance in persia to go some stuck around again church he's calling us out god is still calling us out today the definition of the church means to be called out get out wake up wake up he wants us to stay he wants the enemy wants to lull us to sleep he wants us to forget who and whose we belong to we belong to god we're the children of the most high king there's nothing else i can say to make you understand that stop fearing exodus get out right now is the time babylon comes to rot us it comes to destroy us it comes to keep us weak nyquil lawless to sleep but god is waking us up right now church right now is the moment that you should stand up and fight for what you know fight for what you believe god called us for a time as this didn't he call you for such a time as this didn't he call you stop being afraid stop following trends nobody cares about social media it's nothing our brains are so wide we're so in tuned and tacked in oh this person didn't like it that person didn't like it this person didn't follow my stream who cares who cares wake up trust in god this is more than a like this is more than a share this is more than a repost he's calling you out right where you stand right where you sit get out of babylon get out of babylon get out of babylon there's nothing else i can see there's so many people who had the choice and they were just stuck on the borderline oh lord oh lord god god is so good he's so good to me you're a good good father oh this oh just keep changing then one day tuesday wednesday thursday friday they're singing justin bieber they're singing who else they're singing a kanye west come on guys come out of babylon you can't just love god on sunday every day that ends with a y think about it how many days ended with the letter y do you know yeah that's right i like that can you say it out loud seven every day that ends with the letter y is the day you should be loving god and holding on to his promises don't make this about a sunday thing get out of egypt they wouldn't go get out of babylon they wouldn't go get out of persia they wouldn't go i would even call them borderline believers they knew the promises did they not did they forget did they forget about where they came from their name was still the same the only difference was they were out of actual captivity physical captivity but they were still in spiritual captivity stuck stuck in the mud you guys ever played that game no okay i know you have you just don't want to tell me so these borderline believers knew the promises and yet they denied the power not thinking about the results of sin not thinking about the wages of sin the prophet said in the results of a decision preached in 1955 october 8th oh brother oh brother paragraph 41 if you are living on the borderline tonight come on over cross over jordan it's wonderful come on that's a three-syllable word wonderful that's beautiful there are great big grapes over there we got the initial evidence we got it hallelujah we got some joshua some caleb's that went over the border and brought back the evidence that is it's a good land every promise that god made is here the full gospel is here the full bible is here divine healing is here rejoicing is him happiness is here peace is here and everything in the bible as promised is every fruit that is in this land a man but the children of israel were so comfortable that they were starting to become first-class citizens and hold offices become wealthy tradesmen and their goods and their various crafts were highly sought after they finally got a million likes on persian tick tock you got a million replays they finally got to that level think about that word guys tick-tock isn't that a resemblance of time is he not attacking time [Applause] is he not taking away our time even on instagram too ever since they kind of like brought tick tock over you start video after video after you're a zombie you're stuck but every promise god made is here not there it's here take your time back what is it going to be church let's get back to this king of hazaris let me describe this character he was known for his extravagant banquets his parties and his festivals and he hosted absolute ragers in today's terms these these rages will last for days on end and this particular festival that that is described in in this in this chapter lasts for 180 days can you think about that 180 days the king of hazaris so king xerxes or some people know him as was in retirement for the time being and he was taking a strategic break from war and he was respect and he was scheduled to return to the front line soon and the final day with a drunken exclamation seven more days they extended the party 180 seven 187 days now and on that last on the day before they extended it he calls out to queen vashti to come in that moment it shook up the nation but god needed that moment to happen 180 days that's about let's do them at six months and i know some people here in this building that took six months to get their driver's license but i won't mention his name but i do have the same first name middle name as last name as him don't judge me guys this is church and i was actually wondering like think about it it took me a long time i remember crying one day in my sister's car six months is a long time six months is a long time but these guys they they went to bed drunk woke up i guess i'll drink again and festivities and partying and all the sin that was taking place in this city happening simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously and he just couldn't let it go oh remember the promises of moses moses who's that that's the point that some people got into 180 days the king hosted these festivals with all the rules rulers and the royalty of all the provinces you reigned and governed over and they said he had 127 different provinces and his kingdom ruled for modern-day india all the way to ethiopia and that distance was about from portland maine how many people know where portland maine is oh sweet from portland maine all the way to tucson arizona 2700 miles how many people have been in dukes in arizona sweet sorry i hate to use that word twice but i had 200 2 hundred miles in straight distance not even counting the north and south king hazarus was a great king the prophet describes in paragraph 18147 marriage of a lamb preached in 1962 january 21st in the evening he called king a hazarist one of the greatest kings in the world of that day this is the king that was ruling the land of people who were sinners and pagans and all these things but the prophet still called him that because the prophet knew this was the rule of the land and a lot of bad things were happening but the prophet still saw him as a great king with that being the matter of fact king xerxes king of was still a man and discipline a man of tradition and ex and excellence and he was very very good at war he was a pagan ruler and his great empire battled was so great his empire was so great even he was the king himself but he he battled with alcohol rage and revenge but he was still a king of the people and he cared for his people and was adamant with the greek army who was his biggest threat was adamant with destroying the greek army who was his biggest threat because his father also failed to do so but king of hazaris was mindful of his abilities and even more his limitations he spent his day and night in the presence of his council and trusted these individuals with his life he always kept great men around him men who exceeded in years and experienced knowledge of the law war and tradition nowadays we know so much guys us as youth we know so much am i wrong we have all the information where's my phone hey on in our phones there is so much data in our phones there's so many resources and everything we know so much but a king a rule of 127 provinces kept great men around him people who exceeded in years and experience i seen ministers nowadays forgetting about where they came from i've seen so many different people starting a new church starting a new beginning even though they grew up under the headship of another another great minister an older minister because it's my time now it's my time to shine i didn't like what he said last week i got to find a new church but the king himself stook stood around these great men with more experience was he not the king the crown was not on his was the crown not on his head did he not carry the scepter in his hand was the final decision not his you have a choice keep yourself around wise counsel stop locking yourself in your room and playing fortnight and tick-tock go be around someone who knows a little more than you learn from them grow with them let them correct you stop being so offended stop being so offended it's that simple because there's going to become there's going to come a time and place when trouble will arise there's going to come a time and place where there's going to be heartache and misery you won't find the answer online you'll find it in faith family and community when trouble shook our house my best friend emanuel mutombo passed away i had an option i had an option i live an hour away from everybody in my house i had an option that day on my way to church i'm frantic oh go pick this person up oh no i'm on my way to church i'm there usually a few hours before just so i can set things up in church they're telling me to go pick somebody up and i'm wondering what's going on i'm driving on the highway and when i saw my brother i had to put it in perspective who was still on the throne today who allowed this moment to take place who said yes who gave him life who gave him breath who gave him strength who gave him love who gave him the opportunity to influence the people he was around who did that who created the heavens and the earth who created the sun in the moon who created all these things it's the god that i serve every day it hurts every day it hurts but i have to look in the mirror every morning before i leave my house every time something gets a little difficult every time something gets a little hard i have to look in the mirror who has the final say jehovah has the final say you have a choice today guys you can sleep you can slip into a dark place a place of hurt misery and isolation he's kind of trying to push away guys watch all you to sleep first and isolate you you have to find your strength in your faith family community and in scripture look around you there's people here you have no idea what they're going through but they're making an effort to be in the house of the lord today i know people who get come to service and they haven't eaten the whole day you just never know you don't know what they went through that week they just failed their tests that they they studied for it for six hours it puts you in a bad place faith community scripture and family those things will do you a word of good our next character is esther the one that we've all been waiting for the unlikely hero of this book and she was named because of her momentous contribution in biblical history was an orphan and an orphan is someone who her parents her dad and her mom died or his mom and his dad died so he has no parents she was an orphan and her parents were killed most likely because of the feud between the amalekites and the israelites there was there was war in that land that she was living in and therefore she was adapted adopted by her uncle mordecai the bible describes esther as wise and beautiful how many here are wise and beautiful come on no confidence come on she was appointed to a queen after a public display of disrespect and disobedience by queen queen vashti a decree was sent out and she was exiled and words spread throughout the whole empire and it was this decree was made to put in place to combat the potential disorder that would take place in the household attack the patriarchy this is real this battle is real that's the attack so the persians people who do not who did not trust in yahweh and god but they trust in their pagan gods they said whoa whoa whoa whoa so if if queen vashti can do this we better tighten up our homes and then people around the house like hey honey oh i'm so tired you mind just cooking me a meal she looked at him he looked to her and she's like cook you a meal at this time if vashti wouldn't listen to the king who are you who are you this demand could have been outrageous the king summoning vashti to the place because everybody in the room was drunk they've been drunk for 180 days so quinn vashti was a lady of honor she was a queen she had a high position and she knew these guys were drinking all four hundred six months my goodness these guys got some kidneys for six months in the last week they tell her hey vashti come here the king summons you she's like bro it's been six months and now you want me to because i'm guessing that he didn't even go to her place or her that area the bedroom at all he was in his drunkenness away from her for six months he probably didn't even talk to her one time and now just out of the blue he's just like ah call vashti here he's been drinking for six months bro and now he said bring her here and she's like no she wouldn't do it but god the god of heaven needed that exact instant to take place because somewhere somehow in a little small house on the lower side of this city this great city susa in the slums in the projects probably in the hood he was shaping a little individual a young lady he's just like okay he took out the ruler he's measuring the dimensions on her head she was she was being fitted to wear a crown but he needed vashti to be disobedient am i wrong scripture said it he was shaping this girl's head like oh wow perfect dimensions vashti is going to be disobedient then i'll bring her this is a redemption story this is a love story this was happening the whole time people couldn't see that this old queen bursty oh no oh no the king's like get out of here man he kicked her out he said got out of here that's how he was telling vassa's go he was hurt he was still at war guys let's not forget he was on rece recess or retirement recently you guys know recess he was on recess he was on break he was in the kingdom you know trying to relax decompress they couldn't understand the tactical advancement of this greek military they just couldn't beat them you guys know about the greeks you know about the spartans by any chance anybody know about the spartans these guys are real people this is who king hazaris was fighting he just couldn't get it he needed to be back home he needed to kick vashti out exile her so esther could one day step in because god wanted to redeem the israelites who stayed in susa do you hear that god wanted to redeem the israelites who stayed in susa everyone in susa was not following the trade we're not following the the faith the practices in the religion they were not doing it at all they were living their own life working at nine to five making a little bit of breeze making a little bit of money they started to get a little comfortable driving the mercedes oh i just got the new lexus they were feeling good they will feel uncomfortable but god didn't promise them susa he didn't promise him that area the promises are here joshua and caleb the two smallest guys they weren't even kid they were 40 years old that's what the scripture said he's a grown man but they were tiny they were looking they were climbing climbing climbing whoa this is a place that god wanted us there was a group that of them that went there but only two believed only two believed that they could take that land they looked over you said the big grapes who eats big grapes big people these there were giants there 40 years old grown men were on the commission of a little scout he said whoa look at those big grapes you know they were tweaking they're trying to figure it out and then they saw one guy walking boom boom like and other people the other group that was with him like wow time out god this is what you promised us we us the children of israel are going to defeat those guys oh lord let me pray about that [Applause] the promises was already wrote guys it was already written god doesn't say pray about it some things you just don't have to pray about go and get it go claim it stop fearing don't be afraid fear is paralyzing fight flight stuck psychology right vicky you have options freeze i think that's the words that freeze fight fight or freeze there's always three options god works in threes over and over and over again it's you can fight you can run away or you can you can be stuck we are the people of the open book this is about action church this is about action you gotta move physics say it object emotion stays in motion into a world into rest by some object it's written not just in scripture but in physics you guys will get to physics soon it's an awful time but it's already written in scripture you can trust god about that amen god needed that exact event to take place somehow somewhere some small house in the side of a lower level city who was shaping one individual to wear a crown that literally could be you that literally could be you so after this oh i got to be careful on time too but after this young after this time in estra in esther 2 verse 3 please can i get that esther chapter 2 verse 3. and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces that they may gather together all the fair young virgins onto susan the palace to the house of women unto the custody of heej and the king's chamberlain keeper of woman and let their things for purification be given to them so this is the decree that is written after queen vashti blatantly disrespects the king all the eligible bachelorettes some of you guys know what i'm talking about you need to you need to repent the king sought out a new queen and they were to report to susa let's think about it how many people like math in here i know very far a very small number let's do some math here for a second if this province had 120 if this empire had 127 provinces and they say roughly about 50 million people what what do you how many women do you think there is because in this earth there's about probably 50 percent right 50 women probably even a greater amount so there's 25 to 27 million women that were brought into this selection process for a new queen that's a lot 127 provinces about 25 million women this process was egregious and it was very selective to be a queen was not just to be a wife of a king it was a political position of power and she was also a judge by persian law it's in the bible people like oh there's no way a woman can be a judge the bible says it paragraph 53 the prophet says and knoweth it not paragraph 53 says i believe it was esther one of the judges in the bible think about it so words spread about this decree that they're picking a new queen so they snatched esther out of her house like well you qualify as one of the 25 million women she didn't have a choice but god was already shaping her crown knowing that one day she will find favor in the presence of the king mordecai her uncle takes her reign from a young age and builds her up teaches her the way of the lord just like blind batmais his grandmother was in his ear speaking to him over and over about the coming messiah who would have thought that he would get his vision back after giving up his dove after giving up his his lamb he gave up his income he gave up his eyes everything everything he could touch everything he could see he gave it all up and who would have thought that just those words that his grandma told him over and over and over again that one day he would bump into the messiah what was that attraction on the mountain why were people gathering people expected him to come on a chariot blazing fire with the sword on fire i'm here to save you i'm here to deliver you but he came on a donkey young people it might not be the way that he came to your father it may not might not be the way that he comes to your mother those moment that you can meet god blind baltimore has met him on a donkey in a packed city crowded what were the chances do the math right very limited the chances were just so small but he was able to grasp onto the promise and receive his sight again mordecai he's working in the kingdom and in the in the palace and i believe he got to that position because of esther you know esther had a little clout now she had a little pull now she's like oh you know that you know that jewish guy who lives on the outside there ah just bring him into the into the into the kingdom i think you would do a you'd be a good writer you'd be a good scribe no one knew the relationship promotion came and he overhears the plot from the king's chamberlain's big thin and terrorists to assassinate the king because of mordecai's vigilance the plot was spoiled and haman the last character i'd like to introduce his plot was to destroy the jews and if you can pull up esther chapter 3 verse 1 esther chapter 3 verse 1. after these things did king hazarus promote haman the son of hemetha the agagite and advance him to and advance him and set his seat above the princes that were with him haman himself was an aggregite and if you really unders like if you get a little deeper into the scripture you understand and you kind of look at the history i like history a little bit and you kind of break that down again was a was a family that snuck into this kingdom to grow and rule with his persians they had a warm smile you know they probably had like a little flow or something i don't know whatever warm smile it's like but they carried blood in their hand had vengeance on their mind and they came from the amalekite family this particular man came from the malachite family who was supposed to be wiped away if you remember let's go back a little bit first samuel verse 15 chapter 15 verse 17 said the lord anointed you as king over israel he sent you on a mission saying go and completely destroy those wicked people and malachites make war on them until they're wiped out and the prophet lines it up with sin he calls malachite sin it's a deeper thing than that he was the descendant of aggie and his point and his joy his job was to destroy the the jew the israelites in the land they had nothing but hatred in their mind and their bodies and after these things those royal decree and everything that was taking place and happening haman was lifting himself up and growing up in stature and glory and he was just like yeah i'm the man now the blood of my forefathers i will avenge i will get revenge he probably said when he got that job and his whole purpose was destroy the israelites he had nothing else on his mind he was given a signet to write a decree after his sweet spoke to the king he's like ah let's destroy all the jews that live in the land because they're hoarding all this kind of money all this resources we need to take those resources and bring those and use them for war and that's what he told the king and he convinced him and the king was like all right here verse 10. so the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to him and son of hamedthar the aggra guy the enemy of the jews after he proposed i'll give you ten 000 talents which is in calculation 3.48 billion dollars in u.s money today if we calculate that i'll give you that if we can just wipe away the jews this is the same adversary that was in heaven this was the same adversary that was in the garden the same exact spirit jumped to one another jumped to one another with his purpose to annihilate god's people you are god's people you are god's chosen one the enemy is adamant he has all the resources they're at his disposal the land is his but our heart your heart is god's and that's what he wants to take away from us the decree was sent out through the land there was no email back then there was no snapchat there was no twitter not even facebook even i know it sounds a little old but so they went on horseback to 127 provinces and told them about this great day oh no there's a decree they're going to kill us they're going to kill all the jews and this wasn't just in susa haman's purpose was to kill the jews that left the land that are inhabiting in jerusalem the people in the promised land he wanted to kill them too that's what he wrote down the king said here's my ring vesti left me he was in a hard place his mind was was he wasn't thinking straight he gave his power to a man who wanted to kill and annihilate the enemy comes to kill steal and destroy and sometimes he's given the ring on your life but do you know whose army you're fighting every province and every ruler understood this edict and that day when the word spread around there was great mourning with fasting and weeping and wailing many laying sackcloth and ashes many people had their burning bush moment when that decree came out in these provinces and that day they finally remembered who they were amnesia disappeared they just said oh yeah i'm an israelite god called me for this purpose he already gave me a promise and he already gave me all those things ah okay lord please please god almighty please of heaven i promise you that if you give us life we won't sin anymore just like we learned this morning we make these empty promises chapter 4 verse 14 just have one more scripture and one more quote in conclusion for if you remain silent at this time relief and deliverance for the jews will rise from another place but for you and your families will perish and who knows that you have come to your royal position for atomic this haman was at the gate he tore his clothes at the noobs he was rocked he was shook he said they're coming to kill us the british are coming in his mind like they knew it they set a date they set a time they said this is your annihilation this is the end time church the annihilation draws not not all the time it has to be physical it's spiritual annihilation we can be dead spiritually but alive physically it's coming it's already here it's already here and finally when they took the news to heart that's when they began fasting they began weeping and crying out the bible doesn't say they prayed that's kind of that to me that was like whoa i was looking i'm trying to read i'm like whoa where did they pray but they were crying out sometimes it's the tears sometimes it's the tears god is not looking for an illustrious prayer he's not looking for a theologian to break things down into details and details and details john the baptist came out of the woods with with with a big beard terrible looking clothes but that fire that laid within his stomach that commission make way make way the coming of the messiah jose everywhere he went he was taking down these big places and telling them the messiah is coming the messiah is coming make way he was telling people warning them about the coming annihilation for some people believe that but peace was actually coming it's crazy god keeps his word paragraph 127 and 128 i actually go there what would your grandfather ever said if your great-grandfather told him that there will come a time when carriages would go on the street without horses we would have laughed at him maybe but they're right what 129 what about these other things that would take place all of these great prophecies has been made out but here and someday jesus will come all that glorious majesty of the son of god he promised he would do it he promised he would judge sin and brother brennan cuts his hands together two times thank you brother will you either accept god's provided sacrifice for sin or you will stand in judgment alone nation church or individual the testing time watts they sent out someone 12 of them and they said 10 of them came back oh what can't do it it's impossible but little old caleb and joshua climbed on a stump said we can do it we're able to do it why it depends on what you're looking at if you're looking on the outside does it look this way does it look don't look at what them people says or what anything else says if it's contrary to god's word stay with the word god promised them the land that's what caleb and them were putting on their hopes in read the book of deuteronomy see how moses corrected them said if if did this if i did this i've did that and god did this and said this but you would not god stays with this promise oh sometimes it seems like it's hard now i want you to listen to this it's hard it's a battle paragraph 137 says way down in egypt god said i have given you the land that and all and all that is in it now he never just said i'm going to pick you up or take you there sit you down they had to fight for every inch that was on the ground 138 says when he commanded joshua there be of good courage be not afraid be of good courage be not afraid be of good courage be not afraid neither be dismayed for the lord thy god thy god can anyone say my god the lord thy god is with you wheresoever thou goest wherever you go the lord is with you no matter how hard it is paragraph 139 how great the obstacle is it doesn't matter if it's down in the valley of the shadow of death the lord that god is with thee whoso wheresoever thou goest 140. he says oh joshua could call israel all together stand here and watch the glory of god god is with his word he's made his promise and god said to joshua every place and the souls of your feet that's yours i'll give it to you brother knocks on him three more times it's for salvation it's for divine healing it's for more blessing and if it's anything that god promised make footprints you have to start walking the prophet promised it you have to start walking it said make footprints that's what our prophet told us it didn't say sit around and hope for a day mandatory mandate stay home no make footprints make footprints start moving start moving the old christmas song from like back in the day put one foot in front of the other and soon you'll be walking out the door door get out put one foot in front of another that's the only way you can walk is there another way to walk take one step that's what he promised us every place your soul of your foots i've given the possession to you god keeps his word god's word is everlasting it's true and i believe it brothers it's time for us to make footprints we can't stay right here in the same camp the fire is moving the fire is moving on let's move on from glory to glory from glory to glory from bible experience to bible experience let's unfold let's open up our hearts let's raise up our hands so god keep the same say in the bible don't get outside of that stay right there follow we've got a prophet of god we've got the word of god and we have the angel of god there again he's working in threes he's leading his church just exactly like he led them in those days exactly right the word of god is before us the prophet of god the holy spirit is leading the church we're moving in the pillar of fire and the glory of god sitting together in heavenly places now we are the sons and daughters of christ god and the great revelation of the word and the holy spirit is sinking into our hearts and bringing forth trees of salvation righteousness love joy peace long-suffering goodness gentleness patience it won't happen just to the brethren random tabernacle or to another another tabernacle it happens to individuals me you you you it happens to individuals the whole thing is moving it's one big unit of god there's only one in it moving if there's only one in it in the brethren tabernacle that's moving god will move with that one with that one and it's the only way to do it fall in line march on blessed be the name of the lord esther has this faith she tells her chamberlains and she tells the children of israel and the bland let's fast let's fast for three days and on the on the third day of the last day i'm gonna walk into the king i'm gonna walk into the palace and i might die if i do it it might get scary guys i might die if i do that's what esther said she remembered who she was for a time like this she was called so she walks into the kingdom she bows her head defies all the laws defies all the rules and a sword comes towards the head because it doesn't matter if she's a king or not the law is the law and they cannot override it it just can just add more to it about to kill it and the king extends the scepter the only form of forgiveness god has extended his scepter to us the enemy is coming with the sword the enemy is coming with the sword to take away our life to take away our understanding take away our peace and our joy and our love the sword is coming down but the lord extended his scepter and then he said ask anything you want even up to half of my kingdom it's yours he hasn't even talked to esther for months because that's just the type of king he was he had a concubine so many different things he didn't need to be with esther but her her her beauty her peace her calmness her wisdom and her tenacity if i don't go now the children will perish please i'm not asking for anything more but please come back i want to host a banquet for you and haman haman's like oh me that's pretty cool they go through the whole process amen gets angry on his way out wants to kill mordecai because mordecai would not bow down to him he still had this blood on his hands and this rage that was raging within him warm smile but war within his heart still fighting so oh man one day he's like oh yeah i already wrote the decree on that day in march they're all going to die i'm going to win the king loves me he put me in the highest position those sins of the earth she calls them back the next day oh hey king this is the this is the final day please save my people how many esthers are in the building today if we can have brother kenny and the musicians just come up here they're asking us the question how many s's are in this building today oh king please spare my people the king was confused he was confused he said your people he had no idea there was just so much going on in the world he was at war he was here he was there he was so many different questions he was asking but the queen esther said spare my people she said oh man he walks away what type of riddle is this what type of poem is this what type of what's up with this what esther's tripping right now her people what do you mean and then she reveals to him her what identity and through her identity she saves the israelites through your identity you'll save the people around you it doesn't matter if they're pagans guys because you think that it might just be oh it's just maine it's just maine oh it's just michigan it's just ohio this is the only people that are gonna you know that they're gonna destroy and kill no it's everyone all over the world this is the body of christ it's not the finger of christ it's the body of christ this is not the elbow of christ the body of christ you have to

of things this order and if even if it did happen even if you fell into sin there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plans beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains it says the dying thief rejoiced to see the fountain in his day and there may i that was me there on the cross standing next to jesus as he was about to be crucified for nothing that was me on the cross i was standing right beside him i'm the i'm the thief i'm the sinner i'm the broken man i'm the stealer i'm the murderer that's me i was there but he said no tell your sins are forgiven all of your sins are forgiven esther gave her life a true redemption story but that didn't end the story they changed the degree heyman was hung because of his treason by putting his hands on the queen the enemy was hung by putting his hand on the child of god [Applause] we know who wins this fight we know who wins this fight the enemy will not win he will not succeed only god will win he has won again and again and again and again come out of babylon children come out of babylon church the enemy was hanging on the gallows that he built he built him 50 cubits high oh yeah mordecai's gonna be right there that's what he said a few days later it's him we know who wins we know who wins stop being afraid stop being afraid walk into that kingdom walk into the palace have no fear be the light that the world can see many people won't even touch this book ever but they're looking at you they're watching you they're watching you every single day right now you have a chance right now you have a moment to fight to flight or to freeze that's it when when that happened mordecai steps into the kingdom they give him the ring he couldn't change the law because the law was the law the decree was a decree but what happened was mordecai wrote added to the law the the jews the israelites were allowed to defend himself the prophet came with the word he said church my friend come here man yeah you're allowed to defend yourself that's our weapon right there you can grab that man so you can grab that you can sit down that's your weapon right there perfect that's your weapon right there church there's nothing else that comes to it wrote to decree children of israel you can defend yourself on that day that came and the persians and the means were coming with with their swords their chariots but god was fighting for us pushing back the darkness pushing it back and at the end of it the israelites were victorious i mean we already knew that was going to happen but it happened so when we're fighting today just know we're going to win but you have to pick up your weapon and you have to fight god is not going to pick us up lullaby no he says you have to fight pick up your weapon today
