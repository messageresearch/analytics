I'm just there's just the whole section of scriptures but I'm just reading one for time's sake and this is the only thought that I want to get to Paul says lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices it's a good scripture for what I just talked about let me read that again I didn't tie that to get together until just now lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices so Paul expresses here that the way things that are supposed to be in a Christian walk and that is the normal way in a Christian believer's Life is that Satan should not have the advantage over us we know it should be the other way around that we should always have the advantage over Satan and and so he expressed as the less Satan should and if you want to read this week uh the preliminary scriptures and what led up to him saying that is actually based upon forgiveness and forgiving one another and forgiving a man who sinned in the church in First Corinthians he sinned and that he was openly coming to church still and taking communion and it was sinning and so they weren't dealing with it they were immature they weren't dealing with the sin in the count and so he rebuked them in First Corinthians and said deliver one up and deal with that sin well they dealt with it and the boy repented and then now he's talking about restoring him and bringing him back and forgiving him and if you forgive him then we'll forgive him so he's in that subject and then he comes we want him he says we want to make sure that's all clear lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices Satan is not to have an advantage in a believer's life we're not called for him to take advantage of us we're not called for the devil to slap us around we're not called called for the devil to bully us we're not called for the devil to intimidate us [Applause] can I get an amen this morning we're not called for the devil to slap us around and take advantage of us and intimidate us and I'm reminded of a quote that says overcoming means recognizing the devil at every one of his tricks in other words we want to live a life that's such ahead of the game that even before he brings the Temptation we know what it is we know the path that Satan's going down we know what trap he's trying to bring us in I would like to be able to live I'm just speaking to my wife the other day and was talking about the blood of Jesus Christ and I said hun it has to be two sides of the blood of Jesus Christ that it has the power to forgive us when we make a mistake how many believe it has the power to forgive us when we make a mistake how many is glad for that power but we also know there's another side to the blood of Jesus Christ and that is it has the power in it to protect us and keep us from sin and so many churches only preach this side of it that he forgives us when we sin but they Don't Preach enough on the other side that it's powerful enough to even keep us and protect us from sin best case scenario is we're living close to the Lord and there's less and less mistakes happening because we're living under the power of God every day to protect us from sin I can give you scriptures for that but that's the case we don't want to preach either side because a lot of times churches will preach the one side where if you get this and you have this experience you're going to do this and you're never going to make a mistake again that's not true then why would we need the blood of Jesus Christ because we're still in these bodies and we make mistakes but if we keep preaching this side we'll go on and on and keep making mistakes and not call upon God say God let me ask forgiveness from you but God put a power in my life that I would never do that again can I get a greater amen this morning the blood of Jesus Christ has covered it all for the believer's life and he is not supposed to be intimidating and taking advantage of Satan is not supposed to be taken advantage of us to have the advantage means this dude to have the advantage means a condition or a circumstance that puts one in a favorable or a superior position I'm going to read it again it means that a condition or circumstance that puts one the devil in this case it that condition or circumstance has put the devil in a favorable or a superior position in your life in other words something happens some incident happened a condition happen you got under the right atmosphere excuse me you got to understand maybe a wrong atmosphere because it goes both way right atmosphere a wrong atmosphere is going to put either God or the enemy in a superior position in your life so conditions or circumstances someone has a trial someone has a lost loved one someone has something bad happened to them even if a Christian circumstances or certain conditions if we're not careful it's not just what happens to us it actually elevates and promotes Satan in a superior position in our life I'll make it simple you make a mistake and the devil's beating you up and putting you down you're nobody you're not a son or daughter of God and keeps even though you have forgiveness you'll be beating yourself up the devil's beating yourself up and so now you stay there and guess what the devil has used your mistake to put himself to give himself a promotion or you gave him a promotion to a superior place in your life that he's taken advantage of the situation a lost loved one oh God you know we there's hard things to go through but the worst part of it is to give Satan through that situation a superior position in your life he's taken advantage of you he's beating you up he's keeping you depressed he's making you question the word of God and so to take advantage means a condition or circumstances that puts him in a superior position things happen and Satan gets in a superior position over you through that many circumstances happen in life and in a church many circumstances happen many different Spirits can come in a church and then at the end of it he if Satan takes advantage of the situation then we got a problem because we're going to have situations we're going to have circumstances but if Satan gets the advantage in it that's the problem can I get an amen he binds things up he kills unity and it was just a situation but if it turns into Satan getting a promotion in your life let me say it clearly if a situation or a trial or something wrong you've been done wrong or a mistake you're made that's one thing we can bring it to the Lord can you say it back but that's one thing but if if it makes you give Satan a promotion in your life and his position that's where you're going to have a problem he does not have a right unless you give it to him for a superior position to take advantage over you somebody say praise the Lord he doesn't have a right for that position we got to kick him out can you say man sometimes Satan takes little things and makes them huge things sometimes Satan takes something little and you can deal with it and he makes them big things and he gets the victory he gets dominance over you in the end result he's defeating you and we should say no devil no devil we're not going to let you do that you have not been given any Superior position in my life you're not going to take advantage of me you're not going to use any extreme situation to take advantage of my life he doesn't belong in that position he doesn't belong in your thoughts can you say Amen who gave him a place at the table in your thoughts he doesn't even have a right for a place at the table in your thoughts and you give them a place at the table he doesn't have a right it's like when he comes in your thoughts you should be saying what are you doing here I didn't invite you what are you doing here get out it's the door get out can I get an amen trying to make it simple for all of us is that you give them a place in the table and he doesn't have a right in the believer's Life a place at the table he doesn't have an opinion he doesn't have an appeal why are you listening to Satan's opinion he doesn't get an opinion it's my private world and yet Satan finds any way that he can to get into your house because how many knows the Bible says he's a thief he finds ways to come through the back doors of your life or even the basement window and you're saying I got that secured I got that locked there's no way he could have got in there listen if you're dealing with the professional Thief I don't care how much you've secured your house a professional Thief they have ways you're not a professional Thief but professional thieves It's amazing And you think they never get in there they never get in that basement window nobody could fit through that basement window don't underestimate the thief don't underestimate the thief that Satan is trying to get in your house I said brother Paul what's my house hold up your hands point back at yourself this is your house and the Bible says it's a temple of the Holy Ghost it's and and it's not a temple of the Holy Ghost but you rent out rooms to the devil it's not you can't call it the temple the mind the spirit the body everything and you can't say God is allowed in my soul but my body or my eyes every once in a while I rent out for other things no no if it's to be filled every fiber is to be filled and controlled by the Holy Spirit but Satan is a professional thief and he knows how to get in the back door now we're learning what's on Satan's mind and you have to know you can't be ignorant of Satan's devices you cannot be dumb concerning his schemes that he comes against you you can't not shut every window and every door of your household it has to be protected by the blood and by the word every day can you say Amen because there are too many devices that Satan is in control of and he'll get he's gonna come in that basement window he's going to come in through that phone he's going to come in to that app that you have on your phone he's going to come in through that that new app that just came out he's going to come in through the movies that you're watching he's going to come in through the music you're listening to he's going to come into what you're listening to on the radio any place that he's given he's going to try to sneak in your house I'm asking you to go back to the scripture that Paul instructs us as Believers we should not be ignorant of Satan's devices we should not be ignorant of how these things affect the brain can you say about and we should live that the devil does not have an advantage over us in any area of our life he does not belong in that place can you say Amen this is the devil's mind you want to know what he's thinking every day God's got Protections in place for the daughter of the king I'm preaching to the daughter of the king today I'm preaching to the Bride of Jesus Christ and God has put Protections in place for her and every day the devil is trying to ponder and scheme to get around those protections you ought to know that and you ought to say I'm not ignorant of his devices or what's on his mind I'm Gonna Keep the Protections in place I'm gonna read the word to my kids you know I almost weep because you might some of you older ones may resist this I don't know what you're gonna what you're gonna leave saying today it's fine with me but you know what I'm preaching to a lot these young lives that's going to be baptized today these young children they're gonna hear from this pastor because they're going to go into a world that is perverted and dirty everything that's good they're gonna hear a holy man of God tell them what truth is because I care for the future if we're here another 10 years they need to hear truth they need to Value the Protections in place they need to Value when a pastor says don't be alone together in a car with a guy or girl they need a pastor who says don't be doing these things don't touch one another don't kiss one another until you're married I don't care what standards you've developed the message says it the word says it and I'm going to preach tell keep preaching our young children this beautiful God I just I'm tired of the devil taking advantage [Applause] excuse me for my anger I'm not angry at you but I'm standing I trust you stand with your standing Affinity who takes advantage we say something that's the way that I want to live before the devil I want to live every day that the devil what he's thinking is that I'd like to get him but he's so hard to get to come on people raise your hand how many would like to live a life where the devil gets up Monday morning and say I have issues with this guy because I've looked at his life he's got every door covered everything locked up it's gonna be hard for me to get a plan together because he's hard to get to the Virgin bride of Jesus Christ that they the bride Jesus himself the reason the Devil Couldn't get to Jesus is because he had been sprayed with the repellent of predestination he knew his position he knew he was in the mind of God he knew he was predestinated to come to this earth and that strength was a protection and a repellent against Satan I'm preaching to a bride in this age and a bride that's listening online there's been protections put in place the repellent of predestination has been preached and when she stands in her position in the word it's hard for Satan to get to her bride is living in a place that if she'll stay behind the protections of God's word God has made it hard to get to this bride unless you open the doors and ignore the word of God you say well we don't have anything today we don't have anything for the Modern Problems yes we do God has sent us a message of Christ of the last days God has restored us back to the word don't ever let the devil tell you that there's not something in the word for a protection and place against the enemy God has made it hard to get to this bride look at all the word he gave to us in this hour and if you'll respect it and you'll live it Satan can't take advantage of your life guess what Satan's days are numbered Satan will come to an end someday but the bride will not come to an end thank you this isn't the end for the bride you make a mistake it's not the end for you but there will be an end to Satan someday there will be an end to him accusing us there will be an end to his thoughts he's putting in our mind that one day the accuser of our Brethren will be cast down that's promises in the Bible aren't you glad today that there will be an end to this mind that's coming against you every day there will be an end to that but to the bride who's living in the protections there will be no end to her she's going from here she's going in a Rapture she's going in a thousand years of Peace honeymoon and then she's going to a new heavens and a new Earth she does an end she keeps going on for eternity even though she makes mistakes even though she's went through things even though she lived right in the middle of Satan's Eden with his mind just conniving things constantly conniving scheming what can I do get around all this certain things in place brothers and sisters I know what you got to say about yourself but you can just say God's put things in place if I'll read it and I'll feed on it I will put that in my mind there's Protections in place Satan will not be able to get around thank you for watching our message today if you would like more
