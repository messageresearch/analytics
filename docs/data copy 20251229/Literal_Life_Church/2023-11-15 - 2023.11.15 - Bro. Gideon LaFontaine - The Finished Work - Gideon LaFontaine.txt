then she's also eating she's also eating as far as the last couple days she's eating food solid food amen so the Lord's still working amen I'm going to keep testifying of it amen testifying of the finished work amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen he is he's truly really good to us amen amen we can intercede for even unbelievers amen praise the Lord praise the Lord so let's go to go to the word of God tonight John 19 just a very focused on you know a certain thought tonight try I'll try not to Veer away too much from just this thought of the finished work the finished work amen praise the Lord and then we'll go to verse 28 and then we'll just read through verse 30 all right after this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith I thirst now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon his up and put it in his mouth when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished he bowed his head and gave up the ghost let's just bow our heads tonight just ask for the Lord's leadership dear heavenly father Lord we thank you Lord for just a wonderful atmosphere already God lord singing the song of Zion Lord Jesus unto you Lord just refreshes our souls already God I can already tell it's a lord there's good ground around us right now Lord Jesus Lord and we just Lord come expecting tonight a word from you lord lord I just uh I get myself out of the way Lord and just uh Lord I pray that you'd speak through me tonight Lord Jesus Lord and bless the hearers tonight God that they be fed Lord by the word of God we need it more and more God Jesus not we don't want to Lord get LAX in our walk with the Lord we we want to be closer to you Lord Jesus and always seeking you for what's next Lord Jesus we need it Lord we thank you Lord I know it's just a simple message tonight God and Lord that's about all I can offer Lord God but Lord Lord I just I I pray that you

just lift her up in prayer for a complete Lord healing Lord of her body Lord Jesus and we give that situation to you Lord Jesus we love you Lord and Lord as me and Josh Lord in the next couple days Lord go off to overseas Lord protect us Lord God as we're on uh Lord on the trip Lord and keep us safe Lord that Lord that we we we at that time lord would even be blessed by what we see Lord Jesus God by what we hear God and Lord the things we see Lord would just refresh us Lord God that we really are a blessed people Lord Jesus here we love you Lord and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated tonight amen so it is finished it is finished it's completely done what a proclamation what a proclamation amen I can stop now I think I'm done it is finished amen praise the Lord so that that gets me excited just right there it is finished the work is complete amen amen what do we think of when we we see a finished work by the definition I looked up uh my mom actually got me a a really nice definition Bible of the Hebrew and Greek so here's a few definitions of that that word is finished or that that phrase too which uh it means end complete execute conclude discharge of a debt accomplish make an End expire fill up finish go over pray perform says to make an end or to accomplish complete something generally in passive of time of passive meaning to be ended fulfill to accomplish filling execute fully amen praise the Lord amen to pay off or in full such as taxes tribute to perfect Amen to finish complete completely to comp to complete complete fully to complete finish to finish en entirely and end to death amen to fill up completely to complete so I'm I'm kind of repeating it but there's just a continuity it's it's done it's completed amen praise the Lord praise the Lord so what do we do when we think of that word finished I always like to just just bring it down to what we go through in our daily life like for me in nursing school when I was done and finished with nursing school I was rejoicing I was happy amen that was something that God brought me through and I can testify today that was all him amen praise the Lord but when I was finished it was done amen just like our you know another example is our kids days I mean as fun as it was with the performance you can take a big sigh of relief when it is completely done and there's you know you're done amen it's finished amen uh Rebecca Graham she's in Cross Country I'm sure the race get gets hard at times but what what are you looking for the Finish Line amen when it's done when it's over amen well funny story for me uh you know I was the me and Kyle can relate to this we were the pudgy T pudgy kid on the soccer team right I wasn't in shape a lot of the time going in conditioning for those years right but he would get us he would get us running around that field over and over again and it you know I'd be the last one you know tra you know trailing the whole group you know but all I know is like I just got to finish I just got to finish and then when he'd say when he'd Blow That Whistle it's done that big sigh of relief you could hear you could hear the whole soccer team Amen artist finished a painting and then sometimes even maybe a a wife and let me hear an amen if you can relate to this like when jobs are done around the house without you asking right amen amen you don't have to say something specific right but the job's just done it's finished amen so um even when our kids do that sometimes um I also maybe Gabby's not in here right right now but sometimes she'll come in my room she's like wouldn't it just feel good wouldn't it just feel good if it was just done if it was just clean right now and uh you know I give my whole Spiel my weak excuses you know but um she always you know bugs me but it is it's a good feeling when just in the human sense of something being done completed amen praise the Lord so so something in our natural that likes and appreciates that something complete it's done so tonight I want to focus right on that the finished work amen the finished work the finished work I'm speaking has nothing to do with you though nothing to do with us with our works but it's everything to do with with what Jesus did and is still doing for us amen it's a completed work amen in the sight of God how many can believe this in the sight of God our righteousness and our works are as filthy rags amen that's the what the word of God says amen a filthy rags but when God starts a work he completes that work amen what he says he will do amen that's 100% guarantee he will finish it amen isn't that exciting when we serve a god like that he will finish the work amen praise the Lord he doesn't say say anything halfway we're not half do it lefon tains anymore dad he does it all the way amen praise the Lord praise the Lord so looking back looking back on the the law in the Old Testament um the blood so the blood had to be shed in order for God's people to have their sins covered based on the law based on based on that they had to continually do this in order for this for in in order to for Fellowship to happen communion with God worship with God Amen look at look at the first chapters of Leviticus it it it goes through all the offerings that go through and all of them have the same continuity blood was shed amen blood was shed so many other examples of shed blood and you can you can go on you can go on uh Noah you can go Isaac and Abraham you can you can talk about the whole Old Testament there were shed blood in a continuity amen look at Adam and Eve after the fall why did this is just a question why did Blood have to be shed it was because blood is what caused the fall that blood issue amen that that seed issue that blood issue amen it was because of that blood is what caused the fall it was a blood issue PE so this is what I I present to you people wonder why and people wonder why in the world why sexual sin is the most hurtful sin to everyone around them amen it affects families it affects spouses it affects it it just affects churches everyone around them every human that has gone through anything like that can say that that is some of the worst pain they've ever felt is when sexual sin happens amen can I can I maybe maybe some of you have gone through some of that can you agree set any type of sexual sin that you hear of it just Grieves you as a human being amen it just hurts you think about the long-term effects this has on the natural human being the scars sexual scars can be the most damaging scars that Satan can use against the an individual the sexual scars amen that's why fathers and mothers I encourage you tonight I I I encourage you fathers you're your daughter's protector am amen you are your son's protection you are the Holy Ghost for them amen until they until the time God God has them to receive it so be careful of the influence you let in the home amen those things that you let in the home that might have a because this is a sex driven world Amen how many can agree with everywhere you look every billboard every every uh everything you flip on the Internet it's it's something to do with it amen you can't get away can't get around it amen so the infants you let in the home the movies the music the books amen so we know that Satan only perverts right God God has a provided way what he had he wanted amen but Satan can only pervert so let the Watchmen of that Holy Spirit I'm just encouraging the fathers and and and mothers to take a stand in your home Amen Let The Watchmen rise up and say as for me in my house we will serve the Lord amen praise the Lord that's what the Holy Ghost will do to you it turn a home completely around amen praise the Lord hallelujah so often so often we get so off we go to church service this is the something the lord gave me a while ago but we go to church service and and an evil spirit we might have an evil spirit manifest in the front or something and we all know by by the message that brother brandom told us you know bow your heads close your eyes right and everything will be okay you know you're you're you're away from that Spirit you know you're you're consecrated right there I believe that with all my heart that is the truth amen I believe that and help your children under that understand that as well but don't forget the home don't forget what you let in the home amen what your eyes see in the home what I question sometimes people sometimes when they bring up when they bring that up that whole example of a spirit being manifest what goes in the service uh because they start talking about the music and M music the music and movies they watch and they're letting things in right there right I know this is tough but I want you to see something so unashamed they talk about the movies they watch the things they listen to and they're so unashamed of it and you're letting things in right there amen that in a service right right in a service you would be oh we got to close our eyes we got to we we got to close our children's eyes but what what's happening in the home what are you doing on your alone time amen the Lord told me to call out some Luke's swarmed spirits tonight so I'm going to do it as the Lord as the Lord leads amen the god of what happens here in this building this building is the same God of what you let in your let in your alone time what let what you let in your home what you let in your thought life amen is that the truth can anyone testify amen praise the Lord we'll go to Matthew 624 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold the one and despise the other he cannot serve God in Mamon Amplified said he can't serve God in Mamon with Mamon money possessions Fame status or whatever is valued whatever is valued more than the Lord anything you put before God is an idol you believe it amen John 2 1 John 2:15 let not the world neither the things of that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof I love this but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever amen what's the will of the Lord amen praise the Lord back to the will of God his provided way amen what's his provided way of worship praise the Lord so we go back to this this this Adam and Eve amen and a God who is rich in Mercy Adam and Eve are hiding because of the blood issue amen that seed issue God calls Adam by name amen aren't you glad he calls us by name amen praise the Lord God provides a sacrifice as a covering for Adam and his wife God never accused Adam he looks straight this is what he does he doesn't accuse Adam he looks for him amen he looks straight he doesn't look at he's looking at the serpent and what he did amen and condemns and casts him to the ground amen praise God Amen he's not looking at the Adam he's looking at who caused it amen praise the Lord praise God praise God and then you keep going on to a Cain and Abel right you got two offerings and you can kind of see you see the fruit of what what happened in the garden amen you see the the difference between the offerings you see the fruits of that Abel caught a revelation of true worship and what is it by it's by an innocent blood sacrifice amen amen praise the Lord by faith Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain amen Hebrews 11:4 and then Genesis uh Genesis 4 the two offerings amen we can just turn that turn to that kind of want to just take my time tonight on the scriptures if we can Genesis 4 just the you can start at the first one I'll just read with you guys here and Adam knew his wife Eve and she conceived in Bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his son Abel and Abel was keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that Cain Cain brought a fruit of the fruit of the ground an offering unto to the Lord and Abel he also brought the first slings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord this says the Lord respect had respect unto Abel and to his offering amen but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is it thou countenance Fallen why if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him so I'm getting to the separation you see of the two offerings right see Abel was a Shepherd he recognized that the blood's sacrifice was the way of worship amen unto the Lord God respected abeles and not canes amen I like when God just makes this is this and this is this right he just he makes it just like that amen Cain's sacrifice was all about his work though amen it was all about him tilling the ground right all about what he was doing amen and uh Cain recognized I believe Cain recognized something you know about about God as far as what what his parents you know uh talked with him about about the whole story but he recognized he recognized God gave him a revelation of what what true what what the offering should be amen and that was shed blood amen he recognized that it's nothing about him it's all about the blood being shed amen praise the Lord C's was about the works amen look at what I can do it's dead religion amen so what did Jesus say he said Matthew 17713 he said enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many there be which go in in there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth unto life and few be there be that find it because of false beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are raving wolves he shall know them by their fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit for a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil TR fruit and good a good tree cannot bring forth evil truth fruit getting the tongue twisters tonight neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every every tree that bringeth forth not fruit forth good fruit is heed down and cast Into the Fire wherefore by their fruits you shall know them amen now everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the king shall enter the the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven amen many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in my name and in thy name have cast out devils and the name done many wonderful Works see look they're looking at what they have done amen they're looking at what they have done or what they have accomplished what that's dead religion amen it's all about what I can do what candle I can light what so and then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye worker of iniquity amen praise the Lord it keeps going and talks about a a man building his house on the The Rock and then the you know the man that um the foolish man he built on the sand right so looking at that rock or Revelation amen we have by faith Abel amen that Revelation he had a revelation of that blood sacrifice that provided way Nothing by his works that he did but it was by the blood amen blood applied praise the Lord amen so we have in the approach to God this is in 1955 um this was a real good uh quote saying basically at the end he's talking about how how sometimes you can um you can uh compare your experience with another with another one this was an example about healing brother brandom I'm a Christian and I got sickness now and I wonder why it came um God may be purging you God or giving you some trials make you draw a little closer to him pray a while then heal you amen I love that then you can have a testimony amen praise the Lord Christ heals you and you say well I heard he he healed others um and you know from from what I'm understanding you know I heard the here I heard he he healed others you know a certain way and it was quicker I thought it was awful hard when I was getting mine and if it had just been me I would have failed but something in me not me keeping it but it keeping me amen the question is not whether I hold out or not it's whether he held out or not amen and if he held out I'm sure to be there then the question isn't whether I can do it or not it's whether he did it or not praise the Lord I believe he did it that settles it amen praise the Lord amen he said it I believe it he said it it is done amen praise the Lord praise the Lord so I'm kind of circling back back to one of our definitions I found a word on there and I'm not really um I'm not really the the most like aware of what happens in a courtroom but I've never I've never like been in one that I know of there was a few times when my dad had some rental properties I was came close probably but um never been in one so I just looked up a few things about you know what kind of happens in the US government you know as far as a courtroom right so um so I looked up this word which one of the meanings in um it is finished is discharge right discharge from all debts amen so looking at the too meaning um Cornell Cornell Law puts um discharge of debts refers to the process in bankruptcy court when a debtor listen to this when a debtor is no longer liable for their debts and the lender is no longer allowed to make attempts to collect that debt praise the lord it's a discharge amen of all debts praise God the def defendant is the individual being accused so I I just did some more research the defendant I like I I really had to look up everything because I don't I don't know the defendant is the individual being accused of the crime or code in civil cases I might have this wrong if if uh if I am then just tell me after okay because I'm I'm you know I'm on a certain track here the plff is the person who is Alle alleged that wrongdoing has has been done to them right so let's just say in this case um you know the other person the plantiff is accusing the defendant that they're um they have a debt to be paid okay that's that's let's just keep it simple that way all right so I'm going to set up and Kyle you told me last Wednesday that I need an example so I'm going to use you tonight all right so you come on up here and we'll go through this together amen I want you to just see this clearly tonight amen hopefully you can just look at it look at the court case and uh and picture yourself right in there amen all right so I want you you're the good guy actually you're the well yeah kind of you're the defendant yes so I'm the pl plaintiff so I'm just setting up a um I'm just setting up the like the just basic us courtroom okay we've got a judge right and we'll we'll just pick my dad as the judge he seems like a good fit so you come on up here and Brandon you can be the attorney for the defendant okay I'm the plantiff which I'm accusing Kyle does that make sense everyone on the same page okay so you come up sit right here that works I like that all right so in a regular courtroom we've got me as a plaintiff I'm accusing him okay and you're his lawyer pretty much right you're standing up for him he owes me a debt he does all right and you got something to say that says I don't owe the debt okay and then you make the rule at the end you hit your gavel right there okay all right so there it is that's it all right so now we're going to a u so this is my next step I'm going to a US this is what this would happen Okay in the us if we were working from the courtroom of God okay so you actually leave all right you go back to your seat all right so now I'm the plaintiff all right I'm walking in the courtroom all right and I see what's going on here and this is this is just me and the US and just just imagine how it would be for me if I had to walk into this courtroom so I'm walking as the plaintiff there's there's no judge I'm looking up there's no judge there I'm like okay so no one's going to make the rule right no one's going to f make the final stand but then all of a sudden Brandon the attorney he stands up and he starts walking up there so now I'm wondering whoa what's going on what's going up go ahead and stand there Brandon all right so me as the plantiff I'm I'm wondering okay what's going on I I'm accusing him but he's speaking for him I'm going to lose okay I can't win in this situation all right so now my favorite part all right so you can stay there here we are so now I'm going to put some characters where they need to be all right so now I'm the plantiff but you can also call me Satan all right you can call me Satan all right and then you can you can call Kyle you can call Kyle a a sinner okay or just an individual all right but then you can call now now you can call in the kingdom of God this is how it works you can call Kyle the judge and the attorney right because he's this is Jesus Christ right not Brandon you don't understand what I'm saying but Jesus Christ is now our judge and he's our attorney amen do you believe that so now here I am here I am the devil I I walk into this courtroom and and I I I walk in I open the door and I'm just I've got some charges to make to Brother Kyle here amen all have sinned and come short of the glory of God Kyle amen the P the the penalty of sin is death amen the penalty of of sin is death I've got some things that I've got with you amen Kyle so but now I've got Jesus Christ as my attorney and Jesus Christ as my judge speaking for me and all he's saying I've got a debt that Kyle hasn't paid me amen and I'm looking at him the attorney and the judge is saying it's paid in full amen and now I I bring in my I bring in my notes and I look get my notes and I look at the paper and there's nothing there amen I can't find a trace of it why because before the foundation of the world all that was written Away by the BL blood of the Lamb amen it was gone completely done amen it was finished amen are you seeing the picture tonight amen he's Jesus Christ he's our attorney and he's our judge amen he makes the final Rule and he's standing up for us amen he's our big brother standing up praise God you may be seated praise the Lord hallelujah that's a win like you can't get around it amen it's a guaranteed win it's what brother brother brandham says in the church AE book see for shity that the eternity the attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge the judge the case is settled it's done it's done amen so this changes everything we might look at the rule we might look at a US court but when we're in God's court amen the blood speaks in our place amen hallelujah praise the lord we can say when cancer comes around the blood speaks in our Our Place amen praise the Lord when when depression starts to rise the blood speaks in our place amen praise the Lord when we've got Suicidal Thoughts of the devil put putting lies in our mind the blood speaks in our place tonight can I get an amen tonight hallelujah praise the Lord what whatever the Dax whatever the devil throws at you all you got to do is look there's nothing on the paper there's nothing on the paper tonight Hallelujah sexual sin anything that you've gone through amen we've all have sinned so even if you were even if you were raised raised the perfect way which Kyle probably says that there's not a sin to my name but there is all right so but it doesn't matter we're all in need of that blood amen praise the Lord that gets me excited tonight when that blood intercedes for us and it is finished amen praise the Lord Jesus Paid It all all to him I own praise the Lord praise the Lord this is just one more time Lord in 63 Satan has no more power amen only as he can Bluff with it if he can Bluff you into it all right you have to have it but legally listen he has no power at all every Power he had was taken from him at Calvary that's where the price was paid he is nothing but a bluff if you want to listen to his bluff well all right but you don't have to you don't have to you are free tonight he has made you free amen praise the Lord amen the devil has no legal right to amen that's what I'm trying to tell you tonight amen but you got to believe it amen let the death angel pass tonight his claims the devil's claims are useless when it comes to Christ all accusers they drop their Stones when Christ walks in amen praise the Lord Romans 81 there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen no condemnation amen for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death praise the Lord his blood was broken his Spirit poured out amen now we have access to it amen amen John 8:36 if the son therefore shall make you free this ISS he shall you shall be free indeed amen that's the promise praise the Lord so look so what goes along I'm probably going way too fast tonight but praise the Lord amen amen it's finished amen I wish I could say that right now it's finished I'm done what goes along with the finished work and man I think I got to a little bit of it what what Christ completes so we can over have an overcoming life so there's no condemnation full and complete deliverance amen baptism of the Holy Ghost by the Broken Bloodshed amen praise the Lord by his stripes we are healed amen it's not something that can happen it's already done amen praise the Lord by the Lamb of God who takes Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world Amen some sin is completely gone and by sin all unbelief is gone amen praise the Lord unbelief is gone fear is gone depression anxiety praise the Lord thank you Lord sickness gone Suicidal Thoughts praise the Lord hallelujah now just not not just covered it like the Old Testament right he uh he conquered it all amen he conquered he's our Mighty conqueror that's the reason we say Believers amen we're we're Believers because we rest in that finished work amen we believe we have faith in that finished work amen praise the Lord nothing now in our righteousness but by the finished work at Calvary we are righteous in his sight praise the Lord praise the Lord amen I love this this is uh this is Isaiah's this is Isaiah's prophecy amen and you can kind of see predestination right here because before Isaiah even spoke this God had it in his mind but he was wounded Isaiah 53:5 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen so we have access to all of this amen the God had it in his mind before you were around it all amen amen that he wanted to be he he wanted to be your healer amen wanted to be your deliverer amen and and and he had the whole plan set out that it was going to be by that blood amen praise the Lord by that by his stripes we are healed praise the Lord no wonder we do the Lord's Supper as Believers we need a constant this is what we need a constant reminder of the freedom we have in his broken body and his Bloodshed amen why because in our flesh in our flesh we fear we act up we act out by what we see amen but we need that blood applied over every part of our life amen you can just take anything it's finished you can put that put that just lay it before your eyes all the time it is finished amen I encourage you tonight I also encourage you tonight to listen to the last 15 minutes of uh God hiding himself in Simplicity because it talks talks about bleach it talks about ink right you got to understand something it's so simple the way he puts it and it really is God hiding himself right there there's bleach and you you pour you pour a drop of ink in that bleach right it can't touch it can't touch the bleach right so that's Christ amen that bleach is Christ interceding for us I had it the other day it was uh I I I got some ink on my white shirt I got some ink on my white shirt and uh I put just the a few drops of that bleach on there and uh that that spot there was whiter than the rest of the other shirt that was so so that's what I'm trying to say that bleach is Christ for us amen that bleach is is the blood going red on red our sin in him amen and it's making it completely white amen that's what he did amen praise the Lord it is finished tonight it happened the other and then so what I'm getting at is his his his gift of love must be accepted though right his gift of that blood must be accepted amen just like the story of of the slave amen and uh Abraham Lincoln right he had he had the paper that said you know he's free amen he signed Abraham Lincoln's name but he didn't believe that it was you know it was designed by him he was like no that can't be possible amen But but so it's got to be accepted it does no good if if you don't apply that blood at all amen if you don't accept that blood in your life amen does no good only believe it's very simple the work is already accomplished it's done but it must be accepted or it does nothing accept him in all that he has amen amen every word amen that cometh out of the mouth of God every word will I live by amen praise the Lord and even in this day amen it's not CU sometimes sometimes people like to separate the Bible and and the message it's it's all in the same it's in continuity amen so don't be deceived when we're when we're talking about accepting all of him amen that's that's that's all running in continuity together amen amen I I don't understand when people say that because whenever I am listening all I see is the Bible amen what it's what it's bringing out so amen you can't separate those two things they're running right in right with each other amen all works with the continuity amen so don't try so don't try and um on your own way accept God's provided way everything you have need up to tonight amen everything you have need of tonight it is finished amen he he spoke it amen it is is finished tonight amen if you come with a need tonight something on your heart maybe maybe uh just conviction and you know now you know it's it's it's finished I can I can claim the blood over over that situation amen I can claim it and we have that Authority amen it's nothing that we do but we just claim it we receive it amen and it's the Simplicity of it amen praise the Lord he said it I believe it it's done amen claim your rights right now praise the Lord amen and I just want to pull this I'm probably very um very short here but I I just go through this this last quote real real slow with you guys but it's in uh the Victorious Christ but it's in the patmas vision here um and I'm really glad I'm really glad I I got to go to Genesis and I got to go to Revelation tonight amen I got to speak where uh the devil doesn't like it at all amen we exposed the devil tonight didn't we amen he's a liar amen he's a bluff amen we've got the freedom in that blood amen praise the Lord so just read read along this with me Revelation 117 and 18 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I'm he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and death amen this is the God we serve no human being could stand the full effect of that Vision his strength utterly Gone John fell at his feet as those dead as though dead but the hand of the Lord in love touched him and the voice of blessing said fear not don't be afraid I'm the first and the last I he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more but is there what is there to fear the Judgment that fell upon him at the cross at that grave and when he descended was for us amen he absorbed thank you Lord he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation Hallelujah to them which are in Christ Jesus see before see for sure that going back it's our attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge as judge is the case as judged the case is settled it is finished there is now therefore no condemnation why should the church fear amen as we walk by faith amen what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us why should I fear punishment or death amen he has all it has all been overcome here is the mighty conqueror here is the one who conquered Both Worlds of the seen and unseen not like Alexander who conquered the world at the age of 33 and and no and no and knew no other way to turn for further Conquest so he died a victim of sin and rius living not like Napoleon who conquered all Europe but finally Was Defeated at waterl and banished to Alba only to find himself conquered amen but now nothing but nothing could conquer Christ yes he then descended has he that descended has now ascended above all and unto him has been given the name that is above every name yes he conquered death hell and the grave it is finished he is the key he has the keys thereof what he lose loses he loosed and what he he binds his bound there's there's no changing of it there was no conqueror before him and there is none beside him he alone is our savior Redeemer he is the only God and the Lord Jesus Christ is his name amen don't fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I am you are air to amen all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word Wesley you speak the word and I
