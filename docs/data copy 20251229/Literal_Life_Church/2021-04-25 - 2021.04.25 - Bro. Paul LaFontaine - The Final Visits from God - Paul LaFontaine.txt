========================================

and make cakes upon the earth isn't this just like a husband who invites somebody over and forgets to tell the wife and said i need you to quit do a meal and abraham ran under the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto the young man and he hasted to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent which was behind him and abraham and sarah were old well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women and therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure with my lord uh being old also and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i have surety bare child which i'm old is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son he says it again to her he reaffirms the promise that he got years ago in a visitation from god years ago he comes in another visitation to reaffirm i'm going to visit you so you so i want to speak this morning these visits from god and these final visits from god these are significant visits of the lord these are significant visitations of the lord early in his journey and now here at the end and then he speaks of another visit that will bring life to sarah these are important visits these are important times let me finish up here in the reading is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son then sarah denied saying i laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but doubt its laugh and the men rose from fence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment which the lord may bring upon abraham that which he has spoken of him and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous now just to stop here does anybody see that we're right exactly in this position this is written here just as a type can you say man it happened but it's typing our day so this visitation is important because this visitation is where we stand today where the sin is heaped up in sodom and gomorrah but look what he says here now what's going to happen this transition and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous i will go down and see whether they have done all together according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know he is going to go visit sodom himself and investigate if it's as bad as they really say and the men turned their faces from fence and went towards sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord praise the lord i'll just add one more scripture over in the next last visitation in chapter 21 and verse 1. praise god and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken praise the lord that's going to happen with us friends it's happening with us but there's a final visit that i'm looking for gideon sang about it this morning there's a soon and very soon there's a final change of these bodies father bless your word you have come already lord and expressed yourself in such a wonderful way through the songs and we just know that you're present it makes us lord almost your glory fills this place it makes a minister almost want to just stand back lord and just i so want to be used of you today to be the vocals for you lord to be able to hear your voice and speak those things that are needful bless your people bless those as we were thanking many who labored for the meetings blessed them for it and we thank you for the move of god and the changed lives the many testimonies that are coming in lord of of things that we didn't know about and things that we didn't know were laying there and god you come down and spoke things that we we didn't even know and you change lives and you as the song says father you took that which is couldn't be broken and you broke it lord and you you did the impossible lord jesus will take time as we hear these testimonies we'll share them and we'll give glory to you for them lord thank you for what you did in the meetings meet with us and speak to us this morning once again and we'll give you the glory for it in the name of jesus christ amen praise the lord you may be seated i want to speak on the final visits from god the final visits from god and keeping in mind that abraham the father of faith the father of the faith seed what god did in abraham's entire life is a type of how god will visit the church and visit his royal seed from jesus christ who was the royal seed of abraham until the rest of the sons and daughters come culminating in the last days in these last days we find the royal seed of abram has had a journey and in that journey you'll see similar visits from god like as with our father abraham and these visitations should be studied because they're so important but i want to focus on the final visits and jesus himself just so i can tie it together for you jesus pointed to the end time in his prophecies in luke and when he pointed to the end time he used the son of man term and he says so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and he will come and then he tied it to sodom and gomorrah he tied the coming of the lord and the coming of the son of man he tied it with sodom and gomorrah so we know when sodom and gomorrh has risen to a place that judgment is hanging over it we know that we're in already in the time of the son of man he has already come in word form can you say amen we go to meet him in the air but he has already come because the son of man was already visiting abraham when this sodom condition came up can you say amen that's very significant so this visit this particular visit of god was so significant for our time and that he revealed as son of man and uh you know i love to talk about god visiting his people it's an honor when he shows up can you say man it is an honor and i've lived this my whole life god filled me with the holy ghost when i was 16. i never grow weary or tired i never it never becomes common when he shows up and gives a visit to us it never becomes common to me and it should never become common to you it is an honor when god visits his people and as a dispensation god come after many thousands of years and visited this final generation through the ministry of not a reformer not just a godly man not a man that just had a healing gift but a manifestation of the son of man himself brother brad and being and let me make this distinction because people can't seem to make it they think that we're making making a man god no brother branham was a son of man but he was revealing the son of man brother branham was not the son of man jesus christ is the son of man but this end time visitation was a special visitation because the son of man is going to reveal himself through the end time ministry so we're not waiting for that to come we're in that coming right now you know what you won't hear many preachers preaching that on that in the in the community today and i'm not putting them down but i'm saying we're not waiting for the coming of the son of man we're living during the times because jesus worded it he said the revealing of the son of man he didn't necessarily the say the physical return of jesus christ he said the revealing the revealing is an unveiling he's going to unveil jesus christ he's going to unveil who jesus is can you say amen this is the time of the revealing of the son of man and it's in the time when sodom heaps up and when god visits his people because god is god he can appear in different forms can you say amen because god is god he can appear in different forms and most always when he visits his people he does not come in the way people are expecting him to come people are actually surprised most people miss it when he's there and visits they said he was here he was here because they're looking for a certain way for him to come but he has a way god and morphy god can change his form and he can appear in a way that the people didn't expect he can come and flesh even that day with abraham it was a revelation that god showed him that this man sitting down having a meal with him and these two angels were flesh and blood they had features like a human being they had they they had a countenance can you say man so i don't know what distinction abraham had to call one of them lord but it must have been a revelation but he was sitting there in flesh people look for christ and he's on a cloud and he's he's this and he's in a glorified condition that's not the way he sat there and ate meat and had a meal with abraham and it was jesus christ the son of man in a different form so this the visitations from god can be in a different form and that's why people miss him and i'll say this you will miss him if you put him in a certain box if you put him in a certain way he has to come this way you might miss him can you say amen but don't miss his visitation these men were in flesh eating with him and he had features to their face and all these other things and it looked like men but it was a visitation from god now abraham had many visits from god throughout his spiritual journey but these final ones were the last visits and now typing the church now i'm and many of these things are foundational things for the message many of you know some of these things but just so happens i may say some things this morning and i'll tell you where i'm going a little bit because not only was god visiting abraham in the son of man and this matter and the way he's doing with us now but he also says i'm going to visit sodom and i don't know if you read the last two or three days the i'm already calling it what brother ram called it but the increased sightings of lights around the pentagon and it just got my attention matter of fact i read the article i'm going to read some of it this morning i read it and i thought you know i went to the scripture and i was going to go on with my series on david and saul but god just directed me here to take a little time and talk about this current event that's taken place because they don't have a clue there's an increased number of sightings we've always called them ufos and all the other things but we know by the message what they are and then i go to the scripture realize that he just sends his two angels and he sends investigating angels to go down and look at sodom so it's not only the us that's receiving a visit from elohim but god is sending messengers and he right now is investigating this condition in sodom that's another visitation but i'm not interested in that visitation i'm not going to tell you a whole theory about ufos this morning i'm interested in one visitation and that's with this son of man i want to meet with him can you say amen i want to commune with him and i want to invite him and make him feel welcome when he comes my way i don't want to push him off but i want to say lord i'll take this time and i'm going to stand as the bible said those two angels went down to sodom but abraham stood before the lord how many would raise your hand this way and say that's my position right now when there's chaos around this world when covenant is spiking again here's my position i'm just standing before the lord i'm right here looking right in his face i'm not moving from this place let them go look at sodom all they want to abraham stood before the lord and he kept him there as long as he could somebody say praise the lord amen i'll never get to all this without unless i stay with it but you see now then he visits abraham sarah he reaffirms his promise that was at the beginning of his journey and you see then he says i'll visit her according to the time of life and the next year i'm going to give you a visit that you have been looking for for years and so he had been through many things and hagar and all and all these other things but now what he's saying is in this revisit he's saying it's close now my visit the final visit is closed now sarah and she laughed in her heart but he come to revisit to say my final visit is close i'll visit you for the final visit according to the time of life and scholars say that's in another year i'm going to visit you and this promise that you heard at the beginning of your journey i'm going to visit you and this promise is going to trigger so sarah laughed inside because she has not come to how real this is abraham had but sarah being a type of the bride had not come to how real this is and let me just say this i don't think sarah had come to how important this visit was does that sound like some message people to you does that sound like the people who've grown up in the message and they know the quotes and everything so they're sitting in church and just all these quotes oh yes yes i know where he's going i know where he's going and listen it becomes common to us sarah even when she heard the original promise laughed within herself there's a little sarcasm within her i've heard this our whole marriage i've heard this every says abraham said god talked to him said i'm going to have a child she had a little sarcasm not verbally she didn't she respected enough she didn't say it her in her mouth but inside she had a little sarcasm maybe maybe 30 years ago but not now look at me look at look how old i am she had a lack of belief in the promise but yet she's the predestinated one she's a type of the bride that son was not gonna come through any other woman except sarah and let me tell you this morning you can run you can hide you can doubt but god's gonna bring you around to believing this promise like the song said i believe what you said because sarah was going to have it nobody else is going to have it you're predestinated to receive this word and to have a body you're predestinated to have a body change and bring forth the promised son somebody say praise the lord hallelujah she was the one that was going to have it but she or she's doubting and she's she's got a little i tell you friends am i speaking to anybody if you were to be honest you won't say it to me but you need to tell the lord god that's where i'm at this morning i'm like sarah i haven't verbally said nothing disrespectful but in my heart i need you to cause me help me to believe again to believe this message is true i've got this little laugh within me when preachers preach certain things i got this little sarcasm within me may god burn it out of us may god love us out of it before it's too late can you say amen may god take you that have been hurt and you've got to doubt within your heart may you say like the man to jesus lord i believe but help thou my unbelief that's sarah isn't it if you ask her verbally say i believe abraham i believe my husband verbally but she she said lord i believe help thou what's laying down here it's just sarcasm she laughed a little and guess what brother brown says god could have just god could have just said okay that's it your disrespect it's over mcgregor said god couldn't do it because she was part of abraham the bride is bone of his bone flesh of his best you are part of christ he can't disown you you're bone of his bone flesh of his flesh he can't disown you and because sarah was a part of abraham even though she had this sarcastic laugh within herself god come back and says why did you laugh and here's another sign of the son of man that all you should be familiar with if you're not when that son of man revealed himself he revealed the secrets of the heart she was in the tent and she said i didn't laugh in my heart and he said you did laugh and she knew it was true because the son of man knows the secrets of the hearts and for many years the prophet traveled around so now i'm saying if you listen to the to the recordings you're going to see incident after incident not some television preacher that's saying somebody out there has heart trouble i see somebody has this no you're going to see an accuracy because it's not a man it's the son of man discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart i didn't laugh oh yes you did and she couldn't deny it look at god's grace look at god's grace could have wiped her off the face of the earth but she was part of abraham and he said sarah you laugh but i'm going to reaffirm i'm going to say it to you again i will visit you according to the time of life praise the lord how how low do we get sometimes and how much grace does he have to come back and telling you i don't know what you've done just repent i'll forgive you i'm going to visit you according to my life i have a body change for you i have a rapture for you you will bring forth the promised son can somebody say shout praise the lord this morning how many times does god come in all your ignorance and your sarcasm in your heart and whatever is going on your heart and god still comes back and preaches sermons like last sunday to tell you you're my elect you're my people you're my bride can you say a man and you'll come hard or you'll come easy but you're coming can you say amen and i will visit you according to the time of life somebody please get me a hook to put my coat on i will visit you despite your disbelief i will visit you what a visit that's going to be can you say amen so by the secrets of the heart we'll pass some more of that up because we see that that's part of the son of man ministry that's part of this ministry and for people who say that's over it's over in the sense of a prophet gift but the bible says that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so now it's still going on especially like last sunday so many things happen in the meetings last weekend that were secrets of people's hearts revealed through the word being preached can you say amen and people say that here in certain services if you'll yield to the lord and if you'll pray i don't even have to talk to you god can show me in the word and speak some problem in your life or some habit in your life some victory that you need in your life you cannot talk to me all week and god can reveal the secret of your heartbeat how many has had that happen just so the young people and everybody knows raise your hand anybody who's ever had my if you've been a believer even for six months you know that's real had to be god can you say amen praise be to god so notice now the change in verse 20. i got to move along another visit to investigate sodom and gomorrah and so just the word about this visit now i just want to talk about the word visit if you give me a minute the word visit now in the in the he in the greek in the new testament the greek meaning of visit usually just means spending time with someone a visit is just spending time and a lot of times when we think of a visit you just stop by someone's house you're going to visit and it's just to spend time with someone but in the in the old testament in the hebrew word visit if you study the word the word visit is not just to stop by and just see somebody and have a little chat and a coffee and get going that's not there's a deeper meaning when god visits when he comes he's not coming just to have a little chat he's not coming and stopping by just to have a little time with you but there's a deeper purpose there's a deeper meaning to this visit a visit has a strong meaning to god that when he visits there's going to be something take place when jesus is in the room can you say man things take place because he's not just stopping by for a casual visit but you see if we don't invite him in like abraham did it'll become just a casual visit but god doesn't want it to be a casual visit but see we just say okay another sunday put my tithes in the box here we are another sunday and we can let a visit of god we can miss it can you say amen but the word visit in the old testament it's deeper than the new testament and it's used in two sides the one meaning of a visit is actually punishment and uh his visit means punishment how many remembers the scripture this god says i will visit the iniquity of the fathers on the children how many remember that old testament so that visit has a punishment to it that visit has a judgment to it i will visit he's not just coming to say hello he's coming to visit the iniquities of the fathers on the children so we find that side of the meaning in the old testament but but we find uh then the other side of the meaning and incidentally there's only 10 of the words visit in the old testament the hebrew word there's only 10 that means judgment there's only 10 that means punishment when it says visit the other 90 means he comes for a blessing he comes for an appointing to appoint something he comes to lay upon a certain charge to somebody this isn't just a casual stopping by saying hello he wants to give a charge and the last meaning that i love is he comes to deposit something it's not just stopping by saying hello he wants to appoint you he wants to deposit something amen i'll tell you when the son of man visits a generation like he has now he isn't coming just to say just to do miracles and impress you he isn't coming just to do the the first and second pull right he's coming to deposit something the holy ghost to the seat in the elect when he comes into service this morning i want you teenagers to listen to me when he comes it's not paul lafontaine it's not just some casual visit to church and you see this and then and gideon leads songs you've got to look at this different because when our lord comes the way that he's come this morning he wants to deposit something in your soul he wants to appoint you to something he wants to call your heart it's not just a casual car hey glad you showed up see you next week and sunday that's how some people are they walk out those doors never crack their bible never crack the message if you can crack the message never look at anything else lord really enjoyed that this morning you felt your presence there see you next sunday let me say something to you there might not be another sunday what guarantee you have that this is you're going to be able to come back next sunday might be over it might be the last visit of the bride on monday morning from six to nine and there'll be no service you'll come here and looking for cars and there ain't nobody here because why the final visit took place and you missed it you think about it so we don't we don't say lord i'll see you next week lord i really enjoyed it it was nice to talk to you you really talked to me in the service day really blessing and i appreciate all the compliments but you know what i'm looking for the same thing as god what did it do for you right it might be the last sunday i was praying yesterday morning at five in the morning i said lord i think it was just i've been up every morning at five for some reason can't go back to sleep praying for you all praying for revival i was in this building last night praying for these everybody who sits in these just praying god put me in that atmosphere to call upon the things of god for the people's sake been burdened about some situations and and then i had a wonderful discussion last night with one of my family members with such a relief i was waking up and so i couldn't think of anything else i was praying but i said lord could this be the morning for the rapture please even so come quickly i don't need to go to church tomorrow i can go to the ultimate youth camp in the sky you know there is a scheduled youth camp where we'll all be the same age about 21. is anybody interested in registering for that youth camp is anybody interested there's camps coming up this summer by the way we're going to have the retreat talk brother barry into it we're going to have the retreat this year if anybody's wanting to know we're going to do again but there's no camp there's no retreat like this ultimate youth camp coming up and i said lord can it be in the morning i'm ready i'm laying here and listen take me lord let's go can you say man man i don't have to worry about the bills and the yard working lay my burdens down can you say amen leave it to somebody else to take care of that's not why i want to go i want to go because i want to be with my lord and i'm tired of this sodom condition people are going absolutely insane and the prophet said that they would they're not the mental faculties of many people most people are going they're going lulu they're going crazy can't think properly a woman yesterday in an accident you're standing outside the car just as just a temper just crying yelling cussing just you know it's just a little fender bender but she's she's like about ready to have a war there over a fender bender somebody hit her my wife said brother ben said they go totally insane they're not going to settle down everything triggers them so i'm ready to go how about you when god comes and visits it's not just a casual event he comes to deposit something he comes to put something within you and you have to believe and receive that what he said i believe it let me receive it but a visit from god and when he said i'm visiting you now and i'm going to visit you sarah according to the time of life sarah should not have been laughing sarah should have been saying thank you lord when is it going to be isn't it a year i can't wait glory i can't wait to that visit that's the final visit brother bob that's the final visit that i'm looking forward to sarah should have been praising the lord and i pray your faith can rise in the next months or weeks or today whatever it is that you get rid of your doubt that you get rid of your hurt and pain that you get rid of your sarcasm and say just purely say i believe there's a final visit for this bride and i am a part of it and i can't wait till it happens somebody say praise the lord that's what sarah should have been saying lord thank you and i can't wait to that final visit in a year from now praise the lord god doesn't visit us just to spend time with us he has something he wants to deposit he's something he wants to fulfill his promise something he wants to trigger that life within you let's not ever minimize coming to the house of god let's make it a priority to come to the house of god can you say man we're living in trouble sometimes and some things we have to navigate through because of the covet but don't you dare let the covet or anything deteriorate what a priority is sometimes we have to miss because of it but don't let it read into that this is not important once you're healthy this is important to come never minimize coming to church this is not just a casual social gathering to see your friends god is present and god wants to deposit his word in our hearts we should make our visits with him count that's what abraham's doing he's making this visit count he's inviting him in not like the pharisee who brother ronald spencer said the pharisee invited him but it was for ulterior motives some people invite christ and run up to christ and they have all different agendas why they want god's blessing but they don't want to give a commitment to him amen they might want to they enjoy being the presence of god because it just makes them feel better this gives them a good feeling but there's no commitment there's no heart hearts are all locked up so in this visit with abraham and sarah there's two things i will visit you sarah and i will visit sodom i'm going to visit sarah i'm visiting you now and then he he says i'm going to visit sarah according to the time life and i'm going to visit sodom and gomorrah which is truly happening and there was a moment in that conversation that he dismissed the other two men two angels as we know them the other two men and those other two men started to walk towards sodom he dismissed them and they were starting going to investigate sodom and gomorrah but the bible says abraham stood before the lord that's good that's a good thing to look at during these times to fix your gaze upon the countenance of the lord that's abraham's position if you're dabbling in the ways of sodom or the spirits of lust in sodom so i'm not doing that you're not what are you looking at at your phone say well i'm not a homosexual the spirit of sodom is a filthy sexual spirit whether it's homosexual or not it's perverted sexual spirit with women's flesh everywhere with men everywhere with with dirty jokes everywhere with dirty movies everywhere i'm talking to you now it's real and i can't make that choice for you you have to make that choice to realize do i want to be investigated do i want investigating angels coming and looking at my health i want to tell you you can't hide it is that the position you ought to be is living in sodom remember saud lot did not move right to sodom his first move was to pitch his tent towards sodom there are a lot of families that are not homosexuals and not living there some have got so far away from god they have turned to lesbianism because if you keep going with that spirit of filth it'll take it it's only going in one direction but a lot of families are not in sodom they've just pitched their tent towards it that's what lot did he didn't even know he ended up down there but he ended up the mayor of the city i don't know how many years it took but he didn't just move and say we're moving to sodom he didn't say that he was too religious for that he just his wife influenced them she's seen some of the carts come by through the years of the new makeup and all the new clothes and what they were wearing in sodom and they were selling stuff and lot's wife got attracted to the fashions she wanted to be in sodom and she kept influencing lot oh i pray so i hope you're listening sometimes our wives can be used of god to speak to us and sometimes they're influenced by other things sometimes you men can be influenced by other things and it affects your choices he listened to his wife said let's pitch our tent towards sodom i want to be there and she finally got him down there he was the head and she was the neck that was turning the head a jezebel she had that in her heart and she wanted it and they ended up down there he was the mayor of the city and he is still righteous because the bible says it vexed his righteous soul daily we have a lot of godly people living close to sodom and it's vexing the righteous soul but i'm talking about you this morning do you want to be dabbling in the things of sodom and that's where you position yourself or do you want to be where abraham was fixed standing before the lord and as long as he stood there abraham stood the bible said this he stood before the lord i want to be right there you this morning that are dabbling in the things of sodom i believe the lord's calling you to get in the presence of the lord and stand and look into the gaze of jesus christ and be transformed and changed by just looking at him can you say amen if you're dabbling in the fellowship with sodomites and you're around that type of spirit all the time you need a visit from god that will cause you to stand before him i want you to watch something as we take a look a couple scriptures first and then i want to read an article to you let's focus our attention now on these this investigation to sodom everybody's still with me let's look at the investigation to sodom now right here in the bible but turn with me if you would to luke 21 because i want you to see the scriptures first luke 21 and verse 8 through 11. says here jesus prophesying and he said take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and the time draws near go ye not therefore after them but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is not by and by then said he unto them nations shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and great earthquakes shall be in many places diverse places and famines and pestilences i'll stop right there pestilence is a a tragic or uh i'm looking for the word a pandemic that is fatal a fatal pandemic jesus said there'd be pestilences and he didn't say one he said there'd be many that's right we're not done oh i know all of us want to be done but we're not done the new strains the new ones that would come out jesus said there will be fatal pandemics fatal almost 600 000 people in our nation that's pretty bad that's a lot of lies pestilences and then he says fearful sights and great signs shall there be in the heaven hold that thought fearful sights in the heaven in other words it's making everybody fearful because they don't know what it is fearful sight shall be in the heaven and when the prophet refers to this about 40 times since 1954 all the way through the prophet refers to these things these lights appearing we call them ufos or we call them spaceships or whatever no one knows what these ufos are they still haven't known and actually the pentagon continues to for for 40 50 60 years have hid all their reports and hid everything because they they have no explanation for it and they're coming up i'm going to read you in june they're going to finally issue an article in june from the pentagon that finally after this many years they're going to admit these things are real they would never admit that they don't know what they are but they're admitting this is a reality and we don't know what it is that sounds real familiar with our government and our science they don't even know what coven really is i know some people don't like that but i'm here to tell you there's no absolute to anybody knowing what this thing is or what it's doing we know what it's done but don't put your trust in men who think they've got it figured out this is a stealth enemy can you say amen this is an invisible army that has come and it's demons to me can you say man so just like these ufos just like all of science don't you dare put your trust and make there is no absolute to this thing i have to be careful boy i make some people upset investigating angels investigating judge this is what brother branham called these things now i don't want to have a whole service on ufos or you're going to think that i'm going wacko i'm just saying what the prophet said that there will be lights and investigating angels just before judgment come on the scene and he pointed for since 1954 is he said you see those lights around the pentagon incidentally they're always showing up around the pentagon and around the uh around our our army facilities around the uh the um oh the uh i can't think of it right now just uh give me about a couple days and i'll think of it dave especially what is that a nuclear plant they have sightings around the nuclear places around nuclear things sites around our army ships these are a lot of science and i can't really explain that myself i just know that he called him investigating angels and then here hold hold in fearful sights this is the scripture brother ben pointed to fearful sights and signs shall be in the heaven now turn with me to revelations eight under the sixth seal in revelations eight how many wants to learn something here then the prophet points to the sixth seal in revelations chapter eight and while he excuse me while he's preaching the sixth seal he refers to revelations 8 and he says here verse 12 revelation 8 verse 12 and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten in the third part of the moon third part of the star so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night likewise verse 13 is what i want to get to and i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven now this is the scripture brother of adam refers to in the sixth seal there's an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice whoa whoa whoa that's where we get the three woes okay to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound so here we're at the end of the fourth trumpet and this angel flying is saying and and to me he's observing who the inhabitants of the earth they're looking at all the inhabitants the people the sinful condition can you say about it and screams whoa whoa whoa and that means there's three more trumpets to come now i don't have time to read the last verse chapter nine the last three trumpets but when you read the last three trumpets you're gonna find such uh tribulation diseases and all these things coming and that's where you get the shapes of locusts uh and just um just terrible hideous and hair as the hair of a woman and their teeth as teeth of lions all these hideous things during tribulation start to come out it's all in the last three trumpets there and that's why he's predicting this angel's predicting saying whoa whoa whoa three woes three more trumpets these will be worse judgment is coming if he to come to the inhabitants of the earth flying around and observed the inhabitants of the earth and didn't see it has been reported to sin then he would have backed off but when he seen it all investigated all of it he says this is over whoa whoa whoa to you inhabitants judgment is just around the corner and it's god visiting investigating before judgment i tell you i sometimes i see a little bit of the mercy of god in that because you think well god knows everything and he knows all things but he actually going to visit with his angels and investigate just to make sure it's it's got as bad as it's really gotten because maybe if it's not as bad maybe there's hope for this nation maybe there's hope for this world and he investigates and says there's no hope for this earth whoa whoa whoa i know you think of woe is a different thing but it has a much deeper meaning just like visit does woe has a much deeper meaning and i got it written up here i'll come back up here and read it to you if you study the word woe and the three woes there's two sides of that word as well one is when jesus says same same greek word alas alas babylon or capernaum and he uses the term alas alas that's like woe but it's what it is as god said alas capernaum how i would have hovered you how i would have taken you and saved you but you're under judgments alas alas and it means that god is sorrowful last last means it's a sorrowful grief from god but there's another woe that's in the book of revelations that's not alas alas but it actually uses the word woe but its greek meaning is extreme severe afflictions that are coming and a denunciation of god completely when that angel investigates when these angels investigate and they come to this conclusion which i believe they already have it's not just whoa this is a bad situation that's what we say whoa this is no these wolves mean god is denouncing the whole thing i think brother rap said it a few weeks ago or some minister god's spirit it's proven right now god's spirit is lifting from the earth and when god's spirit is lifting from the earth hell is surfacing because there's no holy ghost to hold it back so hell is spilling over and it's becoming so bad till those angels said god will denounce the whole thing and there's nothing but just affliction and torture and judgment that's just around the corner sobering i pray that it is because i don't know the day or the hour i just know the conditions and the spirits that i feel every day i know that we're very close there's no hope for this nation you won't hear too many preachers saying that either there's no hope for this world she's set for a third a third birth pain first world war first birth pain second world war second birth pain read it in the message birth pains but she won't survive a third birth pain she'll give birth to a new world and a millennium this earth is going to be purged by the holy fires of god woe has a strong meaning to the inhabitants of the earth why they're watching they're visiting if you guys would pull those quotes up they are visiting to see the condition of sin since the revealing of the son of man the first and second poll these sightings have taken place and i i looked this up you can bring that quote up brother branham i looked this i was saying when was the first sightings well they've had a lot of them written down through the years but the official sightings that were recorded and put down for our nation was in seattle i believe and it was the year 1947. so just between you and i that's when the son of man ministry or the ministry began in its initial stages of a visitation from god son of man now reports reports the pentagon puts under it and brother ram says it this way in the quotes if you guys have it we're in a dangerous time remember the scripture says when these things begin to happen time is no more she's fading away when we see the manifestation earthquakes you see them a thousand killed the other day earthquakes in divers places said fearful sights in the skies pillars of fire like floating around like flying saucers they don't know what it is see they don't have any idea did you notice the angels that come down investigated sodom before sodom was destroyed you remember that congregation says amen there was a bunch of them down come down three of them one of them stayed with abraham you remember that yeah amen they were lights from heaven that came down in the investigating judgment look where they're all found around the pentagon and things they find them that's the world judgment sodom and there is one represented will be represented among the churches will be christ himself vindicating himself you glad you're around that group aren't you a grand you're around christ son of man revealing himself sights in the heavens above and signs on the earth below certainly and then in the next one i wanted you to see this in the sixth seal and a crisis so close like real christianity to the bride said it will fool everyone that wasn't predestinated that's right the bible said that he's given end time things now the spirit would be so close it deceived the very elect apostle all everything jesus said here about the end time the bible said that in the last days everything that wasn't predestinated the elect it says the elect now no anybody take that word and run it back in your margin you see what it means it says the elected predestinated see it'll fool every one of them whose names were not on the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world and take the mark of the beast when the lamb was slain the names were put on the book he is standing in the holy place tonight in glory i want everybody to notice 1963 at the sixth seal he is standing in the holy place tonight in glory as an intercessor making intercessions for every one of those souls whose name is on that book i want to say praise the lord i don't know what anybody else preaches but this is the sixth seal and i thank god that he's saying as an intercessor he's in that holy place making intercessions still somebody says that's over you better be careful can you say mine i don't know when it's over nobody knows when it's over but in the sixth seal he's saying he's making intercessions for every one of those souls whose names are on that book and anybody knows that name but him he is the one that's got the book in his hand and he knows and when that last one comes in then his intercessing days is over he comes forth then to claim what he's interceded for he is doing the kinsmen redeemer work now and comes forth to receive his own oh my listen to this now that ought to set every christian to searching himself and holding his hands before god and saying cleanse me oh lord. notice he didn't say unbelievers he said christians even though that we say i believe i'm an elect i've been protesting in this time we need to raise our hands and say god cleanse me look into my life let me see where my bad part is let me get it out of the way real quick lord every teenager every young person every child every older person you ought to be know the hour i'm preaching to you this morning these are investigating angels we're almost at the end of this thing it should jolt our hearts and say god i need to invite you into my heart if you don't have the holy ghost and you keep putting it off say lord i need you i'm not only going to get to heaven because my parents go to this church i need to invite you and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ because the time is short i'm not hanging you over hell i'm trying to show you the time is short children listen to what brother paul is preaching to you we have fun we have youth meetings we do all kinds of things we love you we love your personalities we do everything for you but this is the core of what brother paul preaches is that we're in the last days we're in the last seconds of time ufos are showing everywhere investigating angels saying this thing is just about done you won't come out of tribulation and escape it without inviting this christ completely in your heart you won't get on the sh the coattail of your mom and dad or your pastor see i'll just grab a hold of daddy's coattail and i'll make it into the rapture no you won't you'll stand alone before this lord say god here i am cleanse me let me finish the quote for if the righteous me scarcely say where will the sinners and the ungodly appear it's a checking up time and if you would place it and want to and give this word i don't want to to ask me a question on this because it get might be plumb over on another i mean in writing your questions i think the question is done in anyhow this is the time of the investigation judgment if you want to know what time it is this is the time of investigating judgment we're not in the judgment yet but it's investigating judgment that's right now we'll get to that on the trumpets when we come to that whenever the lord provides on the vials you've got the seven vials the seven blast plagues the seven trumpets which are mostly the israel and world events and we'll find that out we've got the three wolves investigating when just before the woes went forth and we see that this is true and the three angels that struck the earth crying you know whoa whoa whoa unto the inhabitants of the earth and we're living in a terrific time everybody understand trying to make it just as crystal clear he's pointing in the sixth hill saying we're living in investigating angel's time it's a time where they say whoa and that means it's just around the corner it's over i read this article yesterday the u.s government is actually gearing up to share information about the reality of ufos with the public and not a moment too soon says the man who claims to have run the pentagon's ufo program for nine years former president trump his 2.3 trillion appropriation bill for 2021 contained a mandate that the pentagon and spy agencies must file a report about unidentified aerial phenomena uap most of us just call them flying saucers or ufos whatever the jargon the whistleblower louis alzando former head of the advanced airspace threat identification program which operated out of this a secretive fifth floor of the pentagon sea ring told the post that the resulting blockbuster document which is reported slated to release this june tied to the mandate al zando said the upcoming report touches down on the unexplainable long time uf believers are hungry for explanations of the tic tac shaped objects the navy encountered in 2004 the strange cubes with spheres seen by navy pilots in 2014 or the mysterious black triangles continually reported around the world details promised to come via the much anticipated report and at least one evolution of belief i think he says this i think the government has acknowledged the reality of uap el zondo exclusively told the post despite signing what he refers to as a lifelong nda before he resigned from the pentagon i think they all want answers and i think they are all willing to ask the hard questions during a press conference this week el zondo made clear that the ufos have been observed to have qualities that are nothing less than other worldly thank god we already knew that they're concluding now that these are nothing less but other worldly can't be from our world he described vessels flying at 11 000 miles per hour and being able to turn instantly providing a comparison he explained for our most advanced jets going at the same speed if you wanted to make a right-hand turn it would take you about a half the state of ohio to make a right-hand turn he also detailed spielberg worthy operational capabilities that fall into the realm of trans-medium travel zondo explained that the eye-popping vessels can fly 50 feet above the earth's surface or 80 000 feet in the sky and even submerge underwater without a compromise in performance when you see that he says you recognize you're dealing with a technology way more advanced than ours we are nowhere near that our prophet already told us that we've been traveling at the speed of light for thousands of years at least angels have can you say man elijah was particularly disturbed by the locations where ufos and uaps tended to hover even the way in which these in explainable flying machines managed to lift off blows away rational engineering these things have no wings no cockpits no control surfaces no rivets in the skin no obvious signs of propulsion and somehow they are able to defy the natural effects of earth's gravity i know another group of people that's getting ready to divide earth's gravity i'm a part of that kingdom i'm a part of the kingdom that gravity's going to lose its hold someday brother josiah i'm a part of that kingdom this world keeps us earthbound but i got a holy ghost that's going to lift me up someday can you give me five more minutes here 10 minutes how is it possible elsando said how's that possible and by 2019 the pentagon had confirmed to the post for the first time now remember these their things are just coming out they've never admitted anything they've never admitted their reality they just make them a mystery but now they start putting in they gave this to the uh the post for the first time to put as an article that they researched and investigate ufos and continue to do so in other words they've just admitted that they're continuing their research all these years on this they've just admitted that they kept it quiet meanwhile ufo sightings in new york city were up 31 in 2020 46 compared to 35 in the previous year marking a whopping 283 spike from 2018. did anybody hear that percentage does that speak anything to anybody but that there is a 283 percent spike in investigating angels since 2018. does that say anything about the time that we're living in that if there's an increase in the visitation of investigating angels we're getting closer and closer can you say amen and i only say to that i pray there's an increase in visitations from god for me can you say man i pray there's a 283 percent increase since 2018 in visitations from god to you because we're close sodom is receiving these things and i'm saying this only by a prophet's word that speaks it so it's to happen i'm not going to get into the details which things they see as which or whatever i'm just saying he pointed us to say those lights whatever shame or for a shape they see there's a couple pictures of the shapes here some of these these days are pyramid shapes whatever they see i'm only pointing to what a prophet said that there will be lights and angels and investigating angels at the end time that's investigating sodom before the judgment day comes can you say amen there's 283 increase in investigation angels in the three years more sightings last year another new pandemic increasing of more and more can you say man in other words as those things increase we know if jesus said that pestilences plural will come if there's a 283 percent increase in this i wonder if there will be an increase in pestilences as well the thing is wrapping up i wonder if we could pray and say god let your visits to me increase can i get an amen let your visit if it's increasing for sodom let you come and visit elohim to me i want to be with him i want to be in his place i want to be where he is as gideon sings lord i want to be where you are in this room where jesus is can you say amen and he ha if he has these flying things investigate in sodom listen i'll let you know you can't hide anything if that's true that you can't if that's true and they're investigating you can't hide anything from him there's no sin that's secret there's nothing hidden to him that's what makes them so nervous is these things coming up and the way they move you guys can finish the i think they had a video did that one work too all right so just the pictures but you you see then that you you have to look at is that if there's these sightings are increasing then we realize that investigating judgment has taken place to wrap this thing up can you say amen but he knows what we're doing why not open up your heart and stand right in the lord's face this morning in his countenance instead of thinking that you're hiding things from sodom or from these angels i go home and i i don't know what people are looking at on my phone nobody else knows but but just me if this is true that's why they're so nervous because they realize this is this may be an enemy because they trump puts it under they these things are so serious trump gave all this money how much does it sums me a million or he calls it billions billions i love how trump says billions it's always billions to him it's all this money you know what he did because this is isn't going away and it's increasing and he's supposed to protect the country he says you've got to find out what this is in case this is other countries coming in stealth and we're not our country isn't protected how arrogant how proud is that i appreciate somebody trying to protect but they don't have an answer for these type of vessels or whatever they call them i believe we do this morning and that means they don't know what they can see i can tell them they can see everything there is no secrets they don't have anything whether that classified not with the angels of the lord and you don't have anything classified that you're hiding that's a secret from the lord it's time to live open and honest before the lord's face time to get your heart right with god time to look into his face and be changed by it that visit with him as the investigating angels got in sodom and i'm closing now two things because now i'll take our attention off of sodom and the investigating angels he's visiting in angels before judgment now but let's go back to abraham because that's what that's what we're concerned about there's two things that's happening there i've preached on some of these things before but it bears repeating and it's something we should know number one he's standing before the lord's face and he stood in his place before the lord as long as he stand there then the scripture says that he got up and he begins to walk towards sodom because he was going to go too and while he got up and walked what did abraham do he got up and started to walk with christ and begin to plead for any righteous that were in sodom he said lord if there's 50 would you spare it and i pointed it out before to you all lot's only hope was abraham praying and crying for mercy for him lot's family in sodom huh i won't ask for raising hands you got you got family members in sodom right now i mean we got piano players that were here that's living the life of sodom and gomorrah i'll just say it my wife and i pray for them we pray for their deliverance but they're living right in the middle of sodom got girls that have gone into lesbianism caught in that spirit ministers children i know some people in the message would just say well they've crossed the line they're done and i always try to point out that's not what your father abraham was saying why are you positioning yourself as a judge to put them finished didn't brother ron spencer preach it here you can't do that with anybody you cannot write anybody off no matter how low a person has gone there's still possibility for god to reach them out of the my reclaim your children that are unsaved whatever it is there's nothing impossible with god so if you don't get anything else this morning i would ask you to to grab these two things of position of abraham he's beholding in the face of the lord and he stands there that's what he's looking at but when he begins to move jesus moves with him in a heart and prayer for the souls in sodom nobody else is praying for that god let me just say it the way jesus said it was said about jesus one scripture in matthew i think it says jesus was moved with compassion for the lost the tendency in our generation is hard hearts writing somebody off somebody did me wrong that's it they're done that's the tendency of the world didn't jesus said many will betray one another in and the love of many will wax cold we've got to fight against that not only with our love for the lord we don't want a cold love towards the lord or lukewarm we don't want to draw cold but cold for our love for one another and for the lost and for someone who's done us wrong and for a customer or a boss or a dad or a grandpa or whatever it is we are the ones that can't get so cold-hearted that we don't even have a feeling to pray for the mercies of god to save them let's be like our father abraham let's be who we are the children of abraham and say lord as long as there's breath in my body and as long as i can read brother brad i'm saying the intercessor is still there make an intercession till every last elected seed comes in and then he leaves the mercy seat i'm correcting some doctrine here because people get technical say okay there's no mercy out there and there's no mercy to cert listen there's no mercy without blood and if a denomination doesn't have the real blood of jesus christ there's no mercy but whatever if the blood is still on the mercy which it is there's still hope for anybody there's still hope for anybody and we're going to continue to preach it that way because one of the reasons we know it's still there is because we're still here and the last elected seat hasn't coming in might be your kid sister laura it might be your daughter or son that's a wayward might be an uncle might be an ant can you say amen i'm still believing for my dad's family members that the blood of jesus christ will change them be filled with the holy ghost can you say amen and many times there's no others praying for that they don't want to we don't want them to be caught in this tribulation and judgment we want them saved and sanctified filled with the spirit of god our children my children your children those that have left us those that went astray though who's left a message don't try to get all bogged down and just pray abraham said if there's 50 lord would you spare it if there's 30 when you spare it and he said he would and if there's 10 i think it got down to 10 or 5 if there's just a few righteous lord would you spare it and god and the elohim listen to abraham and because his prayer and cry was heard by our lord look at that faith that he had look at what the lord said if there's that many i'll spare it there wasn't even ten but because of abraham's crying out for mercy god spared lot in his family that's our position brother ed we stand in a very important position for our loved ones there's no no hope without us so let's not get caught up in possessions let's not caught up in more money can you say man let's not get caught up in this building i told our staff and our our leaders i told some of them listen we've had to be so obsessed with getting this this way it's time to put our focus off of this building and put it back on what really matters this will be gone someday let's have ones crying out for souls that have been lost let's cry for those that have left the message lord bring them back and put them on these pews listening to the word of god will you join with me saints will the young people join with me say god give me a heart to cry for the lost give me a compassion break my heart if it's stony lord let me find within that inner fellowship with god and looking at his face let me find that real soberness to say i know the hour that i'm living i know how late it is now i'm going to hold on to my faith for those that are lost can we stand and pray sobering thoughtful things to to ponder this morning not at all meant to scare anybody because i know if i preach these investigating angels and i see how close we are to the ending date i can tell you i'm not afraid at all i'm burdened and concerned for the loss but i am not afraid of this world ending because there's another verse there that says and sarah got a visit from the lord and just like the lord said he came back and visited her again there's a final visit here friends there's a final move of god to change these bodies and there'll be a rapture spower heads grace grace god's grace grace that will pardon and cleanse grace grace unmerited favor god's grace that is greater than all you think about the sodom commission condition but there's something greater than all the sin grace grace grace sing it with me god of grace grace that will pardon and cleanse within [Music] grace grace god's grace raise that greater than all our sins lord lay some soul upon my heart and love that soul through me [Music] and may i ever do my part [Music] can we sing this together make it our prayer lord lay some soul upon my heart and love through me and maybe [Music] [Music] should you bow your heads now if anyone like to come and turn their lives over to jesus christ you come and pray this morning you want to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ be filled with the holy spirit i want to make that invitation to you as a gospel minister today jesus hands out his hand to you he says come and follow me i want to make that invitation if he's making it in your heart then receive him this morning with all of your heart say lord i trust you because when this world is gone someday heavens and earth will pass away but the only thing will be left is the word of god god bless you like you raise your hand maybe you don't want to come forward you say i want to this sunday this service i want to turn my life completely over to jesus christ hallelujah god bless you i'll pray for you i want to turn my life over as i see investigating angels approaching around us an increase of them it's coming closer and closer i want to be right with god i want to walk with him be baptized in jesus name to be filled with the spirit my lamps trimmed and burning for him father if that heart is speaking to you just now it doesn't take an altar here it takes an altar in their heart would you just move on them lord would you fill them with your spirit lord would you just guide them lord and take your gentle hand and guide them to a closer walk with you lord maybe someday lord we realize in a service like this we'll look back and realize maybe that's where the last one came in maybe it was just in our congregation and they finally turned their lives over to jesus christ and lord that would bring on this rapture if it is lord may they come fully to you without hesitation may they be completely washed by the blood of the lamb may every desire of the world be killed inside and may they seek to serve you with all their heart providing jesus christ to be the lord of their lives we thank you father thank you for posting us of how close that we really are make us like that abraham lord of old standing before your face and pleading for the righteous that are still laying there in sodom bring them out lord some of them lord may be a judas i don't know the lord many of them had just been caught in a spirit [Music] i raised my hand lord ask for you to give mercy to those who have left your truth lord and there's probably 50 60 70 maybe more people over the years lord have gone astray trying to find their way lord through some other means but you love them lord something happened to them lord and they took a different guidance a different spirit of influence but i'm praying that you'll break the cycle and that spirit that would be leading them the wrong way have mercy on them lord have mercy on my family members have mercy on those who have gone astray god may you visit them give them a visitation lord and somehow may they invite you as abraham did into their place god made they did everything be broken down and they lay before you say god i have nothing without you may they come back to you fill these chairs you've given us lord fill them back up with those who be restored restored in the name of jesus christ we believe in restoration we believe in salvation we believe that you're able to do it nothing is impossible with you lord we plead for them move us with compassion lord move us with compassion the insensitivity the in feeling sometimes that we get in this coldness of this world burn it from us lord and make us soft caring loving sweet kind lord bringing the love of jesus to every life in jesus name we ask these things lay your hands on somebody there next to you pray for them lord i pray for my brother and sister i pray for my husband my wife the family members lord lay some soul in our hearts lord maybe it's the one next to us we pray you encourage them lord fill us with the holy ghost lord let our lamps be trimmed and glowing we realize father we're close so we just pray and encourage one another father i pray that everyone who see the light of their own position in jesus christ lord they become so confident in it lord and so bold and lord such a man or woman of faith build up your church lord in the most holy faith god may we take these meetings that you've given us special time lord may we just build off of that lord and have the theme here that you are the most important one among us and when you show up you make it worthwhile lord grant it father we pray because we believe that you visit us here today your visitations if you come lord will never be the same again thank you father in jesus name amen for the nations are breaking israel's awakening the signs of the prophet foretold oh my think about it gentile day's number encumbered
