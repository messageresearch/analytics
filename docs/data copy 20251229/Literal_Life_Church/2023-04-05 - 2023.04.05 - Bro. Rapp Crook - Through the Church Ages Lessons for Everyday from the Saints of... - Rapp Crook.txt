========================================

perhaps while we were standing we can just turn on our Bibles to the Book of John chapter 12. um and then we'll turn over to the Book of Revelation um starting with the thyatirin church age I'm glad we all were able to make it in the this evening there was a lots of uh lots of wind down where we were some horizontal rain blowing this afternoon but uh we we made it the fire Tyrant Church ages is the longest age and also known as the Dark Ages and I was I was coming up uh today I got to thinking about perhaps uh um starting with this scripture from The Book of John let me just get my display settings correct here we are and there we are so here we go yes and look at the title will be lessons for every day from the Saints of thyatira none of us are in uh Dark Ages that stretch 900 years long but sometimes it feels like we're going through some Dark Ages so we're going to take a look at their experience and then see what God spoke to them and see if he can speak it to our hearts this evening as well but John 12 24 says verily verily and Jesus is speaking I say unto you except a corn of wheat Fallen to the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit and I believe Jesus is speaking of his own life there as he lays his life down that's the only way for him to bring forth much fruit and as it is with the uh the the the male the groom so it is with his bride in the in the church ages the church actually ends up dying it seems like here in the Dark Ages but that's POS that makes possible then a resurrection of a new life that's what we begin to see here through this dietary nature let's pray Heavenly Father we just ask your blessing upon our service this evening Lord I pray father as we look at this uh Messiah tiring age and look at the the conditions it was in and the messenger you sent to deal with the problems that were there Lord I just pray Lord you would also help us to um to take what what you spoke to them and take it to ourselves or we might also draw encouragement to God in Jesus name amen you may be seated let's see here so uh maybe we can turn over the Book of Revelation Chapter 2 since this is the first service on the uh thyatiron age we'll we'll read what Jesus spoke unto them Revelation chapter 2 verse 18. and under the church unto the angel of the church and thyativa right these things set the Son of God who hath his eyes likened to a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass so he's speaking with characteristics of a judge verse 19 I Know Thy Works in charity and service and faith and by patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first and this is definitely a working laboring church I mean he's all these words Works charity service Faith patience Works they're synonyms for one another almost and this is there are six of them there and it just seems like this this church is is is is laboring verse 20 notwithstanding I have a few things against you because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and perhaps next time we'll take a look at the Old Testament type that's being referenced here at Jezebel and how the Catholic Church fulfills that verse 21 I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not and the whole Caster into a bed and then that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death and brother Branham speaks this is going to be with a spiritual death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works but unto you I say unto the rest and fire attire as many as if not as have not this Doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden but that which ye have already hold fast to like come and Heath over cometh and keepeth my Works into the end to him will I give power over the Nations he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of Potter shall they be broken to Shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the Morning Star he that half an ear let them hear what the spirit saith under the churches a long message to this dietary age I think it's the longest of all the church ages and it's the longest age if you open to the beginning of your church age book whether Brandon has this uh this diagram of the uh of the Candlestick Illustrated in the thyatyrian age is uh from 606 to 1520. that's a a really long time a really long time and um you can see the the the little the moons with with light and darkness that's showing how much the proportion of light and darkness is given in each age in Ephesus this is when Paul is the early first apostles were just ministering and there's lots of light and the Antichrist is just beginning to ride but that darkness is ever increasing it increases deadly throughout that Smyrna and then I'm progress in the thigh attire the darkness is just peaking it just seems like the Satan is is finally winning his battle against the truth and this is just a little bit of light there um and it goes on for a very long time then in Sardis um also very dark as Luther just Begins the Reformation and this and this um bringing back to life the the this resurrection of this seed that's gone to the ground to die and then there's the missionary agent Philadelphia under the Western revivals there's an increase of light and then finally in laodicea um not a whole lot of light especially as the age ends at just going into that total darkness now one of the things I'd like to speak about this evening and I'll uh um this might seem a little bit like a history lesson starting out but um I convert some years back as I was reading um and reading different things I came across this uh this this question that somebody was actually a criticism that they pointed out that um yeah if you look at the thyatarian age whether Brandon says it starts at the age at the year 606. but if you look at the messenger that he points out it's it's Columba and he dies in 597. and the question was brother Branham he's dead in 597. the church age starts in 606 I mean don't you can't you see this at this in the the impression you get hearing at the first one was like man what's the church age book worth just throw out the window because this is this is impossible and I I didn't have a a good answer for that so I just kind of laid it around him but as I was studying for for this service um the Lord brought some answers to me I want to and I want to share that so this is a part of this is a question that I had for a long time and notice when you have a question um uh it doesn't mean you have to throw everything away seek the Lord about it and he'll provide the answer in his time and I just pray that the Lord will this this answer um this evening because I I thought there was a it was it was a fair question uh how do you uh how do you answer that um first I'd like to just kind of emphasize this these dark ages 900 years long you'd have to be a pretty extraordinary person to have to be able to influence a time period that goes 900 years I mean we just kind of go back in time we think George Washington what a great influence he's had but that's 1700s and we're not even 300 years since George Washington and you can talk about the pilgrim fathers William Bradford what influence he said but that's just 400 years if you think back to Christopher Columbus and sailed the ocean blue in 1492 I mean that's 500 not even 600 years we had to go for 900 years we're going all the way back in time 1100 like the very first Crusades who from the year 1100 could we say would be still be having a great impact on us today I mean it's this is a huge time period so with this huge time period I think we need to think carefully about yeah who could what's the who would best be able to have an impact that goes that that long that's the first thing one of the kind of emphasize about this and it's an extremely extra extraordinary person be able to influence an entire Millennium practically and the second thing and this is kind of almost simplistic but is it possible for a man's influence to extend past his lifetime it is it is so I mean that's that's the easiest way to answer this this question a man's influence can easily extend past his lifetime and in the case of colomba that's certainly the uh that that certainly so um I want to take us back in time for um a few minutes and um in it was a tumultuous time when uh the couple hundred years before Columbus even born in the uh 400s um four in the year 410 uh this this time of peace that that the Roman Empire had enjoyed and the world around the Mediterranean had enjoyed for a very long time thanks to Rome that was Rome was collapsing and this time of Peace was also collapsing um in the year 410 all these Germanic tribes the the the Goths the visit Goths all these the Romans called them The Barbarians they're masked along one I forget the name of the river with their master I think it was along the um I don't I can't remember the name of the river but they're masked along the Rhine and all these all these goth soldiers I mean they're they're stripped naked and they're just doing all their their their their their pre-battle routines yelling and everything and they're going and the Roman soldiers are on the other side of the river and they're in their beautiful uniform and and their arm everything and they're ready and this is this two worlds two very different worlds and there were this Primal scream and these all these Goths just rush across and there's wave upon wave upon the wave and finally they breached the Roman lines and the Goths just eventually make it all the way to Rome and um I think it was that Alaric was his uh his his name he uh he makes it to Rome and he uh um the leader of the Roman city comes out and they have a have a parlay and um what would you like to have in the lyric basically says you can have your lives but I'm taking everything else in the city and they do and these barbarians they have a um that's what the Romans called I mean they were completely illiterate all the learning that had been compiled in Rome all the Greek learning all from every kind of time period if it had been written it was in Roman libraries for barbarians all right libraries are good for one thing it's great firewood I mean all these books just going up though they'll go through the libraries if they've got this beautiful jeweled books they'll rip the cover off of the and they'll save the jewels and they'll just they just Burn It Off all of them nothing's online nothing scanned no there are no backup copies I mean so much is just lost and I mean this goes all across Western Europe all these these these Scrolls I mean everything that the this is the the wisdom the learning of of centuries is gone and um if it hadn't been for a group of uh I mean there's one place there's different places the Roman Empire hadn't gotten to yet and they'd made it across the English Channel they admit they settled they made some settlements into Britain uh they got Hadrian's Wall they're a different place where you can see Roman settlements but they hadn't made it to Ireland Ireland was a little island just off the coast of of Britain they hadn't made it there and what you have is all these um on different um monks different places who were able to escape from The Barbarians they're trying to get West as fast as they can and they make it to Ireland and they have whatever books they can so as the rest of the continent is just sliding into Dark Ages where basically the Continental Europe is going illiterate they're they're losing literacy as that's happening on the continent Ireland is just beginning to discover books and Patrick the Romans call them the Saint Patrick and his brother Brandon mentions him in the church age book um he was at the mother Brown talks about he was the nephew of Saint Martin's wife I believe it was but he is uh he and his uh friend are are playing along the river Clyde in in England and some Irish um Bandits come on their little little coracle boats they come along and they kidnap Patrick and they and they take him to Ireland Patrick doesn't know the language but he stays there for a certain number of years and he's able to figure out a way to make it back to his homeland he does and when he goes back the home that he finds completely different because in that time period barbarians had gone through burned everything it's just like this is a this is this is a a world that has been passed is able to he's able to find some place where he can do some some Priestly studies and then he goes back to Ireland as he comes back he's he he begins teaching literacy and starting some monasteries and they begin copying work lots and lots of copying and uh um I think Patrick dies 40 or 50 years before uh um Columba is born but Columba he um he he is he he he's from a royal uh one one of the clans in Ireland he's he's born into a one of the royal families he could have had a uh um a very good political career but he also becomes a uh a monk a priest um and he starts studying and he begins uh um copying and learning the manuscripts and that's he decides then through a uh if you read different books you get different stories but he leaves Ireland and he goes to this uh Island uh just off the coast of Scotland um far enough from Ireland that you can't see Ireland he's here and he establishes an Abbey on Iona he takes 12 men with them and they build um and Abby there and different structures and they just start studying and copying and learning and preaching and um and then from column from from Columbus work they just start settling they start making monasteries throughout Northern Scotland all the way through Scotland and then down into England and gradually these um this work that Columbus starts spreads all the way and back into Europe into the continent all the way into Eastern Europe as far south as Italy and you can see in the Scribe in in these in these um manuscripts that get copied in these Irish monasteries throughout Europe they use the same kind of calligraphy and this is this is work from the Irish scribes if the Irish scribes hadn't been doing this we wouldn't have a lot of the learning from Western Civilization would have been gone most of our translations of the Bible of the old New Testaments they might have existed still in Byzantium and East in the Eastern Orthodox church but they would have been lost to the West this is his influence is profound because he start he he he starts this Mission this Irish missionary effort going through Northern Scotland through the through the picked people and then down into England and then across the channel re I mean basically bringing the gospel back to where it had originally been and he's re-establishing it laying the groundwork for a Reformation that was going to begin several hundred years after his lifetime because in order for there to be a Reformation you have to have the manuscripts and he it was the Irish monks who were the ones who were copying those manuscripts Faithfully Faithfully faithfully and then spreading them and taking them further taking them further taking them further so colomba might have died nine years before his church age started but this missionary impulse that he is so much behind that just goes on and takes on a life of its own it's evangelizing all of England and where is the center of the Reformation go off I mean we talked about Luther but John Wycliffe in the year 1300 he's still that's still in the thigh attire and age he starts translating the Bible and would that have been possible if there weren't manuscripts formed a translate off of and then wycliffe's work um he Wycliffe is teaching at Oxford and while he's teaching Oxford and there are um there are students of John Huss who's from uh um Eastern Eastern Europe um students are there and they take wycliffe's ideas back to Huss and Huss is Huss dies about a hundred years before Luther's 95 Theses and this and this Huss is burning at the stake um he's uh present enough to be able to make a pod you might be able to burn this Goose because his last name means Goose but there is going to come a swan that you won't be able to burn and Luther's coat of arms was out of a swan and so this this is just beautifully orchestrated how how could the Reformation have started without manuscripts to work from and Columbus got this this this this this missionary effort Drive transcribing the word that that lays all the seeds out there for it to take place later so thyatyrus messenger um extends far past his lifetime and in order to have an impact over a thousand years you'd have to have something that would just continue to go and go and go um in order to um that would take it on its own life powered by the Holy Spirit I just want to share with you um a couple quotations from a book I read the last couple weeks How the Irish saved civilization and the author does mean this to be kind of ironic because the Irish over time if usually been the the butt of civilizations jokes I mean the Irish I mean they're they're a lot of Irish jokes out there but they saved civilization without the mission of the Irish monks who single-handedly refounded European civilization throughout the continent in the bays and valleys of their Exile the world that came after them would have been an entirely different one A World Without books and our own world would never have come to be and Columbus work he starts this mission of the Irish monks and it just you that God uses the Irish she just kind of thoughts me if I preached it two weeks within it right before St Patrick's Day which is why I colored things green but I I kept it that way um but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise it's like Satan has got he's used the the mighty sword of Rome uh to take out the truth all over the place but in one little corner of Ireland that Satan didn't even think it was worth his time going there because those those Celts are just a bunch of uh Heathen barbarians that are crazy that's where God used this work to restart his Reformation he's chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty as Columba is uh is is paddling away from Ireland and his little uh coracle with this 12 men are going with him um this writer says Columbus journey to Iona would forever change the course of Western history because he's establishing something we're going to be copying these we're copying not it wasn't just the word of God it was it was there were other things besides the New Testament the Old Testament that that were being copied there were Greek literature Roman literature all these things are being copied but with if if if the word of God hadn't been copied at all then there would have been much less for Luther and other men of God to work with later and after um after uh um Columbus he he he found different monasteries he and his followers because basically he would have his 12 men that would be with them they'd establish this this little commune um and the the picture that we showed at the beginning is uh of him as he's going um you can see it being constructed some of the pictures you look up on the you'll find of him him praying and then sowing seeds and as his sowing seeds he's he's praying they're making a settlement but soon after he and his 12 followers would do this people from around the local area would come they'd be teaching the word of God and they'd be evangelizing the area and once this and it keeps has said the limit once there were 130 people this particular spot then he said another 12 men out and they'd go and settle another spot and evangelize that area like they didn't have cars then so you have to have lots of different Circles of of influence to get the whole uh hold the whole the whole region then once that place was evangelized officially then they would go on further and further and further and it was just extraordinarily effective it says the Irish monks launched a spiritual invasion of England from their Island Monastery of lindisfire and all of England north of the Thames was indebted to the Celtic mission for its conversion and we'll just see if I can zoom in here a little bit here so you can see there uh let's see if I can get there uh this can happen no I can't do both so here you've got uh he goes up to Iona from Iona they evangelize all of the picks here and then there's the little colony of of lindisfauna and from Linda's Farm they they go all the way into England and they're evangelizing there and then all of these monasteries these are medieval Sinners of Irish Christian influence this was their it stretches so far all the way through uh all all the way through Europe it's just amazing all how far these men traveled and as they're going they're bringing the manuscripts with them all the way they're basically reseeding everything that The Barbarians had burnt up I mean this this man Colombo he does have an outsized influence because it's not just his life that's influenced but it's the work that he got started and he's got disciples who are doing the very same thing that he would he he was doing and if we look carefully at what the Book of Revelation says to thyatira it says I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and my patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first and the Columbian his Irish monks do a lot of work but after a couple hundred years of doing this the church does kind of stamp it out but the word has been receded and then you've got John Wycliffe and John Huss and other men at the End of the Age who pick up the work I mean John Wycliffe he starts translating into English and the the Catholic church in England didn't like that at all and he eventually got kicked out of Oxford for it and he goes back um to his little Country Church and he just starts translating there but it's not him translating by himself he has a whole group of young men working with him they're all working on this translation together and he sends these young men out to preach and they're called LawLers which is actually a um I think a turn to make fun of them they were called Bible men and he sends them out all over all of England's preaching preaching preaching this is very much like what Columbus had done but and then John Huss is doing the same thing and Eastern Europe but you can see how the last works were more than the first it was even more abundant land the foundation because us is right he's just a hundred years before Luther and then man it's like the fuse just blows and uh and and the truth is going all over the place brother brother Branham talking about this he says the few believers labored and thyatira they labored more fervently as the darkness increased until toward the end of the age many arose attempting reforms where cliff and Huss for example and their labors were so fervent they paved the way for the oncoming Reformation as the word says your last or End of the Age works are more than the first so it's just uh it's just I think it's a the what what happens in history matches what is described there in the book of uh revelation but um um brother Branham talks about Columba he says the pure gospel that was preached by Columbo and his fellow workers spread over the whole of Scotland turning it to God and it also overflowed in into Ireland England over northern Europe This is what what he does and brother Brennan described his means of spreading the gospel with with 12 men going and building a gospel centered town and then he talks about how he had this uh this school and this island off the coast of Scotland and from here went forth many scholars empowered with the with wisdom and the word of God and it was it was a long-term it was a it was a long-term mission for Colombia had long-term impact one French monastic historian um has called him a warrior Monk and he created Colombo created by his singular determination illiterate Christian Society among the Scots and pics of Northern Britain and now after his death a fresh wave of his stout-hearted sons began to affect the same transformation among the Pagan angles of northumbria there in northern England from there to soon um to be fabulous Island Monastery of Linda's feiner and then as colomba had baptized Scotland so his follower would do for all of northern England and Columba now became the model for all who would earn the ultimate Victory monks began to set off in every direction bent on glorious and heroic exile for the sake of Christ many of the Exiles I mean he's got folks who are going somewhat North others went Northwest like Brenda the Navigator going to Iceland Greenland even North America many of the Exiles found their way to Continental Europe and um they fearlessly brought ancient civilization back to its ancient home and that was the the effect of Columbus Ministry there and it was a very outsized effect um this one mentioned a couple other things here um page 242. brother Brandon says when I read the history of this great servant of God the wonderful work he did it saddened my heart to find that the papal power lesson to bring all men into its grasp came and eventually defiled these Mission fields and destroyed the truth as it was taught by Colombo So eventually papal power seems to win the day like I said the field had been reseeded and it was able to be picked up later so I think that for as I read this book of Irish safe civilization um that kind of answered the question for me that I think brother Brandon picked the right guy um he just had an outsized uh influence and it's certainly possible to have an influence beyond your lifetime and Columbus certainly had that second part I'm really in I was really impacted by um by what Christ speaks to the Via tiring age in the second half of his his message I know your Works your charity your service your faith your patience your works this was a working age and as I got to thinking about it we can go through times like that in their life where it just seems like Lord I'm just I've been going on for a long time and I see so little fruit and I read that scripture again and I thought man that seems to describe A Mother's Day sometime that I'm just doing again I'm I just cleaned the house and I've got to clean it again I've just told the kid no no no and I'm doing something else I've got to do it again again again it seems like I don't know but it seems like parenting is like this period of Dark Ages that we're just trying to press through and we're almost there and we're going to make it we're going to make it that's how there are there are some light points that come up every now and then but this is how we feel maybe right now there's a mom but maybe there's a dad in the office wherever we are we feel sometimes does any does anybody appreciate what I'm doing around you I come home from work sometimes and I'm I'm all thinking about my day and then I asked my wife so what have you been up to today I said are you checking up on me do you think I'm just eating bon bons all day what do you think I've been doing I actually did vacuum I actually did mop you can't tell anymore because kids been running out the dogs are running it out but we have been doing something does anybody even see what I'm doing around here and then you start thinking my is that a new dress you have on you try to think what can I notice and I just get lucky that I've noticed something because I want to notice that I try to appreciate something because it does feel like that sometimes but the first thing that God speaks to thyat Tire this this church is so ferving in their charity their service their faith their Works their patience their works the first thing he speaks to them is I know so sisters your husbands might not always notice the things that you do but God sees there's not a single work that we can do as a single act of service no matter how small that God misses he knows and there's all this I mean Columba could look back and of course he's he's dead so he couldn't have looked back except from eternity and at that point he's not in the griping state of mind you can look back I've been doing all this in the Church of Rome comes and squashes it and think what did I do it for anyway you can have that sense sometimes why did I even try what's the use of trying because it's something like the devil's going to win anyhow no God sees he values I know he also knows how much we can take we don't know that we think we can only take this much but God knows the strength of his attributes in us and he knows that we're just we feel like we're gone here but we can take up to here and he's going to help us discover that strength along the way and but he will not put more upon us then we can bear I'll put no other burden on you and then he says lastly hold fast till I come because I am coming hold on don't give up because the devil wants to make you think it's worthless stop worrying about being a good mom or dad because this is such a dark world you're not gonna have any impact on your kids lives anyway but no holds fast keep on going so just kind of start talking about first I I know perhaps we can turn our Bibles to the book of Nehemiah chapter 3. there are lots of examples in scripture where we can see um how how God does see and he does know but I think in Nehemiah chapter 3 and this is um one of these uh um Bible chapters it's just a long list but this is a list that shows God sees and this is a list um chapter 3 verse verse one Elijah the high priest rose up with his Brethren the priests and they build up the Sheep gate they Sanctified it they set up the doors of it evens the Tower of Mia they Sanctified at the tower of hananil and next unto him build the demand of Jericho next to them the son of Emery and this is over the whole chapter it's basically saying which families are building what parts of the gates and if you read this like at 10 o'clock at night you might make it to verse 10 and you're done but if you realize these people they might have gone up that morning and think man I really don't feel like going out and working on the gates today but oh if I don't I'm going to feel guilty so I'm going to go ahead and do it anyway we're and they're doing it and they might think is anybody really even paying attention to any out but God saw it and it's recorded their faithness is recorded and you can go through here one of my favorites is um um is verse 12. next unto this other family repaired Shalom of hello Hesh the ruler of half the part of Jerusalem he and his daughters his daughters are mentioned God saw that half that the mayor of half of Jerusalem and his girls were out there repairing the city and the next verse says um the let's see here the valley gate repaired handling and the inhabitants of zenoa they built it set up the doors threw up the locks throughout the bars throughout they just keep right on going right on going and they talk about from every single of life um they also see in like in five next under this other family the ticoitra appeared but their nobles did not put their necks to the work of the Lord God sees what people are doing he sees what people aren't doing God sees he knows there's not a single thing that you will do for God that he will not recompense you for in some way he will bless you abundantly for whether in this life of the life to come he will bless it he sees it he knows and just knowing that somebody sees knows and appreciates oh that gives that positive energy that puts some wind in the sails to carry on because you know what we're put here to labor and to be of service we're saved by grace through faith not of ourselves it's the gift of God it's not of work sustaining a man should boast we are his workmanship we are created in Christ Jesus unto good works we are I mean if you're unemployed you have nothing to do that's a really really difficult trial not having not having work to do we're created in Christ Jesus unto good works God hath ordained works for us to do that we might be able to walk in them and there is incredible gladness and Joy by doing work for the Lord I love this Psalm 92 you Lord have made me glad through your work if we can get a vision of the work that God has given us to do is his work that we can experience gladness because of it I will Triumph in the works of thy hands because whose hands are God's hands these hands are we will try God you have when I when we can see that I can remember this was about 15 years ago I was I just taught two years at school and I was close to really being burned out and I was seeking inspiration One Summer Lord I needed some gasoline to help get through this next year and God gave me this verse Lord you've made me glad through your work this what you've given me to do is your work and I really am glad by it I will Triumph in the works of your hands I could see this this is what we're called to do and we when we sincere that whether it be whether you're you're a a a carpenter whether you're a nurse whether you're a welder whether you're a delivery man wherever you are wherever you are you're God's hands your God's mouth your God's eyes we can be an influence for wherever we are when we can see that yes I'm going to work today because whether I'm working in the office or here at church wherever I am all work is God's work there's not a Christian profession and a carnal profession you're a Christian whatever you do God is with you and you are serving him by it in the smyrnian church age um brother Branham says all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and the Eternal Kingdom of substance that we ought to lay up in heaven those good Treasures that are available to the faithful Saints because God keeps Good Records Nehemiah chapter 3 shows he keeps Good Records a church age on page 246 brother Brandon says I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the laodicea and or the last stage self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days because so many are getting so hardened because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit because when we're just wanting to please ourselves and that is the default nowadays it's one to please ourselves then really it's it's it takes effort to get up off our couch where we've been having watching our screen putting that away and doing something for somebody else but when we do that we're actually getting in touch with other people serving God in this way oh wow it's a it brings strength and energy and you will leave being more encouraged than had you stayed there and defeated the enemies at the next level of your game I Know Thy Works they'll last be more than the first brother Branham is quoting he says as the darkness of the age increased as The Honorable of the martyrs grew a lengthier day by day the Saints worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased if you want to have increase in your faith do something for God because you will see you you'll realize how little you can do then you'll step out and say wow something really great happened there and it wasn't because of me you'll see that God does something so you want more faith do something how tragic it was that in the Ephesian age love waned and truly nothing instead of the increased Labor of Love on the other ages but in this age in the darkest of all ages they served him even more what a lesson that is there is no ceasing of this gracious service of Love unto the Lord but rather increasing of it that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is increased service because that's what we're created to do or created to go out and serve him more then Revelation 2 24 this is where Christ says I will put upon you no other burden how can I take something else on the course there are times we need to know or no we need to know our own boundaries but um we can trust God that he knows what we can what we can't handle whatever burden we're bearing we can be rest assured that our trial has been customed designed for you we can look at somebody else's truck I wish I had that person's trial and I've heard the story told where somebody is in this dream and they they want somebody else's Trouse they take their trial off and put that guy's backpack on and it just doesn't fit right and it just it doesn't it sticks in the wrong place it just doesn't work by the end of the day they come back to the room to the ones picking up their trial and the one they leave with that fits the best was the one they started with the one that God fitted them for our trials have been custom made for us to be a we couldn't bear anybody else's burden God gives us Grace to Bear what he puts upon us and um to use an analogy um when we're bearing burdens I like to think about God being our our spotter in the weight room you can tell I don't go to the weight room very often but I remember I was in the in college and I was at my roommate was a guy named Dorian he threw the discus for the track team and his his arms like the size of my thighs he was he was a big guy so after a while man I'm missing an opportunity here I should ask Dorian if he could take me out of the gym and we could work out together they could show me he could kind of show me through the ropes and he did he didn't it was rough it was rough but you know when he got somebody who's spotting for you you're pushing up you he doesn't do much at all he might just put his finger underneath that bar and just knowing that his fingers right underneath that bar and thinking that his just him with a little finger pushing up that might be just enough for you to push it the rest of the way up complete the rep just knowing that God is with us we are able to we've got there's a lot more I can never get this I could never get to God take burden from me and all God does is put a finger underneath that weight and it might just be mental knowing it's there he might not even do anything or a spotter but knowing it's there we discover strength I can do it that in that power of encouragement that's what the sponsor does he encourages and then we saw man we we believe in the strength that God has put within us and we push out again because there is no temptation that's taken this but such as is common to man God is faithful and if you've got a spotter you don't want a spotter who's there on this phone the whole time because you might really need him a good spot there's not going to be on this phone the good spot is not going to be a lawly gag now talking to everybody else he's gonna be right there with you and we have a faithful spotter God is faithful he's right there he got this you got this you got this you gotta need a little help and he helps you lift it up he will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with them Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to bear it always makes a way of Escape we don't always take the way of Escape but when we go back through and do a post-mortem on what just happened oh I could have stopped there that was that was the point where I could have there is a way of Escape he's there he's a faithful spotter the word for burden is weight or pressure um this back up again Galatians chapter 6 talks about bury one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ and then a few verses later it says let every man bear his own burden I think when we try to bury each other's burdens we want to take this image of the spotter with us because if we're always being Superman for everybody's trials and taking their trials off of them a spotter doesn't do that a spotter this is still your trial we don't take the trial away from them and save the day every single time where they're encouraging them so they will push through it otherwise they will never learn that they actually have the muscle and the strength to do it so yes we bear each other's burdens teaching each other that we can all that God gives us a strength to Bear our own burden the right way the word for burden is weight or pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages would either Bend or be broken bow or die was the age of the Inquisition the power of the Empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay with your life each age has had its pressures and I like to think I mean laodicea is not we can't really call it an age of an Inquisition but I think we can call it a kind of a Dark Age if you look at the diagram where the Branham had it's kind of Darkness what thyatira had and you know what in the Dark Ages Satan try to destroy all the manuscripts all the word of God he didn't succeed he doesn't do that now what he does is he gives you so many other things that truth becomes trivial that that that the truth is drowned in the sea of irrelevance you can look on your phone and before you can actually even find your Bible app or the message app you go through so many notifications about that most of the time you really don't you could have found out about them tomorrow the next church service you just go through all of you look at all the pictures oh that is so cute that is so cute that is so cute by the time we look through all the cute things we forgot we picked up the phone for first in the first place and it's just it's it's lost there and none of the things we did on the phone just now we're wrong none of them were but Satan has done this create an age with a different kind of pressure so he hasn't taken the truth away from us but he's taken our attention away from the truth and the accomplishes purpose that way it says each age has had its pressures for example a great burden of the last stage is the pressure of riches soft-living and nervous tensions we know about so many more things that we have business knowing about we know about every single natural disaster in the world if we want to we know about all the crime that happens across I mean we know all these things all that knowledge would make you nervous if you tried to process it it's impossible to and we're just gonna we try and keep up with everything trying to keep up with everything and um we we're we're not made for that and I just kind of like going back to this I mean this is the this is the this is what what the gerbil is running through we can say hey God has made me glad through thy Work I'm triumphing through the work of my hands what God has called me to do and then I until I go up on LinkedIn and see what my buddy from college is now doing and what he's up to is like man or my buddy from high school what's going on there wow all of a sudden what we think and we're so happy that God has called us you and then we think what other people are doing and what they're achieving and all these other things or we're very happy with our house until we open Instagram and see somebody else's house it's a perfect family vacation until we open somebody else's perfect time of the vacation and yeah then our we lose the happiness that God is already giving us because we're seeing a certain happiness that is projected that isn't always even the the the case but um I want to go back we fought our good fight we finished our course we want to have a single-minded goal I believe Columba and the Saints the Dark Ages they had a single-minded gold this is what God's called me to do I'm going to get this word spread for this age I'm gonna do it and that's what they were doing well we have today through all the media devices we have such diffuse possibilities it's hard to keep in our eye this is my goal this is what God has called me to I'm called to do this and I'm gonna when I when I do when I fulfill this particular calling in my life this is this is the sweet spot for me this is where I'm this is where I have my joy and God's blessing and we say I got this other goal I'm gonna have this kind of a car I want to have this other kind of thing I'd like to have this done in my house I like to have this like all of a sudden we've got our energy spread out but we don't have to finish somebody else's fight we have to finish somebody else's course we have our own fight we have our own course I want to finish my course I know if somebody else is doing something greater LinkedIn what God's called them to do the great go for it I will cheer for them on their course I'm fighting my course I don't need to see what they're fighting I fight my course and that's what we need to be focusing on what God has called us to do because when you get when we get our sidetracked man that can do a number on us but focus on what God has called us dude I don't care it can be being a mom and you can look and think man my friends in high school they're doing this and this and this and you get these ideas that man I should be in I I should be uh I should be able to have a have night nice I'd like to be able to have nicer things I'd like to be able to go and have a have a job or a career and a lot of women go out and do those things and that's and that and that and that's fine in that time of singleness but then a lot of times these women who put that first the hit age for the men I wish I'd had a family and then then then they miss that and value the thing the value of the blessings God places in our lives our children and then I can remember my mother teaching a child rearing class years ago it's Family Camp it was just the sisters and I got to be in there because I was her son I was doing video and she's actually said the following I have always loved my son but I did not always like him our kids are pressing all of our buttons and think man I wish I could just go get a job and put these guys away I get that I get that but you know what we've pressed through these dark ages because they grew up and they they're in incredible blessings and we just want to keep on pressing on um we fight our good fight we finish our course we keep the faith we hold fast because God will never abandon us he says hold fast till I come because I am coming we're going to keep on keeping on and I don't care what God has called us to there can be times where we go through disappointment where it seems like what we've prayed for and asked for and expected isn't being given to us and that's really hard but we just take a step forward and Trust that's all that we can do there's really no easy answer to that we just take a step forward and Trust knowing he's there and he sees that we're trusting him and we're going forward we're being faithful to him we're being faithful to him and he's our spotter those days we feel like we can hardly push that weight up he will be there and look at it and if you get a little a text message God bless you I've been praying for you today that's not your friend who sent that that is God who sent that look at it that way because he is there with you he is faithful and the promise is I will give you the Morning Star and I can remember when I was in college down at Wittenberg in Springfield I would get up on the mornings I had to walk across the street and there was this huge Cemetery cemetery is a great place to walk in the morning it's nice and quiet and I would be going walking through and uh as I was coming back I was taking an astronomy class that quarter and I'd just been spent some time with the professor at the telescope and they're coming back one more I realized hey that star up there that's brighter than all the rest of them star that's a planet that's Venus that's the morning star and I got thinking wow I'm praying out here to God there's that morning star which is a symbol a picture of God and he sees me and we're and I'm not that I'm praying to the star but to me it was it was a picture that said something but this morning star in the darkness of early morning that's when we see Venus most clearly Venus is so bright even after the sun crashed The Horizon we can still see Venus's light it's almost like Venus is carrying the light of the sun behind it I mean it says going on and the sun follows right after it because the mornings star brings the promise that morning's coming Venus is there as it's still so dark but is there you can look okay there's the Morning Star the sun's right behind it morning's coming that morning star is a is a Herald of Hope and that is what this age needed it was a dark age and they're as faithful as they can and God's promise I will give them the Morning Star God always comes on the scene at the precise moment when we need him most the trouble is we don't know when that time is we always think it's now it's like when my son say Mom I need lunch now because I'm dying we think we're dying now we're really not we're really not mom mom will give you lunch you're not dying yet and we can think Lord I Need You Now I know I need I know you need me I will be there you I'm I'm spotting you I will I I will be there we don't know the time is when God will come but he is going to be there he we don't know the limits of his strength within us he knows that we do go through dark and difficult times and we're sometimes tempted to give up because we know we can't go on much longer and it seems we have to go on a lot longer all by ourselves but it's never the case he is always with us he will never leave us we'll never forsake us remember we serve a God who is the Morning Star he Heralds the coming of a new day he shines throughout the night it's a reminder you're not alone brother Branham says if ever a people needed a promise embracing the land that where there is no night it was the people of the Dark Ages and that's why the spirit's promising them the Morning Star he's telling them that the Chiefs are even Jesus who dwells on light into which no man can approach unto will in the future Kingdom illuminate them by his own personal presence he won't be using the Stars The Messengers to give light and darkness any longer it will be Jesus himself speaking to them face to face it's the morning star that's visible when the light of the sun begins to shine and when our son Jesus comes there will be no further in need of Messengers he will bring us the message himself and the light of the world will become brighter and brighter and our perfect day and like this next next quote always before the daylight is when it's the darkest It's always darkest just before the break of day because the lights pressing and condensed in the darkness it seems and that's the time that the Morning Star comes out but it's only the early risers that ever see the Morning Star if you want to draw Grace from God go to God because he will give you Grace there is a way to escape but you have to reach out for it and if you want to see God go the place where God comes it's the early risers who will see the morning star and I think in this great hour of Darkness just before the break of day The Morning Star is Shone again spreading forth itself the early rise who are rising not setting back and saying I'll get saved next draw get saved next week but those who rise and come out and see the Morning Star rising up out of the stoop and slape of this modern world Theology and they move into the powers of the Holy ghosts The unchangeable Riches of God spread forth in our hearts showing signs and wonders why sure we rise and give him glory that's what he thinks of about the great morning star I'll give him the Morning Star so whatever Darkness we seem to be going through whatever trials we seem to be going through he promises to us as well he gives us the Morning Star and the first Thessalonians 4 18 wherefore Comfort one another with these words there's encouragement and comfort but what is this these words and that's the scripture and that right below it the comfort is that we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord that's when that morning star comes one day and calls out to us and we meet that we We rise up and we meet and that coming is coming that going is coming he will put upon us no other burden he will help us he will give us a strength to get to that moment he will give us the Morning Star he will catch us up and there's comfort in that Comfort one another with these words the Saints and thy attire hear this message they can encompert one another encourage one another and we've got this promise there will come a day the dead in Christ will rise first and the Trump of God shall sound and we who are alive and remain will meet him in the air and that's as Satan thinks he can stamp everything out down here but he hasn't gotten us and one day he's not going to because we're going to be leaving this place and that's the message to the dark times of today and that is a that is the the message I had from thyatara tonight that except the corn of wheat fell on the ground and die it abides alone you have to there we can't get away from trials we don't like them we don't like them but that it's what brings that that outer shell of us away and that brings life to something inside of us new life causing us his life in us also spring forth let's pray heavenly father I thank you very much for your goodness and Grace To Us Lord and this this little simple message Lord talking about the trials of the Dark Ages father and also we sometimes think that we're going through Dark Ages in our life and there are certainly dark times that we go through father Lord I pray that you would encourage each one this evening father that we might be assured that you see and that you know that you see us where we're at you know the pain the anguish you know the the thoughts that we might might have and you're not uh and you're not berating us or criticizing you're looking with eyes full of compassion a Heart full of compassion you're there to spot us we're going to say Lord help I need your teacher and yes he'll put his hand underneath that weight and it'll help you lift it up building that strength within you to carry on what I pray you would encourage each one Lord and I pray Lord that as we might arise or that we might see the Morning Star whether it be the physical one outside and help us to remember your promise or whether it might just be a little encouragement a note or a small word someone gives even something their kids might say to us is yes that was a small encouragement those little words are like that morning star that's bringing in the tell me there's a sun behind me that's coming it's dark now but there's a mighty Son of God coming behind he's gonna call us one day and and take us home into this glorious time and there in that City we won't be walking the light of the church age Messengers will be walking in the light of the Son of God the lamb will be the light thereof Lord I just pray that you help us to encourage one another with that promise oh God Lord Jesus Christ well I trust we've been blessed and encouraged with some everyday wisdom and principles from the Saints and thy attire they had trials we have trials and he gives us a strength to carry on his strength
