========================================

just Brandon um my computer battery is kind of go I could use a my cord will be in the middle pocket of my backpack it seems like computers are like people the older they get the shorter the batteries last a couple weeks ago I took a school trip to Washington DC and I had 6 14 and 15 year old guys in my hotel room and I thought hey one day we walked 20 000 steps we saw everything you could see and I thought man these guys are going to sleep well tonight but they were still going at nine o'clock in the evening but man it's clear who's young and who's not and I was not let's get this set up real quick on setting here this is the Korean War Memorial that we saw while we were in DC and that's always an important place to visit there we go looks like we're in business still here we have it all right Revelation chapter 3 and verses 1 through 6 is what we'll look at unto the angel of the church in Sardis right these things sat here they have the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast the name that thou livest and art dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he could overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life that will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith under the churches let's pray Heavenly Father we just ask your blessing upon our short little study this evening Lord I pray that you would help us to see how you worked in the past now you're working today and what your plan might even be in our lives father I pray that you would move in each one of our hearts father I pray you would answer questions that perhaps are on asked perhaps or aren't even since we can have questions aren't even quite sure how to phrase them yet Lord but I just pray that you would move on each one of our hearts oh God establish us and settle Us in the faith I pray in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated um this evening we're going to start off I was kind of wasn't quite sure how to take this as probably the last uh service I'll be able to take until uh later on in the summer so I have a Hiatus probably almost two months and I thought hey should I take one session just kind of review everything we've we've done so far or start on with the sardisian age and I'm going to do the the latter we'll start off looking at the church age of of Sardis this is uh one that's familiar to us in the sense that the church age messenger the Sardis is one of the best known of them and that's a Martin Luther we can look back and historians look back at this time period and uh call it the Reformation how he goes up and they have the Protestant movement protesting uh Roman Catholicism and the abuses of power of the Catholic church had and um this time period some of the the men that God used in this time period whether it be Luther or Calvin or zwingli there are a number of men that God used we can look back and almost lionize them these are this real men of God and they were and uh and what the work they accomplished and you can look back and things can seem much more nice and neat than they actually were I can remember when I was reading through the church age book um preparing for the Sunday School classes uh a year and a half ago brother branham's going through this section in Revelation chapter three and you know Book of Revelation chapter 1 says this is a book of Prophecy um John's looking uh cry Jesus is showing John how the New Testament Church is going to be going for the next couple thousand years it's a book of Prophecy and the way Revelation 3 describes this time period is much different than you would hear it described in a lot of church histories um in this case um brother branham's kind of summarizing here from Revelation 3 it says here indeed's a very strange thing in every age to this point the spirit has first of all praised the true believers and we've seen that we look at the message of the Ephesian age the the smyrnian ages there's these they're doing really well here doing really well here and really well here then we come to the age that we know a lot about all the great Reformation movement and there's hardly any phrase at all in Revelation chapter 3. all he's doing is basically denouncing um there's he's not just he's not praising the Believers just denouncing um the sin and the age he says but in this period there is evidently such wanton disregard for the Lord and his word that the entire message to this fifth age rings with condemnation if you look at verse 1 again he says I Know Thy Works thou has to name that they'll livest and are dead there's not a whole lot of roses to go with those Thorns Be watchful strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die this doesn't seem like this is a really successful age but this is how God is describing it and brother Brandon continues that the sardisian age was chaotic it was unfulfilled it was split scores of ways and God rebuked it almost in its entirety it was weak sickly ready to die it was not the Glorious era that carnal-minded Protestant historians have tried to make it be I was kind of shocked when I read this but the more you kind of meditate on it it's like wow this is this is true it was cankered blighted denuded of leaf and bearing of fruit except for some deformed and wormy fruit that was fast dropping to the ground so um to Evangelical Christians and to me as well the age of the Reformation seemed like an age of great victories for the faith and there were victories we won't underestimate those but we don't need to make them more than they were either was led by Mighty Men of God but Revelation 3 doesn't have a whole lot of positive to say about that and why is that I just want to talk about this evening and I have a my short answer if we're tired this evening read the short answer then you can take a nap every now on the service and you'll have the core of the of the message here but in the sardisian age God began the process of pulling the church out of the darkness and the areas they'd sunk into in the thyatiron age in the me and age this age of Sardis was an age of beginning but much was left uncompleted so the important lesson for us to take out of this is that we should never mistake a beginning work of God for his perfect plan this was a starting point but whenever God starts something it's easy to stop there and say look what Luther did and we'll stop right here but we never stop we just continue on and that is that is the mistake that was made it's a similar mistake that the Elders of Israel made as they looked what the amazing work that God did on Mount Sinai with with with Moses he's beginning his work of pulling the people out of Hedonism and teaching them how to please him that's what God was doing with the work of Moses but the Jewish rabbis stopped right there we're not going to go any further that was just the beginning point but as you see Christ was coming to fulfill it and showed them much more but they stopped there and that's a similar mistake that we can make we say look what God did in the Reformation we'll stop there but no it was just the beginning process more was still to come for those who would have ears to hear what the spirit would say in the future ages so we'll start first by noticing um God says I Know Thy works that's not usually the best way for a conversation between teacher and student to start when the Teacher Calls the student in Memphis I know what you've been up to I know your works because our works are generally not the best of things Galatians 5 19 says the works of the flesh the flesh has Works they're manifest which are these we'll just leave them as dot dot dot because the works of the flesh are bad God sees the works of the flesh and and it's and there's a lot of carnality in this age because it had been an age I mean this this church that God is speaking to in the 1516 early 1700s they've been they've known nothing but the carnality of the Catholic Church the carnality of men and it's hard to break away from that you've been focused on on men for so long even when God uses another man you'll tend to focus on him to your own detriment and it's hard to break that that habit The Works of the flesh were manifest we don't want God to know our work so much we want them to see the fruit of the spirit and that's he's seeing the works of their flesh you've seen the works of the flesh carnal Works manifest in this age but what's missing is the fruit of the spirit in the age because there's a lot of we could call it like inborn patterns that are just kind of keep going here what were these works that came up before the Lord and caused his displeasure well you know brother Branham says each age lapped over into the next stage so we have a continuation of the works of the fourth age going into the fifth some of this these learned behaviors as it were they're just continuing on what are these where the random lists them on page 281 of the church age book Holy Spirit leadership has been long ago in the pergaman age superseded by human hierarchy and that is that's that's a habit that's that's a behavior that really doesn't get put aside in the sardisian age you've got another hierarchy that gets set up to combat the old hierarchy but you don't you don't get under pure Holy Spirit leadership remember last time we talked about that woman Jezebel and how Jezebel married Ahab and taught him and the rest of Israel to sin and then they had a daughter athaliah who married into the more righteous Kingdom of Judah and she does the very same thing and that that's the pattern you see here Jezebel religion was in the Catholic Church and then what comes out of the Catholic Church there are these daughter churches that have these same kinds of habits that are that are that are teaching the people to uh to follow aside the pure word in its free benefits are displaced by Creeds and Dogma that happens gradually Luther certainly preaches justification by faith alone but gradually that you're going to have to be part of our church or by somebody or something else or something else gets added to that thirdly religion liturgy all these things replace spirits-filled worship the gifts of the Spirit this is how it was in pergamus thy attire and these things you're still kind of bleed over a work has definitely started but to say this is God's perfect restoration no it's not God still has more to come and Mary was uh she was elevated I think almost to a position of the godhead and the in the thyatiron age the pope of course so last time had taken the it was the vicar serving in the place of Christ and you don't want it to take place where where people are identifying more with the men of God than they are with God himself and that's that's one of these learned behaviors that's continuing into the age that the works are are are are still tripping them up as it were and like we've said at the beginning of each age God is revealing himself in a certain attribute that's really necessary to the age and in Revelation 3 1 he identifies himself these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars so he's transporting us back to the vision of the seven candlesticks and the Seven Stars in Revelation chapter one well who has the seven spirits of God it's one God speaking he'll be speaking in different ways the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and even as it's it's the the Temptation is to be focusing so much on the star on on on the messenger that you can make an idol out of it but he's starting at the very beginning don't do that it's not the messenger it's it's it's it's it's the god who's holding the messenger in his hands don't don't lose sight of that and because that was that was the Achilles heel of this age they were God was God was you he was using so many different men to disturb revivals and then they would people would would fall into the same old patterns and they'd start looking at the man instead of the god that was using him and I would start killing the Revival right away and I just kind of I was writing today I thought a star is meant to guide us to the dark that we don't look at the star if you think about if you have a dark room and you have a flashlight you don't look at the flashlights beam that's going to Blind you you look at the light the flashlight casts and you walk in that light without being without just focusing on the beam if you look at the flashlight itself you're going to be blinded you're going to stumble and fall and that's what happens if you look just at the star and not follow the God who has the Seven Stars in his hand so that's why this introduction so important because he's speaking right to the weakness the Achilles heel of this age and successive ages and um in this age there was a dependency upon politics I mean if you've there's a there's a great film from the 1950s I think it is on Martin Luther and many many my might have seen it but it shows how uh he's just he's this little known Monk and uh I think in in Saxony he's he's a he had this college of Wittenberg and if it weren't for the protection of this Duke Frederick it seemed like Luther wouldn't have a chance he's so he the the the the political powers are helping protect um the the different reformers but you can you see quickly there's a dependence on politics and politics is getting mixed up there are a lot of folks in this religious Reformation they were just glad that through the politics of romoff and pay fewer taxes this is all intermeshed together remember the brand name says God raised up many Mighty Men of which Luther was but one Calvin as wingler were two other luminaries and beside these were many many more who are not so well known however though all this was not in vain the mighty work of God was actually hindered by these very men and one of the reasons is um they um they didn't oppose the church State marriage of the Nicene Council to actually Foster that Union there was a dependency sometimes upon politics upon becoming a new state Church um the defense of the Gospel by the state was welcomed even though there was no word for it and then if you I I haven't I left out the next part of it and brother Brown says we can see the wrath of man praising God in such events as King Henry VII of England taking up the Reformation rejecting papal Authority now when King Charles took the the crown under the thing one of the titles he took on himself was the defender of the faith which he before is that he wouldn't take that title because he didn't believe in a faith or the faith but it's ironic that how did the king of England get this title defender of the faith the pope gave it to him because Henry VIII wrote this big tract against Luther and the pope was so impressed Pope Leo the tenth hey I'm making King Henry VII the defender of the faith now until they went to King Henry's head and say I can ask the pope to kind of help me arrange my marriage situation get a divorce and the pope said no so then the English church broke away not for any revelation of the from the word of God is because the king wanted the divorce this is the wrath of man actually praises the righteousness of God it was no repentance by the king but this this carnal step God uses a lot of I mean Bible translations came out of the king the King James version comes out of it in later years William Tyndale writes his uh translates his Bible there are a lot of things coming out of this that wasn't all because of spiritual religious or reasons um in spite of Luther's constant teaching against outside interference in local church matters he was not able to clear men's minds of the bishop Archbishop concept of church government it was a beginning but it wasn't the complete work thus the church took one step in the right direction but still remained Shackled so in short order she was again imprisoned in the same dejin whence she had attempted to escape so it was um it's not the the Glorious story it can be made out to be it was a it was a beginning point that God was was working with them on and the and um Revelation 3 1 God that describes after he says I know your Works he says you have a name that you live and are dead if you kind of think about this as this is a this is a paradox it's like the combination of two things that you wouldn't really expect to be together how can this be and it's kind of one of these intriguing statements that help makes you Plumb and think about what's what's going on well if you take the name of Christ you're going to be alive because acts 4 12 says there's salvation there's there's salvation no other name there's no other name under Heaven among men or by you must be saved so if you've got Christ's name you're certainly going to be alive there's one God one mediator between God and men if you've got if you're if you're in contact with Jesus you're gonna be in contact with God because that's the way to God so if they've got the name that they that they're living but they're dead they don't have Christ's name but if they had Christ and they'd be living and they would be fully alive so there's there's a different name and we could say people were getting tied to their leaders instead of to Christ and they made their own names great instead of making God's name great and that continues to be an Achilles heel up to today that we don't want to be tied to our leader we want to be tied to to to to to the Lord himself there's no you can have the the greatest Pastor in the world but he is no replacement for Jesus Christ and we get in trouble when we when we we want to appreciate and evalue the gifts God gives us but remember they're just stars in God's hand you know when we talk about a name that they'll livest and they're dead this concept is repeated somewhere else in Revelation we remember last time we talked about the the Beast that that woman Jezebel was riding in Revelation chapter 17. and John is carried away in the spirit to look at this beast and he sees a woman sitting Upon A Scarlet colored Beast full of Dames of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns names of blasphemy are going to be another way of saying you have a name that you're living yet you're dead these two ideas are going to be similar and what it is um you're taking a name like a church name or a human Leader's name and you're identifying with that and that's not going to give you a new birth give you a new life and when you're actually saying hey I'm and you're you're saying I'm I'm following Christ under some other name and you're living wherever you want you're actually blaspheming Christ's name because you're living a different life than the life that he would give then the message all things this is in the bottom of page two um brother Graham talks about this God wants to perform his word by his power and when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his word when the church explains the way and says it's for some other day and something how can God who wants to fulfill this word and performance word among the people when the people are denying that he even does it yes they go through all the rituals see but he says here's what happened God wants to perform by the Holy Ghost and vindicate his word and the church wants to perform I thought that was really neatly neatly phrased God wants to perform his word Vindicated but the church just wants to give me the stage give me a mic let me sing I will perform and I want to be I want people to be looking to me be I want to attracting to me just let me perform and that still happens that God wants to perform this word but the church just wants to perform and then they they bask in the phrase after their performance but that is not Christianity Christianity is when God performs his word in US vindicating his promises but the church just wants to perform they have to deny the Holy Ghost they want to perform to make a big organization what else to bring membership no matter what you have to baptize Sinners drunkards Bootleggers anything else and take them into the body of the church no wonder Revelation 17 said this old prostitute woman that had a bunch of daughters that she was full of names or Blasphemous names people who join churches and call that got salvation it's a blasphemy that cheapens salvation it's kind of like uh um people look look at church membership like gym membership you pay your dues and but you never have to go you just I'm a member of the local YMCA I I go every now and then so I can talk the talk of being sore and that kind of thing but it hasn't really changed my life I'm a card caring member of the YMCA but I can eat what I want I do what I want and I'm still I've got my gym pass that's how people look at hey I'm saved because I got my name in the book I'm a part I can fellowship with people like that but God wants to change us he wants to transform us that's what it's about people who join churches and call that got salvation it's a blasphemy it cheapens what God actually is doing she's got 900 something different organizations in there plenty of Blasphemous names I guess I'm a Christian I'm a I'm the Lutheran version I'm the I'm the Wesleyan version I'm this version the Pentecostal version I think brother Brandon would probably say today this or that message Camp version but we don't want any other name than his name we don't want to be focusing on anybody else that will make God has no big preachers little preachers they're all stars in his hands but we don't look at the star we look at the one who's holding them that's that's what we're getting to so they got away by some man-made tradition they got away from the true worship and that is how we get to a Blasphemous name where we're and brother Branham talks about it in different messages there's actually a sermon called Blasphemous names um another might happen in the notes is from return in Jubilee and um brother Brandon's speaking again from Revelation chapter 17 he says the King James puts it she had names of blasphemy and uh it says that means to me I don't know if I'm wrong but God forgive me it means churches took on the names of Christianity yet live like the world act like the world through the things of the world has brought a disgrace upon the True Church of the Living God and they join those it says you might join the Methodist Lodge Presbyterian Lodge Pentecostal Lodge but you can't join the church you have to be born into the church by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that's uh that's a supernatural um Supernatural event in one's life and The Only Name that a Christian can take on is Jesus Christ we can't take on any other name we try to take on any other name we're taking a name that we live but we're dead because no other power is able to transform us from the inside out and sustain us all through life's journey and then there's a there's a there's a principle that uh that brother Brandon makes clear throughout the message that we we take on Jesus Christ's name but also it's only in his name that God will meet man God has and he has a a message he preaches in 1965 in Jeffersonville God's only provided place of worship where he explains he might preach it a few different places but the principle is God meets us where he wants to meet us it's not us to decide where we want to worship God or how we want to worship God God tells us you want to meet me here's where you meet me and um Deuteronomy 16 establishes pretty concisely Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God of the flock and the herd in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there you couldn't sacrifice anywhere you couldn't sacrifice in your backyard you couldn't sacrifice you could find this beautiful this beautiful over Scenic overlooked this would be I I could if I could just sacrifice here this is beautiful I always feel so close to God here in nature why can I sacrifice here no you couldn't the heathens could build they they'd have Groves and altars wherever they wanted to but God says no you worship me in one place in one place only that's where I've placed my name nowhere else it was a big deal to God let me go a couple chapters before in Deuteronomy 14 um God said Moses was writing you will truly tithe all the increase of your seed that the field bringeth forth year by year and thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose to place his name there this is the tithe of your corn the wine your oil the first things of your herds and flocks that you may learn to fear the lord thy God always but he recognizes what if you live a hundred miles from the Tabernacle it's a big deal to take all of your flocks and herds there God says that's fine turn those things into money sell you sell what you want to sacrifice sell them take the money then once you get to the place where God's chosen to place his name you can buy something to sacrifice there and you can make the sacrifice there so he's saying it's really important to me that you come the place where I ask you to come and if it's inconvenient for you here's something you can do turn your crops turn your whatever you want to offer into money come buy whatever you want to offer do it there the important place is you come or I ask you to come and you know what we can say why does God have to be so picky we could all say hey if you love God especially you say you love God why not just worship Him worry ask you to worship Him and how he asks you to worship him because he's God after all he's the one who has he's the one who puts it on us to do something and not the other way around we sacrifice to God where he chooses to place his name and it's the importance of offering those sacrifices in the right place and it is in this in this scripture where you got those three verses and each of these three verses from 23-25 in the place that God shall choose to place his name every verse is there it's emphasized we want to worship God where he is so we can try to be worshiping God in the place where he's not that's not how God wants us to worship him where is God moving in our lives what what channel is he is he using to move there that's where we want to be in worship um for him brother bran talks about this principle in this message God's chosen place of worship he does now notice not one word of the Shadows fail and he's preaching from this these these texts in Deuteronomy these are types and shadows of the Old Testament why was that so important brother Graham's going to explain that now not one word of the Shadows fail he's both Christ is both the word of God and the name of God he was the word made flesh he was the word of God the Lamb of God the name of God he was God that's what he was the Chosen and only place of worship to God and God refuses any other place besides in Jesus Christ you cannot worship him anywhere so the scribes and Pharisees they had an elaborous system that they said Moses set this up we're worshiping where God wants us to worship but the place of worship at that time was not the temple anymore the place of worship was in Jesus Christ he was the word made flesh all those sacrifices could have been offered there even on the day of Pentecost there was a there was sacrifice they were supposed to be offered on the day of Pentecost I just like to to dramatize it for myself there are 120 people in an upper room and they're worshiping and praying that morning in Jerusalem at the very same time that the priest is leading this calf out this Bullock out and he's laying this block on the Altar and he's he's he's slicing its throat and killing it which sacrifice is God accepting though no fire comes down no Spirits Falls as this priest is offering this this this Bullock the sacrifice that God was wanting was a broken and contrite spirit up in that upper room they were doing exactly a Christ they said that's where the fire fell because that's where Jesus Christ was they were worshiping where God had placed his name and the same way today I mean there can be all kinds of places today where they where people can be proclaiming we're worshiping God but like I I've showed in previous sermons I mean these are denominational leaders who are also saying people are worshiping in churches they're basically worshiping their version of the American dream with the name of Christ in front of it they're really just worshiping themselves they like this middle class life where they can feel good about doing whatever they want to do and that's basically the doctrine of Balaam but not Balaam was really good at making people feel good about doing what they wanted to do they could lift whatever they wanted and bail them said you'll be fine and that's the kind of doctrine that is writ large today and that's the name of blasphemy we're we're saying we're worshiping God when we're doing everything how we want to do it and we're really just worshiping the one who's in the in the temple of God setting himself up as he is God that's the Antichrist there's only one place to worship God and that's as we're following revealed scripture we have to continue saying what the spirit set into the churches we want to have an ear to that and not stop us he continues speaking when they keep on listening and following that whole way and on page four from that same message God's chosen place of worship God refuses any other place besides in Jesus Christ you cannot worship him anywhere Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the life no man can come to God except by me I am the door to the Sheepfold all without our thieves he is the only approach he is the door the way the truth life all the theory is everything is tied to Jesus Christ the Old Testament is tied to him the New Testament is tied to him the church today is tied to him by the word of his commandment there is not another place or another name or anywhere where God ever promised to me to man only in Jesus Christ his chosen place of worship he was the word made flesh and God is still a God who wants to be tangible to us he still made flesh today and that is it's very easy to look back and say ah Jesus Christ died on the cross that was the word made flesh but he is still a God who wants to be made flesh in our lives today and and the Crux of the matter is will we follow God as he's made flesh today it is made flesh today now in the um in the 17th century there was a leader of a uh of a movement called the Czech Brethren and his name was Jan um Amos comenius and uh I I came across his name last year as I was reading the church age book I'd never heard of him before um brother Brennan um quote from him at length before comenius died he wrote a a pamphlet called one thing needful you can actually find it I have a link on the on and and the notes and he dies 1670 so if he's writing this is the last thing that he writes I mean Luther writes his 95 Theses in 1517. so he's he's living in the middle of the reformation and he's able then to kind of see what's what's what have been the fruits of this and brother Brandon like I said he quotes him at length and I want to kind of highlight some of the things that comenius says um he was um he he was associated with the Moravian Church which is uh actually a group of Believers that was doing missionary work also in the in the 13 colonies John Wesley and Charles West were doing missionary work in in Georgia which was a penal colony at the time in his West so it comes back across the United across the Atlantic going back to England the the ships going through this terrible storm in the west he does not have Assurance of his salvation he's Amazed by these Christians here on the ship who were praying seeing Psalms and they had peace and these people were moravians so this is a a link with uh comenius but communist writes this tract one thing needful and he surveys the the what have been the fruits of the Reformation he says the great number of teachers is the reason of the multitudes of sects for which we shall soon have no names left each Church reckons itself as the true one or at least as the purest truest part of it all among themselves they persecute each other with the bitterest hatred out of the Bible they Forge their different Creeds and these are their fortresses and bull works by which they entrench themselves and resist all attacks so you can see you're and we have to watch out ourselves and if we're study in the Bible say oh yeah this is the verse I'll use that against that brother this is the verse that's the answer the answer that'll put her in their place this is the verse that shows I'm right that's the wrong way to approach the word the word of God is never a fortress or bulwark for ourselves that's a great misuse of the word of God when we approach God through his Lord help me to be more Godly that's that's that's what we should always approach the word but you see this is a very he's looking at the Reformation from within the Reformation they say this is a bunch of carnality he says to this Labyrinth of sex and various confessions another belongs the love of disputation what is attained by it has a single learned Strife ever been settled never their number has only been increased and you can think about that sometimes folks when you've got doing these long scripture studies or quote studies and nobody in the message has studied this but how many angels can dance on the tip of a pen right the and he tried he tried to he tried to make you make mountains of bull Hills and how many times has that gone on I think this is the document determined whether somebody's in or out and this this is this is the question people always go back to that's not how we approach the word it's and when we and I was doing some meditation recently on on questions because you know we we've heard that teachers tell us there's there's no stupid questions right so people if you've got a question ask a question because there's no such thing as a stupid question I was reading though recently and um Paul does say something that's not quite Kosher for teachers today he says in the second Timothy 2 verse 23 says but foolish and non-learned questions avoid so that we might not say there's any stupid questions but Paul says there are foolish questions and what is the attributes of a foolish question it says foolish unloaded questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes so if the fruit of the question is just more and more Strife arguing back and forth I'd avoid that question drop it because that's a that's a foolish question verse 24 the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patience in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if God pair Adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil what was the snare of the devil the snare of the devil was this foolish question I think yeah just a question I'm going to go to I'm going to take a look at it spend some time on it be careful if it's a foolish question it's a snare of the devil a Godly question is one a good question is one that will lead you to Godliness but there's that that that that is it's a question that they can establish us firmer in the faith that'll that'll that'll help us know better how we can be more Godly but the foolish question is it's going to Puff us up with with pride with some arrogance that we know it better somebody else is is is different avoid those kinds of questions because those are not of God and those foolish questions become a snare of the devil and if you look back how did the fall start it started with a foolish question did God really say you should not eat the tree did God really say that the devil asked this question what was his motive that his motive was not to find out what did God say he didn't care what God said he knew what God Said that wasn't his motive so if that if a question is sometimes a nice mask to hide back some some subtle motive because Eve she didn't have the discernment to know this was a foolish question she deals with it she listens to it she handles it in the four too long if she finds that she's ensnared by this question so it's good to have discernment what why didn't you go to Adam with the question because a foolish question is one that you kind of just mull on mull on mull on yourself and it's taking she probably Googled the question she probably did all kinds of things with the question but she didn't go to God with the question because a foolish question is going to keep you right it's going to do everything it can to keep you from keep you from God himself and how many times is that foolish questions keep us away from our Bibles take us to every single Source except our Bible because the spirit behind the question is a spirit to ensnare us and not to draw us closer to God and convenience is saying to this Labyrinth of sex and various confessions belong something else a love of disputation this love of disputation is going to be chopping up this this body of Christ and all these different branches and everything like this a labyrinth is a maze and look at this and it's it's a confusing mess but he says Satan is the greatest sophist uh someone who argues plays with words and Satan has never been overcome in The Strife of words never so we don't fight Satan with argument we fight him with prayer we fight him with the word but you're not going to out argue Satan and this is a one that I didn't have space in all the slides to include this but in Divine service communities criticism of the Reformation movement this it says in Divine service the words of men are usually heard more than the word of God and our foolish questions how often is the word of God really what's being exalted or something else each one Chatters as he pleases or kills time I learned disquisitions in disproving the views of others but of the new birth and how a man must be changed into the likeness of Christ to become partakers of the divine nature scarcely anything is said of the power of the keys the church has almost lost the power of binding only the power of loosening Remains the sacraments given as symbols of unity of love and our life and Christ happened made the occasion of bitterest conflict a cause of mutual hatred a center of sectarianism in short Christendom has become a labyrinth the faith has been split into a thousand little parts and you're made a heretic if there's one of those little parts that you do not accept you don't believe my Revelation on this little thing we can't have Fellowship but believe this we're we're missing we're missing the main thing then what can help only the one thing needs for return to Christ looking to Christ as the only leader walking in his footsteps setting us aside all other ways until we all reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith amen he says so now Noah still Christendom sorry um as the Heavenly Master Built everything on the ground of the scriptures so should we leave all particularities of our special confessions and be satisfied with the revealed word of God which belongs to us all with the Bible in our hand communist rights we should cry I believe what God has revealed in this book I will obediently keep his commands I hope that which he has promised Christians give ear there is only one life but death comes to us in a thousand forms there is only one Christ but a thousand antichrists the one thing needs for return to Christ I just thought he just and he just phrases this does it expresses it so so well um and there just like in the early Church in the book of uh First Corinthians we have to beware this uh mentality I'm of Paul I'm of Apollos I'm of cephas that's how the faith gets split up into all these little little fiefdoms it was that way in Corinthians it was that way in the Reformation it can be that way it's still today beware brother Branham continues to say in page 284 and 85 of the church age book he says uh this era gave tremendous growth to the denominational Spirit if the Corinthian attitude of I am of Paul I have Stevens was ever exhibited it was now there were lutherans hussites zwingliites Etc such fragmentation of the body was deplorable they were living a name but were dead certainly they were dead they died the minute they organized the great groups organized and tied themselves in matchmented the state that did it they were finished then it goes on and says they're living their own name talking about denominations even today they're living their own name and not the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is that's easily seen for every church is known by the way it worships but never known by the power of God what is it that we that identifies churches the way they worship but that's really not how one should identify us it should be God's power moving within us because we can make the the the things that we use to characterize one another can be such minor things and we can miss miss the main thing if we focus on the on those little things and then one of brother Graham's final comments on this age actually I'm not missing one here oops he says I cannot press upon you too strongly that this age though it brought the Reformation was most sternly rebuked by God instead of being praised because it's sowed the seed of denomination that organized right back to the Harlot and that's the pro that's the pattern we saw in the Old Testament last a couple weeks ago Jezebel with an athalaya going over into Judah teaching idolatry to the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom starts going on downhill after that when the move away from the Catholic Church took place it was not truly spiritual as a whole but was more political and most of the people took up with protestantism because they hated the Roman system of political and financial bondage thus instead of this being a great spiritual move with all the earmarks of Holy Spirit influence is when God used purely spiritual means to accomplish his ends at Pentecost it was indeed a work where in the wrath of man praised God so here you see people were doing their own thing it was permissive will of God but it was still God's purpose to accomplish his work so yes King Henry VII he got his wives but even his carnality would not prevent God from starting his work and and God did indeed begin it and then the jezebelie brother Graham says the Jezebel Lafayette tire was in no mood to give up her hold upon the people and thus we see her daughter athaliah raise her head in the sardisian age with the hopes that she would be able to strangle the true seed by her schemes of organization so the the key Point here is that we should never mistake the beginning of God's work for his completed work so on Mount Sinai with the law God met the people of Israel where they were he met him where they were and if you look at the laws that they that God that he had to talk about he didn't talk about all kinds of strange relationships even bestiality is mentioned there on the law well why because these people were coming out of pagans if they they needed taught about everything he met them where they were but he's gradually bringing them bringing them bringing until he himself becomes made flesh to take them further and that's what they they said no no no we're going to stay right where you started but the beginning work of God is never the perfect work of God yet because the church leaders the rabbis mistook the first work of God the laws has completed in perfect work they missed God's ultimate goal for them the Holy Spirit God's spirit in them and similarly brother Branham calls the sardisian age the Reformation age an unfulfilled age it was the starting point but it was far from being the complete restoration itself the complete restoration was still to come for those who would have ears to hear what the spirit says to the church is we have to continue to follow God as he reveals himself further so in Revelation 3 2 John writes be a watchful strength in the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found my works perfect before God where the Bram says do you know what the meaning of not perfect really is it's unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled age it was just the start of getting back it had started out in the doctrine of salvation which meant salvation was all of God and oh how Luther preached the sovereignty of God and election he knew it was all of Grace he separated the church from rule by ecclesiastical hierarchy he tore down the idols he cast out the compassion of the priest he denounced the pope it was wonderfully good as he started but God had said 1500 years before to John on the Isle of Patmos Luther you're going to start things but your age will see it all unfulfilled I'm leaving that to later and the devil couldn't stop Luther but the devil does try to stop is to get us from going further than Luther he wants to keep us at this unfulfilled part this was an unfulfilled age an age of reformation but that's how God wanted it and every age is asked basically to do the same thing will you follow what God's doing now and that's the test so it was started then but he's continuing even up to now will we follow what God is revealing now and I just say a really great place to start is if we believe truly that Malachi 4 talks about Elijah the prophet coming before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord if we if we believe that will we crack open the book sometime and read it young folk young people we're out of school now and we can say but all sincerity during the school year I just don't have time we can't say that tomorrow morning we don't have to go to school tomorrow morning we don't have homework tomorrow morning I just encourage you crack open a book because if we really say God has done this let Brethren let us not take a more Earnest heed don't forget the things we've heard unless we should let them slip take time put Roots down into what God has done today Jesus says if you continue in my word then you're my disciples indeed so if someone starts has an experience with God at some Revival in the street corner in some church there's nothing about the message but God starts to work there great God can start a work anywhere we can't be to say that God the only me God can only starts thinking here no God's gonna start anywhere but this truth continues to be revealed and unfolded hey walk into it walk into it if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and then you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so don't make the mistake brother Brandon um it sounds like in the church age book it sounds like in Revelation chapter 3 that this period of reformation is being just push the size like no but you know what it is we also still today people are looking at the Seven Stars in Christ ten and all they see are the is is is the star and they can be if you just look at the light you'll be blinded but walk in that light and then you'll continue to go further on to whatever light God has further for us there is more so I'd say the season you go from church tomorrow morning when you get up crack open your Bible crack open a message book and spend some time see if the spirit of God will still speak to our hearts today amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and your grace to us Lord Lord I Thank you for what you did through Luther and Calvin and zwingli and through comenius all these men are just reading about communities life how he had to leave the Czech Republic free flee persecution there lost a wife and two children and just had a very difficult uh difficult time with all the persecution there Lord those men sacrificed a lot and made and made and made stands for truth Lord I pray oh God that we would follow what they taught and then keep on moving on because there's it's not just a star it's the hand that's holding the star we want to be holding that hand walking in that light Lord all the way home oh God father I pray that you would speak to our hearts father Lord I pray that you would father free us from any foolish questions that might have ensnared our thoughts and stared our minds o God lord I pray that we'd push those foolish questions aside the distract us and take us anywhere but your word oh if even just gone straight to Adam has been a totally different story and how many times can we say if I just gone straight to Adam I'd just gone straight to the word in a different story Lord help us to do that father I pray we would establish us and settle us Lord and I pray fathers each one might tomorrow morning or even this evening open the book pray in them hear what your voice has to say that we might actually hear your voice speaking to our own hearts Lord and that would be with Revelation o God that we might see something we've never seen before because there's spirit in the word for the day Lord I pray to you moving us draw us closer you o God I pray in Jesus name amen amen speak my
