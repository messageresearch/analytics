========================================

Julia somebody said praise the Lord praise our God Amen he is mighty in battle praise the Lord he's a man of war and God can fight all of our battles for us as we heard Sunday such a wonderful message I was so glad to be here to hear that and just to see the inspiration behind it and that we are the weapons in God's Armory to be able to come out in this hour be able to face whatever things that come our way praise the Lord it was God who chose you to live at this time in this place if you'd have chose yourself you would have chose another time but it was God who chose you to live during this time so if he chose you to be here he'd give you the tools he'd give you the weapons he give you the faith to be able to make it through this time I believe you will praise the Lord God bless you tonight let's turn our Bibles to Daniel chapter 3 if you would want to wish um [Music] Joseph my cousin and sister Carrie a happy anniversary today surprises amen surprise to see him in church you know and God bless you may you have a nice anniversary and hopefully you got something planned there to get away if you need a babysitter me and my wife are available if you don't fight anybody else we'll watch the kids for you amen Daniel chapter 3 we're going to read a couple places in the scripture and that's one of them uh in Daniel chapter 3 we welcome all you tonight it's so good to be in the in his house and be able to feel his presence and worship him what he deserves all of our worship and praise and all of ourselves and so it's always a joy to be able to have the place and time to do that and just give it all to him amen Daniel chapter 3 and then in the New Testament after that I want to read in second Timothy chapter 3. Daniel chapter 3 and verse 16 if we could read together before we're seated Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king o Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be known unto thee O King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up then then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury and the form of his Visage was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it won't to be heated second Timothy chapter 3 in the New Testament We'll add some scriptures here to the the text and the context second Timothy chapter 3. verse 12. yea and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse doesn't say that it will get better and better as you have many years as a Christian if you're living Godly in Christ Jesus then the spirits and the the forces against you will get worse and worse evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived and I want to speak a little bit tonight in the service on why is Satan getting more angry why is Satan getting more Angry how many believe that Satan's getting more angry how many believe that Satan has always been angry all right but how many believe in this last hour he's getting more angry and he's howling even more well there's a reason for that and it's not just because he doesn't like your personality there's a reason that Satan is getting more and more Angry as we get closer to the Rapture amen heavenly father bless your word tonight may offer it freely Lord for my heart may you replace Lord the burdens that I have may you unburden me Lord and may you bring the joy of God in my heart so that I can freely Minister your word to your precious people tonight whoever's here whoever's listening whoever would listen later father if there's a heart that's hungering for more of you we pray you so anoint our words I'm just a human being but you can anoint men of God to speak words of life and that you would bring deliverance and hope and strength and encouragement to a heart that's seeking you and we trust your truth will set the people free in the name of Jesus Christ we ask him amen and God bless you may be seated I'm going to read a little bit tonight as a foundation from Brother Branham and we'll get to it just in a minute and I'm going to read from a sermon that he preached Christ The Mystery of God revealed and um I want you to notice the title of that Christ The Mystery of God revealed is and that he's saying and I always look at some of these things that's not just a sermon title and I trust it would be that way with my sermons as well that it's not just a title but but it's an announcement and it's a it's a proclamation of where we're standing right now and that's what I believe about many of these titles it's not just sermons but it's announcements saying where the bride is at in the last days Christ The Mystery of God revealed even in that title is a lot of Revelation but notice he says he will be revealed Christ will be revealed and he will be revealed by revelation and then uh then we see that in that title it says Christ will be revealed it's one thing if we know about Christ Jesus of 2000 years ago in our stories from Sunday school and we see the four gospels and we see he lived 33 years and we see his fleshly days here on Earth but it's another thing that God drops a revelation of who Christ really is and actually the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not just the church receives it not just a group that receives it but it's personally to you the new birth is a revelation of Christ personally to you and when that Revelation comes listen I can tell you it's not just that you understand Jesus in the four gospels Christ becomes real and personal to you and so that that time that title is as an announcement it's it's what is happening now secretly and we're just not talking about his life here on Earth but who he is is revealed in the day and its fullness in this day is in its fullness Christ will be revealed in his fullness and who is he revealing it to he's revealing it to his body his people because we are the body of Christ if the body of Christ is without the head then she's not really the body of Christ how many believe tonight and I'm just laying in some foundational statements that I know you will at least nod to and amen would be nice but if you nod to it how many believe Christ is the head of the church he's the head he's the if we want to call it he's the brains he's the he's the one that directs just like your body your head if you cut your head off you're finished the body has no function without the head and so Christ is the head of the body the body has nothing can't be nourished can't be filled can't can't move can you say Amen without the head and so now in the end time we see Paul and Colossians saying the head that he is the head and by him and through him consist all things and she is the body but the head must be connected in a union with the body and through denominational ages of 2000 years denominational ideas has so destroyed the word of God and taken away from the word of God that you take away from the husband Christ and the body has become detached from the head but in the end time the head returns and reveals himself and when the head comes back and the body catches it she becomes one with him for a rapture so that's the prophecy for the end time and so it's him who's revealing himself to his body his people that's what's happening right now spiritually that's what's happening we can talk about what's happening in the news we can take prophecy and and bring all these things but what spiritually happened is the bride is recognizing her headship Christ has returned you say well he's returned not in a physical body yet but because that's when we meet him in the air but Christ has returned in the fullness of his word why has he done that because he's the head and the body's got to connect with it before Rapture and so when she recognizes her headship her true headship and her headship is not a denominational head her headship is not a church her headquarters is not somewhere here on Earth she's recognizing her true headship which is Christ the word and that is what's happening in True Believers she's recognizing her headship Christ is here he is my head I'm becoming one with him and his word is coming through him that I'm truly his body amen his word is flowing through the Bride As she brings herself in the word so with that in mind and just in case you haven't listened uh to that service or maybe you need to listen again just to remind you he says in that as a foundation that in the mystery of God is threefold and he says number one and brother uh Stephen mentioned this on Sunday the mystery of God is threefold number one what did God want to do what's the what's the achievement of the entire Bible it's one mystery of God but it's threefold number one is God wanted to come down and become man and show himself to the people in flesh so that was the first step of his threefold mystery is God came down and become flesh Jesus was another was not another person of the Trinity he was God in flesh the fullness of God how many believe that so now he fulfilled that part of his ministry but but that wasn't the full mystery the second part of the threefold mystery is for the people for the for the for him one once he's here to have the preeminence in his body to have his preeminence in the people so he would have to be here in order for him to take the position of preeminence in the body for 2000 years the preeminence has been denominational ideas for two thousand years it's been man's ideas for two thousand years it's Church systems and so they get away from the true head the husband Christ and then he says I will bring it back I'll bring my headship back the bride recognizes it and she'll leave all other husbands and choose that one husband Jesus Christ didn't Paul say in the Bible I've espoused you to one husband I fear less like Eve was deceived in the garden I fear that Satan would deceive you and be subtle like it was before taking you to other husbands but I'm I'm I'm laboring with you in the gospel to bring you to that one goal that you come under one headship and it's only Christ that you have one husband and it's only Christ all other husbands will be dead can you say Amen so you know here we have the second part is is the preeminence coming in a people and that's where we live right now the third part of his mystery is to restore them back completely to Eden again the head the body restored Back to Eden like the Garden of Eden again and that's what George just that's the summary I just gave you the summary of your entire Bible everybody hold their Bible up I just gave you the summary of every type every shadow everything that was done here every story that you knew from Sunday school there's one summary and now I'm reaching back into the back part of God's mind before he allowed all this to happen what was his achievement what was his purpose and I just said it to you that he'd reveal himself to man that he'd get the preeminence in a body and then he'd take them back to Eden again and restore how many believes got to restore he's going to restore us back to Eden man he's going to restore us back to Eden again completely so that's the summary of your entire Bible that's what was the back of the back part of God's mind to achieve through time and he's wrapping up the second part now and he's almost on on the verge to go to the third restoring us back to Eden again let me say it this way Christ is the head of the body and the body at the end time recognizes that this is our this is our head Christ that's come back to us the word has come back to us again through denominational ideas he's restored the full word back to us and thus Christ our head is back and it's revealed to her this is him this is the one we see in 2000 years ago this is the true Christ revealed and when she recognizes my head is here this is Christ she Embraces it she becomes one with it by the Holy Ghost and when she does she becomes his hands and his feet on Earth where's Jesus he's in his people what's the final manifestation to this world of Christ not Jesus in the air but Jesus in his body and you say Amen we meet him in the air but when the word comes back according to Revelations 1 he sets his foot upon the Land and Sea Christ that Covenant angel that rainbow Angel that's Christ there and when he comes down and descends that's not a physical return the physical return is to meet him in the air in a Rapture this is a word returning of Christ the full word because that's who how many let me step back a bit how many know that Christ is not just the physical body that was here 2000 years ago Christ is the word he's the person of the word John 1 and 1. in the beginning was the word Matthew starts out the birth of Jesus and the story Luke Mark Luke tells about the the beginnings being the birth of Christ John starts it with a with the eagle anointing on John he starts the whole Beginnings not at the birth of Christ but to tell who this Christ really was and that was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's John's Eagle Eye describing what this birth of Christ was who is he well he was a Healer who is he he's a counselor he's a prince of P please but if you miss the part that he is the word revealed in every generation that is Christ when Christ Reveals His word to any generation that's a revealing of Christ and when he brings the word to that generation that's Christ revealing himself Jesus is the word Christ is the word can you say Amen he comes under this headship she forsakes all others uh all the other man's ideas she leaves she exits you find this in the Book of Revelations where babylon's there Babylon is uh is means religious confusion and the world is full of religious confusion especially in Christianity and the call to the bride at the last days is to come out of her my people her come out of come out of that system come out of that Babylonian religious confusion and come to where come back to the word praise the Lord come back to the true headship and there's a people it won't be a church doing it it won't be this church it's a it's an individuals coming back to the word and she comes back forsakes all the other man's ideas forsaking all others like a wife does when she stands in a wedding and she makes a commitment to that one man the bride makes a commitment to one man Jesus Christ all others I forsake all others it's like she takes a vow can you say Amen it's a more it's a more serious vow than what the girls and the guys take at the altar that's serious but the one you take to Christ uh I'll serve you for richer for poor and sickness and in health I'm not going to leave you I'm committed to you and forsaking all others as long as I shall live that's the commitment we make to our hardship Jesus Christ praise the Lord so she does and when she does when she does that the bride now in this hour it sets her in a Rapture condition to be restored Back to Eden praise the Lord so now you see now I said that because it gives the roots of the root of Satan's anger the root of Satan's anger is not just so you don't like you but the root of Satan's anger is this bride becoming one with her head Christ if you say Amen when you are becoming one and bring your life through the word and giving him the preeminence in your life and making him number one in your life when he he hates that more than anything because Satan has learned something and you know I feel very confident tonight if I don't get a lot of amens I'm going to give the devil a black eye tonight I don't care because he does not like me preaching like this because this is what's happening now I'm going to tell you what's making saying Satan angry from the beginning but he's also getting becoming more Angry as we get closer to this Union in this Oneness and this Rapture he's getting more Angry that's why the prophet took the Rapture text in Psalms 27 though a host should be encamped around me I will not fear hide me in thy Pavilion Lord praise the Lord why because as the everything intensifies and once intensifying oh world the worlds of the politics everything's intensifying everything's Under Pressure but why is it under pressure we're coming to the end of prophecies being fulfilled in the people of God the body of Christ she's coming to that moment where she's letting this word go through her and Satan can see some of the results of it and he's getting more angry at your life if you're the one bringing your life through the word and your family through the word he's becoming more angry at your family he's not going to walk away he's going to stand there more angry at you so now we get to the root of Satan's anger he gets more Angry as the Bride Comes under that headship he has passed God has passed his secrets to this bride he's passing his secrets to her through the word you ever have somebody that is telling secrets and they're not telling you what it is and you don't know what it is sometimes it can make you angry and Satan is watching in the last days the last 50 60 70 years as God through the ministry of the last days Whispers his secrets to a people when she's catching it and you know what I love he completely bypassed say he didn't need Satan's permission he left him out of it completely he's left him out because one thing about a revelation is that this is what he told Peter he said Peter you don't even realize all what you have but I'm going to tell you what you got right now when you said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he said he said Jesus said Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you you didn't get this from a seminary you didn't get this from man's teaching I gave you a revelation directly father from the father he said flesh and blood is not revealed but my Father in Heaven gave you a revelation bypassed all the man's ideas and the father deposited a revelation for him to burst out and say you're the Son of God you're the one that was supposed to come you think he figured that out in his head it was a revelation but I want you to notice the next thing Jesus said Upon This Rock of Revelation I will build my church how many knows he said that so he builds his church upon Revelation coming from God straight to his people not through seminaries not through intellectual teaching not through just figuring out in our brain I'll bypass that and I'll he may use her because the mind is the womb to the soul he might start there but it's not to stay in your mind it's to drop by Revelation into your art I will deposit that he says I will give you it came from your father and this is where I'll build my church upon Revelation and guess what the last part's the best the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it that tells me Satan's going to get angry what's he going to get angry at the revelation God gives you it's not that you don't like your personality it's that he's being bypassed and God is dropping Revelations some of you don't even realize all that God's deposited in your life tonight you don't realize in the last 10 years in the last two years maybe you've been around 30 years the secret thing that's been going on God has been depositing his Revelation and really revealing Christ to his bride say I don't feel worthy of it tonight you don't know how I feel tonight brother Paul I'm not going on your feelings I didn't come to preach to your feelings I come to preach to tell your position in Christ and you probably got more in you than what you realize you got lands and stuff laying down here that you don't even realize that you got I mean you have a revelation you understand you understand what I'm saying you understand what God has given you but you didn't know sometimes where all that came and you realize you have more in you than what what you realize and that's what Satan is mad at he had no hands in that and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against a man this is the way he said it Satan can't move a man with a revelation he can mess with your spirit he can depress you he can discourage you he can speak to your mind but one day that's going to be over too he can accuse you you're not a son of God look at the mistakes you made he can say your spirit can get low sometimes you can get physically sick in the body but then God can heal you can you say amen he can tamper with the outer two Realms of spirit and flesh because those two aren't born again but he can't get to the Revelation that God has deposited in your heart this is what makes Satan so angry helps us to be a mature adopted son's when you have that situation where all that live in Godly in Christ Jesus and take a stand and have a revelation shall suffer persecution and when it comes you stand sure-footed and you still confident because that person angry with me it's not the person it's the devil doesn't like what I have remember I talked about a few weeks ago the devil's learned this that the people get get a revelation and they act upon it from from Abel all the way through to the bride today Satan has learned that the people that get a revelation God bypasses Satan gives it to him even when they weren't worthy of it and Satan hates when they get a revelation from Abel how did Abel bring a blood sacrifice and Cain brought fruits one thing revelation he caught a revelation there no but there was no Bible there was no teaching on it there was no seminars on it got a revelation from God that it was blood that we fell by and now it takes blood to get us back so I'm bringing this bloody animal I'm slitting I'm gonna slit his throat I'm gonna let the blood come all over all of it and and Cain is over here on this side and he says I think it's of good fruits in our lives if that God honors good fruits and so he makes this beautiful table with all kinds of lush fruits on it God's going to be impressed with all of my good fruits makes it beautiful and Abel is over here and he don't know but just by Revelation he just does it and there's this big bloody table with a bloody animal around it and they both begin to worship and God says I accept Abel's and I reject Keynes and the only difference was God dropped a revelation this is what you bring in worship not your own fruits not some flowery altar blood we needed blood we needed a sacrifice for our sins the only one provided place to worship God is under the shed blood of Jesus Christ no other place to worship laying in some principles tonight and I hope you grab a hold of them so now we see then that it's revelation God gave Peter a revelation he bypass the hands of Satan and then there was power in it because he said the gates of hell should not Prevail against it that means he can get angry Satan can get as angry as he wants to get and do whatever he wants to do but he can never get to what God gave me he can never get to what God gave you if it is a true Revelation Satan can't get his grubby mitts on it can you say Amen no wonder he gets angry with what you have on the inside no wonder you have people that come against you no wonder that some the tension Rises sometimes and it festers towards you don't go don't blame the person but realize you can just raise your hands and say I must have something real Within Me For The Devil to be fighting me this much this church must be doing something right because I can tell you the devil's really fighting lately he's become more Angry he's wanting to cause more division but I will not stand for it I'll stand here and keep preaching this message I'll keep preaching the headship of Christ because I know some people and some young people are going to get the Holy Ghost can you say amen and it's going to make Satan more angry but I'm prepared for that I'm ready for it because I know this word will stand and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against a true revelation so let's get into these things that brother Branham said here in the first one and so I don't want you to catch now he's going to go into the subject of headship but he says a few times this is why Satan is howling this is why he's so angry right now he says when we see these great threefold revelation God in Christ Christ in the church the kingdom coming Adam and Eve redeem back to the Garden of Eden in the representation of Christ and his bride and then the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise he just mentioned the threefold purpose just just like I did praise be to God now by the revelation of the threefold mystery the secret and by the personal Vindicated word by his original headship this is the same terminology I've been the original headship Christ and so I would just want to just hold it right there so now what she what is the bride recognizing his original headship what's come to us in the last days the original Christ of 2000 years ago his headship has returned my head is here and when my head is here I can be United in a marriage can you say a bride cannot have a wedding can have us can't have a ceremony if she doesn't have her husband around he could have sent her all these letters I'll be there I'll be there and then he's a no-show that has happened to some brides and it's pretty sad but you can get to the end time and Christ is a no-show no he showed up he's in the building and the bride says we can have the union now we can have the wedding because he's here my head is here I'm ready to unionize with him so the headship is returned and she recognizes it it is the original headship Christ himself it's not based upon any denominational idea or other man's ideas it's just Christ purely reveal himself the word the restoration of the word so notice he says here now go to the next one then he goes into this now not say well glory to God we shout hallelujah we sing now remember just a little later he's going to say this is why Satan is howling this is why Satan is so angry it's this headship returning and the bride could be coming one with it this is why Satan is becoming more and more angry as I said it's not your personality it's not just that this this that and the other it's not uh you know it's he doesn't like when the bride becomes one with him this is what makes him more Angry he doesn't like it when it's preached either but if that's he's going to go into something here and say well glory to God we shout hallelujah we sing that ain't that ain't it I I'm a missionary I've seen seven times practically around the world see I've seen heathens devils and everything else dance and Shout I've seen all kinds of fleshly manifestation that's carnal we don't judge the accuracy of a church or a camp by how much shouting is going on and I want to say this that's not what Satan gets angry at he's saying that here it's he's going to go online and say what's that he's holling at he's not we think oh this is what Satan's mad at he gets angry because they're speaking in tongues and they're shouting and there's dancing I believe in all that but I believe it comes as a result of the stimulation of Revelation when you get a revelation you're going to get emotional when God drops something in your heart you're going to get happy about it this isn't a dead cold formal religion this isn't an intellectual exercise when God drops a revelation in your heart you're going to get emotional some people sit and cry some people just raise their hands some shout the aisles but don't you ever use that as the clarification that That's what Satan is angry at because he's seen missionaries and heathens and Devils shout dance and even speak in tongues that's why you can't use it as a criteria for the evidence of the Holy Ghost can do it praise the lord well devils and everything else dance and Shout I've seen all kinds but I'm talking about what's he talking about the headship of Christ not that you can dance and shout and no I'm talking about the headship of Christ the headship has come you could dance and shout and not have be under the headship of this word and this word in the last days is a headship it's the true headship and when it comes we bring our lives under the headship of the word as a matter of fact we bring everything on our lives under his headship submissive what's the word say about it what music should I listen to what's the word say about it what kind of books should I read what's the word say about it and if there's a warning in this word in this message then the bride nobody else is going to do it I'm going to do what I want to do I'm going to watch the shows I'm going to watch I'm going to do it no but the bride says there's a word for it somebody preached that word and I'm bringing in submission my life under the headship of that word she's the only one doing it it's not about you can shout it's this headship of Christ notice being personally identified by the original history we have the answer to the devil's question amen glory next one we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and has paid the price and raising up her head or the body the devil can't stand it that's the reason these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what we're doing now the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is his wickedness and his scheme has been uncovered by the Risen resurrected Christ in the headship over the body I'm preaching to you what Satan's really angry at and part of his anger is an ecumenical council that gathers together because they don't like the little groups that won't come in and agree and find some agreement with everybody come on brothers and they use the scripture Jesus said I pray that they all would be one they're losing using that scripture really how can two walk together unless they be agreed if that denominational system that's part of The ecumenical move is not under the headship of this word but under the headship of the organization how can I become one with that can't do it can't do it we we cannot come under anything except the true headship of Jesus Christ and part of Satan's howling is to grab get kingdoms together in their anger we're so upset we've got everybody but we don't have these young people we don't have this particular group this this they they won't join in with us they won't agree with us they won't preach it the way everybody should preach it and and there'll be a pressure come in the tribulation that they can't buy or sell unless they receive the mark how many know your Bible there's a mark of the beast study it it's not some worldly system or some planting on your head or your hand it's not that it's it's yielding your mind to a system that's wrong it's yielding your service your right hand to a system that's when you receive the mark and if you don't receive the Holy Ghost you will take the mark of the beast but we think it's of a of a a communism nature and if you study the Book of Revelation communism is only a tool to be used to come in the last days the King of the North King of the South in the Book of Daniel it's only a tool the real thing that you should fear is romanism boy I'm being plain tonight ain't I I might have to screen this going out I'm going to tell the truth anyhow a city that sets on Seven Hills a woman a church with the Beast system behind her of the old Roman Pagan Rome James de Papa wrong open your eyes Babylon so it's a form of Christianity that everybody comes into but it gets so angry at those groups who won't join with it we're going to put pressure on them and try to make them join it's part of Satan's anger and it's because the headship of Christ has come back to his body and he's getting more angry at that because she's becoming one with it next one that's it Christ the word he was the word he was the word and the church becomes the word by Me by him making her a part of him and that's the word again personally identified by him his property alone his property alone she is Redeemed by him through him for him and for him alone that's it then what the devil is how what the devil is howling about that's it's being revealed that's what the devil is how I'm going to go back to that last one please that what that's what the devil is howling about that it's being revealed to who to a people you know this last Sunday though they were enjoying the word of God you don't know what God was depositing to you then you wonder why you started Monday and the devil's angry with you God's doing something he can't get his hands on it Satan can't get his hands on it this is what the devil is howling about that it's being revealed if you can raise your hand tonight and say I know God has given me a true Revelation directly from his throne you know what guess what you're a target of the enemy his anger is getting worse in you sometimes it comes through family members but don't judge them it's just the devil that's mad at you because they're kind of like the echo medical Council that's trying to conform you back to the way they wanted things to be the husband's trying to get you back my wife has become a religious zealot my husband's become a religion this young person you're going off the deep end with this thing and they're pressuring you to come back into what's normal but when you get full of the Holy Ghost this is normal this is normal and I'm not going back I will go back I won't go back to the way it used to be Christ is my head now the word is my head every decision I make is through the word of God what does his word say about it and I don't live any other life except to see what his word says and when his word speaks that's the final word for me It's the final word for me praise the Lord somebody say praise the Lord amen why did you choose such a Teaching Ministry tonight when everybody's tired you have to take my coat off and just jump up and down to keep you all awake next one we're in a dangerous time remember the scripture says when these things begin to happen time is no more she's fading away that's Revelation 10 uh time will show me no more he'll no more delay this stuff that means there'll be no more delay I'm going to release this this is all scriptural okay Revelations 10 Mighty Angel comes down seven Thunders out of their voices when when's that going to happen it's clearly identified in Revelations 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel there's seven angels through through the church ages it's the seventh angel he says in the days of the voice of the seven Angel then the mystery of God will be revealed the mystery got to be finished through the vocal cords of the seventh angel then the bride receives it and she becomes one with that word can you say Amen we're in a dangerous time he says time no no I will no longer delay this Revelation for my bride The Book of Daniel says the same thing seal it up Daniel seal it up and it's all sealed up but when's it going to be open Revelations 10 in the days of the voice of the mystery of God should be finished I'll burst forth my Revelation why no more delay I won't hold it back anymore I'm going to give it to my people what a day to live in then he goes into the world events earthquakes Jesus said the beer you see them thousands killed the other day earthquakes in diverse places fearful sights in the skies pillars of fire like floating around like flying saucers they don't know what it is these things are signs in the heavens that we're close I don't know what this smoke is over us but it always makes you is this the next thing where is this in the scripture because it serves things awful odd is this the germ warfare is something falling here do I need a mask is the government going to bring us these big gas masks I don't know I'm just ready to go I don't know give me my mask but I'm ready to be raptured out of here they don't know what it is they don't have any idea what those flying saucers are next one he says did you notice the angels that come down investigating Sodom before Sodom was destroyed you remember that there was a bunch of them come down three of them one of them stayed with Abraham you remember that they were lights from Heaven that came down in the investigating judgment one look where you all found around the Pentagon things they find them that's the world judgment Sodom and there is one represented will be represented among the churches will be Christ himself vindicating to us see in heavens above and signs and the earth below that's what Jesus said there'll be signs of above and signs below the flying saucers the lights they're seeing they don't understand what they are but they're investigating Angels because we're very close to tribulation and the judgments of God so I'll go into this next one here later in the sermon I believe it is identified all the devil is howling about this the manifested truth of the promise of the word in ER alone they don't have the answer when Jesus come why didn't those Pharisees he said if I cast out my Devils by the Finger of God who do you cast them out by see he stood alone and his church stands alone she is not hooked with nothing one headship Jesus Christ but he identified by God being the body that was God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil is howling he didn't know tonight why the devil's getting more angry this is why the headship has come Christ the word has come every day the Lord is showing himself to his true people and they're saying I want to become one with him I don't want to be distracted I don't want to be I want to become one and I want to have let him have the preeminence since he's here let him have the preeminence in this Kingdom did you know this is a kingdom here your body is even a kingdom who's going to be the king of your kingdom you your mind I don't trust my mind she said this is my Christ this person of Christ is here the word is here in this body if nobody else submits young person listen to me you're surrounded by thousands of young people first of all some who don't care about the word Christ they they that's fine but let there be a number of young people in this generation that says I want to bring my life under subjection to the word of God there will be a people there will be some at Judgment Day when some rise up on the stand and say I didn't follow the word as a teenager because it was too hard I didn't want it I rebelled against it and also here's another thing nobody could live that close to God and so I didn't do it God and God steps back and says he brings the young people from the laodicean generation he brings them up and says it's not true here's a whole host of young people coming from laodicea that became one with Christ I want to be one of those I don't want to be a statistic I want to be one of them that he stands with me because I stood with him he stands with me on the day of judgment praise the Lord that's why the devil's howling these great organizations have set up something to close her up I like this last part these great organizations to set something up because this is Satan's anger we're going to set something up to close up her churches they'll there'll be a pressure to close this church someday they'll never do it I love this she the bride will be taken up not closed up amen that's our promise not closed up taken up Hallelujah I love him so much tonight give me about two more minutes I should be done here praise the Lord this is why Satan is howling this is why Satan is becoming more angry it's not at a life that's a borderline believer Satan is not angry at borderline Believers Satan's not angry at compromisers Satan's not angry at the person who shouts Satan is not angry but you start living the life and you by a revelation you start living the life of Christ that's when Satan becomes more angry at you Satan is not howling of those things but he is getting more and more angry at the sons of God somebody is letting that word come through their lives and they are becoming with the word more and more he's getting his rightful position Christ is getting his rightful position in first place in their lives and every question of life gets addressed by the word first because he is her or his head he's my head the word is my head it's not because of your personality it's not because you go to church Satan's not angry at you because you attend church that doesn't make there's hundreds of people thousands around the world at a chin Church some of them were faithful than you it's not that Satan's angry because you come to church and I'm really glad you're here tonight many come from distances an hour and a half away sometimes longer here tonight in this service God bless you some listening from many places God bless you but that's not what Satan is angry with you about it's the Revelation that you hold it's your dedication to come under God's headship it's your submission because only the bride will be submissive to this word the rest rebound say I'm not going to do that I'm going to pick and choose what I want out of the message she's not doing that she's saying I value it all I want it she becomes one with it amen let me just say it this way the message of the last days reveals Christ and Christ is the head so what is the message it has revealed the fullness of Christ message is not a movement to me the message is not just a bunch of group of churches the message of the last days to me has revealed our head Jesus Christ what he wants what he desires how to live what this Bible says restoration of the true interpretation of this word of God it's all that can you say amen and the bride submits under that headship by revelation if you can't pray for anybody else pray for me as a pastor and the true Ministers of the rest of the last days because the Antichrist spirit is getting more and more angry at me for preaching these things and me being under his headship and so I don't take it personal anymore because I know Satan's angry because at the preachers who preach the headship of this word and bring themselves under the headship and bring this church under the headship of the word we're going to keep preaching the message of the last days and you don't experience it but many times it's like rubbing a cat's fur the wrong way while you're preaching somebody starts to squirm you know and it doesn't matter it just depends it gets their number one part of the word is corrective you know uh correction is another thing people run from today this generation does not want correction they react bad to it they don't want to be corrected but this word corrects the air this word corrects us and it takes somebody saying listen I'm willing if this is Christ correct to me in his word I'm willing to be corrected I submit to it but we live in a generation that they're not going to be corrected they're a victim if everybody is trying to correct them they're always a victim everybody's doing them wrong so you can imagine they don't take things too well from me because it's like that a cat being wrong the wrong way and so when I when I stroke that Pentecostal cap the other direction that gets angry when I stroke that Baptist starchy cat the other way it gets a little angry when I stroke that intellectuals and I hit on that through the word and I talk about Paul who was the most intellectual teacher and learned in man and I want to remind you when he came to the message of his day he said I had to take all of my past learning in all my years in the seminaries and I had to forget it and count it all as dung in order to receive the message of the day God doesn't need your formal learning when he's got Revelation for you God doesn't need intellectuals and that's why the word will correct intellectuals that's not going to get us into the kingdom so you rub that intellect before the people get mad you run those in modest girls and immodest guys might as well say guys you rub that you read some quotes and scriptures and you rub that cat the wrong way and they get swirmy squirmy and they get mad at you you rub that Pride the wrong way you rub those Jezebels running their homes and husbands you you rub that manipulative cat that's manipulating everybody in their home and their lives and you become the one man in their life that won't be manipulated by them and they don't like you they're manipulating everybody else but they're not manipulating me or the word and they don't like it they get angry there's this cat you know and brother Brahm says I remember in Tulsa Oklahoma there was an awful mess there with all them denominations and preachers and this is Oklahoma's Tulsa it's probably around Oral Roberts and different ones you know and it's just a big mess and they were fighting and I was sitting in the building and I got a vision and I I had a vision it was a pretty little old kitten and he was laying on the silk pillow and he was the cutest little fella I walked over there and I'm afraid of a cat I went over there and I began to rake him and he was going you know how they do when they make that funny noise you know and I was raking him and just patting pretty little kitty and he said purr just as fine you know and I looked over behind his pillow and it said his name and it said Pentecostal kitten well I thought now isn't that strange and I said this has got to be a vision now that I'm in and something said as long as you rake his fur this way he's all right but now if you want to see what he's made out of rake his fur backwards correct his Pentecostalism that's not based upon the word and so he said when you do that he said reckon so I raked his fur back and then my eyes stuck out you know how cats are green and he was a monster standing there spitting at me as hard as he could what made him angry his fur got rubbed the wrong way see Jake's rake his fur back a little bit and I experienced that sometimes and I know you do too sit there and get angry with me angry with me and and uh he's preaching on me and I don't know why he has to get on those subjects and I don't know why he has to say that but these aren't my subjects I'm trying to go to the source of the core of the word of God and and thankfully nobody I founded this church so when I bring my Bible up I can take any Scripture in this Bible and take a text and preach it freely I'm glad to have that freedom tonight I don't have a denominational help telling me what to preach and I'm thankful for that and I have a deacon board that says preach it every word whatever you feel to preach preach it freely in the word of God I have a congregation many Souls that sang preach it even it takes to Hideout I've had people you know it takes the hide off my back tell it like it is if I'm starting to live in sin preach against the sin if I'm getting off track now not everybody's saying that in the congregation but thankfully we have some and I'm going to keep preaching it and if everybody's gone someday then I'll preach it to my wife at home and then she'll preach to me a little bit no just kidding just kidding I didn't mean to say that that slipped out but I realized the devil's getting more Angry not because of me but because the headship I'm under you realize when you come to the message of the last days Christ it's the head and you're actually submitting to a headship it's a headship it is and if you're under the wrong headship sometime in your life and you learn the wrong kind then you don't trust headship but you don't need to mistrust the headship of Jesus Christ the word you need to trust that headship and you bring your life underneath it and headship works this way husbands as long as you're under the headship of the word your headship at home goes a lot better because God doesn't endorse the authority and a man in first in his authority if he's not under the headship of the word himself can you say Amen so this works and because you know all this is by headship being submissive you know some of the reason I one of the reasons I come to church with my family is that I love the word of God I hunger for the word of God but another reason is I have a certain responsibility to the rest of the body of Christ it encourages everybody else if I'm here and so there's a submission that says I might be tired and I might have something else to do but there's a submission under this headset and say I'm going to make being at church a priority why because I'm submissive under that headship the Bible says don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together yeah is that what the Bible says so I read that and I can say well that doesn't apply to me or that's not important but no there's a certain submission that comes with being around the body of Christ it's not just you're an island but you're submissive to the rest of the body and the work of the Lord that's going on it's all in the headship of Jesus Christ and so just to end this tonight you know why the king got mad you know why the king got mad and got in a fury about the Hebrews it's because of how they answered saying we are not going to Bow God can Deliver Us from the fire if you put us in there but we are not going to Bow if God doesn't Deliver us if God if God delivers us praise be to God but if you throw us in there and God doesn't Deliver us we want to let you know we're still not bowing to this image praise the Lord they took a stand why did they take a stand because they had the revelation of the true headship and Nebuchadnezzar was asking them to come under a different headship it was pressure to come under a different headship and worship a different image and worship a different thing just like the image of the beasts of the last days he wants you to come under the Antichrist spirit and worship something different a new version of Jesus Christ a new version of Christianity but they said no we're not doing that we're not worse and so they would not bow to be swayed to worship at that image at the feet of that image that everybody wanted them to and this is what made Satan angry it was their revelation of who to worship it's the revelation of Truth who the true king was can you say Amen they refused to do it even if they died God raises up a people that are not afraid to die for this gospel God raises up young people that are not afraid to stand for the word of God and hold that Revelation in their heart he and then he goes heat up the furnace heat things up out of his Fury make it harder on them make it more scary and he thought by saying you know what I'm going to do I'm going to heat this up seven times hotter and he thought he's looking for a reaction from him and they're still just whatever you need to do but I'm going to heat it seven times hotter whatever you need to do it's kind of like Jesus said to Judas you're delaying this thing whatever you need to do go do it quickly if you're going to try to cause a stir in the church don't wait go ahead and do it manifest what's in your heart get it done that's what he said to Jesus whatever you need to do do it quickly let's get it over with heat it up seven times why don't you try 14 times hotter because it doesn't matter in light of my Revelation it doesn't matter heat it up before the Rapture let it heat up all it wants to and why am I not afraid not because I have the intellectual fortitude to stand here and save young people and save people's lives from the onslaught of the sexual perversion and everything and the in modest of these in modesty of this age I don't have nothing in me to keep people back from that but I've got a word and a holy ghost that'll keep people from it and I'm going to keep preaching it because that's our hope it's the token that kept the death angel away it's the token applied to the home and the front post of the door it's the Holy Ghost the token is the Holy Ghost and I've got that to preach to you and that'll be your protection in this lustful age can somebody say Amen praise the Lord I was going to talk about the sixth sea a little bit but I think you get the message tonight the reason that Satan is getting more and more angry and now just say to you is that you better be in the word you better be standing you better say God give me more Revelation what you what's the most thing you need to pray for not just the people that have cancer not just your your child that's sick pray for anything you can bring to God but you know what he said to pray for more than anything revelation every time you come to church every time you open the word don't just open the word say God drop drop a revelation in my heart pray for Revelation more than you've ever prayed for it because that's the only thing that will get you through the Wiles of the enemy if you already got it raise your hand I already got some Revelations but don't start praying stop praying for more God drop some more in my heart God give me more I'm gonna need it you're going to need it brother Johnny you're going to need it your family's gonna need it all of them you're going to need it next week two weeks from now a month from now things are going to change more pressure is coming what do we need I mean more Revelation Satan is becoming more Angry all the time and we're going to need it praise the Lord was I supposed to say brother Johnny that's what he was when he was two years old in my church I think his brother John now sorry about that bud appreciate his family being with us tonight Hallelujah all right I'm all done Hallelujah I just I like to make the devil more angry settled in my heart there's no fear if you're still in fear say Lord take away my fears perfect love cast out all fear we're in God's hands in this last days we're totally in his hands to Spring your life under that headship of the word young person I know I mentioned the young people a lot tonight I didn't have in my notes but I'm appealing to you bring your life under the headship of that word say God fill me with the oil you know you know what the problem is today people aren't even asking for the Holy Ghost they're not even seeking it and it's the only thing that will get you through this age I think we need some youth that know that they don't have it and they've got a desires the world in their heart you have to ask for the Holy Ghost you have to seek it nobody's even asking for it nobody's even seeking it Where'd you say last time where's the last time I had a prayer line or had someone up for prayer the very few times somebody says they have needs I pray for those needs it's been a long time since I said I'm seeking the Holy Ghost for the Paul and I need you to pray that I received the Holy Ghost you just don't hear it anymore and that's scary to me because that's our key that's our Escape out of here nobody's going out of here without the Holy Ghost the oil that's our Rapture out of this place we need it more than we ever needed if you've been filled you need to be refilled re-baptized with it fill me with thy Holy Spirit fill me with the love of the Lord can you say Amen Hallelujah can you stand with me and pray tonight God bless you let's give the Lord handclap a praise to him to the Lord the name of the Lord is strong tower Hallelujah the name of the Lord is a strong time the righteous running and they are saved the name of the Lord a strong Town yes it is the righteous running Hallelujah [Music] blessed me name of the Lord oh blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] yes blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord I know the song I want to sing tonight before we pray together before we leave greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world Satan's like a roaring lion roaming to and fro but we're not afraid of them let them get more Angry can you say Amen but greater is he that is in me that he is in the world that's probably a little higher than that one Satan's like a roaring light roaming to and from seeking whom he may divide the Bible tells me so many Souls have been his prey to Falling some weekend but my God has promised us today it is over coming back greater is he that is in need greater is he that is in the Hallelujah greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world on the day of Pentecost a rushing Mighty Wind who into the upper roof and baptized all of Amen with the power greater than any Earthly fall and I'm so glad I've got it too I'm gonna let the whole world know amen greater is he that is he that is in me greater is he that is in me then he that is in the world Satan's like a roaring line roaming to and for yes he is seeking whom he may divide [Music] but my God has promised us to Hallelujah aren't you glad for his power tonight Hallelujah the Raider is he that is in me waiter is he that is he that is in me then he that is it one more time sing it now that Revelation that's inside Hallelujah the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it [Music] greater is he that is in me then he that is in the world Amen can you say Amen to the word of God Amen greater is he that's in you and there's two parts to overcoming recognizing the devil at
