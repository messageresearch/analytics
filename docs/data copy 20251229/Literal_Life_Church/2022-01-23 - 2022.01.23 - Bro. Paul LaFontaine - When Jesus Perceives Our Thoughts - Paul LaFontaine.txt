========================================

see amen this morning we're going to read together in the scripture if you have your bibles we're going to read in luke chapter 5 if you would join with us and thank you brothers for playing and thank you for the special and just bringing us into the presence of the lord and we are depending and trusting on him the snow may be beautiful but up in newfoundland they call it the devil's dandruff i don't know if they call it that in edmonton or not brother from detroit here but they call it the devil's dandruff and sometimes he tries so hard to interrupt things even though it's pretty but so but we're not backing down this morning we're here the lord's here and when he's present then many wonderful things can take place if your heart is open to him amen praise the lord luke chapter 5 and verse 17 if you would luke chapter 5 and verse 17 and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of galilee and judea and jerusalem and the power of the lord was present to heal them how many want to believe this morning that the power of the lord is present to heal them and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with palsy and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went up upon the housetop and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the mist before jesus and when he saw their faith he said unto them man thy sins are forgiven thee and the scribes and the pharisees begin to reason of course uh and so i want to elaborate this morning on our thought life and thoughts and so now i want you to notice the scenario of something happening here that is very strange very out of the ordinary and actually would uh provoke many thoughts from everybody in that room everybody outside of course the pharisees and sadducees are going to be critical but i think it would provoke different thoughts from everybody in that room as they watch the tiles being torn off the roof and somebody with so much faith wanting to get near jesus is willing to tear the roof apart and be and be lowered down in front of jesus i like that kind of faith but that kind of faith provokes a lot of uh critical thoughts especially from pharisees and so this this this is what god gave me to bring in the channel of this thought about our thought life and what we think about the scribes and the pharisees begin to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone but jesus but when jesus perceived their thoughts so this is things that was they were thinking it wasn't they weren't saying it they were thinking it but when jesus was present he knew what they were thinking so i'm letting all of you know whether it's me or you or whoever it is jesus this morning knows what you're thinking there isn't any thought that's hidden from him when jesus perceived this which is the scripture that the prophet used many times to show what shadow of ministry god was speaking through in the last days again under the son of man and that was he knows the secrets and thoughts intents of the heart so he used this because if jesus did this before he can do it again and he used this that jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto them what why what reason ye in your hearts whether it is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk and that ye may know that the son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins he said unto the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise take up thy couch and go into thy house and he immediately he rose up before them took up the wherein he lay and departed into his own house glorifying god and they were all amazed and they glorified god and were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things today hallelujah jesus likes to do strange things to the human mind and when he wants to do strange things we should let him do strange things if it brings victory if it brings healing if it brings deliverance then let god do what he wants to do can you pray with me lord jesus we commit this service to you today we pray that lord everything that you have given us lord that you would be able to help us to deliver it to the people we pray father that our lives will be up on the potter's wheel this morning we pray that you take it as the great potter and mold us and make us better for your kingdom make our thinking better make our hearts better lord and i pray the fires of your holy spirit would just be here and lead us and guide us this morning and bless every heart that had to stay home today lord limit it because of the weather i pray you'll bless them fill that entire house with the presence of the lord i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ lord we already know that you're here we know that you blessed us we know lord that you've received i believe you've received our worship this morning because we've sought to enter in and let you know the depths of our hearts now father i pray that you'll help this minister to get out of the way lord and speak those things that are anointed and needed father a word in season for your people i pray father that you'll bring the answer lord to the questions in the people's minds i pray lord that you will bring deliverance over a mind that's struggling i pray that you'll break down the barriers and strongholds of the of our enemy and lord that you will break through any barrier lord we commit it to you and we believe that you're able to do it we commit every word into your hands now lord bless those as we see brother rowell's church today blessed with a new pastor they voted him in this morning we're thankful lord that the holy ghost is leading the church and when you take some like brother charles spencer and these great warriors brother rowell lord that you're you're you don't leave the church behind but you bring up the new generation lord and you're inspiring new ministers to take the bride on to the coming of the lord thank you bless brother rowell's church lord may they settle down now lord after such a many months of praying and and the cove and all these other things they've been dealing with father i pray you'll bless this church may they settle into just bringing that word and made many mighty miracles take place lord and lives god made the mission work continue there god we just pray for these needs around the world so many things lord and we're burdened for them i pray that you'll bless everyone that's gathering unto the the true word of god today wherever it may be lord we're looking for a rapture lord we're looking for rapturing faith and we know lord when we sit in places like this lord the potential is in your word to bring us rapturing faith lord break every stronghold in our minds and hearts and minister to every being this morning as we commit our lives to you and lord we're glad to be here we're glad to be listening even the person who listens just hears it is blessed lord may we not just be a hearer only of the word today but let us be a doer of the word by faith rising up applying the word lord to our lives we commit it to you in the name of jesus christ for your glory amen amen once you shake somebody's hand as your take your seat this morning god bless you each one now we want to deal with another avenue of the subject of our thought life and i trust you all be listening good this morning and listening intently and uh we don't we we'll see how long we'll go because we want to leave time for special prayer and i believe we have a subject that we've been speaking of of our thought life and i believe with all my heart saints that we can't preach about our thought life enough i could probably take the next year and keep talking about it and preaching about it i believe it's very important the reason i believe it's important to talk about what you're thinking every day and what you're thinking even right now i believe it's important because i believe this is a key to greater faith and greater victory and i am convinced that satan hates it when ministers expose things like how the mind works and things like how satan comes into our thoughts i'm convinced that satan is very much upset and satan does not like ministers to talk about your thought life because this is the area satan wreaks havoc so much it's in your thought life it's the hidden world it's the private world it is the world nobody sees but god but it is a world satan can attack you in and so this is the part that's why satan of course being the the creature or the being that likes to keep everything hidden he doesn't like to be exposed and because your thought life is is hidden and is is private and no one else can see it that's why satan uses it because you can hold things and we know from the scripture your thoughts certain thoughts can bind you and satan loves to bind and so he doesn't like this type of preaching and talking about these things and i'm certainly i know that our enemy this morning did not like it all the way back when brother brown preached the greatest battle ever fought as he dealt with our mind and our spirit and that we're a three-part being and that satan gets in these realms of emotions and see taste feel smell and hear and memory imagination conscience affection reasoning as he explored how satan and one minister told me this week i appreciated that that brother branham and god through the prophet was teaching sons and daughters of god how to go to battle in the last days and because the battle will be in the mind he's teaching us how to go to battle in the battle of the mind and not just to battle but to win he preached that so sons and daughters of god can win the battle over the mind can you say amen so this is important and so i came to this text of jesus perceiving their thoughts and uh when you talk about the uh the subject or this part of jesus that can discern the thoughts and can know what you're thinking i i thought about it yesterday and i was thinking how it's it seems to me and i could be wrong but it seems to me that this part of jesus that can discern your thinking and discern your thoughts is not preached about a lot in the christian realm this part of jesus is actually hardly ever spoke of in christian realms we hear so much about jesus especially in christianity we talk about all the facts of the facets of jesus we talk about becoming more like jesus we talk about jesus and his miracles we teach our children sunday school stories of what god did in jesus and when he lived on this earth for three and a half years and so much as jesus of jesus has talked about but when you think about there's not a lot of messages about jesus knowing our thoughts back then he perceived their thoughts and if he can do that back then he can do it this morning because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and no man no denomination has a right to say he did it back then but he can't do that now jesus is the same in the service this morning as he ever was and if he knew their thoughts within a moment back then then he knows your thoughts now but it's not preached about a lot this part of jesus is not preached about and thank god for the message of the hour who brought this part of jesus back to life again and showed us this is the part of jesus that's very important to us and very important to the kingdom of god that jesus knows your thoughts because we know if jesus can know your thoughts jesus can correct your thoughts and you can get the right thoughts in your mind the right mental attitude towards any promise of god will bring it to pass you can't say i got the holy ghost and ignore your thought life you can't say i got the holy ghost and ignore what you're thinking every day you can't have the holy ghost and ignore what you're thinking right now so our thought life has to be in line with our soul i said our thought life has to be in line with our soul or we're going to struggle so this part of jesus and and thankfully this part was was raised to our attention through the last day's message again and uh it is so significant it is mostly the message that has shown this vision realm of jesus that jesus could see a vision and in a moment's time he could see by vision what the thoughts of the of the person was we see this in the four gospels and we see uh see it displayed but it has been talked about so now we see that he quickly could tell what people were thinking and he could speak it he could expose it and the reason why this side of jesus is revealed to us today and brought back to us is because the son of man is going to repeat itself again and we would see a very unique ministry repeat itself as jesus said it would when the son of man reveals himself in the last days i'm all on the bible now for those who are listening in and those anybody who who uh maybe has not heard these things before i'm right in the bible because jesus prophesied and said in in the last days when it's the coming of the son of man when it's the days like sodom and gomorrah when it's a days like noah's day he will repeat as son of man again son of man is prophet son of man is discerned and a prophet can discern through god now not in himself but he can discern the thoughts and intents of the heart he could tell you exactly in a moment's time what you're thinking he could tell you what your doctor said to you last week he could tell you 20 years ago what happened in your life in a moment's time and he did it jesus did it by vision he could see it can you say amen it wasn't a guessing game it was by vision and so when when uh jesus began then when in the last days when we see this repeated again the reason why this side of jesus is revealed to us is because the son of man repeats again that it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever in all aspects it is wrong to say he is not the same in every aspect if any denomination has taught you that he's not the same in every aspect then that denomination has deceived you because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's the same in every aspect say well why don't i see things in my particular church because it takes faith to believe that jesus can do what he did in the past it takes believers to say i just simply believe it i don't have to go through all kinds of teaching about it he said it he can do it again and i just have simple faith i just believe you can do it and i believe it whether i see it or not i believe he can open up a blind man's eyes whether i ever see it or not but we have seen it and we do see it i believe he heals cancer whether i ever see it or not but friends we have too many testimonies that say otherwise blessed be his name so it takes believers to believe it and so now uh so so i'm just going to move on from that so now this part of jesus being real and this part of jesus of course being real to us in knowing the thoughts it's important and it always has been there in other words there's an element that came through jesus that really has always been there even though you have a unique gift in a prophet that can see by vision certain things we know that this element is always among us because and if you're listening and you want bible for it hebrews quotes and says the word of god the word of god not not just your bible when you think of the word of god not just your written bible that's just a written bible to help us but the word of god the person of christ because jesus is the word the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing to the dividing of sunder of soul and spirit and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart so really this has really never left the church if the word is present jesus the word then he knows the thoughts and it may enable us better if there's a prophet there that can see it by vision and we say my that would be great your faith would probably build if we had the prophet and he could have you up and he could tell you and say i know what the doctor said to you this week and he verbatim word for word tells you what the doctor said and then he tells you your house number and he doesn't know you but he tells you exactly what you're thinking just even in this service he starts to go through and tell you what you were thinking 10 minutes ago in the thought that came to your mind and all of a sudden when that happens and we would our faith would be you know what your faith would be saying this is real jesus christ is among us it would sober us up it does a lot of things it sobers us up that god's real this isn't just church this isn't just not a a beautiful place god has given us and i'm not just filling my time and putting and punching the clock to be here for church no no wait a minute wait a minute this is real he's here so everything changes when he's here so now our faith would build to be able to get out of our thought life and get out of our doubts and get out of our criticalness to say i don't care about all that he's here he knows my life he knows what my burdens are and if he's here he can bring deliverance for it that's what that kind of faith builds you say well i wish i could see it that real but didn't he say to thomas thomas i'll i'll let you touch my side but i want you to know blessed is he who has not seen and yet believes blessed is that brother and sister who just hears that he can do that blessed is them who who in simple faith believe it they don't try to figure it out they don't let their mind go through a whole process just simple faith i believe he's here i believe he can do anything and that's actually what god's looking for so time after time and you can raise your hand where it's happened to you where they say brother paul were you [Music] at our dinner table last night i know you weren't but were you in the next room did you hear what we discussed the whole evening because you preached a lot of that this morning word for word brother paul were you in our car this morning on the way to church i hear it all the time you know some ministers maybe that don't have the character would start saying man i must really have something here i don't have nothing brother barry sent me a quote yesterday it says we preachers we really don't even preach we call ourselves preachers no no we don't preach god preaches to his people you're saying about me do you think i'd ask unless you know what you talked about in your car on the way to church some of you certainly don't want the preacher in the car on the way to church but god's there god's there hears every conversation and not just conversations the very thoughts the intents of the heart this is the kind of jesus that we serve and it doesn't scare me it doesn't make me afraid i've come years ago to an open life before him like this and whenever i begin hiding something i know i can't hide it but when i try to hide something it never goes good when i try to hide this little thing let's do this years ago with my family to see if this will work every time i try to hide something god exposes it no that's you can't do that this is where this goes you let your kids watch that this is what they become so this wonderful work of the lord convicting me and exposing things i'm used to it now and i'm i'm all open all arms to it you don't scare me when you come and you have criticisms and things to say to me if i'm off the word i want to know about it if you have something to say i'm not going to it's not going to be the end of the world if you come to me because why i'm open if it's the lord correcting through you i want to hear it if it's just your carnal mind criticizing i'm okay with it as well at the end of the day other decisions might be made i don't know but listen we've got to grow to maturity to quit being afraid when god exposes what we're thinking because that's that's the message we're under right if we've been back in the days of the prophet we would have seen we wouldn't walk into a service like this and you realize there's nothing that you can hide there isn't a thought within a moment and he's looking back and saying now i caught that thought back there i caught what you just thought and now you can't hide that right now how many know the message to know that's what he was doing and how many knows that no human being could do that it had to be gone using a human being but what a service to be in when it's like oh my goodness wow i just thought that two seconds ago and he picked it up what in the world's going on what an atmosphere god was perceiving their thoughts when jesus perceive their thoughts so now our story here uh let me just say this first why does this part of jesus get ignored satan likes it when things are hidden in our thought life that's keeping you from more faith because men can hold thoughts what kind of thought so i pray the lord can just help me elaborate through what he wants to say this morning because there's so much to say about what we're thinking about all the time it can be good it can be bad it can be critical it can be hesitance of preachers it can be i'm never going to fully give my heart to that and that stronghold holds your thoughts so many things it's so important to talk about because we can hide things in our thought life men can hold thoughts of unbelief how many know you can hold thoughts of unbelief men can and women can hold thoughts of fear you can hold on to your fear men can hold thoughts as i know more than everybody else and i've i've read more books and i'm educated even if you've been educated in a seminary the problem with that is you build your life on a foundation of education and i heard the prophet say the other day education's fine but why always watch where education leads you without god education without god makes you proud and a know-it-all and will explain god away men can hold thoughts of unbelief that men can hold thoughts and i know better than everybody else men can hold thoughts that i am better than everybody else my family's better we're just a notch above the rest that's why it's hard for them to co-exist and connect with people because at the end of the day they're kind of here and the other family's here all that happens in the thought world you never say something like that to somebody most of you but if it's in the thought then you wonder what's going on here what's going on well they think they're better they just think they're better why can't they fellowship with anybody else because they just think they're better that's all there is to it the devil is going to get mad this morning men can hold thoughts of their church background i've always been a baptist i've always been a methodist and they can that background can hold you from going on with the word of god that church background warned you stay away from people like that stay away from people who believe in prophets stay away from do you see that thought is holding you from looking at the bible purely can you say amen all these other thoughts it's those thoughts that quench the spirit of god from moving in your life thoughts can quench the spirit and so this in this incident where we find that it's a great provoking of critical thoughts let me just deal with this just a minute so we have a house that's full of people it's packed full they're waiting on the outside nobody can get in and so now this incident where the man with seth's face gets on top of the house with all of his friends maybe he couldn't do it very easy they had to help him and they start tearing the roof apart and they open up an opening and they lower this man right in front of jesus i i just wonder the thoughts that were going on i know what the the pharisees were thinking but everybody this provokes all kinds of thoughts like what in the world don't tell me you people wouldn't be thinking it very strange if if you started to hear noises we're not packed but they started hearing noises and they couldn't get in so they're tearing the roof apart and i keep preaching and they're lowering somebody to be prayed for right in front of the pulpit don't you tell me that all these thoughts would be come up to you you just can't get around it and you're watching it for the you know thought that's just really stupid never seen this happy before their thought is this in church order that's a thought can somebody go back to the library and get a cod book and let's let's look this up a lot of message people are going that this is completely off a church order i mean last sunday gideon went over 30 minutes on the song service and that's out of church order he went over 30 prophet said 30 minutes get on the word brother tell you all the time is this somebody get a code but let's check this it's like they're coming down thoughts thoughts can't they just do it this way can't they do it and yet your thoughts your thought is completely ignoring what's really happening god's fixing to do something your thoughts have ignored the faith of this man your first thought as a believer should say i'm i'm gonna something's happening here and i'm gonna lay aside my critical thoughts because something's going on i'm not gonna be critical i'm gonna start praying for a man who's willing to tear the roof off of this house and that's why i'm teaching you to correct your thoughts quit being critical quit jumping to the first thought of being critical of other people and every other thing why don't you step back and say now wait a minute i'm bringing my thoughts in line with the word god may be doing something here that person is sitting here in the service and they're not dressed right and they don't look right and they got earrings hanging from the ear whatever they got don't you dare let your thoughts quench the spirit of god for a hungry soul that's starting to search for him don't you dare criticize them don't you dare jump all over them don't you dare meet them in the back door and criticize them you pray that the holy spirit will draw that heart because their problem is more than their earrings that's not the real problem the problem is that god that's a living god a kid needs access to that life and soul and when he does he will do the work because we're not sending people on to heaven just trying to get their earrings off trying to send them in with no birth they can't get in without a birth real birth and personal relationship with jesus christ this person that's so real that i met when i was 16 years old i met him he's invisible but i met him they need to meet this person of the message the business the message the person of the message is jesus christ how many has met him this morning raise your hand i meant the person of the message that's why i love it so much it's not rules to me it's not just god's center prophet it's not that it's christ my living savior don't your thoughts and here here's this scenario and so that you could think all kinds of things and we know what the pharisees said jesus says and i'm not so sure friends that jesus didn't he had this in his mind before the foundation of the world i'm not so sure that jesus doesn't allow strange things to happen to provoke and to let you see where your thought life is i'm not so sure that sometimes i don't preach out of the ordinary or some minister gets out of the order or says something or something's done to provoke and to bring up to let you see how critical your thoughts can be sometimes and that you're not willing to say i'm going to pray i'm not going to be critical i'm not going to let my thoughts go on and on and on and on but i'm going to pray something different has happened it's out of my it's out of my comfort zone it's out of the norm it's out of the box and i'm i'm gonna just watch and pray what's going on here so he did that and it was it was my my father preached this text over and over again when we traveled as children and you remember the title of this sermon sharon and ike and sherry ike's they're not here but you know what he titled it and i heard it preached a million times every church he preached the same sermons that's an evangelist you know it's like he had about i don't want to disrespect my dad today but there's about 20 sermons that's different than a pastor always coming up with something but you know sometimes you preach the same messages again and again and it's a blessing to people oh i heard this message you know he titled this text crazy faith but he wouldn't just say crazy he said i'm going to preach on today crazy faith if you want to know the title of my sermon it's crazy faith and then he would go like no other preacher could do and do this whole scenario of this guy tearing the roof and bringing it down in front of jesus and everybody critical and you know i'll never be able to preach it like he did but it was called crazy faith i guess he was eating some black preacher or something i don't know but that's so how he said it crazy faith and i watched over and over again as it built faith and the congregations were blessed can you say amen and i heard those sermons so much i could preach and myself verbatim today but you know what the scenario was it was crazy faith it was out of the box faith could it be that god wants us to have crazy faith could it be god wants us to get out of our box get past our thinking quit overthinking things quit trying to figure it out and just step out in simple faith i'm believing this i'm going with it could it be that god wants us to have this kind of faith as this man that i'm wanting to get there i'm wanting to get in the presence of jesus i'm i'm wanting to do this can you say amen crazy faith out of the box and here's what the prophet said of that incident he said and remember when the master stood there uh in pool of the bethesda he says remember when the master stood there and the pharisees even around him he said knowing their thoughts that's the reason i'm taking the way i am tonight there's people here i know your thoughts so he refers to luke chapter five that i read and the first quote there if you guys have it he says remember when the master stood there and the pharisees even around him he said knowing their thoughts that's the reason i'm talking the way i am tonight it's 1950. there's people here i know your thoughts and know what you're thinking about all right lady that nervous trouble that you had has left you and you're healed do you believe it god bless you you may you may go on your road rejoicing won't bother you no more let's say praise to praise praise to god there's not a thing in the building but what god knows just exactly what it is and the thoughts of your mind is made known to him and he will make his secrets known to his servants the prophets amos 3 7. do you know your bible amos 3 7. surely the lord god will do nothing except he revealeth his circus his secrets to his servants the prophets so going back to the quote and the thoughts of your mind is made known to him and he will make his secrets known to his servants is that right surely all right everybody have faith believe anything could happen where the lord's people are gathered [Applause] did i just read that quote that says you better bring your thoughts in line because anything could happen when our thoughts are in line and simply believing god can do this he goes on to say in 1951 in testimony all right bring the ladies sister before i look at you i want to come right you just come right around here come around here my back like this i ask some time i want you just to believe with all your heart so that someone know that say just you're just stuttering a bit there look you look at look you someone said you look them in the eye brother branham oh that does it you think i don't know what you're say that you're saying that oh yes i do yes i do it's not me it's our heavenly father he knew their thoughts and that's the reason we're covering this up now sister dear i'm not looking at your eye but i'm asking you something do you believe so just stop right there that's what's going on okay he brings the sister up to pray and somebody has a thought you're reading them by looking in their eye so the prophet intentionally says because you've thought that okay i'm gonna sometimes he put up maybe something in between them i would cover this up i turn my back to them and he's intentionally doing that why because he's catching the thoughts of the critical people so he's adjusting the service now let me just say this if you have believers there and their thinking is right he shouldn't have to adjust the service if there's simple faith but when there's thoughts of criticalism and say i don't know if i can trust this and i'm just here just look checking it out first when all that's there he has to go out of his way to counter that thought to say i'll turn my back to these people if i have to i'll walk over here i'll put a cover saw on my eyes not looking at them because why the thoughts the thoughts are affecting the service the thoughts are affecting the faith of the service now see i'm not looking in your eye but i want ask you something do you believe what i've told you is the truth all right you've been suffering with nervous trouble haven't you all right you've been suffering with nervous trouble haven't you all right go and be well jesus christ maketh thee whole go on and don't think no more about it just rejoice and be happy that that would seem like it's a little bit pretending but i don't believe it's pretending i believe you're taking a step of a little bit of faith to go on your way rejoicing and be happy not because you don't see all the results yet but because you just simply believe i'm coming out of this and it would be better to go on your way happy and rejoicing then sad and depressed god's going to work better with some faith that says i'm happy today i still got this sickness but it's going the devil's on the run i've been prayed for by holy ghost phil people i've got people praying for me and i don't see the results yet but you know what it's going i'm gonna overcome god can work with that a little better in that attitude than he can with the mully grubs go on your way happy and rejoicing i'm turning this way because they come up this side of the platform go on your way brother sister happy and rejoicing setting them in a certain pattern in a certain mood to receive their healing going your way just rejoice and be happy you're nervous it's a real nervous condition he never asked him to deny that it's real it's a real nervous condition i'd say there's some preachers that preach it that way that you know pretend it's not there and all these other things no he said it's a real nervous condition and you want to live a close life and satan's telling you you can't do it i'd say if i ask your hands you know this devil speaks to you as well that you're unworthy that you're unworthy and i want more of god and i want to be closer to god and the devil's telling you you can't i know that devil my heart is get closer to god every time i speak it the devil is just not trying to knock it out at every stage it's only believers that are saying that they want more of god it's only believers saying that she's the only group of people on the face of the earth the bride the true holy ghost is the only one saying i really want all of him so that's the devil that's who the devil's against but he says that satan's telling you you can't do it you go on and do it in the name of the lord jesus you do it in the name of the lord jesus our thoughts so so let's let's just look at it this way our thoughts is a whole other world than what we see even in a service like this our thoughts is a whole other world and god god came into that thought world god if we can say it invaded in these services and he continues to do it god wants to invade your thought life god knows the secrets of the hearts and so but god it's not just that he knows it but he wants to reveal it he wants to he wants to come into that and and uh he wants to he revealed to his prophet what was being thought and then sometimes the prophet would change the way he did the meeting because of critical thoughts why would god do this why would god allow the prophet to expose thoughts say i know what you're thinking you can't hide that thought right now that why would god want to do that to embarrass somebody to to why would god why doesn't god just do just do his work and leave the thought life and what's being thought in the service why don't he just leave that alone i'm probably asking more questions this morning than answering them for you but i like to ask these questions why is god doing this in our eyes god doesn't have to do this he doesn't have to embarrass somebody all of a sudden they're in the back row excuse me to the people in the back row and they're the furthest from the preacher and he says i just you just thought that just now and they're going oh i thought it would help to sit in the back row but if you went in your car if you went out to your car god knows your thoughts and to be sitting there and saying he just exposed but but would god do it to to embarrass somebody would god do it too it's to be convicting of course and it's to be but it's to but but why i'm asking the question why would god come into the thought life of a service and everybody's thought life and want to get into that realm of our thoughts and either have exposed or correct it why would he do it i'll tell you this is what god gave me it's because our thought life has the power to quench the spirit and to hinder the work of god [Music] he was hoping for a bigger more mysterious answer but that's it what you're thinking what you're thinking can hinder what i'm thinking can hinder in a moment if i get to a quote he's praying for somebody and he corrects them because there he says you've been thinking for days this and he corrects their thinking but then he corrects his own because he got critical standing there praying for somebody he says i don't understand why the person did this i'll get to in a minute he's correcting his own thinking and he says i'm sorry lord for thinking that thought the thought life's got to be corrected this is my series i'm preaching on it last sunday appreciate all the response but i'm going on with it because because it had such good response if we don't address what we're thinking every day and we're not willing to bring it every imagination under and casting down imagination every high thing that exalted itself above the knowledge of god you're going to be limited where you go with the lord and a service like this and as services can be limited by what thoughts you're bringing into the service because here we are and i wonder what it would be even in the last 30 minutes whatever i've been preaching i wonder if i've had to bring my belt up a couple times and because i'm losing weight and it falls a little bit i hate to say that in international video but my wife has to remind me and stuff but you know things can be distractions it's like i like this guy's preaching but why don't he fix his pants it would be interesting to know if god were just shh and somehow the tech crew could catch everybody's thoughts the last 30 minutes and put them up on both of these screens person by person starting with josiah cornette and there every thought he's thought not this week every thought he's thought the last 30 minutes would be displayed and then we'll go to brother ted and then we'll go to janus and then we just keep going sister lisa rebecca aubry hayley ryan i got everybody in a good spot right now i just feel like i got everybody into good have you ever thought about it you think about everything else have you ever thought about this [Applause] so so maybe you can go back we don't have the technology this morning i'd love to do it just for the fun of it but we don't have the technology but i can tell you there's something greater than technology in the service today that's her heard in heaven louder than your words heard every thought that you thought so how does it has the power to change a service well yeah if it's not a simply believing what the man is preaching if it's the word and just simple faith and you're not able to shut out gotta quote them and it says we need to need to shut out all the other thoughts i wonder if you put it on the screen if you start going through people you thought about your schedule this week you thought about that hunger pain you feel in your stomach and what's for lunch i know josh and i my son-in-law and i we have those thoughts he he's worse than me because he only thinks about he's hungry but he has to think through where he's going to eat because that's important i eat anywhere that they take me he's got to think it through so i wonder josh i better leave him alone i like him to allow me to see my grandbaby and i don't want to hinder that thoughts i'm just going to go ahead and say this to you there are some people that are still coming to this church and you have resentful thoughts towards somebody else in the church they've done you wrong or something happened 10 years ago somehow two years ago and you hold that thought and i'm here to tell you that there's a place to take those things to forgive but when you bring it to church sometimes i don't even know why people come because they've got all these critical thoughts of everybody else and some people they're looking for something they're looking just looking for a reason to leave the church or something i don't know and brother brahma said this way if you come finding fault you will find it you're gonna find fault we're not perfect we're broken people somebody's gonna say something that they shouldn't say sometimes somebody's gonna say something in the flesh somebody's going to get a little too much anger and even a holy ghost-filled person can step in the flesh and say something they shouldn't say you know why i know they can do it because you do it yourself it's okay get quiet all you want to but i'm going to say this a lot of times we bring this to you and then we expect god oh lord come down praise the lord and your whole thought life is filled with resentment towards people in the church and i say you need to hit an altar and say god purge me of this resentment of this brother and sister they are a brother they are a sister i i may not know them very well but it's not right for me to continue having these thoughts towards them i can show you a bible for it i can show you bible it's wrong to hold on to resentment and bitterness towards somebody who said something wrong against your family and you circle the wagons don't you be doing that buster is that christianity i might as well go on and say it you got something wrong then your first phone call is to you usually and i'm trying to teach you now is not to you not to someone else not to unload on somebody you scripturally the bible says you're if you have an all or they have it all against you you're supposed to go to that brother and that sister this isn't politics this isn't your your local school this is the house of god and though you may not think anybody's got the holy ghost there's some people here with the holy ghost and you're in the kingdom supposed to go to that person not one of your children not not wanna you can go to a deacon and that's fine but listen ultimately if you're acting mature i've got this all and i'm gonna go to that person because they are a brother they are a sister but instead instead of resolving it you unload on somebody else and then you hold that okay that's it you hold that thought you don't think i'm preaching to myself sometimes this week i admit it publicly and i don't do it to be proud i'm just saying i made a huge mistake this week oh well i better not say huge because people will be wondering what it is i'll just i'll tell you what it is i i got in the flesh and i got really i don't know if it was my righteous righteous indignation or just my human anger it doesn't matter i had to apologize for it i was on the phone with another brother not from here and i just said this and i said something demeaning about another brother because i feel like he acted wrong and i said it to this brother and the moment i said it i knew i'd said the wrong thing i i just i called him a certain name to belittle him i did it and i felt so bad i actually feel still grieved in my spirit but i've made it right to them and i've made it right before the lord and that's what god said to do with it i'm just being transparent with you you know i'm preaching that sunday on your thought life and i was doing good until that happened and then i realized there you go buddy you got to bring it before the throne of grace you can't let that hide you can't hold that resentment to that brother and you got to make that right right now i thank god i got the holy ghost in me to make it right right now it wasn't just my conscience was bothered man there's something deeper that say you can't let that go and i want to tell all you people who believe in the holy ghost you can't let those things go you can't come to this church with prejudice and attitudes towards other people that said something they have to grow you have to grow there has to be a forgiving heart to say i'm gonna not let that be my dominant thought because you know why you can never feel full freedom when you come to this church you can never worship freely if you hold thoughts in your mind against someone else you can't be totally free you will always be arms linked you will always be hesitant to give your full heart you'll always be that why where's it going on it's your thoughts binding you up i didn't expect to be so plain today but i pray it's in it's in the holy spirit's leadership to teach us you can't hold thoughts in a service or at home you can't do it you can't do it you can't let the holy spirit be free in your life every thought whether it's a dirty thought whether it's a filthy thought whether it's a resentment thought if it's not of god as we said last sunday you have the security and that thought has to go through security i remember how many kids remember what i did last sunday with solomon and gideon every thought has to come through security and be checked that's what the bible says like at our airports because we had a 911 and after 9 11 then we get security and everyone's got everybody it's got to pass through every thought has to pass through security before it lodges in our mind if we hear a beep beep beep beep beep beep you don't you don't let him go through you don't let that thought go through resentment towards a brother or belittling or i don't believe i don't believe this miracle is for me i don't believe healing's for me it must be for everybody else you can't let that thought into your mind that's it buddy you're out don't get too good get on the plane this is the plane that only has passengers of the thoughts of god that's it it's over this incident with jesus let us know he perceived their thoughts and it was a crazy incident but i want you all to so just try to find a moment here and we'll finish the rest of this wednesday night i want to be mindful of the faith in your hearts building because that we're at a moment that we have some not talking about anybody specific but we have some mental emotional maybe financial some soul struggles internally in the thought life going on and i don't teach this just as a teaching i teach it so the believers can bind together to pray today for one another even if you're listening from our congregation online we're going to bind together and pray and we say lord we want to see an end to the devil's wreaking havoc on our sisters minds and our brother's minds and i'm just asking you to join with me in a few minutes do you believe if i pray for you and the ministers pray for you do you believe you can be healed it's not more any more complicated than that that's right do you know how many times the prophet said have your pastor pray for you and he kept doing that because remember he got into everybody had to come he had to be the prophet had to be him lay hands on him so he discouraged that he kept mentioning tons of quotes my wife took them up one time you get your pastor to pray for you lay hands on you you get your pastor to pray for you if you believe that i laid my hands on you this morning do you believe you can be healed amen you believe it's not me but you believe god can honor his word and if you're sick this morning or if there's someone sick at home covet whatever it may be do you believe if we pray this morning do you believe that person can be healed do you believe he can be healed of mental problems do you believe that if i pray and lay hands on you and the other ministers in this church do you believe you can be healed it's true our thoughts as a whole our thoughts as a whole another world
