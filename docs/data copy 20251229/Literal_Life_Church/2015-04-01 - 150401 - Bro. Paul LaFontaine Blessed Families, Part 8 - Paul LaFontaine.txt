========================================

jesus took him all away jesus took them all away and he heard thank you lord amen love him so much tonight appreciate his presence in our lives let's turn if you would to joshua chapter 22 and i would like to say uh thanks to those who helped put together sunday's gathering fellowship it was a great time and we appreciate sister margaret arranging the food and all that appreciate mark i think helping with her coordinate the cleaning and everything up after and before all the guys and girls that helped him we just appreciate it so much everything just went so smooth and most of all just the time to bond a little bit i really enjoyed that and also just to get closer some have been desiring that so it's just a great time to do it and i just appreciate those times of fellowship uh matter of fact in in light of that i just i was thinking if we didn't have a youth meeting this friday which we don't we just have it every other week we don't have one this friday right brother jared i think i think it's next week so those who want to gather friday night um my wife and i usually if we have it open we go to cracker barrel friday nights i wasn't inviting you there but i was saying after that you know if you wanted to gather at the church here we'd do some just some singing and also just uh i thought we listened to that that day at calvary it's a little less than an hour that the message brother preached that day at calvary because this is good friday and commemoration of that and uh so maybe about 7 30 here for those who want to come out and i'll serve lord supper after that after we listen to listen to that service we'll just have uh i'll have that prepared and we'll serve the lord's supper to those who want to come friday night and just do what jesus said that he said to remember my death and remember what he done we're looking forward to the resurrection sunday can you say amen to commemorate that and to certainly means more to us than an easter bunny can you say man matter of fact has nothing to do with an easter bunny or easter eggs but we we hold in our hearts the real meaning to it and so you're welcome to invite those to come sunday with you as well and to be a part of the service but those who want to come out i thought we'd do that friday i know um i think ike is gathering with a few of the ones of the musicians a little earlier than that here but we'll just do that about 7 30 somewhere there on friday night 7 30 and those who want to come out or certainly will listen to that message is a great message a prophet preached on that day at calvary what it means to us and what he's done for us through that and what it means to us today and how we are thankful for god's sacrifice that he made for you tonight that has to become real to you without it without that that act of our our lamb uh we just wouldn't have any hope for uh for anything eternal can you say amen and him to taking care of the sin question in our life settling this in question and each of us have to have that settled if he hadn't went to calvary there would have been no victory for us that way so we'll just remember that those who want to join us with us we'll do that i'm going to read in joshua chapter 22 and this is a portion of scripture here i'm just going to continue on families blessed families part 8 but this is a portion of scripture i've been pondering on for several weeks and moving through the scriptures and talking about the different areas that talk about families and how families are blessed i wanted to i've been just looking at this didn't preach on it yet there's a certain section of scriptures here in joshua 22 that's been a bit mysterious to me and just been praying about it so we may we may not get to all of it tonight next wednesday we can pick it up but i wanted to see what let you know what i was thinking why i was pondering this set of scriptures so i'd like you to just think deeply with me if you would and read together in joshua 22 and verse 24 and of course some of you may not know the setting of what this is here at the end of joshua's life as the tribes have all come into their promised land and their inheritance and i might say that if you read through joshua you would see how many times the word families is mentioned because all the inheritance is divided down to heads of tribes the tribes and then down to families each family had some a portion that god had given them and rode out for them and that they had to go and fight and take that i think that's neat because i think every family has a unique thing that god wants to do through their family matter of fact i encourage every family to pray together if you're a small family or big family whatever if you're one in your family you should all pray and say lord what have you put me on earth to do and what do you want my family to accomplish for the kingdom of god god's given you a portion of himself to fulfill in this age and i think that should just be a priority you see that all through the book of joshua's the families and the just find their inheritance and settle down in it and fight for it and it's just a wonderful picture but we'll just start here in verse 24 and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing if we have not done rather done it for fear of this thing saying in time to come your children might speak unto our children saying what have ye to do with the lord god of israel for the lord hath made jordan a border between us and you ye children of reuben and the children of god ye have no part in the lord so this is the children of reuben the tribe of reuben the tribe of gad and they are speaking back to the rest of the tribes in an issue that they've addressed and they're giving an answer as to why that they are setting up an altar that's what they had done they they were not in the promised land but now they were asked by joshua to go back because originally they were supposed to be on this side of jordan they weren't supposed to come into the promised land they didn't want to come into the promised land and so now joshua says to head back and when they head back they set up this altar but the principle in scripture is when god sets up one altar there's only one provided place of worship that types today there's only one place that every man can come that's the place that worship is received and that's under the shed blood of jesus christ that's the only place that's not accepted anywhere else except under his shed blood when you have that principle when somebody begins building an altar another altar besides the one god's chosen everybody got really upset about it and this was their answer verse 24 again and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing this is why we set up this altar it's out of fear and saying in time to come to your children might speak unto our children and say what have you to do with the lord of israel for the lord hath made jordan a border between us and you ye children of reuben and you children of god ye have no part in the lord so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the lord therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar not for burnt offering and not for sacrifice we weren't we weren't replacing the altar of god we weren't bringing it for any sacrifice so notice an altar now without sacrifice but that it may be a witness between us and you and our generations after us that we might do the service of the lord before him with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your children may not say to our children in time to come ye have no part in the lord therefore said we that it shall be when they shall should so say to us or to our generations in time to come that we may say again behold the pattern of the altar of the lord which our fathers made not for burnt offerings not for sacrifices but it is a witness between us and you so now they give the answer here is the altar not for offering but for a pattern of the real altar an altar that looks like the real thing it looks like something that i want to have something that resembles it and that was their answer let's pray heavenly father lord bless the word tonight inspire it to his father we pray and we just pray that you received our hearts lord in our worship and praise to you i pray father that this teaching tonight would help us to understand how families can be blessed and how each one no matter how large or small they are but lord they can catch the revelation lord what it is to be a blessed family and lord jesus even our children here and young people here that will have family someday may they catch these nuggets lord may they catch these things by revelation for truly someday that they will get married they will have children and they'll be in charge of a home themselves oh i trust lord that they would have a home that honors god i trust that they would you'd put something in their hearts that someday when i have a they say someday when i have a home i want to have a home that honors jesus christ and lord put that vision in their heart and may they catch these nuggets i pray we just commit this service to you and all that's said in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you shake somebody's hand before you take your seat tonight god bless you each one for coming out now it's just been looking at these scriptures many weeks and looking at this desire to put up an altar for the purpose of uh in future generations that their children uh would not be made fun of and their children would not come in contact with the children that were in the promised land and they they uh were persecuted in a certain way or maybe put down and what part have you with us in other words are you a part of us or are you not a part of us and so i was looking at saying it just seems like the right thing it seems so right and even after they said this to the rest of the tribes they said we're fine with that we're pleased with that you're not setting up another divisive altar somewhere else for people to be swayed to or worship at another altar but you seem to be doing this for the right reasons and at all face value it seems like uh that's why it's such a mysterious set of scriptures even up to today just looking at it it just seemed like especially with the tribe saying this is such a pleasing thing this is a this is fine this is no problem to have this altar just as a pattern of the real altar it seems so right until the tribes even said well this is fine we're pleased with it that's fine so the families in these two and a half tribes are thinking of their children they're thinking of their kids now that in itself is not wrong i think that parents and families should be thinking of the children i think when they teach their children everything we do as parents we should be thinking of not just the present but the future we have to have a multi-generational vision we have to be looking to the seeds that we're planting in our children can you say imagine uh we have to we have to think in terms of not even the correction we give having the correction with the teaching to not just correct but to get especially as they get older to show why we're correcting why what's the principle behind the correction why they want to know some days especially when they get young teens why am i being corrected like this why are you saying this to me why do we believe this way why why is that wrong or why is this right and so there's a there's a teaching that goes with it and uh to to be able to explain those things why because you're affecting the future decisions that are made when they're young can affect affect the future and every true parent should be looking at a child a lot of times it hits a lot of them they'll think uh they'll think very wild at life and they'll be wild themselves and do wild things and then they'll have some babies and some children and they'll come up but once they start to get a certain age then they start to think many times a lot more mature that wow my i got a kid here and they're going to go someday they're going to leave my hand someday and i've got a real responsibility here to set the direction of the way they would go i don't want my kid to be a a menace to society i don't want my kid to end up in jail you know i i want to give him a good life and so even even people out in the world different places they begin to think more mature that way we come in the realms of christians and believers then then we realize that it's even deeper than that we don't want to just make good kids for society but but there's a there's a goal in our lives and that is ultimately i want christ to be in my children and to be the center of their lives and whatever i can whatever environment i can provide them for the right church the right young people the right place the right teaching i want to expose them to all the best teaching i can give so that christ can come in their life and they can make him the center of their life and have the holy ghost can you say amen and so we think about the future that's thinking about the future it's not thinking about the present thing it's it's looking to the future i don't knock these parents here in these two and a half tribes thinking of the future and what their other children are going to make their other children feel like a lot of parents feel that way it's that how do i well you know you could really go into a subject right here of the whole thing of how parents um i got to say this right now i got to really say this right but this is really a good subject and i am not getting into it tonight but the whole subject of parents and wanting so much to make everything right for their kids and defending their children and when they get involved in other children sometimes my a lot you can see a lot manifest and come out of the parents not just the children and this is really good because they're talking about uh what happens if these my children get with these children they say things and well you better watch it sometimes certain things are said to your children because you know we're going to do certain things to make that right and do all this thing and there's a certain healthy protection over your children that all of us have that i have can you say amen uh but then there's there's an overboard i think the thing that takes place where you begin defending things that are completely wrong in your own children i had a parent tell me when i first started passing said my my your my kid is accused and said the other kid did this thing and it's acting like a um what they call it a pit bull they were calling another little boy in the church of pit bull and uh he's just acting that was the name they gave it i mean it's just this kid's out of control you know he's biting people and he's doing things behind the scenes that he shouldn't be doing and he was the kid was i wouldn't call him a pit bull this was a good brother and sister and i didn't want to call their son a pit bull but this family wants he's a pit bull and you need to deal with it and you need to do it as pastor and they were telling me what to do what anyhow and so they were going to an extreme and so now they are pushing me to go extreme to deal with this pit bull in the church and i wouldn't do that you know matter of fact they they quit coming to church for a long time because i wouldn't deal with it like they wanted me to deal with it that's not a good thing that's always an evidence of something happening on the other side as well it's kind of like when brother graham says the deacon corrects some parent for the way their children is acting he says if they quit and stop coming to the church he says you can see there's a problem there in the parents there's some there's some problem there not that there wasn't a problem with their kid to be corrected but there's something problem when someone has a problem with being corrected by the deacons and so uh i'm not getting into that tonight all right but this is this brings out a whole opens up a whole can of worms that these parents out of their desire was thinking of what happens with when these children from the promised land come through later and and are with our children we don't live in the promise we we don't live in that land we're on this side of jordan and so they were thinking about how their children would be treated and so this is one of those places in scriptures friends that we would desire to know the mystery behind it how many has been here sundays and hearing that believers desire the mystery behind the scriptures we want to know the mystery behind the parables we're the ones sitting at jesus feet saying i know you told us the parable but what does the parable mean amen is that your desire and this is one of the set of scriptures that i'm still praying about because i want to see what does what does this whole type mean of parents on the borderline of jordan never fully went in themselves and now but they want to set up an altar so that their children are protected here and and everybody knows that we are we serve the same god so later on we find uh at face value we look at and see this altar that was built to the pattern of the true altar and so there they said later our kids in case our kids are excluded from your group or some kids discourage them from serving the lord we want them to feel apart we want them to feel that so we want this altar so our children will feel apart and not be put down or excluded someday we look deeper at this story then we find these two and a half tribes made a decision way back in numbers made a decision to not go into the promised land we're going to read in a minute the reason why they made a decision not to go fully in they made that decision moses didn't make it god didn't make it they made a decision for themselves two and two tribes themselves and their families that we're we're not going to go into the full promise so uh it because they stayed on that side of jordan so if they didn't have an altar to to look at the kids may say hey now i want you to think about this i want you to slow down here they were thinking that if they if they didn't have an altar that resembled the true altar they were on this side of jordan then someday their kids may come to them and say hey dad some kids were making fun of me today saying that uh that we don't have to do anything to do with the same lord that they do they they were making fun of us but those parents failed to realize that they may also get the question from their kids someday that says dad why do we live on this side of the border now i wish i could express that better i'm not a polish speaker but i want you to settle on parents thinking of what questions they might get someday from their children the question of hey dad i talked to some kids today they were putting me down and they were saying we're not a part of those that serve jehovah god and they so they because they were worried about that question coming they wanted to set up a pattern of the true altar so people could look say we're resembling the true believers that are in the promised land we're close to them fact is they weren't they were they were believers but they were borderline believers they were borderline believers and now borderline believers are protecting their children and so we could put this i might get a i might get my kids made fun of someday so now i'm going to have that question no doubt sunday so i want that thing but here's the other question that they would get that to me would be the harder question for a dad and that is dad i just realized that years ago you were a part of moses message and you were part of the message of the hour and the whole focus of the message was for us to go into the promised land to cross over jordan and take the full inheritance dad why didn't we do it come on yes sir which question is harder well the other one's easier because this question comes back to why they made decisions back then to not fully go into the promise somebody say praise the lord oh my we're going to get into it aren't we but that to me i mean that when you weigh the questions coming from your kids having to deal with listen why didn't we fully go into the promise that god gave to moses what happened dad what happened mom here we were here we have the opportunity to fully go into this thing and why didn't we make a decision to do it and dad would have to answer and we're going to get the answer why they did it in just a minute but before we do that i want you to just take a deep look at this uh that and and how many would agree with me tonight that would be a harder question to answer than kids making fun of their kids much harder question but before we go to numbers 32 that tells the story and answers the question why they stayed on the border let me say this this whole subject matter of blessed families came from the book of genesis out of abraham's life and it was abraham's faith in the promise of god that actually brought the promise that said and all the families of the earth shall be blessed because of what because of the faith of abraham in the promise of the day come on can you say amen all the families of the earth will be blessed because of abraham's faith in what the promise of god for that day god gave a promise abraham believed it can you say amen abraham said we're going to do it and not only that abraham stepped out on the promise abraham separated from whoever or whatever was in between him and the promise abraham uh believed every promise of the age it was his main theme in life everything revolved around the promise in abraham's life amen everything revolved around the promise of the age let me go further all of life's decisions were made with god's promises in mind now here's a family that's how it all began here's a man that first of all he heard god's promise of the age and it had to do with him and second of all he was willing to separate from even family members if that kept him from the promise of the age second thing he separated he left his his kindred he left all those that were dear to because they were all idolaters they he grew up a doctor he he grew up just he didn't know god the true god he knew a bunch of different gods but he didn't know the true god god spoke to him and says i've called you i've called you to land get up and go get away from your kindred and go he obeyed god he stepped out his faith had feet on it can you say man he did something about it praise the lord and what was it about what did abraham's life become all about him and his family him his wife at that time became obsessed they became a completely uh consumed with one thing the promise of the age are you listening young men they're gonna have a family someday are you listening young men and young women they're going to have a family someday you're going to need a vision for that family and i pray that it'll be beyond just a career beyond making a lot of money beyond a lot of possessions and nice clothes abraham's life centered around the promise for the age and he was willing to separate from anything that kept him from it he was separating from whoever or whatever kept him from the promise our father abraham all his life became about the promise of the age it was the main theme in his life everything revolved around it all life's decisions were made with god's promises in mind and he had an unwavering passion of pursuing those promises somebody say praise the lord make him say of abraham he had an unwavering passion to pursue what the promise of god and to see those things taken and inherited and lived and hopefully you're applying this to our lives the promises of god it wasn't something to abraham that you come to church on sunday and just hear about he made it personal to himself my family we're going to pursue these promises god's given it to us this is our land this is our inheritance we're going to go get it can you say amen we're going to be passionate about we're going to keep pursuing it till the end until we receive it that's the passion and faith that was unwavering that is told about in the new testament and let me just say this though that any time abraham made decisions where there was where the promise wasn't the priority he got into trouble any time abraham made decisions in life where the promise wasn't the priority he got into trouble and did he do it yes he did a couple of times he got a famine he didn't know what are we gonna eat he starts getting nervous we gotta we gotta make this decision we gotta do this we we had to change this all right and so now he made a decision the decisions he made without the promise in light now got him into trouble and he made it based upon a famine he got into trouble uh maybe not financially but if there's a famine in land you know what i'm going to feed all my my herdsmen and all the people here i'm looking down the road here six months if it keeps in this famine we're not gonna have anything to eat so i think we should go down into egypt whenever he got out of his own land he wasn't under god's blessings anymore so any decisions he made that didn't have the priority of the promise got him into trouble we can apply that as seat of abraham we can apply it today and also we can probably have a testimony service and you can tell of the times where you made decisions not based upon the center being christ and his promises and that being the priority in your life how many can raise your hand say i can testify of that i've got both hands up tonight i've been there done that i know what it means to just go in a direction and for years pay for things that i've done that because i made decisions with not enough prayer and not enough of the priority being god's speaking to me god's speaking to my family god god has me on a channel that i'm inheriting the promises of god i'm living in victory all the time i'm going from from victory to victory i'm i'm growing can you say man but soon as i make decisions based upon finances or based upon careers or based upon the influence of parents or something like that or family members that want you to do something you can't do it it's got to be upon the promise of the hour our family's priority must be as abraham's here so it has to be a priority you get in trouble thus comes the blessings on all the families of the earth because of abraham's passionate pursuit of the promise of god for that age is it not still important here tonight that that has to be the passion in our lives what is god's promise for this age and my family how do we fit into that picture is that shouldn't that be our passion can you say amen above career above money above anything can you say amen i can tell you abraham he was not a poor man abraham was a blessed man financially and in every way and he stayed in that channel as long as he was under the headship and pursuing the promise of god for that age growing into it becoming a part of it can you say amen praise the lord so now thus all the families of the earth become blessed because of a man like this living this way tonight does your family have this priority is christ the priority is the promises of god in pursuing the promises and growing each individually in that family members as parents is that the priority for your kids is it college or is it where they receive the promise of god what are you talking about brother paul you shall receive the holy ghost and the promise is unto you and your children amen if there's no prayers of create just a craving in the hearts of a parents in their hearts to say god fill my children with the true spirit of god give them more than a religion give give them that change that born-again experience there's not enough parents on this earth praying for that to god they're saying lord give me money to send them to college lord provide this for them and help me lord help them to be a good person in society but the prayer ultimately which should be this promise that's unto you and your children it's for you tonight i'm just a young mother the promise that your children can be saved is for you tonight you take a hold of that promise for your children stop praying while they're only two years old start praying for him now i claim that little two-year-old for the kingdom of god i dedicate him to you i'm gonna do everything in my means i'm not a perfect parent by any means i made huge mistakes in my life but i'm bringing it under the blood of jesus christ and i want my children to have better than what i had i want my children to be filled and go beyond what i am in christ oh that's a great great desire that should be in the parents can you say amen praise the lord so now does your family have that priority so now when we go back to jordan then jordan means death so you're crossing jordans you're crossing over and so if you type that to a life where a family is making these things the priority then the first thing they do is they themselves live out a life of death to themselves jordan means death i want the promises but you can't come to the promises do you cross over jordan i want the promises but you can't cross over until you cross until you die to yourself and your children see you dying out to yourself your children see you dying to your pride what is what is dying to yourself well let's just start with being able to repent that's where it starts doesn't it person a person is not willing to die to their pride and not showing any spiritual death in life until they're ready to truly repent if they've done something wrong to repent whoever it is to their children to their boss and then first of all to god let the children see a dying out of pride you say well you mean you're at home so they're not serving the lord but then if you have children this is a just a powerful thing children that are in the world families in the world god gets a hold of that mom and dad and it has such a profound effect just that first step of god leading them to repentance to see their parents lay down everything for christ and come to the altar and say god i have been wrong all of my life my life is full of sin and i repent of i acknowledge my sin and i need you to come and wash my sins away and then they believe in a life of sanctifying their life all right you know i don't want this in my life anymore god takes the smoking and the drinking all that what a profound effect you know what the kids are seeing they're seeing their parents cross over jordan dying out to themselves and as if they keep growing in the lord they're going to see that death happening through their growth in christ you stop dying and stop repenting you stop growing amen if you stop repenting if you stop saying the words i'm sorry please forgive me if your pride gets to the place you can't say that anymore then you you've stopped growing in christ so there's this continual death that goes on isn't there and the kids they see this my kids they see it they that sometimes if they don't see that death they see pride lifted up above the the repentance that that speaks worlds to them and so that's part of it is the is the is crossing jordan crossing jordan means death to self it means repentance it means sanctifying your life that's hard to do that's why it's a death it's a death to self but i want to hold on to this but death to self says i won't hold on to it we're sanctifying that in our lives we're getting rid of this drinking and the smoking in the this party life we're not going to do that anymore hang around all these party people of the world we're separating our lives unto god here and the children watch that and they see that as being a death in their life and so the whole focus it now becomes coming into what is ours spiritually that's the main thing the focus of the family begins to come into a place is that what has been given to us as an inheritance spiritually what do we need to do to get there what do we need to die out to and what what do we need to fight because remember they had to fight in the promised land we're going to continue to fight as a family till we receive all that christ died for at calvary what it what is spiritually ours given to us freely what is it and we're pursuing it and that's why you read the bible to your children that's why you read and pray if you go through your life and you read and you send them to church and you come to church and do those other things but they don't know that all of that has to do with a pursuit and that is something spiritually has been given to me in his inheritance and the reason that i read my bible is i want my inheritance in christ i want to be close to christ i want him a part of my life that's my inheritance i pray because i want to get closer to god i don't pray because it's a ritual i don't read my bible because it's a ritual there's a spiritual inheritance that's been given to me and i'm going to fight for it every day so no even though you're tired in your eyes kids might sometimes see at night when they get those devotions too late and all those kids you know are rubbing their eyes and not only the kids dad's rubbing his eyes and he's just tired you know and drowsy and dad grabs that bible you know and says we just need to spend we need to read just a little bit and shakes himself you know a little bit and says let's read the word of god pray together before we go to bed talks a little bit about something maybe gives a little testimony or something like that what's he doing he's showing them listen this is a battle sometimes this is a fight sometimes daddy has got to go fight some more demons tomorrow it's a hard atmosphere at work right now there's all kinds of cussing going on around me and all kinds of stuff taking place i can't seem to change that that's the way it is and daddy's got to keep providing a living it's the only job i got i got to keep going and so daddy's in a battle we're in a battle can you say amen and i want to have a passionate i want to i want to receive the things that are my inheritance in jesus christ let the children see i'm going to keep fighting we're going to keep reading our bible we're going to keep praying we're going to keep being at the house of god we're going to keep sending our kids where they need we're going to keep doing it we're not going to quit why because of a ritual no because we're in pursuit of the promise of this day some children something has been given to us and we've got to fight for it god can bless our family to be holy ghost-filled people in this hour and come to a perfection and tell the kids i don't know how he's going to do that except by his grace because i don't think i can even reach there i know i can't but god has promised he's going to have a perfect bride so we're going to keep fighting for it we're going to keep going to church children are going to see dad and mom worshiping the lord can i get an amen children should see dad and mom worshiping the lord not fulfilling a religious duty they're they're passionate about this they're on fire for it not every personality is different i'm not talking about personality i'm talking about the heart of that parent is that this is what i'm all about the word of god not about my church but i'm about the word and about christ and i i want more of him amen praise be to god so coming into and fighting for and living in the joy of our land in the holy ghost i want to say that again coming the focus is coming into fighting for and living in the joy of our land in the holy ghost because that's what it should be and so to many kids they don't see the joy in their parents serving the lord they don't see it as a joy they see it as a bondage they see it as that i grew up with this thing and i'm kind of getting tired of it oh god have mercy this holy ghostland is a joy and our children our families should see that it's a joy and we all all of our parents how many reasons we stand corrected tonight there's not all the time they look and see that you know we go through our struggles but not all the time they look and see and so sometimes they they see different things but help us to stay in tune with god so when they look at this and the image of what this is and everything it is that it's not a bond it's it's not a frustration the bible says don't frustrate the grace of god don't let it be confusing get to the word and let god dissolve your confusion so your children don't see confusion and i don't know what it is i don't know how to do this get in the word find the absolutes and let them see stability let them see consistency and then when you make a mistake let them see you repent let them see you bring it to god can you say amen and so that's what we're coming into fighting the joy of the holy ghost and i dare say that's not the main theme in many message families today pursuing this inheritance pursuing the holy ghost that's not the main theme but we must let them see us speaking to our god in prayer that he is a person that we read because he's a person we want to learn of him that we obey him because he's a person and we love him but it's motive it's a motive the whole motive of it of reading our bible and praying and coming to church and and all these things that we do lord's supper all these things that we do our motive is for us to live in our spiritual promised land so i hope i'm helping you tonight i just i'm just letting it flow but this is the passion that a family should express if you don't feel like you're there tonight we'll join the crowd join the crowd but abraham made his mistakes can you say man abraham made his mistakes but he come back to that the new testament doesn't write about his mistakes it writes about his relentless pursuit and faith in the promise of god that's what it's written about so if you had that as an overall picture of your life that my if my kids can say which they will say uh they're probably already saying it but they will say dad you know he made some blunders and man you know he messed up and he lost this and he lost that you know what i'm talking about and and you know dad you know but but but i want him to be able to see the overall picture is his passion was for god he brought his sins underneath the blood of jesus christ he brought us mistakes to god he admitted him to us he was he was humble about it he showed the humility of christ and but his pursuit was that goal that he's seen of where sons of god could be that's what my children can see i want to place that in front of them all the time this is where god's taking a christian this this is where a christian can become that's what the bible says a christian can become that we move beyond the scriptures that says i shouldn't say behind them but we we we get scriptures that if we if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins i'm thankful for that promise but there's two or three other scriptures that say unto him that's able to keep you from falling so there's a power in there not only to forgive you but there's a power in there that you can live in a place of victory still knowing that you can make a mistake in humility but more and more victory all the time i'm living above that i've got satan under my feet there's scriptures about that too that's the problem with the denominational world sometimes they only present that picture of the blood of jesus christ constantly having to forgive the sins but they don't talk about the power of an adopted son of god come to his place of authority to live above the devil's temptation those scriptures are in there too and let our families and our children see daddy and molly pursuing an overcoming life in the promised land hopefully that just plants the vision in your heart amen how god brings that to pass in your individual family well that's up to you but the pursuit should be the promise of god amen you look you come to this church you look at well i'll never be that and i'll ever be as far as this one or them brother paul whatever that's not the way you need to be looking at this every promise that i've come to and haven't come to is yours just as much as mine you're sitting there saying this isn't for me no it's for you brother ed it's for you brother kyle it's for you brother brown and it's for you sister sandy it's for you every promise that christ died for is your promise too it's yours yes but i can't get it for you have to get it for yourself be better if you got it now as opposed to waiting later because your children are going to be watching your life they want to see something real can you say amen now look hold your finger there and look at hebrews 6 12. here's another thing too that i think is important and that is who we follow because we do follow people we'll have choices in who we hang around and hebrews chapter 6 here says in verse 12 hebrews 6 and verse 12. we haven't even got to that numbers 23 yet or numbers 32. look at this i'm just so excited about talking about the promise and families being passionate about the promise of this age hebrews 6 and verse 12 says that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises so now we have a whole picture of who you're following who you're hanging around and i think we should get our families around those that are inhere we can see they're inheriting the promises they're living victorious life they're positive they're the joshua and caleb if you don't feel like a joshua and caleb and you feel like you're acting not like a joshua and caleb then you don't need to go spend a lot of time with another person that's negative you need to get around somebody that's inheriting the promises and so that god always has somebody that's further along in their spiritual walk and a lot of times we back off from people like that may they intimidate us we feel nervous having them home or whatever no that's who you need to be around that's a good peer pressure that's a good thing the bible says to follow those that are inheriting the promises they're living in victory can you say amen it's not to defeat you and make you feel i'll never be anybody but it's to it's to encourage you to say my this is where this is going and so now you get your children around those that's why i appreciate parents that get their children around those that are these good camps and just good atmospheres and they encourage your children to do that they have a choice where they want to hang around and parents have a choice where they send their kids but for the most part you want to influence them to be around those that are of a spiritual nature and and are striving for the things of god amen you say well i want my children to be a witness so i want to put them out there so they can be a witness you put them out there way too much and not enough getting strength from those in here than promises you're going to weaken your kids because you trust too much they got a lot of good in them that's great but you trust too much that they're the witness to this world and they got it all to be a witness but it can weaken them if they hang around that all the time bible says to follow those who inherit the promises is your family following those that are inheriting the promises i like to ask these little questions you have to answer but i like to ask these in this series he said don't dump it off to somebody else i'm asking you brother i'm talking to you everyone in this building brother is your family following those that are inheriting the promises or is most of your time around those they're not inheriting promises they're nice people they're even good christians but are they moving on with the promise of god coming into it amen amen think about it now they need to be around people who can fall they can follow that are beyond them spiritually so they can grow now look what happened in in numbers 32 here and we'll try to wrap this up numbers 32 now this is where all the way back here is when we find the reason why they didn't go in and it says here this is very important we talked about got the end of the the road in joshua and the joshua said now it's time for you to go back over jordan you've helped us fight but now it's time for you to go back why in the world would have to go back and not live in the promised land they made a choice right here in numbers 30 30 um 32 with moses now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer and the land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle now that may not be important to you tonight but it was very important to reuben and to gad verse 2 says the children of god and the children of reuben came and spake unto moses and the lease of the priests and then the prince of the congregation saying uh atheroth and dibon and jazer and nimrod and hishbon and alilier and shebam and nebu and beyond and my wife wants me to go to a class to learn how to pronounce these words or get me an app or something even the country which the lord smote before the congregation of israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle now friends i want you to look at the reasoning behind people that have come out in the message with moses he's preached what the whole person purpose of the message is come out of egypt been in now in the wilderness 40 years and now they're just getting ready to come into the full purpose of what the message was sent to do and that's to come into the inheritance and here they are just on the verge of it here they are and they say this place that we've overcome here this side of jordan it's a a place for cattle and moses you know your servants we have cattle we're in the cattle it's similar to when jesus talked about the invitation to the feast and they all with one accord begin to make excuse and interestingly enough one was i needed to go purchase a piece of real estate another one was i have married a wife which is close to an excuse but it's still not an excuse close to a good enough excuse but it's not third was i've i've bought an oxen bought a cow it's similar to here we have cattle and we've looked at this land and this land would be perfect for us in uh what we do can you imagine so i want you to notice there's no spiritual mindset of making decisions there can't be they haven't caught the theme of the message they haven't caught what the message was sent for because they're making decisions based upon what's comfortable in a certain land for their business that they're in and what they do and friends we can't make decisions about that we must make decisions in our business with the priority of the promise that god's calling us to amen so now i can preach another hour about decisions that are made based upon cattle what is your cattle what is the thing that you do what is your vision what is your pursuit what is your goal what is in these things because often in life you'll take something you have your goal and then you'll find a perfect situation for your goal and it seems like a perfect fit and people in the message will make decisions sometimes only based on that they'll make a move sometimes and their spiritual inheritance is not considered at all how it's gonna how it's gonna affect their family is not considered at all what kind of church in they're gonna be in is not considered at all right and to me i've uh i felt like through the years that i've said it this way and i'll say it become because i'm a pastor if i was a lay member too if we had to go somewhere and get a job the first place that i pray about going is where is there a solid word preaching church and i trust the man because brother brown says if you give your pastor respects he'll lead you through to the other side that's how powerful that effect is it's a it's a it's a trust level can you say man and so now if it's a respect level it's a trust level i would pray about first first where is that man where is that man where my children are are relating to him and my wife is growing and i'm growing and i'm feeding and uh and and my children are they're in an atmosphere there you can see them slowly growing in the things of the lord and where is that man and where is the best atmosphere for that to happen and then when i find that then lord i need a job now that's contrary to a lot of people's opinions and thinking and i'm not even making it a doctrine here tonight i'm just saying that we are more blessed when we're in that channel of being fed and our family's in that flow and that channel of being fed that's why young girls got to pray about a man who knows his place he knows where he belongs this is where he i go to church this is where i pay my tithes this i got confidence in that man we're bringing our family under the headship of of the word and and what what we're doing here because it says something to your children you got to look for a young guy like that young girl he knows his place he's not bouncing around everywhere but he knows where he belongs not that god wouldn't call him somewhere else someday but i'm saying he knows where his place is and and there's confidence and security that comes from the family and also there's this flow of the holy spirit in their lives causing them to grow in the things of god that's first that's first and a lot of times decisions are not made upon that at all and that's a tragedy may i always hold to that principle myself and conviction myself if i ever had to make a decision to take my family somewhere where that that man and that ministry and that all that he represents and just what he's preaching and the whole tone of everything the balance that's why that's why we said a few weeks ago to someone who wasn't getting fed i said a couple of brothers not getting fit i said listen i would love for everybody to be here but listen if you've gone for a long time and not being fed that's something you really got to pray about because what i want as a pastor is every person here to be in a channel that they're really getting fed and so now if that's not happening you've got to go find that place i love you and i want you and i appreciate everything and and all that but you've got to that's priority don't sit here and not get fed it has to be a priority and a lot of that comes from the respect and trust that this man is yielding himself to god can you say amen and so he's committed to me and i'm committed to him not as a man but i'm committed to his ministry i'm committed to get put my shoulder to the wheel with him there's a certain commitment level you know that that's right um am i committed to you okay three or four said amen and my my level of commitment to you i'm just being myself here tonight all right not that i'm being phony every other service but i'm i'm being more open but you know am i committed to you am i coming to you how am i committed to you i may not be able to call you every week i may not be able to have a friendship with you and i desire that you asked my wife i just i said i wish i could get with them i wish i could do that in this and just don't have all the time to do it and you don't have all the time to be with me either and so we often think i want to the friendship and all those other things but you see that's not what the scripture gives is my commitment as a minister to you my commitment is to labor in the word of god for your souls to get fed and to remain committed to that priority and committed to help you to pray with you to be there when when you're in the hospital whatever whatever needs you had share it with me so we can bring it before the throne of grace i'm not perfect and i can't get to you all the time but i'm telling you this that's the commitment and i'll tell you i can say in my heart i am committed to each and every one of you for that and not just to you but others that god has put in the different places we go to minister in the youth i have a huge burden for the youth i have a huge burden also for to get the message out in spanish it's not just locally here but i have other burdens and things but you here are the priority i am committed to you now if that's a spiritual commitment to your souls then why can't people offer that same commitment to the pastor that's right sure amen amen praise the lord you know what it is it's it's trust you can't demand trust can't ever demand trust but you should pray and find that channel of god and not make decisions based upon a good place for cattle you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about you make decisions based upon can you imagine the promised land is just before them here's moses reaction look at this this verse six you still with me it's only 20 after eight numbers 32 6 and moses verse 5 says wherefore said they if we have found grace in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for possession and bring us not over jordan they're not going to die out to themselves they're not they don't want to go into the promised land two tribes here's the whole purpose of the message and they're going to stay on the borderline i'm not going in verse 6 and moses said unto the children of god and the children reuben shall your brethren go to war and shall ye sit here that's the first thing he says your brother are getting ready to go to war for our inheritance and you want to sit here and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of israel from going over into the land which the lord had given them so here's the other problem there's going to be an influence come from these borderline believers to not fully go into the promise you're going to discourage other people from going in to their full inheritance in christ oh lord thus did your fathers when i sent them from canis barnea so he's referring to their history when they're only three and a half days away from the promised land they went to katie sparring here's the fruit and everything and they all begin to murmur we can't do it we can't do it and so they wandered for 40 years three and a half days from the promised land and they wandered for 40 years because of no faith because of no passion for the promise because of fear the giants are too big i can't do it i'll never be able to overcome that you're sitting here tonight saying i could never be a christian like these other christian ladies here in this church i can quit being negative quit saying that god has his inheritance for you too praise be to god he just needs your faith to say i can do it we're well able to do it by god's grace i'm not perfect by any means but i'm going to keep saying i'm going to keep pressing forward for when they went up into the valley of ishko and saw the land they discouraged the heart of children of israel that they should not go into the land which the lord had given them and the lord's anger was kindled at the same time and he swears saying surely none of the men that came out of egypt from 20 years and old and upward shall see the land which i swear unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly followed me so god got angry at them and from 20 years old and upward uh 20 years old and upwards shall see the land which i swear in the father unto isaac and to jacob let me read that right surely none of the men that came none of the men from 20 years old over shall see that land that was 40 years before they're not going to see it because of their lack of faith save verse 12 save caleb the son of jeffnah and the k the canaanite and joshua the son of none for they have holy followed the lord so he refers back and say brothers brothers listen listen to me listen brothers listen what are you thinking we're right here at the very border of this now we're here ready to go into the full promise and you're making a decision based upon this is the best for your business and your cattle and all these other things do you realize you could you realize you're gonna sit here and not fight with your brothers this is what we've been looking forward to this is what the message is for moses is going to go off the scene as a matter of fact here moses is gone he's passed on his commission is fulfilled amen but the very thing moses preached has now come to pass and they're going to be a borderline believer too scared to go that far second of all he says you're going to discourage the rest of the congregation you're going to discourage other people and i don't have time to get in tonight maybe we'll do it next wednesday night but at the end it says uh gad what's the two tribes gad and uh reuben and a half tribe of manasseh at the end of this chapter you're gonna find a half of the manasseh tribe somehow i was talking to brother aaron mcgarry today he says the only thing he could see from scripture is that to see that they're in the midst of this influence that thing very thing happened is that they influenced half of the tribe of manasseh to stay this side of jordan so influence is a power thing powerful thing not going in we're happy here you guys go on over so then the story goes as moses goes on and i just want to finish that with cable caleb in a minute but it goes on to say if you want to read it when you get home tonight or this week if you want to read it moses agrees to let them do it two tribes and the half tribe of manasseh they're going to stay there but they have to agree to go fight they leave their wives and children home they go fight with them and there you pick it up all the way at the end of the at the end of the fighting at the end of joshua i read as you a text tonight and that's when they said it's time to go back and when we go back we're going to build an altar and they built a beautiful beautiful a very visible in a large altar so you could see it from the other side of jordan big altar that resembled the true altar these were these people they wouldn't go on with the promise they wouldn't go any further they were borderline but they wanted to have some resemblance to what they used to believe to feel good about it and feel good for their children so the children would be put down now friends is the word word a discerner of the times that we live in if we're not on the verge of us taking our promises i don't know what other day this is the day that we take our promise in jesus christ and go on to a rapture and we're fighting for it every day but you can see the influences of those that decide i'm happy right where i'm at in between not crossing over jordan but he said caleb back then caleb will go in and joshua will come in i'm going to close on this tonight why did why did caleb and joshua actually end up going in because they were positive in their confession even when they didn't know how they were going to do it themselves so in reality that's all god required of caleb and joshua it was a positive confession now friends we need to be more positive amen brother paul needs to be more positive you need to be more positive if you want to how many wants to be at joshua and caleb here tonight and when the devil defeats you say i can't do that i can't do that all god needs to hear is your positive confession to say this is all caleb went in for he hadn't even went into the promised land yet but he confessed and says we are well able to do it i don't know how we're going to do it but we're well able to do it and that's all i always like to tell the story that god's sitting there he's all god's just just kind of silent in it all and he's watched all these 10 other spies spend all this time being negative being negative we can't do it we can't do it and in discouraging the whole congregation everybody's low nobody's in the spirit of revival we can't go any further the church isn't going any further i imagine this god is just just bound his head and just shaking his head and all this because this is this is what he called him out of egypt for and he has to hear this we can't do it so he's got his head down and i just like to say he's just just kind of and all of a sudden the bible says that caleb stealed the people he said everybody shut up be quiet still the audience and says brothers we are well able to take the land and i think god perked up amen and caleb kept talking and as caleb kept talking god just kind of stood up and said you know what that's what i need to hear if i hear that i can get them into all the promises they don't know how to do it because they can't do it on their own but if they'll give me that positive confession i believe i'll obey it i'll follow it we can do it can you say amen that's all caleb had to get the testimony that he wholly followed the lord and i'm not going to take the rest of those generations in but caleb and joshua i'm letting in you know what it was a positive confession faith faith and that's why he said in hebrews he says many of them didn't enter in not being mixed with faith in them that heard it they heard moses message they heard the truth they nodded to it it was all truth but not being mixed with faith in them that heard it if we have no faith with what we believe we can't move on to the promises god just stands and says that's what i'm looking for that's the confession that i need not just at church when brother paul's preaching and you get excited about it but those conf positive confessions coming out of daddy's lips coming out of mommy's lips coming out of a teenager it says i made a mistake last week but i put it under the blood and i'm more than able to get all the land that god has given me i will become what christ said i will become by the grace of god brother paul you're trying to make me a radical christian yeah it would be nice brother bram says i would have i would rather have wildfire than no fire at all that's what he said so i would rather have you get a little wild and passionate about god and act out of yourself a little bit than you have you go in the other way of cold and dead and formal and the devil's got his thumb on you all week long that's good that's not living in victory and that's not what god god's called you to see if i had the articulation if i had the way friends to describe what christ wants to mold into you and finish in this hour you what he wants you to become but i can't give you all those answers it's when you're getting in the word of god and you see your true biography you see your true life story you get out of the word you're going to start letting the devil interpret your biography you stand the word he'll tell you who you really are he'll tell you men how to be a real man he'll tell you husbands how to be a real leader of your home tell you wives how to be under subjection to your own husbands and how to live in that kind of faith can you say amen tell your children how to be underception how to be in a certain place and how to live in victory in those things he'll tell you when you stay in the word of god one of the things i've been rejoicing about lately you can stand with me one of the things that i've been rejoicing about so much lately is to see people get into the message of the hour and sending me quotes to encourage me praise the lord because they couldn't be sitting those things and finding many of them fighting such great things that the prophet said in the scriptures said unless i knew they were feeding on the word of god god put a hunger to feed on the promises of this day and for them to send me a text and me an email and to send me look at this look what brother bram said here look what the scripture said here look at this look at that i tell you friends that charges my heart i tell you i feel excited about that and the same way god got excited i believe about caleb's confession god gets just as excited about your confession when you're down in the dumps but you rise above it and say my god is able i am i am well able to take this land i am well able to become the christian that god's called me to become say with me i am able we are able we are well able to take the land we are his people can you say amen we are his people he's able he's able i know that he is able i know my lord is able to carry me through oh he's able he's able i know he is able i know my lord who's able to carry me through amen oh yes he's able he's able i know he is able i know my lord is able to carry me through say it again oh he's able he's able i know he is oh i amen put your hands on your brothers and sisters sisters and sister brothers and let's pray and instead of discouraging one another let's encourage one another in the faith and in the lord heavenly father thank you for your word thank you for the promise lord that lays here in the discernment of the word that is so perfect lord what's happening today has happened before we are standing lord in this great hour father where you have tore the seals off of this book of redemption and you've put out there before us everything that is ours in jesus christ to create a people lord for your name and a bride is to create the virginity of your bride lord to be married to her lord through the word being washed by the water of the word that's the promise of this day and father we want to just latch on to it and hold on to it as the scripture says lay hold of the promise of god and hold it in our hands and put it before us every day and lord our families and the church be blessed because of it the lord each one tonight as someone suffers from sickness your promises that you would heal them lord heal them tonight father god we pray for those that are discouraged that you would encourage them tonight lord we pray father for those that would be on the border line oh my father bless them strengthen them give them revelation lord that they can see the promise ahead of us and walk in it and take a hold of it lord to fight together for one another's growth in jesus christ lord this is our land of the holy ghost bless each one father help us to be more positive help us not to be negative about things but more positive all the time we pray father that you deliver those who need deliverance and god deliver our mouth from speaking negative things may it be the positive confession of the holy ghost lord and what you've done for us or that would bring us into you saying as you do the caleb and joshua i'll take them in because they've holy followed the lord let me be that joshua and caleb tonight i pray by our confession thank you father we give you all the honor and glory tonight moving hearts we pray save souls save souls lord fill those with the holy spirit in the name of jesus in these late hours god just do that i pray draw them to yourself in jesus name thank you father amen and amen praise the lord key of c for like we'll see he is able as we're dismissed tonight god bless you if anybody needs prayer just worship the lord

way oh he is to make me what he wants me to you
