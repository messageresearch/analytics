son First Peter chapter 3 and verse 7 likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so there's a certain violation of respect that can take place when a husband does not view his wife correctly there's a certain violation of respect and so the scripture deals with it very clearly and this will coincide with my subject Sunday on Oneness in my series on Oneness and I want to get into particulars here a little bit but in the marriage relationship and in the husband and wife relationship a Godly husband or a God man must with respect and honor look at the wife properly as being the Waker vessel but at the same time realizing that your heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers may be not hindered so there is a violation something that a husband can do by simply not looking at his wife with the right balance and thus brings dishonor because he uses the word honor excuse me use the word dwelling with him according to knowledge honoring of the way he uses the word honor and us under the weaker vessel as being ears together so there's a Oneness with God and there's a Oneness with one another and that never changes even though her vessel is the weaker vessel so if a man does not look at that right he will not respect her right and thus his prayers to God will be hindered I'm not hearing any echoing amens in here but it's the truth nonetheless and so if we apply that to all relationships and that's what I'm speaking on relationships if we apply that now then we have to have an understanding of who each member in the body of Christ is in order for the respect level to stay very high because if we lose respect then we've lost something in the sense of how we view that person everybody understand so then it goes on to say finally be of all one mind be ye of all one mind having compassion one of Another Love is Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil somebody did me wrong I'm going to do them wrong back no no that's not what we do or railing for railing but contrary wise blessings so somebody does you bad we send them back a blessing wow knowing that ye there there unto called You're they're into called that ye should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that speak no guile let him assure evil and do good let him seek in peace and ensue it it's about relationships it's about relationships it's all about relationship we say well who with everybody this is how we Christians view things and when he says things like he that will love life how many how many love life I want to have a good life all right a few of us for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil what you say can be tied to the quality of life for what that he will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil so what we say is important and his lips from that they speak no guy let him assure evil run From Evil and do good let him seek peace if you want relationships we're the one that's always seeking peace reconciliation whatever we have to do can you say Amen so I'm going to Echo so I feel better so I'm gonna Echo a little bit a couple of points that I preach Sunday so that we understand when first of all when Jesus gave his final words of what the church will do I talked about three or four of them when he left this Earth at least in his physical body he gave instructions to the church he gave where the church will go and one of them was the Great Commission and I was I wanted to make the Clear Point that the commission was not just to certain Believers it wasn't just to Apostles the Great Commission of go into the world and preach the gospel and cast out devils and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that commission is to every holy ghost-filled believer there's no exceptions to it can you say Amen so I wanted to make the point that another con another prophecy he gave for the church is what I'm preaching on is that when he said that they will receive my glory and they will become one with one another as we are one the father and the son they will become one with us excuse me not with us but with Christ and they will become one with one another another that's a prophecy but that's Jesus prophesying this Jesus saying this is what the church will become my point just like the Great Commission it's not just to certain ones to become one with one another it's all holy ghost filled Believers and whether we think it's going to happen or not it doesn't matter it's going to happen because Jesus said it and if Jesus said it that settles it so no matter how bad it looks is that I don't we're never going to come into unity in this in this message but it's just it seems so divided well that's looking in the negative side I'm looking at what Jesus said and I'm looking at the local congregation more than even a nationwide or worldwide let it start at home he said because of the glory coming into the church they will become one can you say Amen so there's no exceptions you can't say well I don't have to participate in that even though I want to be a Sunday morning Christian at the church I don't have to no no this is by the Holy Ghost and if you say you have the Holy Spirit and the holy spirit's number one evidence the evidence of the holy spirit is to believe the word from your heart forever for the age that you live in and if you believe that I believe every word then I just read to you Jesus word for the church especially at the end time when it is the day of Oneness he said at that day ye shall know I and the father I and you you and me at that day they will become one the second Echo I want to give from Sunday is Isaiah 53 and it was interesting to see uh someone has suggested to listen to brother Donnie from Sunday morning he was on the same scripture as I was Isaiah 53 making some wonderful points but here's the point I was making out of it is God was pleased and satisfied with the offering and the sacrifice of Christ he was pleased that's the word he was pleased to see him bruised God was pleased he was satisfied with that sacrifice and why was God satisfied with that sacrifice why would God even be happy about suffering it's not that it's not that we have a God that just says I love when people suffer I like to make people suffer no no that doesn't have anywhere where it's going but when he sees the sacrifice of Christ laying down his life by his own choice can you say Amen but here's why it's it is God is here's why he's pleased with it God is pleased and satisfied with the offering or sacrifice that dies to self in order to restore relationship and bring true Oneness because Christ in his suffering would bring many sons many sons to Glory as well so what God's satisfied because this decision that Christ has made I'm satisfied I'm breathing this in this suffering this pain this thorn in his uh Crown all these other things taking place God was satisfied why not just because of suffering this suffering restored relationship with God and man this suffering broke the middle walls of partition between us this suffering brought better relationship not just better but brought man back one with God this suffering would open a way for them to receive the actual holy ghost in their soul without Calvary you had no place to receive the Holy Ghost but because somebody suffered it would burn out the sin they would burn out the defiling serpent nature and replace it with what the very nature of God and that what happens when you have the nature of God in you you have the same nature as the author written in the word and he has the same nature as the other person sitting next to you that has the Holy Ghost that's how you can become one with them not because you agree on everything intellectually but because by the same nature if I have the nature of Christ within me I don't have any problem being one with him because by Nature I have been bonded and bonded is such a a just a very surface word to use in this this is a Oneness that no man can achieve this is one by spirit I am one with him because I have his Spirit within me tonight you talk about relationship that's not two Spirits trying to get along that's becoming one because you are the same Spirit that's why tonight I can say Amen to the word of God that's why since 16 years old I have no problem saying Amen to the world to the to the word I have no problem it's something resonates with it every time you hear the word and even when I'm convicted I have no problem responding I trust it if if the word takes the height off of my back or encourages encourages me and I'm on cloud nine for the week it doesn't matter if there's an A Matter down here he put it there can you say amen that's why I can say Amen to the Lord there's no resistance down here my flesh sometimes says that's probably the way it sounds but but my soul is always saying that's hard in my flesh but it's a man amen that's me I love that that's me yes that's my husband Christ I'm his wife and I say amen and I submit to that word there is no resistance in my soul because I've met the author and I have the author living in me so because God was satisfied with that sacrifice that is explained in Isaiah 53 he was pleased to bruise him in order to restore relationship then we learn something that there is a suffering and sacrifice that is made when you want to make relationships better now let's let's just say this if you reach out christ-like and you go through prayer I want to reconcile I want to restore I want to see things reconciled in a relationship that's wrong and bad someone did me wrong whatever it is I did them wrong they may not always respond right right away did we all respond right away to the Lord some did some right away but some of you man you took a long time and it was God's love that went to Calvary for you it was God's love that wouldn't found you it was God's love reaching out to you when you were rebuked for for your earrings and your short dresses and your makeup and all this stuff and you came in the first service and the preacher Just Whipped all that stuff when you come in there you didn't feel you so much you didn't feel so much it was the love of God but yet if there's something within you that changes you can you say man and that's that's my husband talking so in when when God's reaching out to restore a relationship he goes to Calvary and he starts to move on You by the Holy Spirit and you it's not everybody that responds to being reconciled by right away so if that applies with God dealing with us it applies when we bring a christ-like spirit to say I'm going to sacrifice I don't want to be so focused here I'm going to make right what I've done wrong but I want to have an open conversation with somebody and I want to talk to them I want to say to them listen is there anything I can do to make our relationship better is there anything I can do to to restore what's been lost years ago is there anything that can be done and when you start asking questions like that and you start being open like that you may not always get the response back because the Holy Spirit has to do it in their life too but nevertheless Christ reached out when while we were yet sinners Christ died for us praise the Lord so now I I want to talk about how Oneness Works in different vessels because you know we are all different vessels we are all different personalities your personality is not sin it's before I get into sin in person's life because sin when you cross over after the garden everything comes into relationships all relationships are broken down they don't have the potential anymore to be what they were in the Garden of Eden before jealousy comes in hatred comes in blaming comes in the glory of God departs from them there's nothing there to work off of as far as Oneness with other people and your husband and wife it's gone it's gone that's why today without god without the glory of God it's difficult to hold a marriage together because he's the one that created marriage right and we don't have an understanding have the glory of God we're just working off an intellect and surviving basically but you see now there's something greater than surviving there's overcoming there's the glory of God and when it comes into our life then we have something getting us back so I'm not getting in the next few weeks I'll get into the sin part because there are normal things that are happening still today in relationships that we're still calling normal but they're normal under after the fall and after sin and we're still doing some of those things because we've been taught that's normal but we've been taught by Hollywood the movies you watched whatever you were taught and so it's ingrained in your system this is normal this is how I treat another person this is how I act this is how I respond but there were things that happened under the fall like blaming one another like jealousy like sin like like all those things came from the fall they didn't come from before the fall they came after and so now we need to to look at whatever's happening under sin we need to at least say if I'm doing that wait a minute God you're teaching me this isn't normal this is an order to normal to be a rage of anger in front of my children and in a rage of anger just yelling in their face and anger and belittling them and and and and belittling their character let me tell you brother whoever you are or sister that's not normal that's not normal that's not normal behavior for a Christian if you make a mistake bring it under the Crossman when that's a pattern and it's broken relationships your whole your whole life your whole life you need to really look at your experience with God because the glory of the Lord would be changing that that's under the fall that's treatment of other relationships under the fall that's not when the glory of God comes in it begins to change I may remember that from Sunday from glory to glory he's changing me so what's it changing the nature of the Fall was the serpent nature all that came with it uh just all the separations all the breakup all the broken relationship with God everything come from the fall now because of coward the glory of God comes back to his church comes in by the Holy Ghost and now we come into a process now of by Nature saying I'm reversing God's saying I'm reversing all these patterns that broke relationship and you've got something within you that builds strong Relationships by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you got something that reconciles relationship that's you you got something what do I do I look to the word this is what I need to do in this situation when I do this person that hates me the word tells you what to do you get rebellious say I'm going to do it my own way you know I'm gonna no no no no no we're under the glory of God here and from glory and Glory he's changing us can you say Amen so now you know we're living in the day at that day you shall know I and the father I knew you and me them and one another Oneness we're living in the day of Oneness and intimacy with the Lord please don't read that word intimacy wrong the world has made it a sexual experience or whatever intimacy is a a complete open relationship without walls there's no hindrances there's no walls we're living in the day being restored back to True Oneness with God and one another and true intimacy with God and with one another no walls a relationship without walls people talk about Revival take we got this that and I rejoice in any rejoicing of the word of God I mean if God whatever God can change the atmosphere in any service and do whatever he wants to do but if you want to know your pastor what kind of Revival he's looking for I'm looking for a Revival and to come to the true Oneness it's a Revival to me when someone truly forgives another Christian when Believers come into Oneness and die to themselves I'm wondering after Sunday's service I wonder how many brothers went down and sat with their families this week and said after what was preached I'd like to sit down and talk with you and I'd like to have an open relationship how many brothers did it to their wives I'm not saying you had to do it I'm just wondering what effect this has happened because we can not in church all we want to but if we were serious with God then we say now I'm going to be open with my family with my wife and I'm going to say what can I do to make the relationship better what have I done is there any walls up here that we can tear down so Satan quits getting the glory I'm not saying that to be because probably most didn't do it and I'm not putting you down because but I'm asking you is that what are we taking from this series in relationships to go ahead and go the way of Calvary and the cross and say I'm going to go the suffering and the hard way a way that God's pleased with because if there is a reconciling a relationship at the end of it God is satisfied if that's a suffering thing to do God is satisfied I think it's a Revival when someone forgives someone when Believers come into Oneness and die to themselves for a greater Oneness in their marriage and family and others that's also what Jesus said the church would come to not just the Great Commission not just casting out devils not just if they drink any deadly thing not just they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he said they will become one as we are one that's part of the end time revival can I get an amen tonight don't forget Oneness is a part of the end time Revival it's not just laying on hands it's not just healing lines that's all part of it the supernatural needs to show himself in the Church of God a book of Acts Church repeat it again can you say Amen friends but don't forget the book of Acts Church it wasn't just all miracles when someone lied to the Holy Ghost they got in trouble for it don't forget the book of Acts Church they sold all their goods because they were trying to meet the need in someone else there was other things working in the book of Acts church and Jesus said at the end they will become one as we are one that's the Revival that I am looking for and this word I believe will produce it can you say Amen now I wanted to say here that God created us a relational being in the beginning God created you a relational being what do you believe what do you where'd you get that it is not good for man to be alone and I use man not just in the sense of the brothers but the sisters because remember they were together as one Spirit masculine and feminine right so then he says it is not good to then he puts them in two vessels then then he has Adam there it is not good for man to be alone so he begins the process of taking the feminine part out they've never lost their one not Oneness because when he took her out he said and they too shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife and the two shall be one so the Oneness hasn't been broken there's still one in spirit but now their vessels are different okay and so God has created us a relational being it is not good for man to be alone if man is detached from relationship with others of his kind it's not good and it's not of God if someone would say I don't need anybody I don't need friends all friends have hurt me I don't need any friends anymore I don't need people I had a fellow tell me one time years ago he says I want to come to your church but he says I really don't want to be around the people I want to come and hear the preaching and get in my car and head home I don't need people and uh he's already off track and doesn't know his Bible because Christ is living in his people thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please
