========================================

so if you guys go ahead and take your seats I just want to kind of relax a little bit but uh I was telling brother Brandon uh back in the office that uh for those of you who are in Sunday school on on Sunday You're Gonna you got a little bit of a a preview of what I'm going to be speaking on tonight um kind of to tell a funny story is that when brother Rapp had asked me to take Sunday School I decided especially since we had a full weekend of the Fall Fellowship the Lord kind of spoke to me to to use the last sermon that I had preached on in Virginia brother Steve coffees and so my wife and I stayed rather late as everyone did at the fall Fellowship because I knew kind of already prepared already had my notes um and I went home and I got on my computer and I opened them up so I could study a little bit and they were gone everything I had was lost so I stayed up about 2 30 in the morning trying to to remember everything that was in my notes and what made the story funny uh or more funny than uh just losing them was the the title of my topic was I remember so I told everyone in Sunday school that I was doing my best to remember my notes because I'd been been a few weeks since I'd actually uh kind of written them out but when brother Paul contacted me Sunday night I actually was in the midst of taking what I had started to build for Sunday school and was kind of rebuilding my sermon and so I just felt like the Lord was leading me that you know since brother Paul asked I'm just going to continue on with that and we'd speak on it again this evening so that will be my topic tonight as I remember um so if you guys just real quickly and I'm sorry to make you stand up again but just want to stand we'll read our opening scripture this evening in Deuteronomy chapter 8. starting in verse 11 and we're going to be going to verse 20. so it says be beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God in not keeping his Commandments and his judgments and his statutes which I commanded thee this day lest when thou Hast eaten and art full and has built Godly houses and dwelt therein and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is Multiplied and all that thou Hast is multiplied then thy heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage who led thee through that great and terrible Wilderness where and where fiery serpents and scorpions and drought and there was no water who brought the fourth water out of the rock of Flint who fed thee in the wilderness with Manna which thy fathers knew not that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do thy the good at thy latter end and thou say in thy heart my power in the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth but Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his Covenant which he swear unto thy fathers at it as it is this day and that shall be if thou do at all forget the Lord thy God and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish as the nation which the Lord destroieth before your face so shall ye perish because you would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God just bow our heads in a word of Prayer dear heavenly father we just come to you tonight Lord and just Lord thankful for another opportunity Lord just to gather around your word Lord and just hear from you this evening Lord father Lord I just pray that you Lord open our hearts this evening and take all away all nervousness Lord father and just use this this week and humble vessel Lord just to say something that might spark something within your children Lord father to draw them closer to you this evening Lord we just pray for all those that aren't able to be here this evening that you give them an extra special blessing Lord father and we just pray you bless the remainder their service in Jesus name we pray amen so you may be seated sorry I always hate when the minister forgets to say that so in these scriptures uh the the what is translated to forget in the Hebrew the root of that word it means to mislay to be oblivious of from want of memory or attention to stop remembering ignore dismiss from your mind abandon neglect or cease to care about um and I find this interesting because if you look at kind of the timeline of Deuteronomy this sermon of Moses takes place during a 40-day period right before the children of Israel are go to go into the promised land and so we all know when the children of Israel went in the promised land that Moses didn't go with them this was kind of the end of Moses's life and I find it interesting that at the end of his life uh here you have God's Prophet who he had spoke to God he saw God face to face he had held the Commandments that God had carved with his own hands just imagine the things that Moses could have told the people I I have to believe that Moses knew he was coming to the end and there's probably many things he could have shared with him Secrets he could have imparted in them um just information about the Lord and who he was but what God ordained him to speak about was remembering and I find that interesting um and that tells me that remembrance holds something significant not only to God but to the life of a Believer um for the children of Israel to come down to this point to Moses's entire life of everything he'd done and seen to come down to this point and that is what God wanted him to say to use his last words on Earth to say was to remember means is there something significant about that and so Moses knew that remembering was something that God's people had struggled with he knew it was something that they would continue to struggle with so he he used this these last sermons to to not only encourage them but also to admonish them um Moses over the years he had witnessed and we all know the story but he'd witnessed over and over again that God would do something for the children of Israel the children of Israel would worship God and praise God for what he had done and within a short period of time they would forget it and they'd turn away from God so Moses knew that this was a constant struggle and so he knew that going forward this would continue to be a struggle um and and again I know we all know this story but I just kind of want to lay a foundation but even though God had sent them a promise deliver through Moses he had sent that he'd brought the children of Israel out of bondage he kept them through the desert he gave them victory over their enemies he brought them to a Promised Land through all of that the children of Israel still complained and I'm just going to give a few examples but we I'm sure there's probably many more and some that you probably remember better than me but throughout the scripture Israel complains even before God delivered them when Moses first kind of came on the scene um they complained to Moses in Exodus 5 because of all his talk about the promised land of all his talk about what God was going to do for them it caused pharaoh to say fine now you make bricks without straw and so the children of Israel were upset and they started to complain that all of his talk of God's promises were actually making their life worse in Exodus 14 uh the people complained and said told Moses leave us alone uh they said it would be better for us to serve the Egyptians than dying the desert so again we're at the point where they've seen miracles from God they had they had witnessed what God had done and they got to a point where they just said leave us alone we'd rather be in sin than to die here in the desert um in Exodus 15 the people complained about the bitter water uh in Exodus 16 they complain about being hungry and God gave the man and they you know they still complained no matter what God did for them no matter what God showed them their memory of what God was doing was short-lived again in Exodus 17 the people complained about being thirsty in Exodus 32 the people Moses went up to the mountain this was when he goes up to get the Ten Commandments from the Lord and to speak to the Lord and the people had such little patience that they forsook the Lord and they they built the golden calf and it angered the Lord um and what I want I want us to kind of talk about at this point was when we talk about remembering in order to create a memory and we'll talk about this more as we get into this it takes time it takes patience and we see in this instance the children of Israel they had no time for it they had no time to meditate on to remember to praise God for what he'd done they had very little or limited I should say patience for doing that the minute they felt like God was taking too long they turn from him again in numbers 12 we have Miriam and Aaron who complained about Moses's leadership numbers 14 the people complained about how difficult it looked to conquer the Giants in in the promised land and they refused to go again I want us to think about just imagine all that these people had seen God had delivered them from Egypt he had they'd seen the waters parted at the Red Sea God had fed them he had given them something to drink he had kept them in the desert they had all these victories over their enemies and yet through all of that they said God this is too big for you and they still complained that's fascinating to me um again and I know in our own lives we get this way and we'll get into this a little bit but to imagine seeing the actual Waters of the sea parted and then to tell God yes you did but this is too big I know you did that but this is too big again there was no remembrance of what God had done once it was over once they had seen the Miracles it never stuck and and so Moses was telling the children of Israel listen you have to remember you have to dwell on these things that God has done for us you have to and and I'm probably getting ahead of myself a little bit but for a memory to take hold into form it has to be something that you're constantly thinking about talking about remembering it can't just be something that we're oh this happened and we'll remember and trust me for those of you who aren't there yet the closer to 40 you get the more you need to do this because the long-term memory seems to to be even worse than it was when we were younger it's something that you constantly have to be remembering in in praising and testifying to what God's done amen um also if you look at scripture and again just the the topic of remembrance you'll find through from Genesis to Revelations you'll find it everywhere God is constantly telling his people to remember and one of the ways that God does this is that there's several stories through scripture where God um puts it on the heart of one of his children or commands his children to build memorials to something that he had done for them the first example would be when Jacob had his his vision of the stairway from Earth to heaven in Bethel when he awoke and he had that Vision he had such a strong feeling for what that meant and the experience that he had that he wanted to commemorate it and he didn't want to forget what it meant and so he took the stone that he had fallen asleep on and he raised it up to build a memorial to God the second one and if you guys want to put up that first Slide the second one was when the children of Israel went Joshua excuse me cross the River Jordan God had told them someone from each tribe is to pick up a stone and then we're going to have them stack these Stones as a memorial to what God had done for them and so I imagine it looks something like this now I don't know exactly how big the stones were but I have to imagine it looks something like this and God said this isn't just a memorial for you that when you look at it you remember it and this is something important to remember as we go on it this is also memorial for your children and your children's children because when your children look at this what's the first thing they're going to do what is that what's it for and that's your chance to then explain to them what God has done because this is one thing that we have to remember about our testimonies my testimony or your testimony when you give it may bring Faith to me it may stir up um excitement or wonder for me to search out something for myself and that's what these memorials are for as we grow in Christ you have to realize that Gideon's testimony will only do so much for me at some point I have to have my own testimony because even through everything that the children of Israel saw God do for them even in those cases where they were actually there they would forget so at some point a testimony from a Believer will get me just so far and then I have to have that relationship with Christ amen the third example is in Samuel first Samuel chapter 7 and this is when the Israelites were under attack from the Philistines and God leads them to Victory and so Samuel erects a stone and he names it Ebenezer meaning the stone of help so again this is another example of the children of Israel setting up a permanent Memorial to remember God and what he had done for them and then probably the most well-known or the one that means the most to us would be the act of communion at the Last Supper when Jesus was with the disciples and he was breaking bread and they were drinking the wine he said do this often remembrance of me and we continue to this day to do this what is it it's a memorial for us to remember what God did for us it's it's not just drinking wine and bread and coming together God wants us each one of us individually to remember why it is that we're doing this because it's important to God that we remember because he knows we're human and the minute we forget the minute we're not remembering what he did we're just like the children of Israel and will start to pull away from him amen in 1957 in time tested memorials brother Branham said this not long ago when I heard when I was in Italy I heard of Mussolini in that great statue 40 something feet high that he'd built as a memorial to Athletics as he was an athlete and I wanted to find that Memorial and you know it had been blown into powder by a big Blockbuster I stood about two three years ago on the place where pharaohs of Egypt had raised up great shrines and idols and they tell me that you have to dig 20 feet under the Earth to find even the ground where those memorials stood I've stood where Caesar Augustus where the herods and the greats of Rome and I went on the street where he used to go down the street from the palace since about 25 feet beneath the Earth those memorials are gone but that Living Word of God Still Remains just the same and just as valuable that's a memorial so again the message that we have the word that God has given us that's another Memorial that we have to look back on and remember what God's done for us and the memorial is something it's usually a structure but for a Believer or a Christian it doesn't have to be a physical structure but it's usually a structure and it's something that's established to remind uh people of a person or an event and we we often don't realize that we have these things in our life anyways for instance the cross that hangs back here brother Branham talked about having one hanging from his rearview mirror these are these are monuments these are things that will spark remembrance enough when we look at them the minute a Christian looks at a cross that means a lot more than just two pieces of wood to put together we remember what that means we automatically associate it with the suffering that we caused God Amen and memories of memorials they give us something to set our eyes on they give us something to help us Center ourselves on Christ remember the problem I get in trouble like you always say you do because I'm going to read a quote from a psychology article but it says memory is essential to all our lives without a memory of the past we cannot operate in the present or think about the future and as I read it read that I kind of heard it differently in my head and it's without memories without remembering the past we can't operate God's gifts in the present and if we can't operate his gifts in the present we can't keep our mind on what he's calling us to that's why remembering what God has done is important if we can't remember his promises then how do we operate them in our day-to-day lives and if we can't operate those in our day-to-day lives how do we hope to be to reach what he's calling us to the higher place that he's calling us to amen during times of trial remembering keeps us from being double-minded it keeps us from losing our hope and our sense of direction when we can remember what God has done in our lives personally it helps keep our feet on the straight path it helps keep us pointed in God's Direction this is exactly what happened or the opposite of what happened the children of Israel they forgot who they were they forgot what God had done and they lost their Direction and they wandered in the desert for 40 years because of it most of them never saw the promised land all because they had forgotten what God had done for them now stop and just think about that for a minute here's the children of Israel who were in bondage over 400 years they'd waited for a deliverer it finally happens and all that God's asking them to do is remember don't forget remember that I promised I'd deliver you and I did it so if I promised you that and I did it then every other promise I've given you I will do that's all they had to do all they had to do was remember what God had done foreign so simple so simple and yet they turn from God and it's easy for us to look back and think well that's that's silly God wasn't asking much of them guess what God's not asking any more of us he's saying just remember when you're sick remember that I said you're healed when you're struggling remember that I said I'd be there that's all he's asking us to do because if we can do that God Will Supply the rest amen and again the act of remembering is important to God he wants us to live our lives in remembrance our past present and future in God is linked by our memory now why why is that why is remembering important in Psalm 77 we get an example the author Begins the chapter by describing his despair he says I am so troubled that I cannot speak he continues by saying will the Lord casts off forever and will he be favorable no more is his Mercy clean Gone Forever does his promise fail forevermore hath God forgotten to be gracious hathy and anger shut up his Tender Mercies now how often when we're going through trials does that sound like us if no one else would raise their hand I'll raise two because it sounds like me quite often and I often like to say to people in our humanness there's nothing wrong with being there God understands that we will go through times like this the problem is is when we stay there that's the problem God God came to Earth in Jesus so that he could experience what we experience he knows that this is going to happen to us but he also knows that we can overcome just the way he did he wants us to move on from that and so if you keep on in Psalm 77 the author doesn't stop here he continues and then as he continues in the scripture he begins to remember and meditate on the things that God's done he says this he said I will remember the years of the right hand of the most high I will remember the works of the Lord surely I will remember thy wonders of old I will meditate also of all of thy Work and talk of thy doing remembering is an action it's not something that just happens it's something we have to do we have to do consciously think about what God has done and is doing we have to wake up every morning and say you know what yesterday may not have been the best day but God blessed me in this way this way in this way because I'm telling you I've been serving the lord a long time and some of you a lot longer than me there's never been a day that goes by no matter how bad the day has been that you can't find at least once that God has blessed you and so if we just as the author in the scriptures is done start talking about those things even internally to ourselves start dwelling on them no matter how small we think they are the things that God has done for us something happens and what happens when this author starts remembering and meditating on these things he begins to turn his despair into praise this is exactly what the children of Israel could have done he threw everything they went through if they had said okay you know what we're thirsty we're hungry but God brought us out of Egypt God parted the Seas is going to find a way to feed us he's going to find a way to bring us water if that's what they had done their despair would have turned to praise amen and this is what the author continues to say he is he says who is so great a God is our God Thou Art the god that do us wonders thou has declared thy strengths among the people thou Hast With Thine arm redeem thy people the sons of Jacob and Joseph say law the waters saw thee oh God the water saw thee they were afraid the depths were also troubled the clouds poured out water the sky sent out a sound Thon arrows also went abroad the voice of thy Thunders was in the heaven the Lightnings lightened the world the Earth trembled and shook the way is in the sea and thy path in the Great Waters and thy footsteps are not known thou lettest thy people in a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron so this author is talking about the same thing that the children of Israel went through but he doesn't talk about them being hungry he doesn't talk about them being thirsty he doesn't talk about them complaining he talks about everything that God had done it's the same story but seen from a completely different perspective and this author instead of being in despair like the children of Israel were and who the children of Israel who missed out on their promise this this author is stepping into the promise that God had given him he's praising the Lord for all the things that he had done because he wasn't looking at the circumstances but he was remembering God's promises amen and I won't read the scriptures tonight but if you guys want to go back and read it read psalms 106 because it it lets you know what happens when we as Believers forget what God has done and just three things that I grabbed out from that scripture is it leads to unbelief and eventually to Rebellion when we don't remember what it is that God's done eventually the devil will get in there and start to twist what it is we believe and start whispering things in our ear to eventually we don't even believe what we used to believe and then if we continue to let that happen it then becomes a rebellion and hopefully I don't get myself in trouble for saying this brother Paul but I often say for all of my friends that no longer are sitting here because they've left this is what happened this is just my opinion they forgot what everything that God had done for them they started to look at the things they didn't understand the things that didn't make sense a minister who had hurt them a friend who betrayed them and it became unbelief and they kept letting that be fed and let be fed until it just turned into Rebellion now as brother Paul always says I always like to caveat this I'm not writing anyone off I believe most if not all of them will come back someday but this is the problem they forgot what God had done for them the second thing that happens when we forget what God's done is it makes us do foolish things we tend to do things we probably never would have done when we keep our mind on God and what he's doing when we're remembering what the works that God has done we tend to look for are what our purpose is what are the things that God is calling us to do um as brother Boaz was also teaching in Sunday school so often we leave our purpose undone and why because we forgot what it is that God is doing for us what he has done for us and what and then in turn what he's calling us to do and the last thing and probably the scariest thing in my opinion is not remembering causes us to anger God and how many times did it happen with the children of Israel at one point Moses had to throw himself in front of God and the children and say God don't do it because it's so angered God that they couldn't remember everything that they had done and sometimes I often wonder why we don't have a greater understanding of how this affects God because how does it affect us when we do something for someone and they forget or they don't acknowledge it or they don't make it seem like it was as big a deal as we thought it was we get hurt we get sad sometimes we get angry sometimes we quit being friends with them probably shouldn't do that but it happens if if that's how it makes us feel how much more would it make God who literally gave his son to shed his blood for our sins none of us no matter how great something is you've done none of us have gone to this level for anyone else so we have to understand how this makes God feel and it's important to God that we remember we're going to get a little technical here a little bit so let's try not to fall asleep I'll try to whoops keep it interesting when it comes to memory we have three types of memory we have sensory memory and this memory allows us to remember sensory information so when we come into a room the sights The Sounds the smells things that we feel this is your sensory memory that's what allows you to remember those the second is your short-term memory now your short-term memory rely allows you to recall specific information for a very short period of time um the human brain can only store your short-term memories depending on what article you read anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds and the average person can only retain about five five to nine items in the short-term memory at one time and and that kind of varies depending on the person and the last type of memory is your long-term memory now this is any memory that you can recall after 30 seconds and long-term your long-term memory can last from days to decades and there's one important thing that I want to point out because we're going to talk a lot about your long-term memory is even though theoretically your long-term memory is infinite long-term memories can be lost the only way to keep them to really keep them is to constantly think about them to bring them up to remember them to recite them to share them when you do that it keeps you from losing those long-term memories so even though we like to think once it's a long-term memory it's safe it's not foreign again after you reach 40 that becomes even more true now when you get into kind of the long-term memory there's five stages that a memory has to go through before it becomes semi-permanent first you have the sensing and it involves being exposed to scenes or situations so when you're in you know you walk into the church building all of a sudden your brain is starting to sense different things that we talked about the smells the sights The Sounds the things you touch and so that starts in your your sensing and then your brain starts to encode what it's saying it's feeling and receiving and the the volume and complexity of what your brain uh or is what is passed to your brain through this sense your sensory um sorry your senses it's too great for your brain to process all at one time and so what happens is your brain starts to choose things to focus on and to remember um and a lot of times it's the unusual things that our brain will remember um so when you walk into this room as big as it is and we're all in here it would be hard to remember every item of clothing everyone's wearing what everyone's hair looks it's just too much information so your brain has to pick things um that it wants to remember um sorry Kenny I'm going to pick on you but if Kenny walked up here and started playing the piano in a rhinestone coat I guarantee you all would remember that why because it's unusual it's a little strange a little out of the ordinary so that's something you would remember but you may not remember you know what brother Brandon is wearing sitting down here in the second row your brain has to pick and choose what it's going to remember once it starts to encode the information that it's see it's seeing in order to really root those memories it starts to consolidate what's essential and it starts to to encode and and um put together into a stable long-term memory everything that it's sensing that process uh strengthens the signals between the neurons in your brain and you need that in order to recall the memory later once you get past the consolidation part you get into storage so this is where um the brain has to store it so it's easily accessible to you later when you want to recall the memory um the full memory however isn't stored your brain stores traces of the memory so again walk into this room you might see smell hear everything but even after the brain has kind of picked and chose what it wants to remember even in that it only stores traces of it so that when you recall that memory your brain kind of puts it all together to remember the full memory the last piece is retrieval so thousands of events can be stored as memory traces but they're useless if you can't retrieve them so this is kind of the important part While most memories will never be used some memories can be brought forward through retrieval cues so when you hear a song and that song reminds you of something when you smell something and that smell reminds you of a memory that's kind of what's going on in your mind and so once the memory Trace is activated so once something activates those traces to kind of bring that memory back the more that happens the more likely it is that it'll be reactivated in the future so again when God has done something for us if we constantly are talking about that we're sharing our testimony we're sharing the blessings that God has brought to us the more we do that the more likely when we need that memory that we'll be able to bring it back up so again I'm just laying a foundation of why it's so important as I said before creating memories is an active process especially if you want those memories to become long-term you you have to to consciously say to yourself this is something that I want to remember so that it will become a long-term memory otherwise you risk it being a short-term memory you walk out of the room and you don't remember in Deuteronomy 4 and 23 the scripture says take heed unto yourself and this means be on your guard and watch yourself lest ye forget the Covenant of the Lord your God which he made with you and make you a Graven image of the likeness of anything which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee so again scripture is telling us be careful not to forget watch yourself he God is reminding us of something that we need to do again this active process of remembering but because sorry I'm stumbling over my words but I have to imagine that the children of Israel didn't set out to forget what God had done for them but on the same token they didn't set out to remember either and that's where the problem happened and so as Christians we're we don't wake up in the morning and think I don't want to remember anything that God did yesterday but because we're not doing the opposite which is to remember what he's done that is essentially what we're doing so again that memory consolidation is the process where our brain converts short-term memories into long-term memories in short-term memories again uh tend to be quite Limited in terms of how long they last and so that memory consolidation works by rehearsing or recalling the information over and over and over again so these neural networks become strengthened so for example if you're studying material regularly over a long period of time those Pathways involved in remembering that information will start to be strengthened and you're more likely to remember that in the future another example is you know we have paths out here in the woods and if you were to go out there every day and walk those paths the more often you walk them the more familiar you become and the easier it is to walk that path again just like our Christian walk the more that we're walking with Christ the more that we're dwelling on what it is that he has for us the more that we're remembering His blessings the easier this life becomes the children of Israel if they had just remembered what God had done for them what he had promised think how much easier going sorry going through the desert would have been how much easier it would have it had been when the spies came back and told them all that they had saw for them to say didn't sound that hard if God can do all that he's done this is this is nothing just think that they would have stepped into the promise that they had waited over 400 years for it and instead they were left in the desert I want to go back a little bit again and talk about the three types of memory so again the sensory memory is that sight touch sound and smell and as I was reading up on these types of memories it got me to thinking that your sensory memory is a lot like your flesh we come into church as Believers and we see things we see shouting we see praying we see the Lord touching people we hear things we hear sermons we feel things God you know emotions are great I'm not knocking emotions but it's got to be more than that and we see that that's our sensory memory that's our flesh and too often as Christians that's where we stop we feel something we're like this is great but what happens is the moment that feeling subsides you don't remember it you don't remember what it is that God did we have to get past the sensory memory so then you get into your short-term memory now this is what I like to to um to say is and we'll get into where I kind of came up with some of this in a minute but your short-term memory is your soul this is the believer who goes to a camp or a special service and God does something for them and they truly are touched they're truly God is truly doing a work in them they're genuine about what's happened but they leave and they go home life gets in the way trials start happening Temptations come and they start to grow cold and they find themselves in the same circumstances of the children of Israel they've forgotten what it is that God's done I'm going to quit doing that in a minute they forget what God has done for them it's a short-term memory God had done something for them but they didn't dwell on it meditate on it search out the scriptures get into their prayer closet and talk with the Lord build that relationship enough that it became long-term now your long-term memory I see is our spirit this is the place that if we can build those memories of what God's done for us that when life's circumstances come when the world starts closing in around us when we start to feel our weakest when we're beaten down to our lowest something in that long-term memory in our spirit cries out I remember I remember that he said by his stripes I'm Healed I remember that he said ask and I shall receive I remember that he said he will never leave me I remember that he said the righteous will not be forsaken that his children will not be seen begging for bread I remember that scripture says knock and it shall be opened unto you I remember that he said that if I believe I will have eternal life this is where we have to get to that long-term memory again we don't sit around and and have to and I want to be careful that I don't kind of walk over what I've already said but we have to make a conscious decision to make something a long-term memory but once that long-term memory is there we don't have to think about it every day we have to you know constantly bring it up and remember it to make sure it stays there but we don't have to think about it every day but we have to think about it enough then when something happens in our life that we need that that we need to remember what God's done for us we don't have to make the conscious decision to think about it something Wells up within us that we don't know where it's coming from to say I remember amen so why why is it so important for us to remember why do I and why did God harp on it so much that we need to remember it's because remembering brings praise into our lives remembering brings stability it brings peace it brings comfort I know many of you can uh can attest to this but I point to brother Paul because him and I you know both lost our fathers about the same time what brings us comfort one we know we'll see him again but the other is the memories we can talk about our fathers we can talk about the things that they they taught us we can share with people those memories keep them alive to us they bring us hope they bring us peace it's the same thing with Christ so often we wonder Where's God in our circumstances he's probably just waiting for you to talk about him he's probably just waiting for you to say something to to remember how much it is that he's done for you amen there's so much power in Remembering God's goodness truly remembering it making it a part of who you are a part of your spirit on the other hand there's so much danger in forgetting every time the children of Israel forgot the Lord and what they had he had done for them it led them into captivity idolatry and oppression the very thing that they complained about was what they ended up in all because they couldn't remember and finally go back to the slide I keep I think we're on the wrong way sorry can you bring that back up Genie that's the one I wanted thank you I know I've probably told this story before but I love this story and it fits so well it just kind of came to my mind as I was studying but this is a picture of Horatio spafford I believe is how you pronounce his last name and he's the gentleman who wrote the song it is well and I've mentioned this before but for those of you who don't know the story of this gentleman in this song um Horatio was actually a very successful attorney and real estate agent um he but he lost his fortune in the Chicago Fire in 1871. about the same time that he lost his fortune his four-year-old son died of scarlet fever his family had been going through so much he decided they should take a trip but he had some business he sent his wife and his four daughters on a ship to England ahead of him halfway through their trip there was an accident and the ship sank and when Horatio's wife was the only one survived there's over 200 people that perished all four of his daughters died his wife made it back to England and she sent him a telegram and the only thing that it said I have this right it said saved alone what shall I do so here's a man that lost everything he had lost his son was trying to find some comfort with his family ended up losing the rest of his children as a parent I can't imagine anything worse could you imagine how he must be feeling could you imagine his flesh the last thing he probably wanted to talk about and think about was the blessings that God had given him it's probably the last thing that he wanted to do so when his wife sent him the telegram he immediately boarded a ship for England to be with her when the ship that he was on reached the point where the ship that his family had perished on had went down the captain called him out on deck and pointed it out to him and as he stood there and he looked at the location the place that was the last spot his four daughters were on in this Earth where he never got to say goodbye whereas a father I'm sure he felt his heart had been ripped out in that spot the words the song It is Well came to him the grace and mercy of God what God had done for him they weren't a sensory memory for him it wasn't a Feeling it wasn't something that he felt but then quickly forgot it wasn't a short-term memory that comfort him as long as he was successful it had become a long-term memory so ingrained in his spirit so anchored deep down in his love for God that even at the greatest tragedy that could befall any parent his Spirit cried out I remember my lot thou has taught me to say It Is Well with My Soul this is where God wants us to be he wants us if anyone had a reason to look at their circumstances it was this man and I some may not appreciate this but if anyone had a right to be angry with God it was this man he had lost everything time and time and time again and imagine what was going through his head as he stood there on the deck of that ship and as I was studying I was thinking about that I thought God I don't know that these words would have been what came to me but I want to be that I want to be the kind of person that no matter what happens I can say God has brought me through enough that I know he'll bring me through this it doesn't matter it does not matter what the enemy does because God will bring me through it amen church we have to remember what God has done for us we have to meditate on it daily it can't be something that we just on Sundays and Wednesdays we come here and let brother Paul meditate on it and tell us I love brother Paul and the rest of the ministers I love what they do and I appreciate what they do but my relationship with Christ has nothing to do with them if something was to happen to them whether it be that God take them from this Earth whatever it be that can't stop me from serving the lord we're all humans I'm sure I've disappointed them not yet but you might at some point disappoint me I don't know hopefully not but maybe but I have to be I have to be okay with that to say that doesn't matter the Christ that speaks to them through me that's what's important not in the humanness what we do because we are human we're going to make mistakes amen and to to remember what Christ has done to us to sing his Praises is it's not just important when things are going well it's most important when things are going horribly when your life is falling apart like Horatio when you've lost everything and you probably want to curl up and say God take me now that's when you need to remember that's when you need to praise that's when you need to thank the Lord for His blessings amen and again we have to count our blessings and it's not just for us it's for our children it's for our children's children when I have two two sons now when something goes wrong in our lives they're watching how I react to that and I'm going to be honest like brother Dix was on Sunday I don't always react no 90 of the time I don't react the right way I'm trying to get better but that's why this is important because if we're dwelling on the things of God when these things happen we will react better because it's it's not even our flesh that's reacting it's something so deep down that we don't even understand why we're doing what we're doing amen I can this is kind of a long quote but I want to kind of uh remind you because I know we all know this where I got um the point I was making about the sensory memory being the flesh the short-term memory being our soul and the long-term memory being our spirit so brother Branham is talking about kind of the gateways of what controls us our spirit our soul he says now there's one way to get into the body how's this body controlled now watch real close now and get your pencils ready here's the gate on this side that goes into the body one two three four five now you got that drawn now the first gate is see smell hear taste and touch or feel the sensors it's your sensory memory now that's the senses in the body is that right how many knows that six senses control the body now we got a soul after you get through this the senses is outside that's the outer system now in here there's one two three four five five attributes in the soul now you run and write them down the first one is Imagination the second one is conscience and the third one is memory and the fourth one is reason and the fifth one is affection now did you get them all if you don't then let me know you got them all down see taste feel smell and hear the body that's the opening to the body the soul is Imagination conscience memory reason and affection is the senses or the attributes like the senses of the Soul sorry if I went uh sorry I had to split this into two because it's kind of long and the soul is the nature of the spirit that's on the inside because the soul only puts out an atmosphere of what's on the inside of you it takes the place of sanctification the soul sits in the same category there now everybody got that all down now to this gate there's only one gate so the gate to your spirit that's called self-will you're the boss of what goes on in here filled with the Holy Spirit here and this becomes God's judgment seat where God sits in your heart and if you do something wrong say oh my I did wrong some people say I don't it don't condemn me to wear short hair it don't condemn me to wear manicure or makeup it don't condemn me to go to dances it don't condemn me to tell a little white lie it doesn't condemn me to do to play bridge at my bridge party you know it ain't got nothing to condemn they don't hurt my conscience you got no I love his little sayings you got no more conscience than a snake has hips you ain't got no conscience there ain't nothing there to hurt you you're of the world but I challenge you to let Jesus Christ come in here and try to do it one time brother you'd be soaking them you'll back off and shake your head from that thing just as certain as I'm standing here because he's holy listen I'm quoting the scripture if you love them things that's the world things of the world it's because of the love of God is not even in you so again brother Branham tells us the gates to the body are the senses see smell taste touch and feel that's your sensory memory it allows us to remember things that we sense and as I was talking is when God deals with us sometimes we feel things sometimes we feel emotions there's nothing wrong with that but it's got to go deeper it's got to go deeper than the body it's got to go deeper than the flesh so then the gates to the soul or your imagination conscience memory reason and affection this is your short-term memory this is where you can reason and decide if this is a memory that you want to make permanent to make a long-term memory now when you get to the spirit you have self-will this is your long-term memory again it takes a conscious action to continually dwell and meditate on what God's done to turn that into a long-term memory that's your self-willed that's your spirit amen you make the decision to consolidate memories into something more we anchor the things of Lord deep in our spirit and that's a decision that we make God's not going to force things on us so this is where I kind of Drew those parallels between what brother Brandon was saying the body the soul and the spirit and those three types of memory um I want to kind of share a testimony have only shared it with a couple of people here in the congregation but that kind of started me on this path of thinking about this and so about a year and a half and a year year and a half ago in June of 2021 I had been working from home for a year due to covid and we got called back into the office so so it was our first day back and I had been in the office probably 20 minutes and I sat down at my desk and I got an email from the HR department I got one and the other leaders in my department all got one and so didn't tell us what it was about just said we'd set up meetings um within the first two minutes of that meeting we were told they were letting go of the entire leadership team and we had five minutes we weren't even allowed to pack up our desk to grab what we could grab and that we were everyone was being escorted off campus I'm going to be honest with you again like brother Diggs I didn't have the best attitude I was angry I was upset I felt despair this was two weeks before Betsy gave birth to Casper I was worried about what am I going to do for insurance how I'm going to pay for the next year we all know how many times you have to go to the doctor the first year of a child's life I was upset that there had been no warning there had been the you know no one had said hey you're not fulfilling your job requirements it was just we've decided to change how we do things you all have five minutes it's been nice knowing you I've been there eight years and so I remember I was really upset um again being very honest I was so upset that the VP of the department had asked me please don't tell anyone this is happening we want to let them know ourselves so I immediately opened my office door and told the entire department honestly I was that upset I'm going to be honest I didn't react very well um I was stressed I was trying to figure out how am I going to go home and tell my wife you're having a baby in two weeks we have no income only a couple of months worth of insurance you know how does that make you feel so I remember Drive riding my car and I was just upset and I was thinking about all the horrible things that could happen and why me and why did I put so much of my time and effort in this job who they apparently didn't care enough about me to give me more warning than just five minutes and I remember as I was doing this and again this was nothing that I did this was all God I remember I was doing this and I was just being negative and I was worrying and I I really didn't want to go home I was trying to figure out where can I go so I don't have to go home and tell my wife right now what can I do to kind of buy me some time and all of a sudden the negative thoughts stopped and something inside said nope and I remember I said this in my head and I remember it happening I said God you told me when I couldn't do it you could I can't I'm done I'm not worrying about it I'm not talking about it I'm not trying I'm not going to try nothing I'm going to go home I'm going to tell my wife what happened I'm gonna tell her everything's gonna be okay and we'll wake up tomorrow and see what happens now if you know me this is not my typical response it's why I say this wasn't me there was something in me that remembered something that I heard time and time again that when we need him the most when when we can't carry that burden he would be there for us now I will tell you that for most of my life my dream has been to work for myself has been to start my own business but I never took the leap because I got married I had kids and I couldn't justify doing it because anyone who runs their own business knows it's not easy I went home that day and I told my wife she was a little freaked out that I was so calm and positive about it because again not my natural reaction but I remember her looking at me and saying it'll be all right we'll figure it out and I will tell you all it took for me is the Lord laid on my heart to send out a quick message to all of my colleagues that I'd worked with over the years I'm no longer at my job I'm open to work in the last year and a half God not me built my business I've not gone after one client every single client I have Has Come to Me by Word of Mouth every time one project finishes I'll turn my wife and I say I don't know where the money is going to come from but God will figure it out I literally get a call within a day are you open to another project and again I don't say that for myself because I didn't do it trust me again if you know me this was not me but God showed me that if I would just remember his promises and place that on hit on him place that in his hands he would take care of it and I will tell you every single time we got to a place where you know the clients were thin or maybe I had to figure out where to get some more money coming in with another client every single time instead of and again anyone who knows me I've always said I'm waiting for the day I can be the grumpy old guy and no one will get offended this has been my dream and some reason God is making me more positive and I'm not quite sure it's throwing me off a bit but every single time that's happened instead of dwelling on well I've got to figure this out well where's this money coming from my wife and I are just like well we're going to see what God's going to do and every single time he's done it every single time and and the funny thing is is my wife and I's relationship has been better I'm happier our family is closer the Lord has opened doors that I'm able to on a Friday say you know what I'm not working I'm going on the co-op field trip I did it last weekend I'll probably do it again Friday but it's because I work for myself I never could have done those things when when someone asked me to come and preach I don't have to say well I've got to figure out how I can take days off work and see if I can take vacation I just say okay I'm coming God did all of that and it's brought peace and comfort to my life it's brought all of these things that had I tried to do it on my own I wouldn't have and again I'm not saying this about me this was God every single bit of it but I wanted to give an example of what how God is showing me that if we just remember what it is that he's done that he will take care of us oh wow time's fine I'm going to come to close here in a minute but here here's the thing too that I love about this subject as much as you look at scripture of how many times God says remember remember and if brother Rapp is listening he'll appreciate this because I use this word in Sunday school and he was happy he said I'm the first person that's ever used it correctly I love the juxtaposition of what I consider God's greatest gift which is our ability to remember so he gives us our ability to remember all that he's done for us because it brings us that peace that Comfort amen but the opposite of that and sometimes even more important is he's also a blessed also blessed us with his inability to remember our sins it's important for us to remember that he doesn't remember any of it it's amazing to me that something that is so important for our lives the opposite is also so important for our lives Isaiah 43 25 says I even I am he that bloodeth out thy transgression for my own sake and will not remember thy sins that should be something that that alone that one scripture if we had nothing else in this book but that one scripture that enough for us to meditate on every single day enough for us to wake up every morning be like I got this nothing else matters that alone one line and yet so often like the children of Israel we have how many of those lines and we forget we let the circumstance we let the devil come into our lives and try to get us to focus on the things that don't matter my job didn't matter my ability to bring in an income didn't matter when the children of Israel went into the desert when did God ever say how many of you know how to find food in the desert he didn't because their ability didn't matter he was going to provide it why are we not understanding that he's going to do the same thing for us you know if you're like me oftentimes you think you know when I have a need come up God it doesn't seem like God's meeting that need and I've waited guess what sometimes he requires us to wait a little bit he's not punishing us he's just waiting to see are you going to remember are you going to remember what I've done no matter how long it takes me to meet the need are you going to remember and it's hard it's trust me I I grew up in circumstances that caused me to have to rely on myself a lot it is very very hard Kyle knows what I'm talking about he kind of grew up the same way it is very hard for me as a Christian to rely and I'm being honest fully on God I say it I believe it but when it comes to rubber meeting the road a lot of times I'm like God I know you can meet this need but I'm going to help you out I'm going to try to do it my way and he'll let me he's let me off a lot of times sometimes it works out but it never works out quite the way it would have if I let God do it amen in 1953 in the sermon Israel and the church brother Brandon said this oh honey you give me this good book to read and I read here where it says the sea ain't got no bottom and Jesus said he put my sins in the sea of forget excuse me forgetfulness forever said they're still going hallelujah hallelujah that's right sure still going ain't got no bottom see it up on top there they just come right on down keeps going oh my just keep on going Hallelujah that's right and I read that because I love how I kept saying how deep it was and there was no bottom and it just kept going because as much as I've talked about tonight that in order for us to take part in the promises of God that we have to bury those memories so deep that they become long-term memories even as deep as we need those to go it does not match how God how deep God has placed our sins all the things that we're worried about well God how could you love me God how could you do this for me because X Y and Z he has no idea what we're talking about God sees us through the blood of Christ he sees us in our perfection God God remembered Abraham not as a liar but the father of our faith he didn't see Moses as a murderer he didn't see Moses as a doubter he saw Moses as a deliverer David wasn't a murderer and an adulterer David was a man after his own heart he didn't say Rahab as an adulterer he saw Rahab it's an ancestor to Christ God doesn't see us the way we see ourselves God doesn't remember the things that we remember and see again this is that juxtaposition that God wants us to remember what he does but he's telling us forget your sins because I forgot him stop dwelling on the things that I don't care about because I don't even remember them so again our memory is important in one sense but in the other it also hinders us when and again it's that memory that comes from our flesh remembering all the bad things and what is it it's the devil that's trying to get us again to dwell on the things that are wrong what we need to do is remember what God has done you have to let those promises sink past your senses your flesh and meditate on them until they become those long-term rooted memories in your spirit and here's something to something to remember excuse me we will all remember what's important to us if Christ is important to you if what he's done is important to you if his blessings blessings are important to you you'll remember them because I will tell you we don't have trouble remembering our Hobbies we don't have trouble remembering um our sins we don't have trouble so why do we have trouble remembering what God's done because we forget how important it is to us but if we if we were just ourselves to constantly remember every time we wake up to remember what's important is what God's done in my life what God's doing for me stop looking at I'm not where I want to be and remember you're not where you were that's God's blessing you know and I don't want to say that we shouldn't be always striving to grow in Christ and to be more spiritual and to and to grow closer to him but if this is as far as God's going to take me praise God I want to go further but if this is what he has for me praise oh I heard someone say one time we as Believers get so wrapped up and I hope I don't get trouble for saying this but so wrapped up in I'm gonna go on a Rapture I'm gonna go into Rapture I'm going to go in a Rapture and he said why does it matter if God is ordained you not to go in it that's where God's ordained you to go that's what should matter what should matter is what God has ordained for us now I'm not saying that we shouldn't believe that we are or and hope for that I'm not saying that we shouldn't strive for more we always should but the Bible also teaches us to be content where God has placed us you know Brother Paul's talked a lot um that it's not about positions it's not about so often we think being more spiritual is rising up in a position or rising up in different things and it's not it's being content where God has brought you where God's bringing you I may not be as spiritual as maybe the next guy but I'm a spiritual as God's wanting me right now as long as I'm keeping my mind on him and I'm always asking him God what do you want from me where are you sending me as long as I'm doing that as long as he is my focus and I'm remembering his promises and what he's called me to do I'm where God wants me that's what's most important musicians if you want to come I'm going to close on this so again from Genesis Genesis to Revelation scripture reveals the power that God has placed in remembering not only for our sake but for our children's sake and our children's Children's sake there's so much power that comes just from remembering what God has done I read an article as I was studying this and the gentleman who wrote this article at the end he sums up perfectly kind of my thought and he says this he says it's time that we recapture the gift of remembering in a generation that doesn't know the story the message or the person of Jesus we need we need more than ever to remember ourselves and to find compelling ways to retell his story to every people group and culture not to get lost in Nostalgia but but to be released into fresh Faith and Hope fueled by the certainty that God is the same yesterday today and forever what he promised he will surely fulfill that is a simplicity of Christ we make it so much harder than it needs to be we're always I was talking to someone the other day we're always looking for some new deep truth so that we can see more we can seem more spiritual but if we would just focus on that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and what he promised and what he did for the children of Israel what he did for all of his children in the Bible he will do for us today those promises were not just for them they were for us as well but the only way for us to step into them for us to to use the gifts that he's given us as we first have to remember we have to remember what he said we have to remember what he's done in our lives amen oh I I hope the stirring that God has put in my soul has come across tonight I know it seems like a simple thought to remember but I I've found as Christians just like the children of Israel it can be one of the hardest things we do because we rely too much on our senses what we see what we feel enough I I won't mention names but there's a sister that we all know who's going through health issues right now and I've been so blessed with talking with her family of no matter what's happening them saying God will take care of it it's okay no matter what the doctors tell us no matter what's happening no matter what it might look like it's going to be okay it's going to work out and I will tell you from conversations that I've had with other people who have witnessed this their testimony is reaching other people there's other people that I know who have left this message who are witnessing that and are starting to ask questions they're starting to wonder how how do they have that faith how do they trust so much and I know they're asking those questions because they've asked me I've had those conversations so again our remembering isn't always just for us sometimes it's for others sometimes it's just to spark enough faith in them that God can begin to build their testimony because once God can build their testimony and they start to share that then he's going to start to build someone else's and before you know it the last person the last testimony that God's looking to build will be built and we'll finally be able to step over in that Promised Land but we have to take heed of what happened to the children of Israel and to remember to always remember what God's done for us amen amen brother kidding if you want to come I just want to say I love you guys all tonight and I hope I didn't keep you too late but as I came up here tonight and I don't mean to keep going on my only wish my only hope and I I sat here this afternoon in this front row and just prayed was it it's not about me it's not about how eloquent I am it's not about how smart I can sound but it's about what God what what one word or two words that God can use to touch one of you guys if I can walk out of here tomorrow and this is last time brother Paul ever asked me to stand here but somebody was stirred enough to tomorrow when they wake up to say God thank you what you've done for me I'm good I'm done that'll be enough for me and so I hope tonight that that's happened I pray that it's happened but at the same time I'm not going to worry about it it's not my job that's God's job so I love you all and I hope the Lord blesses you abundantly for the rest of the week brother Gideon [Music] reality [Music]
