something praise the Lord praise the Lord amen we'll have uh just to change the order of the service I believe Brother Sam speaking tonight so let's all stand tonight I want to sing this one the song

thee my bless Christ surrender all amen so good to be here it's good to be gathered together in his presence and I just um just pondering over just of the moments even on the drive over here is we all have so many needs and our needs are so diverse God we need him to come and to minister to every every need and I believe that's what we've come for we we need to hear from him there's lives and hearts Among Us that truly God's here to give you a real experience and there's lives and hearts that God is here to give us a fresh experience and to direct us and help us that our lives might move on further and deeper in him the real truth of the matter is it's it's not so much us in our own selves walking as though oh I'm going deeper it's actually just opening and letting him come deeper it's because you you and me we are the Tabernacle of the Living God we just want God to go deeper we want him just to work and move through every area of our life and I say Lord if there's any channel that's that's hindering it all show me help me Lord that that channel might be yielded to you that's what we want you know many times I my father he dealt with some different medical issues and I remember at a certain time we would at times I'd get ready to go out and preach and I'd see him in the in he had an office that was adjacent to mine and he just would be sick to his stomach and we would pray and the Lord would move for him each time but it what it was is that when you got to taking a combination of Medicine sure the Lord would touch him but we had to figure out what was the cause because every time it was the same reoccurrence and so I believe that's how it is in our life is Lord I I know you're my deliverer I Know You're My Healer I know you're my all in all but just help me Lord that the areas of my life that in those areas I can yield them to you and I can better understand what you have for me and how that I'm to live and operate as a son son and daughter of God don't you love him amen so good to be here with you and uh so thankful for the privilege to be able to stand before you it's certainly a counted a great honor and certainly have a lot of high regards for brother Paul and brother Barry and uh I think about it you know brother Paul I thought 10 years ago was the first time that I had ministered in a winter youth retreat and boy I didn't know that my life was going to change after that it was right right after that where the decision was made I stepped away from teaching my I didn't know 10 years ago but who what God has in store who knows but I just want to be ready just want to be ready amen let's just go to him in a word of prayer amen could we just pray together Heavenly Father Lord we're just looking to you Lord so thankful for your mercy Lord here Among Us Your Grace Lord Lord Jesus we are certainly needy of you Lord every one of us Lord Lord how we need Lord a a fresh touch from you Lord father I I pray that God that here Lord as these Services have already started there Lord with the afternoon session Lord we we understand it doesn't have to be a night meeting for you to move it's when Lord our hearts are open to you Lord you'll keep moving after the night service is over you move through the devotions you move Lord in the afternoon sessions Lord we put no restrictions on you Lord for any work and what is to be achieved you're God and we just Lord want to take all limitations off and just desire you to move Lord minister to us Lord through every service Lord may you guide us and help us Lord I pray every one of us working together Lord for there's one reason that we're here and that's Lord Jesus to see you and to see you glorified that our lives would be changed further changed Lord we would receive further Direction Lord by your spirit we just give ourselves to you and ask if there's anything that we've said or done Lord that would be displeasing to you please forgive us Lord May the same inspiration Lord that's my prayer that you'll come and be the speaker here tonight Lord I I need you Lord the thought you've laid on my heart but Lord I need you to come and deliver it so would you give me the grace to step out of the way Lord may you just take Lord and speak to us tonight just every all the things Lord what we have need of we we just stand here Lord just looking to you we give ourselves to you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you would I'd like you to turn with me in the in the scriptures here to Jonah chapter 1 and I just want to we want to read just a few verses of scripture as we're gathered here in um just beginning in verse one now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of am saying arise go to Nineveh that great City and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me but Jonah rose up to flee unto tarus from the presence of the Lord and went down to japa and he found a ship going to tares so he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tares from the presence of the Lord I want you to notice this in verse four but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty Tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken then the Mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his God and cast forth the Wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them but Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep so the shipmaster came to him and said unto him what meanest thou Oh Sleeper everybody else is alarmed Jonah is the only one sleeping what meanest thou Oh Sleeper arise call upon thy God if so be that God will think upon us that we perish not and they said everyone to his fellow come and let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us so they cast lots and the lot fell upon Jonah then said they unto him tell us we pray thee for whose cause this evil is upon us what is thine occupation and whence comest thou what is thy country and of what people art thou and he said unto them I am in Hebrew and I fear the lord the god of Heaven which made the Sea and the dry land then were the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him why hast thou done this for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord because he told them just like to just speak just a very simple thought that's actually a question what are you doing here what are you doing here amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I think it's one thing that is very clear that the message of the hour has brought us so aware of and we can see it through the scripture that we realize that the presence of the Lord Lord It's the very person of Jesus Christ it's God himself so it's more than a feeling it's more than an emotion oh how we love to feel him how we love that but the presence of the Lord is him that's who he is it's his word and so we find that as it brings it so simple that we see over and over through the scriptures that when a person themselves comes into the presence of God and really will humble themselves in God's presence then there is a change that comes into that person's life that can never be gotten away from it's something that changes them from just time to Eternity we find it within Moses Moses had heard the word he had been around the word but when he got into the presence of almighty God then his life was changed God began to speak to him regarding that word that he had heard he had rehearsed he even had tried to live it and then he had got to such a place he was so frustrated in that he wasn't seeing things turn out the way that he thought it should turn out so he just thought I'll just get away from it and I'll just forget all about it so he tried to occupy himself going out there we know he fled and he went out from Egypt and he tried to get away from everything and what he had known and what he was looking at and he was trying to run from was his failure but God you know one thing about it is that what God has a promise for you and you're a part of that promise you're never going to escape that promise and purpose that God has for your life so when you think about that question that we look at here tonight what are you doing here and and I'm not just so much talking about at this at the winter youth retreat I'm talking about where you are in your own life where you are in in your part part in your journey no matter what age you are no matter how long you've been serving God no matter where you're at in your journey with the Lord there's still a question that arises what are you doing here because we understand that God has a purpose in us being here God is not God has not just brought us here to see if he could do it but God has a purpose in it and the prophet tells us like this in why Christ speak he says if we can find the purpose that God has brought us here for oh how that we'll save ourselves a lot of trouble and we'll save God a lot of trouble and you know even when God makes known his purpose because we realize the ultimate purpose when we talk about the will of God and I want to know God's will for this and I want to know God's will for this well there is many different Avenues of things in our life that I believe as a Believer and as a child of God there's a reverence in our life to see that there's a value in knowing God's will you can even look at examples maybe it's examples you've had had an extended family it's examples you've had before you where you've been able to see my I I look at that situation maybe if they would have only been a little bit more careful but anytime you ever see anything like that it's always an opportunity for you to look at it not down on the person but to look and say God help me and teach me what it is that I can glean from that in my life if I am seeing it in this way you've not did it so that I could be critical or become lifted up but it's something about it I need need your grace to teach me Lord and help me that's what the prophet even when he would go into his own life even as we look down through the scriptures God never chose through the scriptures to ever hide the humanity of the men that he chose to use down through the scriptures God could have chose to do that but God wanted you and I to see that so that you and I could receive comfort and strength and realize in our own life that God in Me is greater than all of my Humanity he's greater than all my mistakes he's greater than all my failures he's greater than even what my own thoughts are concerning my own life God is so far greater and so when we consider this and look at the question what we're doing here it brings us back to always looking in our own lives I find the prophet doing this over and over think about brother randam laying in his bed and then he receives the visitation beyond the curtain of time and when he thinks he's laying on the bed and he asked he asks he looks to himself he says here you are 50 years old and what have you done for the Lord now I don't know about you but I I would never expect the prophet to have asked that question to himself yeah probably if I had been standing there that day I would have said hey wait wait wait wait wait let me give you a list of what you have done let me give you an accomplishment of the word that's been ministered that would reach and the healing and all the Miracles that's been done but you see it's something about with the the child of God when God moves upon your heart there's always a desire knowing there's a next move there's another Tomorrow there's a purpose it's if I'm still here then God's purpose is not finished and so if I'm here there's nothing can take me out of this Earth until the purpose of God is finished so if we can bring that into the context we realize that there's nothing else in this life that really matters or should take PR idence or preeminence outside of the purpose of God and once we've caught a hold of the purpose of God which is to be filled with the spirit of God and allow God to begin to unfold in your life what he has for you to do God will begin to unpack that in our life and he doesn't do it all at once he does it little by little and when what he's calling us to do he prepares us to be able to handle it that's the same way it was was in the days of creation what good would it have done to have created all the wonderful uh uh uh you know uh Wells and things like that if there was no water for him to swim in but God makes preparation one day to sustain what's coming on the next day that's frankly why you and I are here in an age that is totally unfit for humans to live in an age of neurotic pressure and tension but God himself by his word that he already has promised in here and now in this generation he sold that word through him by the mouth of a prophet and here we are benefiting from the word in this hour living by God's grace with a San mind that's the grace of almighty God to be able to look at things with a clear purpose you as young men to be able to recognize the responsibility that's set before you as a young man as a young lady recognizing this and being being able to overcome the thoughts of Lady oia Satan zeden I'm telling you right now you may not feel like a miracle but you're a miracle God has provided for you he provided for me that we could live sane in this hour and not just sane but Victorious and so when we find this that you know like Moses Moses when he he felt like that you know I've been a failure and so he just ran away and that's listen this when we look at things many times we all all of us come under the same pressure like Jonah was under when it comes time to face responsibilities it's not hard when everybody's patting you on the back it's it's really it's not hard to serve God right here in this atmosphere that we're in that's not hard it's not hard to be bubbling over in this atmosphere now you might have went through something and you might say brother Samuel you don't know my condition but just hold on I believe that God has Grace to break you right out of that situation and not only can you come out of it but you can go deeper and further than you've ever been before don't set any limitations on God what you receive this morning say God I want more tonight when devotions come tomorrow I want more when the afternoons when the morning session I want more afternoon session I want more I want to be so filled like a sponge when I have come to a point of saturation when I walk out of here there is no more that I can hold I can say God I've been overwhelmed things that I can pray about and things that I can take with me from here I've been encouraged you see Moses when he he ran away I don't know how we're here but we're here Moses when he ran away but you know what he couldn't escape God's plan for his life God knew right where Moses had to be you know God knows how to get you in I into a place of surrender let me just let me just point it to you like this you can be a you can be individuals Holy Ghost filled sitting right in the church and God is calling you to do something and you look at and say this one would be better this person's more qualified this person listen that's not anything new the prophet when he was when it was made known to him what his commission was he told the angel of the Lord I ain't going to be able to do that you need to find somebody else you see it's always something when God ask us to do something we look at it through our own human abilities but God is not calling you based on your human abilities God is calling you because he knows what he has placed inside of you if that's what he's talking to sure we have ears on our head sure we have a mind that the word when we hear the word the word has to pass through our mind and come down into our soul but listen that's not the stopping place it's coming down to the soul it's that part of God that he always knew that's what God's speaking to and sometimes we're the ones who get in the way and we look at our own lives and say that's not possible let me tell you everyone down through the scripture that God has ever asked to do something it has been individuals that you and I would have never qualified as candidates for the job who would call a man and a woman to receive a son who the woman had been Barren all along who would do such a thing as that who would call a man who was a scaredy cat and call him a mighty man of Valor I tell you who would do that the same God that's called you the same God that spoke to your life so I just say we need to just right here tonight the prophet would say it over and over he said you're wanting somewhere to put your foot you've been praying for a moment to put your foot down this is your moment he said whatever you have been he said you've been a failure he said maybe as a housewife a failure as this maybe you've been a failure as a student maybe you've been a failure as a Christian a failure but listen let me tell you what a Vindicated Prophet said he said let that be a has been and start fresh tonight I thank God for Fresh Starts that's the promise of the scripture renewing of our mind Hallelujah so here we are in the presence of God you know Cain went out of God's presence that's the biggest mistake he ever made he went out of God's presence and the prophet just simply said it just like this he says when we go out he said of God's of God's presence that's where you or I will make our own mistake sometimes let me just speak just a moment here sometimes we understand that there's times that a person from the beginning we can see it when man can't stand justified in God's presence he will run if there's sin in his life if it's condemnation is that right but there's also a part of it too as we were just saying that sometimes a person can run or flee and try to move away from the responsibility or the issue that God is calling them to face and you never go any further than that that word that you fail to obey God can never go any deeper unless you allow him to move deeper and you know why Jonah brother Bram I love this why Jonah himself he didn't go his thinking brother BR says he thought he looked at himself I'm a Jew you're calling me to go speak to Gentiles they'll never receive it now I'm not going to ask you but I'm sure there are some professional Bridge builders in here tonight some people who you've got some things right now that that'll never happen that'll never be you know negative NES I hope nobody's name Nancy positive pets you know we but but sometimes there's just listen you we're surrounded by negativity come on you you don't even have to look too deep in your app you get notifications that are negative emojis upside down frowns headstands and whatever more negative all around you are a generation that is being bombarded like no other generation help me now if Satan is doing that then what do you think and how much greater Is God moving brother Samuel it don't seem like I should receive from God thumbs up like you or that smiley face emoji but God knows who you are and God's here to encourage you Hallelujah he knows how to discourage you in the wrong things and encourage you in the right things you're his son you're his daughter amen and he was thinking I can't go down there because if I go down there they're not going to receive it so he ran from the presence of the Lord what what God had called him to do but just because he ran from it did not mean he could Escape it he tried to drown it he tried to get away he tried to go as far as he way away that he could from that but you can't get away from God let me read you the scripture out of Psalms 139 I I love the I love this chapter David said in Psalms 139: 7 I mean when David says you know my up my upright in of my downsitting you know my you you be set me all around in other words David said God you know all about me God knows every detail about your life and about my life and you know what God is not trying to perform plastic surgery on your life the holy oh my let me preach now the Holy Ghost is not a performing of plastic surgery it is God coming in and raising up a son and daughter of God and it's God living through your Veil God living through your temperament God don't want you to be like nobody else he's made you the way he has for a purpose for a reason just say God I'm tired of being frustrated with it and looking at this and trying to do this and trying to do that Lord I would just start right here say God deliver me of a from that part to where I feel under the pressure to be like this pressure to be like that just be honest with him say Lord let that so drop in my life Lord David said in Psalms 139:7 whether shall I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence where can I where can I go if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me you know what I love about this we were all like sheep gone astray you can walk here and walk there but God never leaves you it doesn't matter how low you are he'll go right down there and bring you right out oh you may not be low in sin maybe you're low in your spirit maybe you're low in your mind but God knows just exactly where you are he knows just how to find you and give you a fresh strength give you a fresh courage and that you yourself can take dominion over your own nature instead of letting your nature have dominion over you amen that's right you know God had to help sister Bruce with that God wasn't going to change her temperament but he helped her and equipped her to be able to see this is how you're natured you get somebody on your heart and you got to pray for them you can't you you can't stop until you go do it it'd be like you know somebody probably there's some of us in here tonight oh if you feel like man my car my car was left open or this was happen you try to go to sleep I'm just going to commit it in the hands of God and then you realize sleep ain't coming I better go up and check out what's going on you're made that way now some of you were like not me I said Glory praise the Lord but you see how Satan then would want to work on sister brues brother Bram said how God works now Satan wants to work that same way he said he'll put a thought in your mind to make you think you're not a Christian pointing out all your mistakes all your failures all your all those things what is it it's learning what brother Brown was trying to do is help her by the word see the Dominion that is given to her as a daughter of God that she doesn't have to live in defeat any longer I have no doubt if she had been there with brother Bram let's say Sunday after Sunday after Sunday she would have walked out of that office Victorious but you need something more than just say well I I feel real good you need to know how to battle the enemy Amen to know how to battle him to understand even how you're made up Lord have mercy how did we get here my nonetheless David said right there I'm just got to move on David said you're right there I want to just just say it in this way because there's there's an eternal quality to you that's what that's what David was expressing this thought that God has of you let me just say it like that that Eternal part of you is that seed that thought of God on the inside that's what God is working on you ever seen a nail that has maybe a piece of plastic around it sometimes we have that for uh different uh uh uh tasks that we do you know you bring that nail if it's iron or I believe it's iron you bring it near a magnet it'll stick to that magnet but it's not because the plastic it's because of the properties in the nail that are magnetized to the mag to the magnet and that's the same way it is in your life it's not my flesh not my spirit that is magnetized to the word of God it's my soul that's that Eternal part and that's the part that God is working on to bring into cooperation with the purpose that he always had of you Hallelujah this is why brother Brandon would just say it you know in this way he says if I can if you don't mind me quoting this he says if you're a true Christian and truly called like Jonah was God has already got your fair paid get off of the ship going to Tarsus God predestinated you to this life if you're a true called child of God come to Christ come into the fullness of him oh my your way is paid to where it's paid to Nineveh not to tarus you're predestinated and there's a ship leaving right now only thing you've got to do to get on it but if not you'll never have no peace Hallelujah brother Bram you know he goes on he says remember he draws our attention to the scripture I love this God was in the boat the first the scripture we read in our text but the Lord caused the strong wind God knows how to get the attention of his children you know and sometimes God will let you go through things just to let you see the value he's already saw in you I'm telling you God ain't wasting his time with you he's never wasted his time you have value in the sight of almighty God Amen there's no way of getting out of it God was there in the boat was in the storm was in the fish everywhere he turned God was there Hallelujah I think of a brother there back in our assembly older brother now brother rap you would know him older brother and here he here he was he he told me that when he was out there in the world and he said here I am he said I came up around that bar and they were you know they served another another drink and and he said all of a sudden there begin to be a playing of a hymn on on a piano he said' I told him that don't belong here something begin to call out at that moment things begin to turn and to change in his life and he's been a pillar around this message I think he's in his 80s now but I look at that how that God you can't get away from the presence of almighty God I don't want to I don't want to but yet there's pressures that come our way than that we have to face up to I think as you as young people in this in this day and age you are faced we all are but there's more and more pressure that is being placed upon you not just from social media and all these other things but even the way and the direction that the world is going where you are already no doubt some of you have had to take a stand on your jobs and different stands you've had to make and I can tell you this here that if you stand for God he'll stand for you but the way you stand for him is make sure your attitude is also in right with the word you're standing on that's very important not just well this is the word but your attitude must be right upon that word is that all right so you know brother B says he's after you he says Jonah and where Jonah went God was in the boat in the storm in the fish he went on being right along with Jonah until his perfect will was done brother B said if he's after you you might Dodge here Dodge there but you'll be miserable until you do the thing you started out for him to do at the first place don't go run from the presence of God face up to it that's the thing face up to it face the issue nobody else could do it for Jonah is that right Jonah had to do what God told him to do well Lord there's a bet not Jon out called you to do this so you don't want to get out of his presence you want to move into his presence brother B said that's what we're here for he said if you've been a Jonah if you've been wondering which way to go or what to do come on get on the ship with us tonight we're going down to Nineveh to cry out we're letting that tarous ship go on down if they want to we've got a duty before God that's a message that we're responsible for so there's a responsibility that has come with this word a responsibility that God calls us to there's things that were issues to be faced maybe the issue that's to be faced is something that you've tried to run from maybe it's to make something right that you've looked at and said that really don't matter this really don't matter but you've got to face the issue and say God give me the courage to face the issue in the right way because I want to be pleasing to you I want to walk fully with you now here I want to just kind of just just just divert just a moment here on that thought what are you doing here you know there was a man a Prophet by the name of Elijah and Elijah Oh my he was he he had been so anointed when he stood there on Mount Carmel everything he had done he had done it at the word of the Lord I mean there was such a confidence that he had but then when the mind of Christ when it pulled back off of off Elijah the presence of the Lord just you know kind of lifted you you you all know what I'm talking about when you you walk out of service man sometimes on a Sunday or maybe you're coming out of camp and you're thinking whoa where is that devil at he don't worry he's still there I'm not telling you that to hunker down I'm just letting you know that God is strengthening you and equipping you and helping you to see the armor that's already provided for you and no doubt some of you already have he's trying to help you to learn how to use it because what you don't want to be you don't want to go on in your life and then your life become up and down because God's called you to lead a home sisters you you God terries here you are you're going to be the Fifth Gospel there's got to be a standard and what I'm talking about a standard an absolute and mama can't be the absolute daddy can't be the absolute you've got to know Jesus Christ in a personal way to where now you yourself are yolked and high and harnessed and tied to the word of God why if not it'll be however the wind's blowing right now we go this way we go this way after this move and then a you've got to have an anchor in your life something to wear that you know where you're standing let me just put it to you like this that there's no quote that can be given to you that will shake you but you can say man that's a good one and so is this one is that all right I don't think we're cherrypickers here how in the world how what are we doing here here's Elijah man and God asked him the question what doest thou here h e r e here and Elijah said I'm the only one I'm the only one he felt all alone I want ask you to raise your hand but sometimes you can be in the midst of a crowd of people and feel all alone you know me just say like this you know Satan can can re he's very masterful at it hey I'm not bragging up the devil that old that old older little sister said he's a good adversary I'm just trying to expose and tell you what he'll do he can get right into your mind don't underestimate that oh the mind's nothing the Mind listen the word has to pass through the mind and if the word has to pass through the Mind Satan could have never got to even the beginning if she hadn't opened up her mind and started to listen and then it went down that's the same way that he'll come the same way that he'll try to lead you away from the word if he can't get you away from the word then he'll try to isolate you so there becomes your own little world you start living in well the rest of them really don't care for me at church so and so listen I know what I'm talking about I know if you say well brother Samy you're just talking to young people listen what I'm saying right now can go and be applied no matter how old you are we still have to battle against thoughts like that it never stops but Elijah this seemed real I mean when you got somebody that after what has been done on that mount you would think my Lord who couldn't who wouldn't believe but you see what Elijah couldn't see he couldn't see that there was a courage that had come into 7,000 he couldn't see it let me preach now sometimes even I can stand as a pastor and sometimes there's things that I may not see here but God don't always start out here God starts in here right here in this service in these services in my just start out for you wiggling that little pinky yes Lord I'm a Child of God pretty soon you keep wiggling that pinky you'll be doing two fingers pretty soon it'll be a hand pretty soon the hands will be up what it is it it's contagious the spirit of God will move as you let him move in your life but he brings courage to the Inner Man Hey listen those that were up up there praying for the prodical son his mom and dad never saw one fist physical evidence but the prophet tells us the angel of the Lord went there and dealt with his heart so let me say this to you that's what God is getting lined up is your heart is your thoughts is your life but I'm the only one now I don't think any of us I'm not here I'm not here picking on Elijah I know what have lik to where you feel alone and it's real you don't just walk up you know Sister Gabby you don't walk up and just say hey snap out of it God don't work that way sorry God don't work that way you know we talk about well I ain't going to preach name and claim it God don't work that way either snap out of it God works by his word what we saw in the beginning when God wanted to create an atmosphere he spoke his word and then his presence moved in behind his word and created the conditions for relationship I'm glad God knows how to break down our will without stomping on us but he knows how to draw us out I'm glad about that aren't you what are you doing here Elijah well you know Elijah after he said what he said then the Bible said God told him to go stand before the Lord stand upon the mountain before the Lord and the Lord passed by and a great strong uh great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind and earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake now it didn't say that those things weren't effects from him passing by but God wasn't just coming by to see if he could cause an earthquake God wasn't coming by just to see can I create a fire that was not the purpose you see Elijah needed help oh my Elijah was in more than a cave he was in here in his own self he was in a cave and he needed to be let out and the only the only one that could lead him out was his God his God that has spoke to him time and time again it would take a still Small Voice I'm not against noise I mean it's I think it's kind of evident the way that I'm not against noise but I can't help but I I am who God has made me to be but you know what I don't want you to be like me I want you to be how God has called you to be you might Worship the Lord in such a way there may not be you may never be one that shouts that doesn't have one thing to do with it what it has to do with is has there come a still Small Voice in your life I hope I can have just a little bit of time now here he was being being being God was Desiring to lead him out of that cave now I want you to think about this you know off of the Earth just today there has been billions of water gallons I've got the exact number that has evaporated did you hear it did y'all did you all drive here today and say man listen to that water evaporating text Brother rap brother rap did you hear that what I'm trying to tell you is sometimes the things that are the greatest things that are happening happen without any noise out here now let me just preach for a little bit we understand that the silence itself at the opening of The Seven seal I believe as young people we understand that part that's the coming of the Lord his presence Among Us that's why we worship that's why we can praise when we see our names in the book John himself John saw the 4 and 20 Elders roll their crowns it didn't move him John heard the angels didn't move him but when John saw his name boy that's where John tore loose in his own way in his own way so John wants moved by the Angels was not moved by the 420 Elders John was moved by the word where John the prophet said it like this John looked and said there's John that's what bring real Worship in your life not a worship that ends when the music ends not a worship that ends when Camp ends but a warship that goes through your life when you go to school when you go to work you are a true worshiper Elijah what are you doing here this is what I always I don't know I guess I'm probably just a little bit slow some of these other brothers are smarter but you know I I just brother rap being honest I've always looked at that when brother bradam when he preached the message brother brand says what doest thou hear h e a Elijah but the scripture says what doest thou here h e re E I mean that to me is what strikes me because you see I I had always pondered that but I want you to think of this what you hear will speak to where you presently are here are you hearing me what you hear will presently speak to where you are here and what and and and now with what you can what what you're able to grasp then then with love courage and ability he'll give you Grace to catch where you need to be see God is Not coming to Elijah said what in the world are you doing here what in the world what come on man you're still here you're still here in justification or you know wherever you're at in your States I mean here what are you still doing here you've been filled with the spirit of God and here you are just just kind of just wandering around just moping around what are you doing here no God just listen God don't come to shame us God doesn't have to Guilt Trip us come on we just come through that kind of a season right now are you going to get a gift for so and so no come on everybody knows it everybody got family members that are guilt Trippers oh Lord hope that clip don't get out but notice but if you'll yield to that still small voice but it was as the Lord passed by there was an effect surely upon on the surroundings but it was the still Small Voice that brought a settl in Elijah brother Bram says if you're listening for anything but the still Small Voice get back in the cave that's that the straight words brother BR tells us he says you know he says here we come he said men and women can grow up shouting and praising God speaking in tongues belonging in the church dancing in the spirit paying ties how many knows brother BR believed in all that how many of us believe in all that but he says and still not be in their heart that still small voice of God's Rich deep love a still Small Voice that speaks down in your heart that changes every attitude makes the nature different and you become a new creature in Christ I'm not going to I'm I'm just going to say something but I want you raise your hand because I want your friends get mad at you but no doubt everybody's got friends that's somewhere along the line your friendship it's kind of almost like you're the designated listener you know kick stand on the bike you listen it's not listen and may they you talk that yeah yeah but but you see sometimes with us we're too busy telling God why we can't we're too busy telling God how unqualified we are let me just tell you something you're you're talking with him who knows you you're talking with a God who knew you listen and has directed clear from his mind has directed the course of life and has even watched over your great great grandfather he's watched over your father he watched over your mother God has watched over his seed because his seed is him it's his word and he's taken that kind of care to watch over it then let me tell you don't you think that he'll take that kind of care to see that the word itself comes to full fruition in your life sure he will just say it like this his voice is his word that effect of that still Small Voice let me tell you what it did it brings and instills a deepness of Faith that'll stand firm in the midst of every storm in the midst of the time of Temptation you might say well brother Samu I I have fallen in temptation but it will give you strength to get back up and to overcome because it's true see we want to we don't want just to have an earthquake or a fire we want the effect of the word in every area of Our Lives let me tell you when God gets on the inside they'll bring some earthquakes going on there'll be some fire going going on where God is doing what consuming more and more and more of our life where there's some Earth being moved where there's character being molded it'll be God working from the inside of our Lives because God knows if that still small voice and it becomes a settl in your life don't worry about thunder your life will be Thunder against the devil brother Bram said oh how we need thousands of lived voices in Jeffersonville thundering out Purity you might be a sister that maybe you don't shout a bit maybe as the sister you're one the say well brother Samuel I'm T I'm a little bit timid ain't nothing to be afraid of and ashamed about being timid because I guarantee you when push comes to shove if the devil wanted to try to back you up on the word you'd stand right there and say I'll give my life for this word that's worship right there sis that's real worship sure ain't nothing wrong with shouting ain't nothing wrong with with all that but listen with the real reality of it there's got to be a thunder that when you walk on the school you walk into the job you may not say one word right here but your life will Thunder out Purity Holiness that's the kind of Thunder I want I thank God for the Thunder oh my I love the fire I love the earthquakes but I I I I need to be moved in here that's why I need to be moved sometimes I get I can get settled in my ways anybody ever get settled in your ways maybe I'm just the only one maybe I'll take four or five people and we'll just go preach to ourselves here for a minute you get settled in your own ways and we need God lord I want you to come by Lord move over my life but you realize you can't create that that's why the prophet could say in a message before the new year recognizing your day in its message God create in me what's lacking in my life help me to be a more humbler servant a better servant more willing I'll say God help me see that sadl you think about it brother Welch Evans was one of those he was one that he couldn't get he couldn't get settled in his life brother Bram said brother brother Welch said you know brother bramy said I would go over here and go over to brother Jagger school and I'd go stay there three months and I'd go here and I'd go there and he says I never got to any place that I could ever have any Assurance if I do this if I do that or what I might do here I am or I am not till I heard your teachings that settled it once for all for the worshipper once purged from his sins has no more conscience of sin no more desire on the inside Satan can come out here and tempt this but there's no more desire in here remember don't try to then put this guy back in the picture remember this guy is the plastic over that nail you don't want to get that plastic get you know really built up no we don't want that plastic get built up just let the plastic serve its place its purpose to just be a display for the glory of God to show forth this is why again I hope this all right this is why you have then here's a man brother tells you about in a couple different places of the message word made flesh India trip is one of the places here comes a man sits on brother bram's porch and said brother Bram I and they they told me they sent me to you and said I need big help I go I need a lot of help he said what is it brother he said well I've been trying to get saved I've really been trying to serve god brother BR said well what's wrong he said well I went down here to Billy Graham and they told me you know to raise my hands and say you know that that that I accepted the Lord he said then he said I went for a little bit but he said something just really wasn't settled he said then I went over to the Methodist he said man they said you got a shout he said I got so happy he said I started to shout and they said bless God youve got it he said but you know there's something that still just wasn't settled he said then I got over there he said with the Pentecostals and they said you got to speak in tongues and he said I tell you he said the anointing of the spirit of God came in there and I started speaking in tongues he said but you know it just seems like I'm just not able to get where I need to be and brother random says it's so simple he he said brother he said the problem is you weren't straightened out right in the beginning he said now think about it sir he said was there a time that you didn't love the Lord he said yeah he said so you mean you went to church yeah he said I went to church but it didn't you know it didn't matter to me I just went he said but there was something I saw in my wife's life and I said there's something different about her don't ever underestimate your testimony you may may have a father that's not believer you may have a mother that's not a Believer you might have a sibling that's not a Believer but let the light of Jesus Christ shows shine through your life it might be a coworker remember that is the greatest witness in this world is to see a walking testimony day in and day out it don't mean that you may not make a mistake but they can see here's somebody that can say forgive me I said that wrong I shouldn't have said said that or I did this I shouldn't have did that they're looking at a standard of the word being lived out in your life he said was there a time that you didn't love the Lord hell he said well what happened he said I got to read in this track he pulled it out of my pocket got to reading it he said when I got to reading he said an awfulest feeling came over me it's called conviction thank God for conviction it don't it don't ever leave you conviction is always there it comes to our life to do what it's God working to lead us deeper and really leading us deeper it's actually us removing hindrances so he can go deeper it's us removing hindrances so he can move through Avenues in our life and here come to that place and there that gentleman stands there he said what happened he said you used to love to go to dances you used to love this he said and now he said in your life he says do you love the Lord he said with all my heart brother BR I love the Lord he said I want to do everything I can to play him he said brother he said you've had it the whole time the whole time what was it brother BR said the problem was he said you didn't need a prophet you just weren't straightened out you needed to be settled on the word and the word is a person hallelujah it's a reality that where your life your nature your desires has been changed your whole desire is I want to please God I want to serve him with all that's within me I don't want anything in the way my whole desire is God hallelujah I I'm got I've got to I've just got to move on down here his word comes to bring healing there was a little little girl by the name of Georgie Carter brother bradam hears this it went into prayer and he starts hearing this what is it she was always a sheep by miltown that's where she was at she was at miltown brother BR sister as I went through there he said in that dream he said I thought it was dream he said then he said realize here I am in a vision he said I'm having to go through all these briers and all these darkness is all around and I'm having to I don't know probably some of you went through some thick places if you ever went hiking there's sometimes where I Trail deer that I had to get down when I was blood trailing that deer had to crawl push my bow in front of me I'd end up with thorns and everything else all around me as you're going through there it just it's it's not a place you would want to go in I would never think about taking an afternoon stroll or a nature hike in a place that's prickly but I want to just see see this right here that the prophet is waiting through this and he's coming through there because there's a call that's going out come to miltown brother Bram gets up tells the congregation he said there's going to be a letter or something coming in here because there's there's a need down in miltown nobody knows where mil Town's at I know it's hard to believe in this Young Generation you'd say give me my phone right now I'll should know they didn't have none of that then I don't even know if ran Rand MCN had been born yet it goes to the next Sunday a week passes by finally here's a man that stands in the congregation says hey I know where that's at you see sometimes the answer to your request may not come in the time that you're looking for it it may not even come with the people that you're looking for it but God can bring somebody in and it isn't that that person is special it's God you know what God's trying to help you and I see trust me I know who to put in your life to bring Direction bring help value I I know now you find a situation that's down this is what I I want to trying to move to what are you doing here here She is in a situation she's got TB she's been laying in a bed for nine months most of you have been around the message you you've heard this story over and over but for me it wasn't until I think within the past year I stumbled across this this this quote where I was looking at it and brother Bram tells us why she would had the condition she had of TV she had that condition of TB not because of any choice that she had made are you hearing me listen Daniel and Joseph were in situations that they didn't choose to be in now listen they could have chose and took on victim mentality I'm always oppressed they could have took that on now listen it don't mean that they didn't battle that but where they were at God they God was working with them and they had to submit to overcome Daniel could have said what did I do to get down here I was walking with God and here I am snatched away and taken down here in Babylon I didn't ask for this he could say I wouldn't like a lot of these sorry outfits of one serving God no Joseph look at Joseph Joseph going to say what do I deserve to be here now you think listen to me you think that he didn't those feelings didn't come to him they did Brother brandham tells us in a message a prisoner he said he cried and cried and cried and cried but you know why God had Joseph down there in that prison the prophet tells us in a prisoner because there was a little speck in Joseph's life that he felt like he was somebody and God couldn't use that feeling in his life God said it's got to be totally surrendered that's why the prophet could say that the gift he put in Joseph life is finally what got him out of there now think about this you and I why is this why is this I'm probably sure nobody in here says that why me flat tire why by me probably nobody nobody says that no well just in case I say that sometimes man again everything was lined out perfectly date night tonight and this comes up I don't know I love date night my wife I'm talking about my wife let's clarify that one oh yeah I still get the butterflies for it boy I love it but you know she was in the condition she was in this is what struck me the Brier she had was a church that didn't believe in Divine Healing but she was in the condition she was in because her uncle had taken her to piano lessons and had ravished her he had exploited her she didn't ask for that I just read remember how brother Ram talks about Marilyn Monroe he said I knew what she needed if I could have just got to her I just had done some reading on different ones of certain ones down through time I never had known this before when I was reading on different individual she was even an individual that had been ravished over and overpassed from foster home to foster home to foster home you see what Satan will do he'll try to take an area of your life and exploit it let me tell you what the healing power of God will do she took a hold of a word and said if God Did It for that person he can do it for me this is what I stands out to me not only did God raise her up off of that cot but immediately she goes in the yard and starts just thinking the Lord and right after that goes right over to the piano and starts playing usually something you've been traumatized by you'll say I can't say I don't want to be around that but she went right through to that how did she do it it wasn't mind over matter but God's mind had come down and broke the complex broke the fear broke that where Satan was wanting to hinder in her life brother BR said there she stood as my piano player in miltown from there on take that devil that's the same way in your life Hallelujah we could go on but I'm just going to close there's channels there's areas in your life but you know where it's got to come to it's like finally those guys said to Jonah Jonah hey what what what do we have to do because you're you're here and it's nothing but trouble he said got you got to get me out of the ship I'm going the wrong direction see that's important that you know you're headed the wrong way because when you can face up to that then God can help you to get right back on track no matter where you're at in your journey but so those guys they weren't going to throw Jonah out you know how this how the scripture goes they started roolling to shore they weren't going nowhere to no avail finally it came to this Jon Jonah said you got have to throw me over you know what you know what had happened Jonah had finally come to a place to say Lord I'm G to stop running I'm GNA stop running it's time that these are issues that I've been I've been running from in my life maybe there's a an issue that you've run from of really a real repentance with God maybe it's an issue of a relationship maybe it's an issue in your life that you're running from and God's got a call on your life maybe what you're running from the enemy has wed to make you ashamed of it like he'd have likeed to put Georgie Carter in a place and locked her away as if it was her fault I can't explain it to you tonight because I don't have words to explain it but I can tell you what God did for Georgie Carter that same God is here tonight and that same God what he did for her I can't explain that how how that a little a little girl brother Bram said 37 pounds brother Bram said it like this he said I don't know how she even got the strength to get off that bed he said the only thing I know is when God is moving you and calling you he said he'll give you the strength you need I believe God will give you the strength and is giving you the strength to face some issues right here tonight let's just say to Lord beginning right here tonight maybe there's some channels in your life that you've not surrendered to the Lord maybe there's some things like I said you've you've run from and you need to say Lord I I I I'm I'm running from because it's it's fearful remember Jonah his thinking his thinking was they'll not receive me but if you can just receive God's thoughts God's thoughts have never changed about you God don't see you as a coward God don't see you as a quitter God sees you as his son and daughter of God that he's called and called upon with a responsibility it might be tough to face the issue but listen if you will let the Holy Spirit just even in this moment the courage that he's given you God will give you the strength and you watch how the Holy Spirit Will begin to go down in that area of your life let me just tell you something the Lord is not one who says you need to go down in that area of your life but here's what he'll do he will come right down there and he will take your hand and he will walk right through the channels of your life he'll say let's let's go face this together let's let's take this together now it may not be something that's just like that you could look at Georgie Carter and said well for her it was just like that but it begin with a word that she took a hold of it's got to you got to take a hold of the word first and you take a hold of the word the word has within it the strength to bring the change that's needed in your life God is more than enough to change your circumstance it's a moment that we can have right here tonight to face the issues I'd say God I don't want to run from it I want to run to him the fair's already been paid you you don't have to work anything up you don't have all you have to do you have to accept what God has already provided for you he's provided an escape and a liberty that you can walk from where you're at to where you need to be let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I know was a strange thought but what are we doing here Lord I I don't believe that even in this camp that we're here by circumstance I believe we're here by design Lord father I thank those same stairs that I walked down moments ago I remember nine years ago walking down those stairs I still remember that young man's face when I walked down to begin to pray with different ones that young man stood there and said brother Samuel I came to the camp and I I didn't come for the right reasons I just came because of all my friends were here he said but something has changed I I want to know God in a personal way Lord I I've often thought about that because it just shows that sometimes Lord you're not even bothered with sometimes the reasons that we would even come to Camp or come to a meeting I know we we understand how important it is to have the right motive to have the right objetive Ive but Lord you know what it is to get us into your presence and it might have been because we've come for a friend maybe it was because a parent had urged us maybe it something but God once in your presence the motive and objective things begin to change in your presence Lord begins just Lord just to just Lord a melding away of any of the hardness Lord that's buil up maybe from circumstances of Life maybe Lord from Lord things that haven't gone like we thought they should have gone maybe there's things Lord to wear lives Lord right here that God right here tonight Lord they can look back and they Lord maybe they're just so caught with looking Lord at failures but may they Lord just look to you who's dealt with their heart you who spoke to their life maybe there's an area Lord in their life that they themselves could say oh I I don't know if I could go there but Lord Your Grace is here tonight to bring healing in every area of the life your presence has come down lord and you let us know Lord the value that we have in your sight you were willing not only to come from Glory but to shed your blood and to send back the Holy Ghost to send Lord a message Lord in this generation that really opens the real clear view of Calvary what it was all about where men had tried to close it off and opens it back to a place to realize that God has come in order to have a relationship with me maybe here tonight it's a facing an issue maybe you've just become busied with the cares of life maybe there's a lot of things that are there that maybe it's with school and other things don't listen don't don't feel condemned about that but allow the Holy Spirit why don't you just allow him to bring a renewing in your heart bring a renewing and a refreshing maybe right here this as this this meeting it's already started in an afternoon session maybe we could just say Lord just tenderize us Lord in your presence soften us up Lord father I pray God may you move Lord by your spirit Lord any hold I think of that little lady your Prophet walked into that insane institution why she didn't look abnormal she didn't even look like she belonged there but your prophet he looked around he said where do I even start and she looked up up at him and said sir start here with me start with me Lord there were situations there were things that had taken place in her life and had led her down paths she was ashamed of never wanted to go down those paths but because she had been taken advantage of then she just said she just went to wasting her life Lord life is a precious thing you've given it to us I pray heavenly father that as you went down to that little lady you raised her from the condition she was in turned her life around so completely Lord father right here tonight I know the needs Lord among us they're so they're great Lord but you're greater you're greater Lord may you just just breathe Lord upon every life and every [Music] heart may you move Lord I pray just for every single need Lord I believe you already have right through the word I I believe that I've Got Confidence in that Lord but I pray tonight Lord if there's any that Lord would maybe they Lord would be in need of prayer maybe Lord in their heart Lord just in their heart Lord just wanting to Lord just say Lord I I just want to rededicate myself Lord to you one we couldn't just stand in his presence I think that'd be a good thing right now just to really just to say Lord I just want to commit everything into your hands maybe it's a situation maybe it's your life maybe it's an area of your life could we just as we're gathered together and respectfully maybe brother to brother I know we've got husbands and wives in here but in a respectful Godly manner maybe just a lay hand on that one next to you if it's a brother to brother a sister to sister let's just offer a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're here for a purpose Lord our heart's desire Lord God is Lord that every one of our hearts Lord May every channel of our life Lord from our heart to every Avenue to every faculty Lord that it would be dedicated to you Lord father I pray that God May Lord Jesus as you have spoken Lord here already Lord in these services today Lord God that that it would just come to such a settled place if there's a Heart Lord that maybe they haven't been settled up to this place but Lord may that be the moment Lord that they would be able to look Lord in their life CU sometimes Lord when we hear that of a still Small Voice we wonder well how will it sound how will it be but it's to notice the effect after that voice has spoke to us our life has been changed now Lord I pray that God that you would speak in the depths of the hearts of your people may you encourage maybe any Elijah that is Lord hidden back in their cave maybe they've kind of started to pull themselves in maybe they've been hurt maybe they've been wounded Lord may you Minister Lord God you said in your word when the book had come open you have sent to heal them that were bruised Lord God may you come tonight Lord bring healing Lord upon on lives Lord bring healing Lord in the channels of Life Lord God father maybe Lord in the mind in the spirit Lord no doubt there's children of God standing right here tonight Lord that in their soul they have already been sealed it's settled but Lord there's still something they deal with Lord in their life maybe Lord God it's a young sister Lord battling Lord a thought of value Lord Lord God I I pray that Lord that the same spirit that would want to bring that and cause her to battle and then turn around and condemn her Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus Christ may she look and see Lord God that spirit for what it is and see that it's already defeated Lord God grant it Lord I pray father oh Lord God may you Lord I pray moving Lord God in every channel every area Lord every Avenue Lord we want to fully dedicate ourselves to you lord lord I
