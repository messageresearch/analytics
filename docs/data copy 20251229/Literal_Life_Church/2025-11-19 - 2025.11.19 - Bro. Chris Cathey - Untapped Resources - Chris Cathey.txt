Oh God bless you tonight. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. I just call you family. So, we love you. We appreciate you, brother Paul. And I just feel at home tonight. We missed [music] you.

Okay, never mind. Well, tried. God bless you. God bless you musicians, everybody tonight. Let's just open the word and I just don't want to hold you too late, but just want to speak what God has on on my heart and may he just come in your aisle tonight and may he give you what you have need of tonight. It's all good. Genesis to Revelation. It's all good. &gt;&gt; Thank you for everything. Thanks, brother Ike and the musician, the the sound people back there. And &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; uh we just appreciate everybody. God bless you. So just want to turn tonight for to just to second Corinthians uh chapter 4. 2 Corinthians chapter 4. I just want to read this uh check 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 1. It [snorts] says therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not. Verse two, it says, "But have reconciled the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God." Verse three, but if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost. In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, least the light of of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. Verse five, for we preach not of ourselves, I say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. For God who commandeth the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. In verse seven, I just kind of want to speak on this tonight. But we have the this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. &gt;&gt; Would you say amen that tonight? Let's just go to him in prayer. Father, we just come before you humbly, Father, asking you would speak to us tonight. May you get me out of the way, Father, and we just come in your channel. Only you would speak what you'd have to speak to your bride tonight. I'm so thankful for everyone that's here. We love him dearly. May you bless Brother Paul and all he's done is faithfulness, Lord, so many years, Father, and just bless his family, Father. May you bless this church and bless the community, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You may be seated. I just want to speak a few minutes on this verse. I was reading it the other week. And verse seven says, "But we have this excellency uh this treasure in earth and vessels that this excellency of the power may be of God and not of us." And I and I started to think in this message, Brother Brandham, I I kind of got this where brother Brandham, he would go on to say, he would say this in this message, taking God at his word. He said, "Brother, I tell you, he says un we have untapped resources of God, it hangs before us." He said, "Where all things are possible, it's a shame that men keep looking back this way instead of looking that way." And he goes on to say that Jesus said in St. uh St. St. Matthew the 13th chapter, we are a swer that went forth and sewed the seeds and someone would come behind him and the enemy would sew seow weeds and and the husbandman said, "Shall I put should I should I pull them up?" And he said, "Then they let them both grow grow together and and he says at that day I'll make the decision. The angels will come and take out the wheat and so forth and burn the tears out the fire." Now, he said we're always talking about how wicked the world is. That's true. He says, "But how women smok and cigarettes and men and drinking and wallowing in slop and beer and stuff." He said, "The way they're doing today is sin on every hand." He said, "Churches and ministers and all, smoking, drinking, gambling, running to parties and picture shows, dancing, hell drives, and everything else." He said, "But we all talk about how wicked that is." He said, "But we're always looking to that." He said, "But that's the wheat." He said, "But but let me tell you something, brother. You forget to know." He says, "The church is growing up at the same time." &gt;&gt; I tell you, amen to that. Tonight, we got to we we get into a place and I just want to speak a few minutes on untapped resources. &gt;&gt; Untapped resources. And I believe we live in a time that the devil points you to everything but God. He points you to this circumstance and this trial and and and he keeps you busy in life and we forget to know that God is doing something today. And you know, you might think what God's done in the in the in the past or what he's going to do in the future, but we got to realize what God's doing now, what God is doing now. And we get to a place in our life where we we look at the weed and we go, "Well, you know what? Guess what? It's it's going to grow out here." I'm here to tell you I put in artificial turf and you probably know that the weed will still find a way somehow to come up through that turf. &gt;&gt; But still there's beauty on the outside and beauty on the inside. And I'm here to tell you even though you see that going on, we are blessed people today. God has called you out. God has put you, in other words, you've been you are sitting in heavenly places tonight. you. Each and every one of us are the bride of Christ is sitting in heavenly places and we have untapped resources &gt;&gt; and we live in a place that you know the devil wants to to to push it down and oh well brother you're this and that. Well, you know what? We're all sons and daughters of a king. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you I just like that where it says in verse 7, but we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the ecstasy of the power may be of God and not of us. Verse eight, I pray this encourages you tonight. Verse eight, it says, "But we are troubled on every side." Would you say that? &gt;&gt; Yet not distressed. It says, "We are perplexed but not in despair." Aren't you thankful for the word of God? &gt;&gt; And it goes on to say, he says in verse uh nine, "Persecuted, but what? But not forsaken. Cast down but not destroyed." Oh my, this the the the book is full of promises tonight, brother Henry. It says verse uh 10, always bearing about the body and dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. &gt;&gt; For we which live are away, delivered unto his death to Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. So then death workketh in us, but life in you. Oh, I love that. Tonight he said we had the we having the same spirit of faith according as written. I believed and it says and therefore I have spoken. We also believe and therefore speak. Verse 14 it says knowing that we knowing that he he which raised the Lord Jesus Christ from all us also but g by Jesus and shall present us with you. And he says verse 15, for all things are for his for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redounded. And it says to the glory of God. I'm building to this tonight. It says, "For which cause we faint not, but through our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day." It's [snorts] it's it's a daily process. And how do we get that? You see, Brother Chris, Brother Paul, how do we brother Brandon, how do we get that? It's a renewing. It's a dying out every single day. I just because I got a tie on doesn't mean anything. I'm just a same like you. But it's a daily walk with Jesus Christ. It's a It's Who are you feeding the most tonight? It's the inward man. We want to listen to Facebook and Instagram and all these things. But I tell you tonight, get in these resources. Get in the resources of God. God has opened the entire book to you tonight from Genesis to Revelation. And it's a time to tap into your resource and say, "God, I want more of you, Lord. I want I, you know, the sick can be healed. Whatever you have tonight, you can be healed instantly. It might take over time. It might be day by day. But keep every inch, possess your land. &gt;&gt; Every single inch, possess your land." Maybe you just feel like, "Brother, I'm barely making it." But you're you're here to church tonight saying, "I'm pressing on." Maybe it feels like I'm going 2 in or I'm going three inches. But I'm here to tell you, you need to tap into the resources that you've been laid before you from the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, but it says in verse 17, for our light affliction which is for a moment workketh for us a far more excellency in eternity weight of God. Verse 18. While we look not at the things which are seen, but the things which are not seen. And I and you you witness this when you're out, brother Kenny, and you're out at the gas station, or I know when CO hit, Brother Paul, and you would just be at the pump. I travel more when CO hit in the land. And I'm not saying it wasn't a virus, but I tell you what, we have a God bigger than your cancer. We have a God bigger than your diabetes. We got a God bigger than your anxiety. And I'm here to tell you, you got to tap into the resources that God has gave you. &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say, brother Tony, he says, which we have not seen, for things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm thankful tonight. May I wasn't in brother Arab's meetings, but I'm here to tell you, I was there before the foundation of the world, and you were too today. He's called you from the found. He came looking for you. And I'm here to tell you to tap into the resources that he's gave you today. The entire book has been opened before you. &gt;&gt; The entire book from Genesis, not just on a shelf, not for these tapes just to sit on a go get dusty. We have them on our app. We have them on an iPad. We have them everywhere. But it's time even young people to get into the word. Get into these resources that you have. Right. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I like what Ephesians 3:20 says. It says, "Now unto him that is able to do exce exceedingly abundantly all above all that we ask or think according to the power." &gt;&gt; And it says, "The power that workketh what? In us." &gt;&gt; In us. You know, God, uh, you know, you are the branches tonight. you know, you're connected to the vine and you we're the more you read, the more you push out, the more you the more you stay in the word. You know, people's like, "Well, how you got so good of faith, Chris?" It's not because I just build it up. It's because the hearing of his word daily stay in the word saying, "God, I want more of you &gt;&gt; and stay in these messages of the hour." &gt;&gt; And then I just looked this up and we're talking about the power of God. And I I read Acts 1:8, which I thought was really good. It says, "But we but ye shall receive power." And I wrote that word beside power. I looked that up, "Dunamis." And it says, "After the God Holy Ghost has come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto you both in Jerusalem." So, we have work to do. It's just not just sit and say, "I believe a message and I'm going to keep it to me. I'm going to just, oh, well, God revealed the entire book." But I'm here to tell you, he you're the only feet, the only eyes, the only ears, the the only lips that God can use. And he's wanting to use you tonight. And maybe it's on your job or wherever it's at, but just be a light for Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Just be a light for Jesus Christ. I'm not saying go and blast them with the entire message. They watch the life. &gt;&gt; They watch the life. You don't have to say anything, but just live a life so filled and so connected to your resource that they say, "I want what [screaming] he's got. I want what Brother Kenny's got. I want what he's got." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you, maybe revive us tonight. Put something in us a little smart. Maybe you're online tonight and you're discouraged. I'm here to tell you to tap into the resource. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it goes on to say, I wrote I looked that word dunamis up. I thought this was excellent. It says in the word dunamis, the word it says word power. It says dunamis means explosive, dynamite, miracle working energy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is explosive dynamite miracle working energy. I tell you what, no matter what age I get, I want to be a dynamite for him. I want to be a miracle working energy. I want to see people delivered, set free. &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's our God. &gt;&gt; That's our God tonight. &gt;&gt; I love that. I like what the prophet of God says. He says, "And Christ is the exaltable fountain of life." &gt;&gt; He said, "We are planted in him by the Holy Spirit." He says, "And then we just listen then just drink from him. Every person that's a Christian, listen, the devil don't care how much you come to Christ. &gt;&gt; He don't care how much you come to Christ. But brother B says, but he cares about how much you drink. &gt;&gt; He don't care how much you come on Wednesdays, how much you show up on Sundays, Brother Kenny. But he does care how much you drink. &gt;&gt; He He He cares about how much you drink. So he don't want you in the book. He don't want you to because he, you know, like he says, Genesis expo, it shows where his beginning and Revelation shows his end. We know what side you're on tonight. And I'm here to tell you, we know we on the winning side. &gt;&gt; But he goes on to say, he says, the devil don't care how much you come to Christ as long as you don't drink. Listen young people, as long as you don't drink, he wants to keep you on this or this social media or this or that or he wants to keep you so busy not to drink. &gt;&gt; Show up on Wednesday. &gt;&gt; Show up faithfully on we got we got I mean the message we got 30 years 50 years I believe a message but is the message on the inside? Is there a life living in the inside that says I'm ready to go. I'll beat you to church. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I tell you, it's a time to wake up. It's an hour to be happy. It's an hour to be walk around like, "Oh my, brother Paul, I just can't get out of the bed. My back hurts. Next week, my foot hurts." It's always something. But I'm here to tell you, we serve a great God that g that gave you a message of the hour, and he revealed it to you to do something for him. That's &gt;&gt; right. Not just for the ministry, but every leoty alike. You can do something for Jesus Christ. If you're a housewife, you can be the best housewife. You're the Sunday school teacher, you can be the best son. Whatever it is, &gt;&gt; God's called you for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Oh, but he goes on to say, he says, you could stand at the table with your mouth watering, say, well, I'm here. I'm here. You're afraid to turn your faith loose. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He goes on to say in this message, this other message, excuse me. He says, "If you can limit God, you can limit Christ." That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about untapped resources tonight. He says, "And if you limit the church today, its possibilities, you're limiting God." &gt;&gt; He said, "But all things whatsoever you desire when you pray, believe you receive it and you shall have it." Another message, he goes, "Brother, I'm telling you, untapped resource of God hangs before us." Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say, and I I think I read this, but he goes on to say for time, he says, "But we Americans," he said, "we're all wellfed and furied and and feathered, and we sat around, well, my pastor don't believe in that kind of stuff. I'll go over and just just say what now wonder you can't get nowhere." It's the truth. He said, "It's a shame. We don't recognize God and his power and his deity. He's moving." &gt;&gt; Oh my. He goes on to say, "It's a shame." Oh, well, we're ready for a judgment and we're and we're sure going to get it. That's right. He said, "My people," he said, "they that that call my name," he said, "if they'll assemble themselves together and pray and then hear from heaven." &gt;&gt; But how can we do that with everything else hanging in the road in our roads and things like that and all these different He goes on to say, he goes, "But poor little America, why? It's a shame." He said, "We got a church on every corner, each pastor fighting." I'm like, "Amen." He says, "I'm afraid to let but" But he said, "Sponsor one of these meetings like that. They'll pull some of some of the people away. Why it's a mill ticket? It's a shame." &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say this. He goes, "But why are you thinking about a mill ticket and million miles yonder dying in heathenism?" He said, "Why? We got preachers hanging all around everywhere, fussing about their little churches and their organizations and tearing up this and that and the other and snorting at one another." He said, "But why? It's a disgrace." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "It's not fair for one man to hear the gospel twice when one man has heard it at all. Heard it at all." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "It's time for somebody to go." He said, "God to move in yonder." &gt;&gt; That's right. It's time to press to press on. It's time to move forward. &gt;&gt; Maybe your past looks really bad. And maybe maybe the devil's telling you and wants you to live. I I could really live in a broke up home. I could look at how bad my past was. I grew up I was in Toledo as a young age and I could just sit there and dwell on it, but I'm not. I just dwell on the good things of God. I dwell on where he brought me from and where I am today and what he's doing in my life. And it's so easy to look in your rearview mirror in your life and brother Ram said, "You'll be racked up somewhere." &gt;&gt; You'll be racked up somewhere. But you know how big a windshield you have when you sit in your car tonight? It's a big windshield. And that would tell you when you look out your windshield, maybe you'll leave this message, you'll say, "That's the blessings of God. I'm moving forward." Maybe maybe you made a mistake, young people, young people old like, maybe you're online. You made a mistake. Guess what? Just repent and move on. &gt;&gt; Don't live in it. &gt;&gt; The devil wants you to dwell on it. We're all sinners saved by grace tonight. &gt;&gt; We may I fall every day, but I just Well, you know what? I just dust my my pants off. I ask forgiveness. And his mercies are new every morning. &gt;&gt; His mercies are new. I just tap into the book and say, "Lord, I need some more of your resources." But too many times we pass these gas stations, baby, like me, and my wife goes, "Honey, you've been on Eve for about 2 hours. Uh, it's time to fill up the tank." And, you know, it says 5 miles. Would you please stop? Maybe that's only me tonight. Well, I know it says two and now it's zero. Now we're on We're on some major grace. But too many times we come to church that way. We, you know, brother says, you get what you come expecting. If you look for a mistake, you're going to find, you'll find one in me for sure. &gt;&gt; But you get what you come expecting. And we got to know that God, I maybe I just kneel down and say, Lord, I I need you to speak to me tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, I I'm I said that today before I got here. I said, Lord, I want you to speak to me. Even when I'm preaching, Lord, speak to I'm preaching to me tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He goes on to say, he says, "When a spirit born," listen to this. I hope this encouraged you tonight. And in the in the church age book, he says, "When a spirit born uh spiritfilled man, his faith takes the word into his heart and places it on his lips." He said, "Why? That's the same as deity speaking." He said, "Every mountain has to go. Satan cannot stand before that man." &gt;&gt; That's right. That's an untapped resource that you need to claim tonight and say, "Lord, I speak to my mountain. I speak to that cancer. I speak to that uh diabetes." And just keep walking forward. &gt;&gt; It's like that brother in the chair. He he kept walking in there. I forget his name. Brother Paul, you probably could say it, but he's in the chair and he he's sitting in the the barber chair and he he he keeps claiming his eyesight. He's like, "Well, you're crazy." And all of a sudden, his eyes came open. and then he took off running and he's chasing him. But I'm here to tell you, some of us need to step out by faith and say, "You know what? I'm tired of listening to the devil's lies. I need to tap into my book. The book that's been opened from Genesis to Revelation has been given to you. It's been the book has been handed to you. What are you doing with it?" &gt;&gt; Oh, what are you doing with it? &gt;&gt; Oh, not sit on a shelf or or I got a relic or I got a buckle. I'm I'm not trying to be respect disrespectful tonight. &gt;&gt; I'm just being honest. I'm sorry, brother Paul, but I I got a suitcase and I and I'm not being mean. I Please don't take it wrong. And I got this and I got that. And it becomes a relic on a shelf. &gt;&gt; Oh, but Brother Tony's want to He's wanting some people that God could live on the inside and you be written pistols read of all men. And when you walk down the street, they go, "Oh my goodness, even this shadow healed me. I was so full in the Holy Ghost, his shadow. That man loves Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, but we got to get in the book. We got We got so brother brother Gideon, we we have so many untapped resources. &gt;&gt; But we just could get in the book. And you know, I just love this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad for it, brother Tony. &gt;&gt; Brother Paul, I'm so thankful. Brother Brandon, I I tell you what, I I didn't look for it. He came looking for me. I'm thankful that he did. &gt;&gt; But I thought about tonight and I was saying about untapped resources and maybe this does something for you. But I got this little little bucket. Maybe just brought this. Brother Brandon brought it for me. Thank you, brother. But I thought about these stakes and maybe this will do something for you tonight. But I thought about these stakes tonight. Maybe get some young people to help me if that's okay. I hope someone will will will maybe will you come help me? One of y'all help me. Uh will you will you help me? Do you mind? You don't have to be young, middle age, whatever age. And I want you to take this tonight. I want you to hammer this as I read this resource. I want you to take this steak and maybe they can see it here. And I want you to start hammering that down in there. Not too hard where all the sin comes out, but just just enough. John 3:16, for God so loved the world, that he gave his only son that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. &gt;&gt; There's you a good resource tonight. &gt;&gt; All right, brother. Will you will you will you hammer that in tonight? All right, let's read another one. 1 John 1:9. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse you of what? All unrighteousness. All. So, we're driving stakes tonight. You see that? We are mentally taking the resources that God has gave us in this book and we're driving a stake in that and saying the devil that's my stake. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's a resource tonight. Thank you. Maybe you could come up for a minute and and drive this one down. Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; Okay. And we we'll read another one and I won't have time for them all, but uh let's read Joshua 1:9. Be strong and courageous for the L for the Lord for your God is with you wherever you go. Maybe he's driving. Hit that stick a couple more times. Psalms 23:4. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I will fear no evil, for thou are with me. Thy riding staff, they comfort me. Oh, there's your resource tonight. Drive it down. Maybe the devil, you've went around this mountain long enough. It's time to start driving your your resources and your stakes down and tell the devil whose side you're on. Too many times we we we tell God what our storm is and you need to tell the storm who your God is. &gt;&gt; Too many times. &gt;&gt; Oh, maybe maybe get another volunteer. Anybody want to volunteer tonight? Anybody? No. Not many hands. Come here, brother. Thank you, brother. Oh, we'll read another resource. I hope this is sinks in tonight. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Maybe this a little elementary, but this is just where I feel like good going. Philippians 4 4:19. But my God, but my God. You You're going through a hard trial tonight and you're like, "Brother, I don't know how I'm gonna make it. I don't know how I'm gonna pay my bills, but I'm going to read you something. My God shall supply all your need according to his riches and glory by Christ Jesus. My God. That's your God. I'm talking about our God tonight." &gt;&gt; Matthew 6:33. Maybe maybe just pull one out and hammer this one in, brother. Uh, but Matthew 6:33. But seek ye first the kingdom of God. I tell the boys this all the time. I say, "Boys, seek the kingdom first of God and his righteousness, and all the things should be added unto you." That's right. &gt;&gt; And we could keep going. We would be here. I don't have enough stakes tonight to pull out all God's resources, what he's done for you, where he's at. I hope that sinks in tonight. Thank you, brothers. &gt;&gt; And we get to a spot in our life where we need to drive a stake down. Maybe the Holy Spirit, maybe the devil comes on your shoulder and say, "I'm not saved." Then you just go back to John 3:16 where you dri down because he comes on my shoulder some days and you'll say, "Well, you know why? You shouldn't have cut that off or you shouldn't have blew the horn. I'm just being honest with you tonight." And I said, "Lord, yes, I'm sorry." And I'll start to ask for forgiveness, but my God, my God will forgive you of all your iniquities. &gt;&gt; I mean, I just go back to the book because the book has been given to you. the entire book. We live in an age where Paul didn't even have the entire book open. But you are living in a day where this book has been open to you. &gt;&gt; This entire book, all these resources. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's better than 93 octane. It's better than 87. We're living on heavenly octane tonight. The untapped resources we have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, I pray this encourages you tonight. Y'all just call me crazy, but hey, leave me that way. I'll read some more. Peace I leave with you. My peace I give unto you. Not as the world giveth, but give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid. &gt;&gt; I think some of you the adults need to take a steak tonight and drive it down and say, I need to Maybe you need to go home and physically put a steak down somewhere. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And say, I'm tired of this. or you know and maybe maybe Isaiah 40:29 where it says that he giveth power to the faint and them that not might not be he said have no might but have increased strength every even the youth shall faint he said and be weary and the young men shall utterly fail but they that wait upon the Lord &gt;&gt; shall renew their strength they shall mount up like eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not be faint oh we would be here all tonight if I start from Genesis to Revelation of how many resources you have. &gt;&gt; Oh, but the devil wants to just put in your mind, brother Tony and brother brother Kenny just puts it in our mind every day. You're not a child of God, young people. He does it to me, too. So, I know he does it to you. But if you drive a steak now, you can go back to that steak and go, that's where it happened on a revival night or on a Wednesday night. Oh, we wouldn't have a revival. But something struck my life and on the inside, I tapped into that resource and I said, "Lord, that's me." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; Oh, we got to remind the devil who we are. &gt;&gt; Or what team we're on. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't have time to read all this, but Jeremiah 29:11, "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you." Listen, young people, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of what? Peace. &gt;&gt; That's right. Thoughts of peace, not of evil. So when the when the enemy comes to attack you, he's going to give you evil thoughts. &gt;&gt; But look, thoughts of peace, not of evil to give you what? An expected end. I'm thankful. I'm thankful, brother Kenny. He's gave you me an expected end. I had a terrible end one day. But when he when he when he came when he found me, I'm here. I'm just here to tell you, he's lit me on fire for God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's lit me on fire for God. But you go on to say Proverbs 10:22, "The blessings of the Lord, it make it rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, Isaiah 54:17. That's another one I really feel like we need to take a stake and just nail it down tonight. Right there. Listen. Isaiah 54:17. No weapon that's formed against thee, thou shalt prosper. Every tongue that rise up against thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the saints of the Lord. And the righteousness is of me, sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's time to start driving some stakes down tonight and say, Lord, you got un riches that we don't tap into. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, he says, listen to this. He says, he says, he said, if you say to this mountain, be moved and don't doubt in your heart, but believe. He said that what you said will come. This is how I got this message. I was listening to this message conference and he says he says you say it come to pass but you have what you you you've said he said you can't have you can have what you've said whatever whatsoever it is he said let it be he said it's untapped resources &gt;&gt; untapped resources and he goes on to say a man said that long ago he said I don't want to bother God listen to this he said I don't want to bother God you know I you know I don't know if you ever felt that way I don't want to bother God &gt;&gt; I don't want to bother He goes, "Well, I know is he's awful busy." &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said this, "I know he's awful busy." He said, "Nonsense." He said, "I don't want to." Well, you can exhaust, listen, you can exhaust his bountable blessings. He said, "Could you imagine a little fish about a about a half an inch long out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? I better drink water sparingly because I might run out. &gt;&gt; I just a little inch in the ocean, brother. Just think about how big the ocean is. You look, you can't even see the other side. That's how big God's blessings are. You can't even see from day to day, but God is carrying you along the way. &gt;&gt; God is carrying you. &gt;&gt; Oh, you might not see in front of you tonight. You say, "Brother, I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills. I don't know. Okay, you don't need to worry about it all. Just keep walking. Possess the land that God's gave you. If you're going to walk just 2 in or 6 in, you're still moving forward. &gt;&gt; You're still moving forward. &gt;&gt; But he goes on to say, said, could you imagine a little mouse about oh so big under the great garners of Egypt saying, I better eat ration myself this winter. &gt;&gt; He said, you just get little grain, two grains a day. He said, 'I might run out before the the new harvest. That's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; Oh my, this message is wonderful. &gt;&gt; He said, 'Well, it's twice that ridiculous. A thousand my a thousand times more to think you can exhaust the mercies of a merciful God. [applause] &gt;&gt; That you can exhaust the mercies. You can't exhaust the mercies of God. I would be way gone off this world if it wasn't for his grace and his mercies. &gt;&gt; Oh, I pray this sinks in tonight. &gt;&gt; He said, "Why? You're trying to force his way into you. Ask abundantly that your joys might be full." &gt;&gt; Maybe you come in here. I'm just I'm just wore out. Well, just ask God to fill you back up. &gt;&gt; Just like you're going to the gas station. You're at the spiritual gas pump tonight. Say, "Lord, fill me up. I want some more. I might I might have been in the message 50 years, but guess what? You got to keep I might have had that car out there 50 years, but I got to keep putting gas in it and gas and some more gas. And you're not just here on a Wednesday night, but get you a little bit of God tonight. Say, Lord, I'm here to be filled up. &gt;&gt; I want your resources tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Luke 9:109 it says, "Behold, I give unto you the power to tread on serpents." This is another resource. &gt;&gt; "And scorpions and all over the power of what?" The enemy &gt;&gt; "And nothing shall by any means hurt you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He might hurt you here. He might hurt you in your mind. And you just It's It's the battle of the mind. We know the greatest battle ever fought, young people, is in your mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then you just fill it with junk and trash all the time. and you maybe you're in your room by yourself and my parents ain't looking I'll do this or I'll do that. But God is always watching &gt;&gt; and it's a time that you could take that time. And I'm not saying just be in your Bible for a hundred hours. But I'm here to tell you just watch what you're feeding on. &gt;&gt; Watch what you're feed you're here. You're you're not a trash can. You're not a dump. &gt;&gt; You're you're sons and daughters of a king. &gt;&gt; And you need to feed on these resources tonight. I'll tell you like you ever got a car and you you we've we've traveled all over all over and you fill up this tank and that tank and some gas stations you pull up like baby we going have to buy gas here tonight so we going to have to pray wrecked your heart &gt;&gt; and then all of a sudden you got water in the tank and that thing like I'm telling you she ask her you get water in the tank and you barely going and you your car is sputtering you don't know what happened and you got water in the tank maybe some of you tonight's got a little bit of water a little bit of world in the tank. &gt;&gt; Maybe there's time to tap into the resources. Maybe maybe maybe you've been saved. Maybe you dragged the steak down long time ago. But I just want to remind you, look back at the steak and say, "Lord, I just want another refilling tonight. I want some more tonight. Lord, refill me, Lord. Oh, come on the inside. Give me Give me a purpose, Lord. A vision for you." [snorts] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I'm so glad there's many, brother Tony, more outpourings of God. Could you imagine? You just get one fill up and that's it. But our God is so merciful. He just keeps filling you up. Oh, I tell you, I don't care. This stuff never gets old. And the more you feed it, the more you feed that day by that read that renewed day by day. And the more you read it, Brother Brandham, the more it just it just resonates, Brother Paul, on the inside. And it's like, oh, that's me, Lord. That's I say amen to the entire book. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, he says, "Science can only climb so far." He said, "It falls back." He said, "Listen to this. You got the un uncarchable promises of God, untapped resources, yonder." &gt;&gt; He said, "But the thing of it is they have to look back and see, oh, they're in the school of thought who that taught that taught taught taught it." He said, 'But I don't care what the school said. He said the Bible said. The Bible said. He said, ' And that's God's science book. Here's your You want a science book? Your parents might get here. That's your science book tonight. &gt;&gt; I know it's all ragged, but I tell you what, it's good. And it might not feel good sometimes when you walk in church and you get stepped on your toes, but I always say it's all good for me cuz I need it. This old man, I'm trying to get this every single day. It's a progression. It's a daily walk. &gt;&gt; It's a daily walk. And when you look at your friends or someone beside you that maybe is not as far as you, just pray for them. &gt;&gt; Encourage them. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother says, when they're in the gutter, pick them up. You don't have to go, "Well, I'm going to give you a quote. Let me kick you right in your throat." But no, you just encourage them. Give them something. Write them a note. Write them a letter. Hey, I just been praying for you today. Send him a flower. Whatever it is, cuz love will conquer it all. That's right. &gt;&gt; Love of Jesus Christ. They could care how many books you've read, how many message books you read. They want to see the life behind the name. &gt;&gt; The life behind the name. &gt;&gt; Oh, Philippians. Hope this is okay. Philippians 1:6. Being confident of this very thing, that which he that which began a good work in you will perform until the day of Jesus Christ. Second Timothy, I'm just reading some resources to re to to strengthen your faith tonight. 2 Timothy uh 1:7. For God had not given us a what? Spirit of what? &gt;&gt; Fear, but of power and love and of a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, the world thinks you're crazy. Oh, brother Gideon, he thinks we're crazy. All right. But I'm here to tell you on the inside, there's that inside man that feeds day and day. And I'm tell you what, we're headed to earthly home and this is just a pest house. This is we're just going through. But I here to tell you, I'm going to live on the the mercies of God and his untapped resources and say, Lord, I want more of it. &gt;&gt; I want more of it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He goes on to say, I was reading this um I want to read this. He says, "Oh," and he said, "Brother said, "Oh, knowledge we will we only run so far, then it falls backwards. But the tree of life has no end to it. We've got untapped resources and we're we're scared to step out and take God at his word." &gt;&gt; He said this like 14 times in 14 different messages. Untapped resources. He goes on to say he says he said they're pressing forward looking forward but we want to look back and look at Moody and Sanki Sanki he says and Finny and Knox and Calvin he said but what they said it was all right that was the for their age. He goes on to say he says my grandfather rode on an ox cart and I I'm driving a Ford uh V8. My son will fly a jet plane. He said that's where they're going on but that's what religion ought to be. He goes on to say he says the coming of the Lord is at hand. &gt;&gt; He said the church ought to be moving unto their powers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He says science can only climb so far and then it has to be dropped dropped off. But we got untapped resources that's never been touched of the power unlimited of God. &gt;&gt; And he says that we ought to be moving into. &gt;&gt; I say praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. This this message is wonderful. I like what he says right here. He said we're living in a million miles under our privilege tonight. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said the privilege as Christians to be enjoying. I feel ashamed of myself when I look out here and I see the institutions and the sicknesses. And he says in the troubles that's going on right now. He said, "Our church ought to be walking on the street, healing the sick, raising the dead, casting out the devils, doing signs and wonders, making the whole world realize that Jesus Christ lives." &gt;&gt; Well, he said, "That's what we we we need to you want to know what we need to be doing? That's what we need to be doing." He is what he says, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say, "We're living in under our privileges." Yes, sir. He said the le the left they left him at the feast of Pentecost and their own he said he said there is the only place the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian I was a Baptist he said and Pentecostal he said will ever find him he said they'll go back where they left him at and he goes on to say he said where is the joy of the lord I want to ask you tonight where's the joy of the lord &gt;&gt; he said where's the power of the lord he said the church asked today what happened to the god of history. He's waiting for his people to call him on the scene. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's waiting for me and you to call him on the scene. You got something to do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, he said, "But we can't do it through denominations." Aren't you thankful? He said, "We can't do it under psychology. We can't do it on arthatic." He said, "Or we can't do it with education. We separate ourselves. We divide ourselves." He said, "We are we are not divided. We are one person indeed in Christ Jesus. He said we are all in one in Christ and our denominations will never do it. He said as good as they are, they won't do it. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying there not great people in them churches. I'm talking about the system itself. &gt;&gt; There's some great people in them, but the system itself is corrupt. Aren't you thankful you're called out tonight? &gt;&gt; Every one of you tonight has been called by name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every one of you has been called by name from the foundation of the world. You've accepted it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he goes, "Our education is the greatest hindrance the gospel had ever has ever had." &gt;&gt; He goes, "What we need is not no educ what we need is not education. We need the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost back into the church." &gt;&gt; To demonstrate the power &gt;&gt; to demonstrate the power. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about untapped resources tonight. He said, "But we're still a million miles short where we should be." &gt;&gt; He said, "Let us move what?" Backwards. &gt;&gt; Let us move forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But too many times we're fussing about this. We're fussing about that. And hey, did you hear what Johnny said? And do you hear what I'm I've been a victim of it? And you did you hear about this, brother? You just pray for him. &gt;&gt; But he goes on to say, "Let us move forward. Let us let us go back where we left them at the feast of Pentecost." He said, "We don't need an omination." Then he goes on to say this. He [snorts] said, I like what he says right here for time. I'm moving. I'm having to skip a little bit. He says, "One," he said, "One time a man caught an old crow." I like this. I'm talking about untapped resources. He said, "And he tied him up because he was in the cornfield." &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe you're here tonight. Maybe this is you tonight. He says, "And the bird begins to fly over saying, "Come on, Johnny Crow." He said, "Let's go south. Let's go. The winter time's coming." He said we he's got he's he's got so poor he couldn't hardly walk. &gt;&gt; Maybe you walked through the church tonight and said, "Brother Chris, I just barely got here, but you got here. &gt;&gt; You're moving forward. &gt;&gt; You got here." And he goes on to say that poor old crow, he and he just cut him loose and he said he and when he did, the other crows came over and said, "Come on, Johnny Crow. Let's go south." But he said he's been tied up so long until he just couldn't walk around. He said, "I can't do it. I can't do it." And he said he didn't even know he was free. &gt;&gt; And maybe some of you tonight is living with so much baggage in your life and so many scars that you just I'm just here to tell you you've been set free from the Jesus Christ. Oh, I'm here to tell you you need to drive the baggage like that. You go at the airport and you many times I'm always on a plane, brother Kenny. And I just love it when you can just go, "Here's my baggage." &gt;&gt; And you watch it go up down the little escalator and it goes and it goes around and I'm going to the plane. Praise God. And too many times we carry our baggage with us and scars in our lives. When Jesus Christ has already carried every weight, every sin, every diabetes, every cancer, whatever you got, he's he's the greatest high priest we got. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's an untapped resource that he just is sitting there going, "Hey, I've been here the whole time. Just tap into me." &gt;&gt; And you know what? Maybe you're not completely healed today, but just keep claiming it every single day. &gt;&gt; Just keep walking forward. Say, "Lord, I don't feel no different, but I'm not going by my feelings. I'm going by my own time, my resources." Oh, I tell you, he says, "I just claim it tonight. Oh, claim it tonight. &gt;&gt; But he goes on to say, he said, "That's the way man is today. You don't know what he says, you don't know that Jesus Christ made you free, brother." He said, "Let's get out of it." He said, "Let's get somewhere. God made us free." &gt;&gt; Don't starve to death. God has got Pentecostal blessings all through the skies. Listen to this. And untapped resources of his goodness. &gt;&gt; Untapped resources of his goodness. He said, "So let's go to it. What whatsoever will will come." He said, "Let him come." He said, "Drink." He said, "Drink from the life freely from the waters of life freely." He said, "The eagle," he builds his nest high in the rock. And he's like the church. And the church of Jesus Christ is the church that set up on a hill that gives light. It's high. It's got a high ambitions. &gt;&gt; Oh, it says it's ought to have high expectations. [snorts] &gt;&gt; It's okay to have high ambitions. high expectations. He said it should have high expectations because we've been expecting God to do something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're living in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; If we could just get above our storms tonight, you know, when the plane goes through it and you feel it all and I'm like, "Lord Jesus, lo, I'm with you always. Would you please land?" As brother Paul said tonight, he said, "You ever heard that scripture?" I said, "Yeah." I said, "I love it." Cuz I mean, I go through a storm. And I'm like, get this plane out of the sky and let's land or at least get above the clouds. &gt;&gt; But so many times we we get caught up right there in that cloud of life &gt;&gt; and trials and the devil keeps wearing us out and our family and this don't go right and the the laundry is messed up and I mean I mean I'm talking about major problems. the the the water heater goes out &gt;&gt; and then you go to Ecuador and you travel the world and you go, &gt;&gt; I ain't complaining about nothing. &gt;&gt; You get into the shower and it's cold and you go, "Praise the Lord &gt;&gt; that we even have water." &gt;&gt; And then you start eating some rice and you you eat this and we're just we're just spoiled. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to be honest tonight. We're spoiled brats. I'm a spoiled brat. But we have untapped resources and we got other people in other countries that might just have one little message thing. I'm telling you, I've seen it and they'll come up to me, "Hey, brother, can you get me a book? I've been reading this for 20 years and I've got three pages." &gt;&gt; And it will rip your heart out. &gt;&gt; I'm being honest tonight. You go overseas and you they got one book and they got like just a few things. They have just a few few and they marked it up so much and passed it around so much. It feels like a piece of sheet. like a sheet you can literally cover up with. It's been touched so much and we have untapped resources. The message of the hour on our phone on on the iPad. We have the whole book. &gt;&gt; All his blessings. Just get into it. &gt;&gt; I'm encouraging tonight. Get into it. It's all good. &gt;&gt; And as we as I'm trying to I'm trying to get this planet out of the sky, but he says if you come in this afternoon saying, "Well, I go up and if I get get in the prayer line, all right." Well, he said he'll tell me what I'm Well, Lord, he says, "Oh, don't have expectations like that." He said, "But if you don't do it, uh, he won't get I won't." He said, "If you don't do it, then I won't get nothing." He said, "Your expectation is not too much." &gt;&gt; He said, "Come to church this afternoon. If you're sick, say, I'm expecting to go home." Well, &gt;&gt; he said, "I'm not going to leave till it happens." He said, "If you haven't got the Holy Ghost, say, well, I'll stay here to," he said, "and right to in this place or I'll get the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "I come here amongst the Holy Ghost people." He said, "I come here where the spirit is at. I stay right here." He said, "I want to be like old Buddy Robson was on that in that cornfield." &gt;&gt; Think about it tonight, Brother Tony. He talked about corny. He said, "Oh," he said, "Lord, if you don't give me the Holy Ghost, when you come back, you'll find a pile of bones of Buddy Robson." I tell you, it's time to us to say expectations and say, "Lord, I'm not leaving till I get it. I'm not leaving. I'm going to tap into his resources because every resource in that book is yours and mine tonight." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. He goes on to say, he said, "A man one time was trying to seek God, and every time he'd say, I'm saved." The devil would say, "No, you're not." This is where I'm going tonight. &gt;&gt; I'm not saved. He said, "No, you're not." He says, "One day he drove down a stake." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Listen. One day, he just made me think about this. One day he drove down a stake and he said, "Satan, from this on, I'll point to this stake." &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "This is the place where I met God's requirements." &gt;&gt; He said, "One day, Brother Giddy, I drove down a stake. Brother Kenny, Brother Tony, all of us, Brother Isaac, all of us have drove down a steak." Maybe you just hadn't drove the stake far enough. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's just kind of like leaning here. Well, God had just come to church. You know what? He didn't come to save this building. He came to save individuals that want to say, "I'm here to get what God has called me for. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says, he goes on to say, he said, "You drive your steak down right beside your seat this afternoon, saying, Satan, right here is where every doubt's going to lay." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm going to fly away with him this afternoon. I'm going to He said, "I'm going to accept exactly what he told me I could do." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Do you believe it?" I say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as we I want to bring this out as we close this down tonight. He says, "But the church," he says, "you see, let's see what where Mr. Moody said about it. Let's see what Mr. Wesley said about it." He said, "Them men lived in their age." He said, "That was all right for their age, but we got not only a scientifically a scientific tree to climb, we've got untapped resources." Amen. &gt;&gt; He said of the bountiful blessings of God which is not limited to our limit. &gt;&gt; That's the problem. It's not what you can do. He's already paid it all. &gt;&gt; You all, we all come to him and say, "Well, God, what I can do for you?" No. What can I do for you? Lord, I here I come. I'm I'm You know, he didn't come to save a bunch of perfect people. He come to save individuals. I say, "Lord, here I am. I lay it before you tonight. Lord, I'm I'm filthy. I'm unclean." That's where God comes and cleans up. &gt;&gt; He can touch the ring, the the rink is sinner, whatever it is, walks in this house of God tonight. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what they look like. You should have saw me on the outside when I when I was in the world. &gt;&gt; I tell you, if he could save me, he can save anyone. &gt;&gt; That's our God tonight. He said, "Whatsoever you ask in the Father's name, he'll do it." Every promise in the book belongs to you. When you're saved, listen to this. He said, "When you're saved, he gives you a check." &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He gives you a check with his name wrote at the bottom of it. He said, "Don't be afraid to fill it out." &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He said, "Don't be afraid to fill it out because the bank of heaven will recognize when it goes to the Pentecostal clearing house." &gt;&gt; Oh my, I'm telling you tonight, fill it out. It's already got Jesus's name on it. Let it go to the clearing house tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I like what he I like what he says here. I'm trying to get to it tonight. We're almost there. But he goes he says he goes on to say he says God's known by simple faith by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's the only way. He said God in you brings you a son of God changes your nature. And the very same thing God the creator who made all things spoken to the world existence by his word. He said that same spirit in you believe everything God says and there's nothing impossible that you can believe it. He said you won't stand back in one little creed and say I don't believe it except it. He said I can't believe God will I can't believe God will do this. I can't believe. He says you limit God by your unbelief. &gt;&gt; He said you limit God by your unbelief. And I just want to bring out something right here. And I know we're winding down, but it says right here, he said, "The Bible said the kingdom is," we're talking about untapped resources. He says, "The Bible said, Brother Ram says the kingdom is within what?" &gt;&gt; You, not these walls, not in this drywall, not in what's behind the studs, in you. He said, "When Jesus rose up from the dead, remember he had on his side, listen, I love this. He said he had the keys of death and hell, not the keys of the kingdom." He said that was given to the church. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Now Peter had the keys." He said, "Do you believe Jesus would keep his word if he if he w if he if he doesn't, brother, he wasn't God. That's all." He said, "Peter, I give you the keys of the kingdom." In other words, to the Holy Spirit. Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. &gt;&gt; But I want to bring this to you. And tonight, we're talking about resources. And we're going to we're going to come down to a close. And I just want to show you something tonight. And I hope this is okay. I hope he invites me back. But if he doesn't, I'll keep preaching the word. I love you, brother Paul. But I just thought about this tonight. And I know there's a basketball and football and people probably going crazy. Oh my word, he's pulling a basketball and football out. But but you know, we're human, you know, and and and I just thought about this basketball and maybe maybe some of the young young boys, young Anybody volunteer tonight? Maybe y'all can come back and volunteer. Do you mind tonight? Maybe hold this basketball. But we're talking about untapped resources, right? And we're talking about this football. And I hope this really sinks in tonight because I was thinking about this and I thought about this baseball. I saw the baseball. I think little Joseph's baseball. He and maybe Joseph, will you hold this tonight? The baseball. And I thought about these resources and I hope this really sinks in as we talked about driving stakes down. Maybe come right here where everybody can see you. Do you mind? And and I thought maybe maybe name a I don't know a famous uh baseball player that that makes a lot of money. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Babe Ruth. Babe Ruth. Maybe of our age. I don't know who who that is today. Maybe maybe the Dodgers guy. whatever his name is, Otani. But that baseball is, you know, in his hands, it might be just a home run. &gt;&gt; I hope you're understanding me tonight. In his hands, this might be worth $6, $7, $11, but you put in Otani's hand, &gt;&gt; it's worth 40, 50, 70, $80 million. &gt;&gt; Do you understand tonight? &gt;&gt; This football might be $7 to him or whatever. Maybe uh who would you say like Patrick Mahomes or I don't know just a name. I don't know. I I I'm old school so I'll probably tell you some old names like Troy Aman or something terrible. But but like in his hands this might be worth $7 or just a game touchdown or the game ball. &gt;&gt; But in Patrick Mahome's hands this is 160 $80$100 million. &gt;&gt; That's right. You put this basketball hands maybe say Michael Jordan tonight &gt;&gt; it's $50 million $50 billion 1 million 20 whatever it is is that you put that in Michael Jordan's hands but in his hands it might be just $5 tonight &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; do you understand what I'm saying &gt;&gt; I'm talking about untapped resources tonight and I hope this sinks in thank you maybe you sit it right there but I was thinking about tonight I was I was getting ready tonight and I thought about these I thought about these nails and I thought about resources And I thought about this and you put them in the right hands. &gt;&gt; These nails tonight cuz I build houses and build things. They might just build me a birdhouse tonight. &gt;&gt; That's about probably all it's going to build. &gt;&gt; These little these little Now maybe brother Brandon, thank you for getting them for me. But but maybe that'll build me a little birdhouse that's going to fall apart in a couple weeks. But when you put these nails in Jesus's hands, &gt;&gt; when you tap into the right resource, &gt;&gt; when you put it into the right hands, Right? &gt;&gt; It's gave you salvation. It set you free. It set your cancer free. It kept your diabetes free. It's gave you something to be happy about. But I'm here to tell you, I want to read this quote that maybe the musicians come. It says, "Now sons and daughters who are the most powerful before God. What is an angel? An angel's a servant. Is that right?" He said, "They're servants. What are you?" &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a resource tonight. He said, "What are you?" He said, "His sons and daughter." He said, "Who has the most power in heaven?" Then he said, "A sinner that's saved by grace or an archangel that's standing right by his side." Oh, listen to this. He says, he says, "The sinner that's saved by grace has more authority in heaven than the archangel that stands behind his side without sin." I'm talking about you, me tonight. A sinner saved by grace has more authority. You got to tap into the resource tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or he died in vain. Brother Tony, &gt;&gt; he died in vain. If you we too many times, we just got to tap into his resource. &gt;&gt; We got the whole book. We got all the message quotes, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We got We know him really good. We memorize them really good. &gt;&gt; But is the author &gt;&gt; is the author of this book, young I tell you, young age, middle age, is this author living on the inside? Is this the author living on the inside of you saying, "Hey, you got untapped resources." &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, if you could just get this book in your hands tonight as they play something softly and you can realize what resource you have &gt;&gt; because this word will defeat the devil anywhere, any place, anyhow, &gt;&gt; and anytime. &gt;&gt; And if you could just get the sword in your hand, you know what? God, I I just want to close on this as they place something. Think about this tonight. They might get $50 million. &gt;&gt; Oh my, this is hitting home. &gt;&gt; Oh, think about it tonight. They might get 50. Michael Jordan's riding around saying, "I don't have a care in the world. I could pay all my bills. I can buy 19 Lamborghinis." &gt;&gt; But look at who you are tonight. &gt;&gt; That's right. tap into that resource and say, "Lord, I'm a daughter son and daughter of the king." &gt;&gt; Oh, it should put something in you tonight. When you realize who you are that you're just not going around the mountain for 30 years and 40 years, I believe a message, but the message is living inside of individuals. He's wanting to live inside of you. &gt;&gt; I hope you're understanding. He send a son who has more authority. Of course, we forget what we are. &gt;&gt; We forget many times what made us who we are. And when after we become what we are, then we forgot how we get here. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you, Lord, I'm sorry. I do the same thing. I get where I'm at. I get complacent in my life. Me, you, we get complacent. We forget how we got here. And he goes on to say, he said, "Oh boy, 84 cent." He said, "Oh, John, you're not very much after all. We're 84 cent. What is that today? Inflation. What is it? $3, $5." He said, "I touched the boys, but boys, you got a soul." He said, "You got a soul that's worth 10 million worlds." Isaac, come here for a second tonight. I'm here to tell you, you got a soul on the inside that's worth a lot more than Michael Jordan could ever come up with, that P Manning could ever come up with. You got a soul on the inside that's that needs to be saved and converted. And it's got untapped resources. When the Holy Ghost fills you and he keeps filling you day by day, you have untapped resources. Tap into them. They're yours. They're mine. They're yours, Brother Brandon, tonight. Oh, just say, "Lord, I want to tap into your resources. I'm tired of believing I got this. I'm tired of anxiety. It's a Wednesday night. I'm It might have held you over. I'm But I'm ready to tell you, maybe there's something said, "Lord, I I just I haven't stepped out and just said, Lord, I surrender to you tonight. Whatever my problem is, he already knows. But that soul, this body is worth 84 cent. Maybe his body today is worth $5 with inflation. But that soul, young people, that soul on the inside is worth more than any any basketball player. And what Payton Manning can make. &gt;&gt; He's come for individuals. Every one of you tonight. &gt;&gt; He's came. He set you free. It's time to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Thank you. It's time to rejoice. I know you've heard me probably long enough, but I'm here to tell you, tap in to these resources. They're all good. Every one of them, they're all good. &gt;&gt; Tap into them tonight. Maybe just heads bowed tonight. Maybe just someone say, "Lord, God, I want to tap into it tonight. Maybe I've been around this mountain long enough and Lord, I I just need another refilling. Lord, I I went around the mountain and I I'm just I'm just complacent with my life and I just Well, I was just me and no more. But maybe say, "Lord, work on me. Come and touch me tonight." Oh, maybe there's someone say before this service ends, "Lord, no one looking around say, Lord, I I just want the Holy Ghost in my life." Oh, no one looking around. Maybe it's just one person. If not, God bless you. Oh, Father. Oh, fish is worth one soul is worth it all. Oh, may you touch them while they're sitting there tonight. Oh, whatever it is, you have a need, whatever it is, just lift it up to God. Talk to them. Just talk to them. Say, "Dad, Lord, Father, we love you tonight. Take up this broke up sermon, Lord. And we would really get dedicated, Lord. Even my life, God, we would just come into a consecration with you, God. we would tap into your resources, Lord. Oh, Father, we love you, Father. Oh, we love you tonight. Oh, we love you, Father, in Jesus name. Oh, let's sing is it myself. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just worship him for a minute tonight.

We've been waiting for overcomers [music] [singing] in this life. [music] We've been made glorious [singing] [music] through the blood of Jesus Christ. [singing] Hallelujah. How many raise your hand and say, "Thank you, Lord, for the word of God tonight, the word of life." Thank you, Lord, that you're the exhaustable fountain. We have this treasure in earthn vessels tonight. We're not looking for it somewhere out there, but it's within us. We just have to tap it. How many got it real clear tonight? You can be around all of God's resources and not tap it. That's right. &gt;&gt; You got to tap it. And they're saying that there's so much oil in our own country and they want [music] to tap at California, different places. Our president now wants to tap it. You know, the enemy has kept that back for many years because of, you know, whatever environment or whatever else, but they're f we haven't. We've depended on other countries, but you know what, right? Within our own country, [music] we just haven't tapped it yet. &gt;&gt; It's within you. You just got to tap it. Get in that word. Can you say amen? Get in that place. He that is in within you. He that is in you is the message of the hour. It's he that it's in you is what he's trying to show. And it's an [music] inexhaustible fountain. Inexhaustible fountain. There is no limitations except the limitations that we put on it. I'll tell you I feel pretty pretty good tonight from the word of God. And it's not a pride. It's just I feel very privileged. How many raise your hands say? I feel privileged to have access access to this type of fountain, access to these things and uh just to see the untapped resources. How do we tap into it? We have to drill. We have to drill for that oil. Prayer, reading the word, taking your time to read the word sometimes. There's a difference in skimming across it and really digging. If you're digging for a treasure, there's a difference in just taking one shovel, but to really dig and keep digging deep until you find the treasure. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; If we're bound by our past, the past can keep us from what he has in the future for us. [music] I say to you in the name of the Lord Jesus tonight that we live way below our privileges [music] and there's so much more that God has for us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Oh, I want to know you more. Oh, I want to know you more. We don't know what God has for us and all the resources. Praise the Lord. Let's Let's give a hand clap to the Lord for the word tonight.
