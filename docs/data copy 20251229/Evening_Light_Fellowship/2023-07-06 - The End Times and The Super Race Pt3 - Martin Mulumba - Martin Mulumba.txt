an awful lot of work so this a week from today will be the first service in the community center the following Sunday yes in the community center the following Wednesday Community Center it may be I don't know how long it takes because sometimes on a remodel it takes you longer than you thought but the Lord willing I'd like to only have to have one Sunday excuse me um uh yeah if we could just one Sunday out of here but we'll see it may be two weeks or so and if so praise God we still have a place to gather somebody said praise God it's not outside in 114 degrees under a tree ain't nothing to complain about you'll have comfortable chairs and air-conditioned and it'd be a little bit different but hey I know you all persevere and you'll bear with us and I I I uh just ask you for your understanding for the inconvenience so the Lord willing will do that and um we're even doing the um the new lighting is going to be up here we we haven't had correct stage lighting up here since we bought the church we're going to redo that we're redoing uh some of the air conditioning units we replace seven of them here a few months ago we got three more that are kind of on their last leg this building's over 20 years old and uh you know uh when you look at the carpet thank the lord it's lasted this long and everything but uh yeah uh it's time you know uh that you replace it and put some new stuff in there and I know all of you will enjoy it so uh the Lord bless you and thank the Lord for all of those uh what what happened I get a little bit too much involved I'll be honest with you I get a little too involved and get a little too much into it then I get stressed out and everything like that so I've got orders from my board from my son and from my boss sister Sandy no I'm teasing on that I'm her boss but she she uh she gets away with some things now and then but anyway they've told me you don't even get to come over here because you know I I tend to get too involved next thing you know I'm packing the carpet on my and throwing it out there in the back and tearing up the carpet and scraping and everything like that in fact the brother and I was working with the you know they said well how old are you I took him over here to master Taco for lunch most of them all speak Spanish but anyway they said hey cuanto anos are you how many years old are you I said how what do you guess what do you guess what do you think yeah I once said yeah I think 48 . another one said nah naisy he's 52 or 55 something like that and the other one said 962. I said no I'm 70. Oh no you're not 70 man you you work like a young man I'm not a ramrod I just lead by example I just believe that whatsoever you do you do as unto the Lord not as unto man not with lip service but with your whole heart that's why when we come to church we're not here to to entertain we're not here to see one another we're here to worship God and we put everything into it even on a Wednesday night amen praise the Lord I have Brother Martin malumba is going to be ministering for us tonight I'm going to turn the service back over to you brother David if you sing another song God bless you all amen so remember a week from today the doors will be closed out front you'll be going around to the bed amen God bless you the spirit of God [Music] [Applause] write your word in my heart Feel My Hope stand with me come to my life [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh Lord [Applause] [Music] your word in my heart [Music] [Applause] fear of God [Music] back on the Lord [Music] Heavenly Father we truly desire your spirit to move once again tonight to fill our whole being to make us sanctuaries where you are pleased to dwell within father in this day look for a god of great Darkness but you chose a place where you can find and abide loan it's right that you are cleansing day and night you are strengthening and feeling low far and giving low faraga materials to understand the time in which we are living in fathers because without love for the god you nearby us we would be no father God roaming around and like low faraga Ship Without a shepherd and being led astray to slaughter father but it is a privilege unto us today to be standing low father God in thy presence knowing it's not by might not by power by by the spirit as Lord father God we wait upon thy presence once again tonight may you attempt to be sick may you heal or father God may you look for a God to strengthen those who are discouraged may you love father God [Music] for Revelation Lord because Lord has the time goes by the moral of our God we are to be closer to you may you father God open that word unto us once again tonight as we look away unto you with Thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's name amen may God bless you once again tonight it is a privilege to be in the house of the Lord as well we are still standing will take The Book of Luke we still in that same part believe we're going to dwell upon it a little bit a little longer because the words of Jesus packs a little bit too much into it as described would say that many things that Jesus did are not all written but we believe by the key given to us in this last day we are able to stretch out what we're is uh within the word Luke 22 chapter Luke chapter 22 verse 24 to 30 and then I'll have you be seated and there was also a Strife among them meaning the disciples which of them should be accounted the greatest and he said unto them the kings of the Gentiles exercise a lot of sheep over them and they that exercise Authority upon them are called benefactors but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is Chief has he that does serve amen may the Lord bless you you may be seated uh once again I would like to thank brother Ron for the trust and the privilege to the opportunity and privilege to stand here uh to keep developing the title that we've been talking about for the last three parts the end times and the super race we have seen so far in the last two Services uh Department of the Gentile nations in the end times where we saw Nimrod being the type of Lucifer the type of the devil who had ideas that he taught to be the heir of the earth and he had the things that he wanted to accomplish he wanted to make a demo for himself he wanted to build a strong Nation he wanted to build his own religion and as we went about we saw that even in his religion he took the people one step at a time away from the true uh previous worship that was the relationship between God and Men and as you went along his desire was to be worshiped and you want to be worshiped and by people looking at him because as long as he still wish being worshiped just by having an idea of thinking that the devil is an ideal a spirit out there is not fulfilled if that desire is not fulfilled yet and we saw that um as he goes about time and time after time it took the People by dividing the land and bringing culture languages from one continent and we could then we have countries then we have a series then we have streets and and on and on and on by Within every country we see that people have their own religion you'll see that you know the religion of the whites the religion of the black people the religion of uh of the ancestors and all these things the devil was just taking the people one step at a time to bring them to worship Him and people but then over time people since they were taken away from the presence of God they started leave building by those principles day after day they think like oh we are Americans we are Africans we Congolese we're French and we we Filipinos and we're Chinese and all these things it took a little bit of time and people became proud of it it's like you know where are you from oh I'm from Africa are you Congolese yes I am like proud of it you know but then that was an agenda that the devil had but then when God created uh the men and women he said for multiply and dominate upon the Earth he didn't tell them go out there and divide the land and become looking at each other on the basis of race and on the basis of money and on the basis of all these things but then glory be to God that God also wanted to restore that Fellowship because the fellowship had was taken away people didn't really know what they were worshiping but then the Lord also had to stop working in a way way to bring people back but then the first revelation that we find that amen when it comes to God the first of all Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ because he is revealing himself to you for this real the only purpose to bring that back that relationship between God and us and as the men were coming about the devil knew that he also had the work to do he knew that there was uh God was sending out prophets and when the prophets were coming they were bringing the people back to the line and bringing the word and people will look at it it's like oh glory be to God but the devil was not satisfied because if we only had a group of people that we call Christians it's very easy but then the devil had to come among the Believers to try not to infiltrate them and to be able to overcome them because he wants because I believe in Isaiah Isaiah he said he wanted to lift himself above the stars of God because he was he could have had the rest of the two-thirds of the Angels but it was not satisfied one-third of them was not under his control and he wanted still to go and get them therefore that's why even after all these years that uh prophets were going for to Israel and and stuff and you still find that the disciples as we just read they wanted to see who was the greatest among them they wanted to see like you know among us we all do uh this and we do that and stuff but who is who is the greatest Among Us is it the pastor is it the the the one that clings so do we have to build a hierarchy of people where some people are more important than others but then God looks at them and said I said no you shall not be so those are the things of the Gentiles because people under the Dominion of the devil because it made you fall is the devil told God they all told Jesus like you know all these nations belong to me so Jesus tells them like you know no you shall not be so because if any one of you be the greatest let him be as the little one if you think that you are the greatest ever of them all be the one who served the most but then in the society that we live in serving is not in the it's not a place people have to serve me people have to worship me people have to recognize me I want to do what I want to do for my own best not for the best of God's kingdom but then our individual mindset once Aikido I want to do it for my own I'm doing this because I want to be happy for myself but then Jesus started drawing a different picture and as he's drawing a different picture people now we understand that these disciples still had a journey to go before receiving the Holy Ghost they had a certain mindset they were living in a certain manner they were thinking in a different ways but then it requires the coming of the Holy Ghost the holy spirit in the people to bring that old nature to note and to build another kingdom because Jesus says in verse 27 for weather is greater he that seed is admit or he that serveth is not he that's either that meat but I am among you as he that service and the year and and ye are they which have continued with me in my Temptation and I appoint you unto you a kingdom is showing them a different walk a different place is pointing them to a whole different realm but then the devil at the same time does not sit quiet and looks at them and say like you know oh Jesus these are your people take them and go with them they say the devil looks at it and understands like hey there's really a lot of work to be done here Paul comes about he started telling the people taking them from the levels where they were being Corinthians and lifting them up one step at a time one step at a time but the devil looks at it they say that uh these people are going too far let me now get to work that's what we'll be talking about today because uh uh last time we went into almost into Genesis 11 and by God's grace if we able to to get to it and uh he'll be wonderful but then by God's grace so to uh draw that line and to show how the prophet shows it so that at least every time that we referencing to these things it's not just based on on the fact that we are in the message because we can still be in the message but when we look what what brother Branham says about even people in the message and stuff it becomes a little bit scary but also joyful to the soul to know that we are so privileged to have this access to this Revelation and not just to be called church members but to be called the true bride of Jesus Christ he will uh it will take all the time that it will take by God's grace because he met me the other day and he was drawing all these things and I was like what are you talking about and but then when you draw it differently then I'm like yes this is so wonderful so by God's grace will take the time that we'll take because I don't want to mix things of what is of the bride and what is going on with uh the devil at the same time I want to keep them separate so that at least uh everything can be uh held in its position so that when we focus on the bride it's on the bride and when we deal with everything else accordingly but God's grace so the devil looking at it he sees that God has sent the first prophet which was uh Paul brother Paul came about and did a wonderful work and lay down the word and started to laid out the pardon and say like he say like you know as a wise master builder have laid down the pattern be wise he that builds upon it but then at the same time those converts because when the Revival comes in the city thousands of people show up I mean media we see that in branham's days 300 000 people in one meeting but look at us today barely we have it we can fill it up Sanctuary with 5 000 people why because there are reasons to it and everything is laid down in the word and as the Lord opens these things up to us it's just so wonderful then it gives courage to the Believers that as we see the pyramid growing the Lesser it is the smaller it is and only the Overcomers will be able to make it and these Overcomers they have to be equipped they have to have the tools they have to know to separate because in this day the two shall be so much closer it will be even harder to separate them because even the disciples told Jesus we met a guy is not one of us we should stop him a second why did you stop him because in them already without the Holy Spirit they had an organizational mindset they wanted to start an organization right there it's only people of this group who has the truth it's only people of this church it's only this pastor who understands it better oh you see those Brothers they don't really have it that thing already started among the disciples and the devil knew that dice that's his way that when we see all those things repeating again in this day we need to go back to the pattern we need to go back to the world in order for us to understand exactly what is taking place and what is what we supposed to do and as the devil saw that I'm saying uh Simeon Church age paragraph 18 but there is but there's where the Roman Catholic Church was formed out of out of a group of people that were converts of simple and ironus and some Martin and on them they were converted Christians from paganism over to Christianity just as we saw last time that the people who were under this oppression of nimrod they had all this Idol worshiping they were had all these elements of spirits and culture and countries and stuff they were now converted to Christianity and now as they were converted to Christianity but wanted to pull the church back into the Old Testament form of ministry like having high priests apostolics a succession like one book to another Pope another Pope if we could go down and Through the Bible you'd find out that that's exactly the truth and how God condemned the thing from the very beginning and last night church it said I hate it the Lord saw it from the very beginning that the people came from a different lifestyle from a different way a way of looking at things when they came now into Christianity they wanted not to bring all the gods and all the cultures into Christianity despite of all that was given to them there's no more Gentiles there's no more free man there's no more slave in all are in Christ but these people tell him about with the very same idea and say like uh we want to go back just as they did in the wilderness they say like you know no no no we remember where we're eating in Egypt this is too boring we don't want this like you know there's a lot a little bit of a little bit of movement out there in Egypt let us make us a king do what go back in Egypt the very same thing and the Lord will bring him like the very same thing that they were living out there in their mind they wanted to have a king over them they wanted to have a high priest over them and that's how they never came about they say well let me get with this unconverted people the people who could not who didn't believe the whole truth the people who didn't give in totally to God they wanted to have a little bit of Christianity yet a little bit of beer on the side a little bit of Christianity a little bit of movie on the side because of that the devil finds his way in the devil find his way in bourbonam says in the same message progress 63 was there a prophecy concerning that you remember post prophecy last night I know that after my departure Grievous wool shall enter in among you and Men of your own class they're just like us but with a powerful thought in the mind with a vision in the mind people anointed of the devil but they just look like any one of us they dress like us they talk like us but with a certain mind in the in the in the uh with a certain idea in the mind gracious wolves shall come and shall enter in among you and Men of your own class right in their own church the Roman Catholic Church coming up will rise up among you and pull away disciples after them and Paul's wolf we find out become Nicolaitans foreign they came to church the conversion they didn't give internally to God because of that the word says things they did not fully give in to God then God sends out the spirit to drive them away totally to it and these people with what they had in the mind with what they wanted to become they still wanted to be recognized as one of the greatest but Jesus said no there was a kingdom before this Kingdom existed and I want to get you back to their Kingdom but then before then look at what is going to happen what a privileged people we could be that before the danger comes before anything starts taking driving you away the Lord shows you this is what is going to happen so look at what is going to happen now it's our job now it's either we are truly converted truly given unto God or just a halfway then by being halfway The Vault find his way the devil finds his way into us amen you see and uh in the same message program 76 and this church had to begin to have a root of bitterness coming up in in them because that that this church demand Church the big part the majority of them always was hammering against the Holy Spirit ruling in the church and they wanted to rule themselves they wanted to set up a priesthood they wanted to act like the Old Testament people they wanted priests and they they if the Pagan the the pagan gods back there where they they was converted they had priests and so forth of Jupiter and Priests of Venice and so forth they want to bring in them same to make these men what we saw yesterday that in different land a different part of the world people bring all kind of religion all kind of gods and as we say in India God of fertility of of sun of rain and and all these things up and the conversion when they come they hear the Revival coming up what do they want to do they want to bring all those Gods now but just by converting it what was the statue yesterday now he's a human being walking what was uh just a picture yesterday that couldn't talk to them now they have a priest that can talk to them now but then since they were not converted they wanted to be worshiped they wanted somebody to come and tell them everything they have not in the purpose as of in James 5 go confess your same to one to another but to bring the worship of the devil in human flesh the same devil taking them one step at a time showing them like you know don't worry it's just a God the Father God the the son and God the Holy Ghost and then they represent it with uh God the Father a light the son a little baby the Holy Ghost a little dove that was not enough it brings it down okay from one country to another okay let's have a Mary a woman with Marina with a baby from the baby the baby doesn't talk let's remove the woman let's now we just have the woman help Mary Help Mary after Hail Mary Mary is almost disappearing because now he wants now to cup off is Eden in one of the services we read that that he is going to make himself God and he's going to do it and by doing it he also needs to have vehicles and converted people in the church converts off the message that he's going to use as a vehicle to drive them from to to fulfill that purpose say like you know look where they started look how they're coming down look at what he's doing from the Daniel Vision we see that the statue of Nebuchadnezzar all the four stages all the four kingdoms is the same devil coming down one step at a time coming down once upon a time so that we can look at him one day and say like oh this is what we've always looked at we always talked about that's what he wants to do but then at the same time God also must also have a people that has to be aware of it and by becoming aware of the devices of the devil then we are more equipped now to fight the battle because without being aware of the devices of the devil then we are just swept away because it will look so simple so honey because he's going to get the kingdom by flatteries you see it's just it's just it's just freedom of speech you know it's your Liberty you know you can just do it yourself you a young girl you should you should have fun it sounds so simple but behind it now it requires now he that heareth the word to be able to at their own to hold together otherwise before you know it I was here I was praying there's no more prayer then I'm I'm going I'm going I'm going but then the dev does exactly what he wants to do and has he had members now he brought them in then they get to uh then I see a room and I see him uh the Council of Nasir as they get there now these unconverted people they came about they were always debate among them God the Father deity nobody was uh there was no understanding among them then the devil looks at them like since I already have a part of my people in the church let me bring in now another person to be able to achieve the great purpose shows us the same message paragraph 130 is 113. so Constantine with this in his mind to strengthen his Empire as Rome always did to hold the keys to the world he had to bring his Pagan ideas and take the Christians ideas and somewhat consolidate them together to dwell to weld this together and make himself an Empire that would be that would be second to none see because that would make him yell the greatest ruler in the world constantly what he wanted from the very beginning to make a great nation but then when he was hit in the uh the political Realm he wanted not to change it into proper room but then how does he do it people in the church diversion in the terms of vision of Revelation and he's come is not come revealed not revealed and all these things here people in reality they wanted to make themselves a name because the greater he is as the biggest person in the land the biggest the highest the most notable preacher they know in the surface of the Earth to the point they want to become taking over from the message of the age that same idea of being lifted upon above the stars of God of becoming The Interpreter of the Gods he wants now somebody and I'm converted man on the pulpit without the ministry in the home without the holy spirit in the office without the Holy Spirit to now fulfill this great agenda but now what does he do it takes the man the uncoverted man brings in the political power and puts it all together in order now to achieve that great purpose and what does it become it becomes then the religion of Jezebel this religion of Jezebel these unconverted people these people who did not know what conversion was that's why but I'm saying he said you see when Billy Graham goes out there he has all these big meetings after you a year or two he comes about he can't even find 30 people he says but look at Paul what did Paul do he tests one man brings him all the way to conversion fills him with the Holy Spirit then that man is able to go out and convert more people now we have now another side in the same church and people also who were not all the time they were given to receive the Holy Ghost did not receive the Holy Ghost now they start embarking now to another agenda coming now to church it's not just sitting there I come to church I listen to the word I'll go back I come back early listen to the word I go back no there is a purpose of coming to church to be filled with the Holy Spirit otherwise there's another gender where the devil wants to possess people to help people under his control so that he also can dwell in the Phil fill them up just the same way as we see with her Judah Judas is carried because since he missed he went out there did all the great Miracles and evangelize and all these things but then since he missed to receive the Holy Ghost what does the Bible say then the devil did what entered into him the very same agenda when the devil did that what did he do did you go to do sell the word betray the word you come to church you listen to the word you come to church you listen to the world you come to the church you then you it becomes common to us then it become common it's like well I've heard this I know this yeah I know that quotation yeah it's it's here yeah I know it yeah there's nothing new in the message there's nothing you can preach me that I can you that I've learned exactly then we understand what has happened amen we understand what has happened but then by God's grace God so loved the world that he is given his only begotten son that he that believeth in him believing is turning from your old ways into a new way that if you believe now you become a new Creator creation this new creation not made out of men men ideas men interpretation men men ways of thinking all my culture my country my this my this no a new kingdom coming down Jesus say I appoint you unto a kingdom is it getting you again opening another door a place that will shut all these years because the cherubins were standing there in the front of the Tree of Life of the tree of life now the door now is open unto us for us to go back to the fellowship again now when you stay outside without being filled with the Holy Ghost dead death comes in and when death comes in quickly you start all of a sudden you just start feeling that I am better than him I am better than she she can't tell me anything why because that spirit that unconvention that your unconvisted state you're the state of unbelief brings you now into the agenda of the devil and quickly you have the political views and your political views now start like drawing lines like you know I don't like him he's a Democrat he's a republican he's this is that he's a socialist we're withstanding socialism oh we don't like communism in our country exactly we understand where that came from the purpose why God is bringing all these things around is to Enlighten our eyes to give us all these informations for us to be aware to be precisely understanding like time is coming to the end it's not a time for us just to roam around to say well I'll make this much money I still need to do this I say yes plant your corn plant your potato but have the understanding of the time in which we are living in and this is where the road now is opening this thing you say look how they started they came in the church like every one of us but since they did not open their heart to receive the Holy Ghost they were still attached clinging to the cultures to their to the denominations and all these things to the pastor to the churches now he is not the political system to to go with you alone and here now we have now a political system uh uh Constantine with the unbelievers they come together a this agenda now cannot Blossom pretty easily because since they were had so much money they had access now to all the businesses in the world because at this room already had experience on how to rule the land from the time of nimrod because that was the agenda now when you add that together now with these unconverted people what can stop them and that's what we call today the Catholic Church and this Catholic Church is not always pointing to what we see out there in Rome but when we look in our lives the way we're conducting ourselves the way the word is open unto us and how we all like to hold on to what we like best goes the same way as these oh we we are the one we have the money we have the political uh Medias we have all access to everything we we say one thing every all the world has to follow us that's what they had that's why they would do it they are doing today as far as conversion Constantine was never converted but not a son of God and some of them tried to make him it wasn't never one thing did ever do that he was something like a Christian to me so only other uh so honor the one offered the Nicole Nico Nicole nicolayton churches has to put across and as far as anything else he has ever done that look like Christianity the church was married paragraph 154. Christianity that is the needy equation side the formal side married to the state with Pagan ceremonies Pagan ceremony as ceremonies and it was the birth of the Catholic church in that day church is the fact that one person who heard the word who didn't receive the Holy Ghost got now trapped into the realm of politics and there they are that's what we call the Catholic Church yet at the same time we also have those who withstand that Doctrine we have those in the days of their messenger received the word believe the word converted receive the Holy Spirit and now they were positioned now they had not to fight that system not to get in among them because the word says how come the rules came in because we lowered the standards because we didn't keep the word to the standard what we're supposed to keep it at because the prayer life was lowered because coming to church was lowered because paying our tithe was lowered all those still those elements in every every one of us we can look at it and say this can be a dull for the devil to get it because if you don't pay tithe today tomorrow you'll feel guilty but then if you don't recover from it then you start getting used to it then you start getting used to it the more you start getting used to it then becomes normal for you not to pay and now since you can pay it into your tithes and God doesn't bless you anymore then you have to find another job to fill up all the bills that you couldn't pay anymore that's how the devil works because when God established the tithe it said it is for you to be blessed but then when you stop now that God now has the free Liberty to let the devil come and take what you have and now with our own political mind we want to start now teaching God how to do it well I have 20 000. back pay for the tights well let me first get another job pay my bills first then I'll get back to it before you say it you know they said it's 50 000 you back pay of tight and at the end of the day then you're just going to give up because it's unbearable because when people file for bankruptcy it's because like you know they've looked into all the math they could do it's like hey I just give up it's the same pattern right and now when we look at it now these people now the Catholic church or these Believers or these unconverted people 139 it looked it looked good because there was rich and so forth and he gave at this great meeting when he called together Constantine gave the Bishops nice buildings it got a hold of some money and all these big places like buildings it gave these over to the church that they could use uh use as a church houses oh they were nice buildings all dressed up and so forth he gave them over to the church besides that it dressed them up and all these things 141 oh you can imagine how the Pagan said well I can go for that there is somebody that somebody can speak back to us we've been talking to an idol but this man can speak back to us after they have received all these buildings received all these churches make all this money they have experience now what was the statue now become a human you go to a doctor he can tell you exactly what you need you don't need prayer meetings anymore you don't need healing anymore of course God also heals using doctors and stuff but the condition that we are blessing here is somebody in the state in unconverted human being a person that came to the world that listen to the word but now has turned away from God now to become a new Creator creation under the devil with a lot of money with with the state behind with all that experience now they become now a new a new a new church they become the biggest of your own at times when you look at some of those churches not to name them when they have uh campaigns and stuff you look at millions of them they speak about like you know oh every Sunday we have about 50 000 attendees on one service morning service and evening service we have people streaming and they've turned out the the the the prayer meetings into into a customer service line you want us to pray for you call this number I am telling you these are things that I tell you are happening out there you can talk don't worry who can chat we can send you a prayer note we can send you a holy water we can we can have the bird the the the priests come visit you if you just pay ten thousand dollars look at where they started they heard the word but one step at a time it does started taking them away fire and farther far away from God and when all this now they're accumulating all this much money now money now had not did not turn money into the state of uh into a a standard of spirituality how come you serving God and you're suffering like this job tell us you are you you are how did they say it you are a secret sinner how come you are you you said that you worship God and you you you're not making it why because they started somewhere the turn now like you know the whole the whole world the whole world we need money I need to work for money I need money I need money I need money money now has become now even a trap to those who have it and to those who do not have it for those who have it they don't want to lose it and they have to do all the means necessary for them to keep accumulating the money and to those who do not have it they will do anything to get the money because now society looks at them ends of like you know when you have money that's what makes you a good a good man an honorable man but Abraham says uh in a second sale I believe one paragraph 153 is that like somebody will come and and pay and bills the church and and is then is that you want now to start leading things according to his views oh it's because he's the one who gives us the good money is the one who who has the the big check watch out watch out quite often even with whether with ministers I'll go preach there because they pay me good I'll go there because they have a basement a good check at the end of the service of course they've turned use the ministry that God has given them now it means for them to make themselves a lot of money why a non-converted man because he came to the ministry because he wanted money just as I was uh I I had a friend in the uh back in the days in the Congo he said like if this country this country nothing is working I think the best way the easiest way to to make money is just to open a church of course because you come to church they tell you like see the seed the seed the seed seed God is going to bless you oh another one say oh there's a brother here he was to he was about to pay your his rent God tells you God tells you take that money and give it to me all kind of playground of kind of mental kind of things why because men were unconverted and they had to use all the means necessary to get that money and from the money they get now they're the goals now to dominate all the world they'll go from one country to another and say oh we have the money we are the country who have the money we're going to develop you develop without the word because development is to take people from one state to another just like a brother saying but you came here saying that we were pagans and you made us dress the way we dressing how come when we come to your countries we find women naked just the way as we were before yesterday but the idea they had behind was not to convert the people was not to develop the people but they came with flatteries to get all the wealth to accumulate all the money and by accumulating all this money the people now said like you know look at the Beast who can be like the Beast you have to be have a degree you need you need to go to the School the best school in the land because these ones with the schools they made the biggest schools they made the biggest money you finish on one of those schools you can get the best pay out there but then without Holy Spirit you see a woman you see a brother you see a man takes the job quickly she becomes boastful I'm the one who is paying the Mind here you don't respect me I'm going to divorce you without being converted all the blessings all that beauty becomes a curse it becomes a curse and by it becoming a curse the Lord said no I can't live it as such I can leave it as such because the Lord knows that you know if I keep I leave these things coming going forward the young people when they grow everything they think in their mind what you want to become I want to become like that that Idol I want to become like the idol what do you want to become I want to become like the idol don't you want to become a preacher ah preachers are boring they always consecrating and praying and we don't have fun we don't travel as much as we like to why that's what Society is showing them that's what the unconverted people turn the world and picture it everywhere in the phones on the TV at school and everywhere they go they show them like this is what beauty looks like the American Idols everywhere you go American Idols American Idols but this is not really short you know but in the mind it's not that she wants to cover herself but she wants to look like the American Idol that she saw there it's covering but watch out the question is are you filled with the Holy Ghost are you converted because after receiving the Holy Spirit brother when I'm saying that those Africans after hearing the word themselves nobody told them they went and veiled themselves covered themselves after covering themselves why because they received the Holy Ghost but then how come you with the message with the word day after day your dressing is just going Australian Australian astray the Lord now sees it and understand like look at this spirit look at where you have shown and fall short from look at where that's going to take you we have seen it in the churches people sitting in the pews before you know it they on the street doing all kinds of things that you know but then the time has come the Lord said we need to come back we need to come back I know many times that we can find ourselves in all kinds of things and left and right but then as long as you can hear his voice harder not your heart by opening your heart now the Lord now opens a way for you now to come back to that fellowship and this Fellowship will get us through the position where we can understand exactly what are we supposed to do and as bug of 259 when they fixed up to this big thing they did the the the they mixed up the church and and the politics that was uh that was the birth of post-millennium because the church had gotten so rich it was rich as it could be and it was and what it was and it was what powerful it was over the state the stage and the church together you see they became that powerful when we look at it it is powerful the Catholic Church it is powerful as the prophet says like you know the president of of the United States is Big here probably big in other countries but it's nothing in Rome the president of Russia is Big out there but in Rome is nothing this is the men this is the church that sits upon the waters so many people so many nations how does he do it by taking the unbelievers taking the political system putting them together and there it is he can now govern the world time is up but I wanted to to get into um the political systems with this political systems is going to lay down all these ways of leading the world so so that at the end of it he can bring everyone else under the same religion so that you cannot buy you cannot sell without having what the mark look at where you started very he didn't see he didn't look like something very uh to strike the eye but it was very simple just very subtle to look at it to say well you know the devil is not really there's nothing to this I'm proud and I'm Congolese I'm Mexican I'm Nigerian and all of these things but then it started leading now to go quickly before before I close that this political system they started we have most of the most known ones the fascism socialism capitalism all these systems with tools put in the end of the devil in order to achieve a purpose because with the political system now we have political parties which one are you democrat Republican you see that so this Devil by using that as a trap to govern the world to govern the country and look to people like this is really not something but it was one of his ways remember Constantine a man a politician came and joined the church from this church now they become powerful from becoming powerful now they can now lead the entire world but then remember in the time of Ahab we had what Jezebel behind the back the church but who had this uh this Ahab behold before the people the politician the unconverted man sitting there signing the papers but the one dictating the agenda is the woman behind and by her by him being in the front line we only see like he's Mr the president no he's not the president the president is the one behind it because you may see her that's my wife no she is the boss you say that by her being behind she's leading the way she's controlling she's the woman she stands there she's firm she has the eye in temperament she is the dominating female she is the one bruising everything in his way she's the one when she takes power you can feel that hey nobody can move here why because that these were unconverted people you give somebody without the Holy Spirit you give them power you give them money that's the end of it all is going to walk upon everybody there's no respect to nobody but then with the Holy Spirit despite of all that we can have we are still servants we are still using all that Authority in humility that's where we see brother Branham could show us he said like you know you see sit very quiet the holy spirit is very timid but these ones here they go in the land we go you're going to do what we tell you if you don't if don't allow the homosexuals in your countries we're not going to give you money anymore why because that's the agenda from the very beginning that's the agenda we see that in the countries in the continents in every single stage in every single country in the world but God grace we're going to get into those political things I had so much but but time goes by as he leads but but God's grace we're going to get to it because the Lord has to come down has to see what they are doing what they are building what are they building how did they come to build it they go and they put they play with policies and principle and interest compound the interest by the time you you realize you don't understand the formula they calculated the interest all the money that you're paying on the mortgage it only goes to the bank before when you fall you fall to one payment or two they kick you out all the value all the money that you paid to the house is gone now you're homeless man why but flatteries they acquired the land and when they acquire the land is not to have you Remain the question but to get you to work more so you can pay more you pay all your bills and by paying all the bills there you are one step at a time there you are you are far away from God but I believe but God's grace with uh this little thought that I was about to be where I was able to bring out that you're able to see the importance on how what the devil is doing and how is it doing it bringing the people a little bit one step away from the presence of God by telling them like you know no we have the money we have all the resources of the world and by having all the resources of the world that's the to your third seal this hotel goes there they manipulate the economies today you wake up like you know oh it's good and now it's inflation how come it's this inflation some people are getting rich and richer because of that system that political system but then also at the same time God knows that he has to provide guidance to his own that despite of all that you have to fight because when you fight when you know how to fight we'll get to where they at the appointed time that when you have you're able to fight then you have the Victory and the Victory there's a reward and that reward is not just you come to church and you say to say well we'll hear about it we're not a good sermon and then we move on and on and on and on no but when you listen to the word Lord open these things in my life because that's the most important part of it because we can talk like you know Russia United States Africa Asia all these people out there but then when you miss it in your own life that's why the devil will catch you from because when you're able to see that Revelation in your life Lord open my understanding to see these things in my own life because when I see it in my own life then I'm able to overcome probably like the things that I love to I love to see the things that I like I like to to listen to will always push me to one more of those things one more of those things and those things will stray me from your presence but then with the Revelation with by praying then we are able now to go back to those places and say like Lord you need to address this element because those of time of old they overcome Not By Their Own Strength but by the your spirit amen shall we pray Heavenly Father once again so grateful Lord to I've been in thy presence and time went by so fast without realizing that by your grace you bring out your god what is necessary as Lord you had shown it Lord beforehand how he's going to be and the time that is going to take father may you lead us Lord Jesus Christ by bringing out the Revelation because without Revelation father we are unable or father God to do anything Lord because what you said through thy Prophet Lord that God give us life prevailing Revelation because Lord this is a good courage and a good strength for us to walk along
