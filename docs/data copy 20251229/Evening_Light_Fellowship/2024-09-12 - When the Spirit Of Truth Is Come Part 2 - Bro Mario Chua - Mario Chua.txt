amen [Music] hallelujah God bless you Saints good evening and thank you musician thank you for our song special it was really a blessing for tonight am and I would like to invite you to the Book of John chapter 16 verse 12 to13 the same uh scripture C that I uh brought last uh service that I have I usually don't uh do a part series because I don't have the gift of that kind of gift as I am just a delivery boy that whatever God put in my heart I just deliver it amen and I believe uh God will give me some nuggets no and the next Minister will catch up and if they have the gift to make a series that's it amen I am just a helper to make the whe keep on running so H thank you tonight I will try to make a part two so John 16 uh verse 12 I have yet many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now praise God because we know that God knows the season of your life to reveal his truth Amen in Proverbs 15:23 he said a word is a season how good it is and verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth truth he will guide you into a clear understanding of the revealed word of your day for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come and we can say that we are now living in a prophetic time prophetic Ministry so I'd like to read the last verse Revelation 107 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets than you and may the Lord add a blessing upon the reading of his word so my you may now be see it so my title is when the spirit of Truth is come part two and sometimes we will ask just like pilate what is truth we want to know truth amen what is truth even brother Ron preed that a while a few years back maybe ass seers of what is truth and we know that truth is the absolute of God's word made clear to you in the spirit of your mind by the holy spirit thank you Lord and the word of God becomes a faith in you then that is truth because he said Thy word is truth the word becomes spirit and life in you and we know that the characteristic of Truth is that it will always set you free amen that's right John 8:32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free so we know the truth because the characteristic is that it can liberate us from sin unbelief or doubt praise God into the word of God and we know that we are now living in the prophetic ministry as we said a while ago that the ministry of the Propet is to gather all the loose end and every mystery in the Bible is already being opened and we know that being a prophet sometimes it's hard to to Gras because some of people believe that a prophet knows everything but let us face reality in the fact just like the expression when you are in the vacation and you have a wonderful time uh enjoying the creation of God and the fellowship then after your vacation you have this statement let us go back to reality the reality is after your vacation you have a bill to pay your mortgage your electric your car let us go back to the reality so the prophet in reality he was born a prophet and we know that Prophet is a gift from God and gifts and callings are without repentance the reality is he was born a prophet and he grow become a boy even he at a young age a boy he has the operation of the gift of a prophet was already in operation in his life he can see Vision he can hear voices and some sometimes he cannot understood or understand what it was and we know that he was growing so that's why we believed in the progressive revelation of God because Revelation come from God Amen that come from the prophet it come from God but he need to grow and experience his life that all that experience God is showing him some scriptural truth that become a reality in his life so that's why the prophet is the interpretation of the word of God in our day he didn't just become a prophet just for the prophet but he was expressing God manifesting the word that is being made flesh in our day Hallelujah so that's why we believe that one of the greatest misunderstood subject about the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation and the person of Christ praise God being made manifest in our day but I want to look at it in a different angle and we know that the Old Testament begins with a woman conceiving and the New Testament also begin with a woman conceiving amen but we notice that there is a difference in the way they they conceive amen so there is a mystery that lays in here for this last age that was to be fully revealed by the prophet and there must also be a people on Earth at the end time who are able to come into the full understanding of these things so there are two conception and we want to look into Mary's belief as opposed to Elizabeth and look at how manifestation of that came out in their way of conception or how the conception took place in the lives because we know that both Eve and Elizabeth conception or Elizabeth conception came by sensation but Mary is just by believing the word so there is a difference and both of them are type of the Pentecostal and the bright AIDS one is by sensation and one is by believing the word of God so my subject for tonight is conception by the spoken word so turn with me the Book of Luke 1 verse 26-38 so this is where I will get my subject conception by the spoken word Luke chapter 1 verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth so the angel will not come unless he was sent from God Amen so we have an angel in this last day that sent from God that's right in Malachi I will send you Elijah the prophet that was the angel to the church it was sent praise God directly this Angel was sent directly unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth exact geographical location amen that's good called Nazareth as the prophet said there is no good things come out of Nazareth that's right to a virgin espouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary so we will notice this Angel come from Eternal realm and down to a geographical location yeah praise the Lord amen God knows where to send his Angel that's right he sent an angel in Africa he sent his angel in Mexico he sent an angel in the Philippines he sent an angel here in Phoenix hallelujah thank you Lord that's good a specific time of history and a specific woman amen in other words there was no guess work involved and neither is there any guess work involved by God calling us thank you Jesus there is no guessing work that you receive the message of the hour because God is sending his Angel exactly where you are at thank you Lord God Don't Make Mistakes that's right what God calls is not a mistake but you are the manifestation that God sent an angel in this last day and he said that this is now the Gathering of the elect where are we are gathering not in the Church of brother Ron we are gathering through the revealed word of the hour God is calling his bride from all kind tongue and people hallelujah so that we can join to our bride Grom the Lord Jesus Christ thank you Lord that's the truth no guessing work that's enough for us to go home and rejoice can I go home now hallelujah amen you need to to to to get it personalize in your heart because Mary is a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right and the angel came into her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw she was troubled at is saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be there's always a question mark why did I receive the message how come I receive the message how there's always a question but when there's a Biblical question there's always a Biblical answer amen if you have a question there is always an answer that's right and the angel said unto fear not Mary for th was found favor with God Jesus the visitation of Angel gave favor to Mary so the Angel's visitation in our generation is a favor from God to us Hallelujah it is not a mistake that an angel had been coming down in our generation the mighty angel of Revelation 101 the angel of the Covenant which is the Lord Jesus Christ and this is the favor of God and remember that a prophet in this generation always represent God to the people amen when there is a prophet in the land god is in the land remember when John the Baptist he is propagating he is preparing the way for the Lord and when the Lord was come Behold the Lamb of God takes away the sins of the world he will not say Behold the Lamb of God if there is nobody in there that's right so likewise the prophet in this generation forun the second coming of Christ that means that God is in our midst the visitations of God in this land that's why the prophet said I must decrease and he must increase that's why when the prophet is out of the se he is still here in the form of the fer of fire praise God and revealing himself to the word of God he never leave us because the prophet for today is the Holy Ghost himself the prophetic Ministry of God hallelujah and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus so look at the message of the Angel it is connected praise God about a conception in the womb and behold th shall conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son shall call his name Jesus the message is already being done Glory there's no other message that's right the message is already been given and thou shall call his name Jesus thank you Lord that is why the seventh angel message is also connected with the teaching about conception in the womb of a woman in this day this is about conception amen and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest the Lord God shall give unto to him the Throne of his father David this prophesied this is prophecy from Isaiah 714 730 or 40 years before it came to manifestation to a very specific place to a very specific woman and the angel know his name and called him Mary amen Jes there is no accident you need to be grateful in this last day the same message is just a shadow on type in our generation it's about the conception of the word of God in these last days amen and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end oh Hallelujah and then Mary said unto the angel how shall this thing be saying I know not a man yeah good question notice her first and only question first and only question because for a thousand years every woman had conceived only by one way that's right that's right the human race knew of no other method of conception right but now Mary was being asked to believe in a conception by a way that had never happened to a woman [Applause] before it's hard to believe and even Joseph cannot believe it and he was trying to to put her away privately and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee praise God amen amen yes sir The Impossible thing that you cannot understand God will send the Holy Ghost that's why when the spirit of to this come he will guide you into alen and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee before therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God glory amen he didn't called that the born of will be a God God knows exactly how to put his word Son of God Amen and Son of God had beginning and had ending there is no such thing as Eternal God as what the denominations trying to to to make us understand because being a son is all for the purpose of redemption amen and behold they cast and Angel and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron praise before the angel appeared to Mary he already appeared to Elizabeth 6 months prior and Elizabeth was Barren but praise God as the scripture said for with God nothing shall be impossible amen hallelujah and Mary said behold the hand made of the Lord let OB be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her amen so there are two we women mentioned Elizabeth and Mary two women mentioned here together Mary and Elizabeth and Elizabeth conception like Eve came by the sensations of the flesh between a man and a woman but the contrast we see that here is that Mary conception came without sensation and we know that Elizabeth represent the Pentecostal denomination idea they are conceiving the GI through Sensations and emotion whereas Mary conceived by believing the word of the angel that was sent in her day just like brother Bram the Forerunner of Christ oh we know that Elizabeth represent the Lan AGS we are fully convinced with that because in the last days there are only similarity and and even Elizabeth and Mary are cousin right right and we know that Elizabeth represent Lan Pentecostal Forerunner of the first coming of Christ came out of Elizabeth womb just as brother Branham the Forerunner of Christ Second Coming came out of Pentecostal age womb of the seventh age and that is why Elizabeth being the older woman conceived first and Mary is the younger woman conceived lust because the briad Aid comes after the Pentecostal age yes amen praise God so the message God's only provided place of worship brother bam said remember how we just went through the church ages the messenger of the church always come just at the dying of the other Church age always dying of the Pentecost bring forth the rupturing of the Bride wow the dying of the Luther brought forth Wesley and the dying of Wesley brought forth the Pentecost and the dying of Pentecost brings forth the message now so that's why the prophet said you got to die to the Lutheran age to be born into the westle age you have to die in the wesle age to be born in the pescal age and you have to die in the Pentecostal age live nothing of it leave nothing of it left burn it with fire because it's going to be burn like The Stoke that the wheat comes out of the stock the denomination it's got to be burned so don't bring your denominational denomination over into this new message this is the word now this is no longer man's ideas being into the message so that's why excuse me that's why the prophet said you need to die to your denominational idea don't bring your denominational idea into this bright age and I have this experience when I met my uh uh uh a close friend a Pentecostal Minister and we know that we have the idea that the prophet said that the Pentecostal are really allergic to the word predestination so I'm going to tease him so brother do you believe in predestination but I know that they are allergic to predestination but I try to to to provoke him what they understanding about predestination right because there is a lot of issues because baptism with the Holy Ghost without sensation and this pred predestination comes together so I asked him brother praise God do you believe in predestination and when he say yes I was surprised I thought he will react something like that oh you really you believe in predestin yes we believe in predestin how do you give me how do you explain predestination well if you are predestinated if you keep going to church if you keep serving the lord then it shows that you are predestinated but if you stop then you are not predestinated and he gave me an example just like an example you are riding in the train to a certain destination and you fall into the from the train how can you be predestinated if you fall so that is their understanding about predestination it seems that you need to put an effort in order to show that you are predestinated and that idea is tripping in into the message of the hour it seems that you need to work out to make an evidence that you are predestinated you need to work out you need to go to church every day to show if it's show no you don't need to work out to show you that you are predestinated that's right because a lot of people go to church with different reason right that's why we can see people coming in the church for how many years then go they they G then another come in they have different reason so that's why there are three classes of people in the church those who make things happen and those who make who watch things happen and those who are wondering what happened amen the believer the make believer the unbeliever you say they unbeliever no believer as the prophet said but there is an an but they believe when you say something they believe but they cannot believe or have faith in what you say so you don't need to to to to to make an effort to prove that you are predestinated because predestination is come from God Amen and I told him our understanding of predestination is amen if I I'm in the train and I fall from the train God will stop the train and put me back in the train until I reach my destination that is our understanding of predestination because predestination PR God we are predestinate before the foundation of the word we don't need to prove anything that we are predestinated God will prove his predestination in our lives thank you Jesus praise the Lord you don't need to prove anything okay but that understanding of the Pentecost is creeping into the church you need to do something you need to do something if you are predestinated you are to do something come on you need to be faithful in the church you need to do this you need to have long hair that that and then you are predestinated but predestination is so different you are predestinated as the prophet said by the for knowledge of God he knows the beginning and the end that's rights and being predestinate doesn't mean that we cannot do anything about oursel we just follow no predestination give us a premoral agency you have the right to accept and you have the right to reject it but because of predestination even though you backslide even though you're fall God's purpose is to express his attributes that's why he allowed that you fall in order for his his attributes as a redeemer be expressed in your life you don't need to prove I don't backl that no even if you back slide as the prophet said as Paul said all things works together for good to them love the Lord he allows sickness he allow everything in order for his attributes to express thank you Lord your failure has nothing to do with what he has predestinate because predestination didn't start yesterday that's right that's right when you read your scripture you are predestinated even before the foundation of Lord as if it only just yesterday that you are predestinated amen yeah amen very oh praise the Lord as the prophet said her daughter come to Daddy Daddy it seems that the scripture is contrary to what the S had said because the scripture said that the world was created in seven days and the prophet said there is no contradiction because in the beginning when God created the Heaven the Earth period he said maybe it takes Millions and millions and millions of years amen that's right then verse two amen it takes millions and millions of Earth there is another civilization within verse two and then verse three said let there be light and that light didn't come instantly and the Propet said that light maybe is wooing maybe millions and millions and millions of years then Paul said you are chosen and predestinated before the foundation of the word if the word was created for millions and millions of years how about you are prediced before the foundation of the world praise God thank you so our thought has nothing to do with our lives God knows exactly where we begin and God exactly where we end because what he started he is going to finish it this has nothing to do with us Hallelujah god require us to believe believe in the works that he has already done you have nothing to do with it just like Mary he has nothing to do with it but to believe be at to me according to your word we have the message in this last days my brothers you don't put any ideas into the message of the hour that's why when the prophet said in a message being led by the Holy Spirit he said you can teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things that's right so you notice that the angel called Supernatural things the deeper teaching of the word that's right some Pentecostal babies in the message I remember that babies try to copy what they see that's good amen they try to impersonate and knock out what they see others doing right if this church is going shouting shouting other babies impersonating they are trying to copy one another but we are not copying any other but we are praise God leaving the word that was being we in our day they are impressed with Stage performances running in the ppit shouting Dan and then and you say you feel the spirit of God come on and so the Holy Spirit was identifying the maturity level of the Church of laia but we are not in a baby age anymore thank you Lord because we have crossed over over through the door an Open Door in heaven we are living in a time when the bride is to come to a full Perfection yes of maturity yes in order to bring resurrection and the Rapture you need to be matured in the word that's right so this is what the prophet said I know we we there are so many quotes with regards to British Nation but this is a quotation that God puts in my heart you know before there was a word you were in God's thought that's right remember that the word was created millions and millions of millions of Earth so how about when you are in the thought of God millions and we don't know nothing about it that's right but now it is being revealed unto us and we need to run and rejoice we ought to be the most happiest people around the earth because everything that comes in our way God already knows about he just want us to believe I will continue God told to give you the Holy Ghost because he knew that you're wanting it amen and he chose you himself because you desire he chose you in Christ before you or Jesus or any of you was on Earth amen that's the truth this is not an ordinary stuff this is this come from the mind of God it's just conveying the thought of God through the mouth of the Prophet that's because the prophet is representing the word always come to the prophet so he's sharing the word thank you Lord to establish Us in his word amen Christ before you Jesus any of you on Earth and He sent Jesus to die to prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost to bring you to himself this is a church so I'm at home now so he speaking about deeper things oh that is so rich to me to think is not what I wanted it wasn't my desire it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing I had not one thing to do with it that's right but before the word ever started God saw us and put our name in the Lamb's Book of that before there even was a word talk about God hallelujah it isn't our desire to be a Christian is our desire praise God it was God's desire thank you Jesus thank you Lord we ought to be thankful I stood outand with the big L so I will jump to to the Highlight before there was a word before there was a planet before there was a sun before there was a moon before there was a light before there was anything we was still God God and His thought the Eternal thoughts of God Choose You by predestination prise God by for knowledge to know that you would be on earth to know there would be Hallelujah sin that's right he knows about you God knows about us more than we know about ourselves that's right that's why God said a prophet is like to make us known the mystery of his will in our life all our struggle or ups and downs and all trials praise God God knows about it thank you Lord and sometimes he allow it to some to fall to sin in order to express his attribute that how gracious our God is amen that's right and someone said then why why why there is sin it never been sin his attribute would never had been a savior there had to be a sinner so he could be a savior that's what what we're saying God allow everything in order to express his attribute there had to be a sick man so he could be a Healer that is one OB attribut that's why my brother and sister when brother Brenham preach about the law having a shadow he said that why I believe the time will soon arrive that when healing will be a miracle healing will be such a common thing amen we've got to get some rupturing faith in the church to get away from here from one of these days we need rupturing Faith that's right am and even healing we cannot major oh I am Vindicated because in our church God show Supernatural thing signs will follow if you believe am healing will follow if you believe because it's already done and God provide healing not only our Physical Realm in our spirit realm and in our soul amen there will come a time soon and that soon is now amen we can see a lot of people being sick and they healed God do miraculous thing but that is the aest of the Rapture the aest that the soon coming the changing of our body is coming soon we are not looking that we need to be perfect and holy and walk holy praise God we just need to believe the word hallelujah that he has already done it is already done didn't require us to believe on the things that he is just like our Father Abraham amen he is a nobody he is a a idol worshipper but out of nowhere but for knowledge of God God appeared unto him and gave a covenant I will will make you a father of many nation which is very impossible because he is already old thank you Lord and you can argue why don't you give me a child when I was still young that's why you cannot question the God's grace he require us to believe what he has done that's that's why the scripture said and it was imputed unto him for his righteousness he's believing the word it doesn't mean when you believe the word you are only already immune to all the trials remember when he received the message of the promise of this day trials begin to set in amen when the prophet said separate yourself from your Kindred and people and all the family the first thing that happened that went with him he done really thought it very well and he suffered the consequen that's right but did it take away the promised Covenant of God to him no God is only expressing his graciousness because Abraham believed the promise God is keeping his word and Abraham they live in Jerusalem Betto which is the house of God then ping strike and the first thing he do he went from Jerusalem go to Egypt and he was afraid to die and he told his wife tell him if they ask tell him that you are my sister imagine what a traumatic experience it did for Sarah that is just what we read tell tell the king that you are my sister and Sarah also tell the king so that's why the the king wants to marry the sister do you think Sarah is not murmuring inside oh Abraham if I have a time I will C why did you do this Abraham you are the responsible husband you are the head of the family why did you do this but God keep his promise because Abraham believed amen and God appear to the the king return my Prophet or I will kill you y amen and the King said you know the Integrity of My Heart Lord just return it why God is keeping his promise he was not keeping Abraham physical but he was keeping Abraham because Abraham believed the promise amen it has nothing to do with our acation because he has so many failures in his life that's right true maybe when Sarah was returned to Abraham Sarah will say Okay cook by yourself cook your own food wash your own this uh do the laundry she has a traumatic experience for maybe for years amen that she will not forget that's why when the time come he said maybe I am not included in the promise take Hagar and Abraham because he did no good to Sarah he just okay Sarah to cover up his shortcoming I'll take hugger but we need to com he compromised he compromised but did God take away his Covenant with Abraham no right God keep his Covenant with Abraham why the more sometimes Abraham is to is to is run out of faith and God appear to him I am else sh I amen I will give you strength to move on thank you Lord if you fail and you fall sometimes we are discouraged sometimes we don't want to go to church but it was God will appear and encourage you because that is what his attribute he is keeping his promise to and every one of us that is predestination our work has nothing to do with it our shortcoming has nothing to do with it God is in it all amen even Jonah and we know the story of Jonah he was commissioned to go to n he went to sers but God before it happened God already prepared a whale so that's why in the beginning of Genesis God created a whale and took for how many years for it to to happen and to manifest because Jonah God knows that he is going different direction amen so before it happened he already prepared a well oh praise the Lord right how gracious God is yes he is amen we don't need to prove anything in this physical place that we are predestinated the only thing you know that you are predestinated you can say Amen to the word that was said in your day no doubts no interpretation just say Amen even even if you cannot understand it you just say amen amen because God is the one that will yes work his way through your life until you recognize that it was not you not your effort to go to church it was God that lead from you are still a little baby until now it was God all the way in your failure in your discouragement God is in it all the way through because he will never change his mind about you because you are predestinated before the foundation of the world and predestination is our foundation in this like if we see the program of God in our life we can just say amen and rejoice forever more Hallelujah because being in the rupture is not the work of our flesh being in the rupture is believing the word that he has already done in our life he's just conveying his thought to the predestinated Sons and Daughters of God thank you Lord and sometimes we have this terminology Sons and Daughters then we have bride and wife they are the same person it had to be that way it was God who saw it and for orain it remember this I don't know if remember the devil ain't even in the race we are always blaming the devil when we have something in our lives oh the devil do this the devil do that but is the word from the prophet he said the devil ain't even in the race oh he's just a tough on the side of the road that God used to bring children to him thank you Lord that's why if you run away from God God will use the Devil he's just an instrument for you to cry father God forgive me I'm going back into your presence no wonder own that day how the Angels Sing when we're singing the Redemption Stories the angels will bow their head and don't know what we're talking about that's right that's right Hallelujah that's why I can always say when they preaching of the word and you don't respond you you are just like Angels because they don't know about the Redemption story amen they don't respond they don't see they just look at you and they B you that's what the prophet said they are angels amen look like angels we don't want of course sometimes we we become we we get emotional that's right but the prophet said any religion without an emotion is dead that's right but our stimulation come by the wine of the revelation of the word of God we are stimulated by the revealed word of the hour not by emotion or Somebody's Crying and you cry too no that's right our stimulation come by the revealed word of the hour that is that's why we can respond amen we can respond an nameen to the word of God and you can feel you are now sitting in Heavenly places thank you Lord hallelujah when you're responding the word you forgot about your problem tonight because you are sitting in Heavenly places [Applause] but after the service we will go back to reality and we Face another challenge but you hear the word everything is in order don't know what we're talking about sure they never was lost and they don't know what it is they don't know how good we feel to know that we which were once Sinners unlimited from God we without hope without Mercy with God in the world corruption dying going to a devil's hell and God stood down and pick us up and redeem us and now we are above the Angels right now hallelujah thank you Angel were the first created first

servant we are Sons and Daughters can we say Amen you are Sons and Daughters amen amen some are ashamed to say Amen that that's why we need a tutor we are predestinated unto adoption but we were adopted because we need some tutor that's right and the father said how about this son oh that son he is so stubborn but I'm working on it thank this one is full of worry but I am working on it this

US amen God is still working on your case thank Lord so don't worry don't be discouraged God is still working every details of your life he's working on it that's why he sent the teor that's right to

brother and sister that church I don't believe the side of Eternity how will never realize that what you are the position that you are that God has placed you you Spirit fill people you're a sons of God why Angels a servant you're a son an angel can bring you a message but you can H but you have to act amen that's it amen the message is sent from this Pulpit tonight amen thank you Jesus from an angel angel in the Pulpit that's why I told Brother stepen I I don't claim any Ministry in my life I am just a helper in the church to keep the whe rolling but the angel is Christ that's right he will be the one that will V at his word an angel can only bring you a message but you have to act amen you're the actor on the scene I brought you this message for you to do so and so this is from the father I bring it to you yes that's all it is your sons and daughters of God predestinated us according as he had chosen us now we didn't choose how could I choose him 400 billions millions and trillion years ago how could I have chose him oh Hallelujah but he chose me amen oh brother that's it chosen Us in him before the foundation of the word that we should be holy he put an apostrophe in it now don't try to make it yourself cuz you can but the Pentecostal concept of predestination is you need to have an evidence that you are predestinated but predestination is from God and God Alone amen you don't need to act you need to believe the word believe the word eat the word the more you eat the word the more you become the word that's that that's the only thing that we can do in this life eat the word hallelujah eat the word not denominational word amen but the mystery which is being revealed in our day don't try to make it yourself cuz you can't because Without Blame before him in love it was God's love for us that he chose us oh thank you Jesus hallelujah what the Blessed people we are amen we are nobody we are nothing but God send his angel in exactly geographical location where you are at in order for you to receive the message of the hallelujah thank you Lord praise the Lord amen I remember brother Murphy W from Clover there when I metet him in in the Philippines and I said how did you come to to to the message of the hour so they told me that we we we we are in China and we gathering together we have a just a Bible uh Bible study we are just hiding and hiding there was an American an American who was giving the spoken word and he heard that the police are coming and they are trying to cuss those American people so because of his Mercy he went to the American and said can you give me the book because or or just go away because the police are coming to cut you and they will not go just keep on treating so by by that time he said I will just keep that book and you can go away and he keep the book for half days then finally he read the book and that's the beginning where God called him Lord and He preached the gospel to all over China and when he went to the Philippines he brought four young ministers one in the prison ministry he was persecuted in the prison uh all the hard persecution that she receiv but on top of that it was time for him to share the gospel amen and the gospel reach to a different city in China amen is that not predestination it is not man's doing man has nothing to do with it it was God's program all the way from the beginning to the end we just need to Humble ourselves Lord if you call me whatever things you want me to do let me humble myself amen and do it I have many failures I have so many things but Lord I humbl myself just help me Lord that's the only thing we can do humble ourselves in the presence of the Lord so let us go back to our subject conceiving by the spoken word in Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel that was a prophecy and 730 years ago that prophecy is grooming around the earth is looking for the bed Mary was not born yet that's right maybe he's uh her grandfather or grandma or whatever but that word keep on rolling looking for the place for that to fulfill and he's looking for a perfect virgin that's right yes so we know that this was Mary but we also know that this scripture is a compound scripture that is also speaking of an end time virgin bride amen because God sent elizer Isaac sent elizar to find a virgin Bride for his son and eliser is on the scene to find a virgin Bride for his son in this last day so virgins shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel means god with us or with us is God praise God so by this kind of conception the Virgin Mary conceived and brought forth God in human flesh as if should have done in the beginning no other conception could have done all could have done that and she brought forth God in flesh in male form that was the first coming of Christ and we are taught by the message of the hour that this end time bride would also be a virgin that will conceive and bring forth Christ in human flesh again amen but this time it would be Christ revealed in the flesh of many membered body Hallelujah in female form at his second coming he's coming in the form of the Bride coming of Christ in a many membered bride but got with us again in briad form not just I will be with you but I will be in you in John 14:12 it say at that day you will know that it is I in you and you in me at that day you will know that's right amen that's why in Parable Matthew 13 it was given for you to know the mystery of the Kingdom but to them it was not given that's right at that day you will know if you are a son and a daughter of God you will know oh hallelujah amen because this is not a church membership this is a body many membered body and the message choosing a bride he said the other is pregnated by the word of God now will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and woman is one and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of the body and the two together make the one body again like Adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one we are one with Christ so remember that Elizabeth the old woman who represent the Pentecostal age of this church age conceive a sensation but the young virgin woman of this age who represent Mary must conceive differently that's right the end time bride in his Bri must conceive by the revelation of the word delivered by an Angel message just like Mary did amen and Mary didn't say Let It Be according to my sensation Let It Be according to the feelings that I I feel amen amen but she said be it unto me according to Thy word because the spoken word is the original seed that is why the Original Seed of the word has been given to us again in this age by an angel's message and you need a seed in order to conceive and that seed is the spoken revealed word in the hour that we are living in Praise the Lord one of the mystery of this last days was the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the conception of the coming of the word of the revelation of Christ the word that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are L that's right Christ is Mystery of God revealed he said what is the new birth then this is a common quotations in many churches well Breen what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you yes sir that is why the evidence of new bird is not based on speaking in tongues or tingling feeling of your spine or emotional experience even though at times need feelings and experience to help us along the way God uses those things so there is nothing against feelings and emotions in fact religion without some form of emotion is death but life in this hour doesn't come by feelings it comes by the revealing of the word and the over showing of the Holy Ghost amen the Bible didn't say upon this feeling I will build my church that's right about this tingling or sensation I will build my church but the word said Upon This Rock of the revelation of the word of God I will build my church Hallelujah because remember that they were sensation Pentecostal sensation loving people they love gifts and God allowed them to consume even a method just like Elizabeth and the first even it did bring forth a form of life but this last days of the bride was to be like Mary conceived differently not by gifts not by The Giver of the gift but the giver himself not just the gift but the giver of the gift just like when eliser come to Rebecca he give her a a lot of gifts from the father and they enjoy the gifts just like the Pentecostal but the time has come that he was asked the father are you willing to go to meet the Unseen bridegroom right honey he left all those gift the Pentecostal and he went with eliser to meet the Unseen bridegroom she was not satisfied about the gift he Wass The Giver of the gift that's why in this last day we are more on The Giver of the gift than the gift and The Giver is the word himself being made fles in our day that's right praise God hallelujah that's right notice the life that was in the hus in the ster in the tussel oh I I will just cut it and brother Bram said in the Masterpiece justification made a way for sanctification and sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost Made A Way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself Hallelujah so we are now the Perfection of the word has come in this generation that is for the Bride of Jesus Christ trying to do a God's service without the will of God I'm going to try to finish this and just a few more quotation for but I'm not not him so this is Brother Burnham about talking about John the Baptist introducing so I will jump in in the in the next paragraph and today he is standing Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost amen manifesting himself more and more coming into his church making himself known he is standing Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost he is not standing in his Corporal body he is standing before us in the form of the Holy Ghost by the revealed word of the message of the hour you are hearing from Christ the word that was being revealed in our day that's why he's speaking when when the message is is being spoken tonight there is something in your heart that say amen for exciting something amen because it was God the Holy Ghost himself revealing himself more and more and more to the church that's why our understanding of the message growing more clearer and clearer and clearer every day praise the Lord manifesting himself more and more coming into his church making himself known because him and the bride and the groom will be the same oh Hallelujah making his known and one one day you will see that the one that you feel in your heart and see his identification will become personalized before you then you and he are [Applause] one the one that you feel in your heart sometimes you cannot understand what is pulsating in your heart when you go sometimes you you have not come into the full realization yet of who you are but there was something in your heart deep down when you are working there is something that you feel that God is calling me just like the testimony of brother Neil he is in a box leading conv nowhere to to stay but there was something pulsating in his heart maybe longing for God hallelujah he don't know about the message he don't know about God but when he pray sir God answer it he don't know what it was even even sister Sandy she is a Catholic but God has spoken to her something like something she feel in her heart and when she pray God answer her prayer God is no respector of any person that's right whatever situation you are in in this world if you are the SE of God there is a liful Satan there is a lightful Satan in your heart that you cannot understand but you feel what it is but the time has come Hallelujah that what you feel will become personalized to you and you realize who you are praise the Lord identification will become personalized before you then you and he are one that's right amen you are one with with the word because you believe his word amen you've United by the word and the Word was in the beginning will go back to the beginning which is God that's why when you are still a little babies there's something pulsating and only the bride will respond to the word because there is a deep when the Deep call you to the de there may be something to respond to the Deep that's right and if you are not a SE of God you will just reject the message just like the woman of the wells she has so many husband but when the Messiah come and show him the sign she immediately believe Thou Art the Messiah amen but those religious group when they saw the Messiah they said you are bable that's right right right but for the Bride of Jesus Christ you just say amen amen Praise You Jesus even if you are ashamed to say Amen your heart I know will say amen amen because remember this Angel was sent to your geographical location maybe your culture is So Silent Hallelujah and you still bring it into the message of the hour like was time I'm silent some are just smiling some different culture but all in all we gather together in the revealed word of God Amen thank you you're United by the word and the Word was in the beginning will go back to the beginning which is God and that day you will know I am in the Father the father in me I in you Hallelujah even the prophet was so excited Hallelujah we'll go back to the beginning and he's shouting hallelujah amen if you listen to the tape you will enjoy the anointing that comes while he was sharing this word because it was not his message it was the message inspired in your heart and he when he delivered it he himself rejoice in the message that God will s thank you Lord and that day you will know that I am the father and the father and me you you I am you and you hallelujah we're here we have arrived we're here amen don't look for him for the other generation he is here in the form of the Holy Ghost revealing himself more and more that's why we don't go to church just to to to to to be seen we come to church to feed on the word of God we see he himself revealing himself and the more he reveal himself the more we just humble ourselves amen that's it if we will do it ourselves and we are the evidence that I am predestinated you will be boastful amen because you do it your way right but when we know that we cannot make it without the grace of God all glory go back to him I'm so glad to see him I'm so glad to see him personifying himself right among us we see what he promised for the word not what somebody emotion singing and jumping and dancing but by his word amen he is making himself known Hallelujah not by an emotion praise God but by revealing it through the word of God so our conception as the Virgin bride of Christ for this end time hour must come by the revelation of the truth of the word that has been spoken to us by the angel that has appeared in our day that's right it cannot come based on deception and unbelief some hybrid word teaching of previous age that was the eve and Elizabeth represent but we are in the bright age as the prophet said here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary how was the word of this hour in Mary how did she get the word in her then how did she conceive by that method good question H how did she get the word in her and then how did she conceive by that method remember that Mary actually became physically pregnant just by receiving the Angel's message amen amen it didn't happen for almost 40 or 4,000 years and that method of getting pregnant had never been seen before 4,000 years of human existence that's right unbelievable how could a virgin conceive by just the spoken word of an angel's message think about that even Joseph could handle that idea and he was going to put Mary away privil so it was very hard for anyone to accept back then and that is why also very hard for people to accept the same thing today we need to have some sensation to prove our new birth but this exact same thing is promised to repeat again in this last day because the new birth of this bright a is promised to come by visitation and Revelation from an angel and is so different of how women the church would usually conceive amen and then this new age Revelation brother told us that we can have the previous Pentecostal experience of the Holy Ghost baptism every our life and and still be lost and he said notice we find that people there's many just can't believe it even Spirit-filled people I'm going to give you one that will choke you that will maybe some to stumble you because if you are not ordained to believe you will turn back about faith and go you cannot receive it that will choke you the baptism of the host do mean that you're going in not all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul remember in that Spirit you can be baptized with the genuine spirit of God and still be lost it's the soul that Liv that was ordained of God right that's so much different from what denomination yeah understanding remember that this terminology baptism of the Holy ghosts has a very wide application because we use this term to mean both the rain which is the spirit of the genuine Holy Spirit falling on a person's Spirit LM and also sometime we call it that is our new birth right but we have since them thought by the message of the hour that the new birth of this age is different to the Rain baptism of the Pentecostal age because you can have the rain baptism every day of your life and still be lost right but you cannot receive the revelation of the seed word of God in your heart and ever be lost that's right because that word when watered by the holy spirit is what Quicken you to eternal life because my word they are spirit and they are life Hallelujah in the message the future home that's what I that's what we were talking the other day the evidence of the Holy Ghost see the evidence of the Holy Ghost when you can receive the word of God Amen the word when you can receive that's the only evidence not the evidence of you're trying to do to be perfect no we have so many failures but it doesn't mean that you are not son and daughters of God and I said a while ago all our failures are permitted by God that's why when brother R preach about the wrong will always turn right yeah because that is predestination God allow everything so the evidence of the Holy Ghost the evidence of the Holy Ghost when you can receive the word in First Peter 1:23 said being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever so the new birth of this bright hour comes by the seed of the revealing of the word of this hour that what why only the elect can be truly born again because they are the only one with the capacity to receive the word and the prophet said in none seed there is nothing to Quicken Hallelujah only those who are seed can be reborn in N there is nothing to Quicken amen what a special people you are praise the Lord thank you J you are not a guest work that's right an angel of sent from the realm amen of heaven and found wherever you are thank you Lord although we still have our cultural manifestation sometime but doesn't really change what's what in the mind of God before the foundation of in the message me and age in every age and every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer I say in every age the evess was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and the spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and leave it amen amen so we can see that the evidence is receiving the word so we'll go back to the question how did she receive it so in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed say and the only way that we can ever be born again is first in the womb of the Mind am in our mind receive the word then the spirit comes on top of that and brings it and there you are amen that's how you conceive the word of God it must come into the Mind first receive the word and the spirit comes on top of that and brings it there you are that's what it does that's the real Go goel teaching brother I believe if St Paul was standing today he' this the same thing Amen in this hour not Mary's womb the physical mind was virgin womb am why she believe God's word no matter how much anybody criticized how many things somebody else said that didn't have one thing to do with it she believed God's word regardless and only you as a message Believers a bride of Christ can receive the message that was sent in your age we ought to be grateful no matter how many trials Mary was criticized persecuted but she believed not Mar's womb the physical mind was virgin womb why she believed God's word no matter how much anybody cre how many things somebody else said that didn't have one thing to do with it she believed God's word irregardless amen oh I wish I could just get that over are you getting it first was her mind before the act ever taken place in her literal womb that's why Faith cometh by hearing and that hearing by the word of God only and you cannot hear the word unless you are part of the word of God because there is something in you that will respond to that c and that is the evidence that you are part of the word of God thank you Lord and that ever taking place in her little W the ACT had to take place in her first to let the Spirit come in to do the rest of the work first you need to receive the word that was sent in your days that's right and the spirit of God will Quicken that word thank you Lord oh before the actual spiritual birth can take place the word has to find itself through your mind amen yes believeth he that heareth my word and believeth on him that set me ha past tense already eternal life let us stand you just recognize that you are a part of God even before the foundation of the word that's why you can hear the word of God in this last day not any other word not any other voices but the voice of God was said directly to let you know and if you are a seed of God you can respond it with an amen many will criticize you for that oh you become insane when you receive the message you become insane you become a cult no matter what they say you believe what you receive is real and no matter what criticism you hear you still believe and by believing you are now manifest testing the Life of Christ in you praise the Lord oh before the actual spiritual birth can take place the word has to find itself through your mind believe it he that heareth my word and believeth on him ha eternal life and shall never come to judgment but has passed from Death unto life oh my the Virgin womb her mind virgin mind to believe God's word amen amen no man's idea no interpretations of men but the Virgin womb of the Mind in this last day thank you so Mary literally conceived and became pregnant just by receiv receiving and believing the word revealed to her by an angels and so much this endine bride conception come by the same way the word revealed to you by this Angel message that is what we are called in this hour to believe the Angel's message amen that you are Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah God is revealing himself more and more we are not looking for any other sign we're not looking for any Miracles that happened that we can shelter we are waiting for the changing of our body we have the rupturing Faith as the prophet said miracles and healing will be coming common soon that's right but we need rupturing faith for the changing of our body not by the way we struggle to become perfect but by the way we receive the word just like Enoch was he just walk as the light goes as the Revelation go and fold more unfold he just believe it he saw a lot of criticism but he just keep walking as the light unfold the message unfold you just believe it until one day he was found not Hallelujah and he had this pul C up and before his translation he has this testimony that's right that he pleased God we say we can only please God by receiving his word amen because an angel was sent in this last days am and that is the favor from the presence of God thank you Jesus Mary thou has found favor in the sight of God what a blessed people we are so can you I
