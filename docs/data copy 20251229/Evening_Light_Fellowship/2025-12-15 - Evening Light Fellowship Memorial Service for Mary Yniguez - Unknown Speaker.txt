You know what? She's not. She's just waiting on us. [snorts] So, let's bow our heads. Father, would we take this opportunity, Lord, that you've given us a space and time, Lord, to honor a a woman, Father, a [snorts] daughter of God. And we want to [snorts] let you know, Lord, we thank you for her crossing our paths, Lord, that she was a blessing to us. That wherever she went, you know, she blessed those around her. Father, we just ask you now, Lord, just [snorts] put your stamp upon this little memorial. Father, we don't mourn, Father, for her death, Lord, but we rejoice, Lord, because if we could trade places, Lord, she wouldn't want to come back and we know that. And there's nothing that we can think or dream up of what it's like. But Father, we're standing here and we ask you, Lord, to come down [snorts] and bless this little memorial. Father, for your glory, Father, was glorified through her life, [snorts] we just commit this time to you, Father, in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. [snorts] Amen. So, Brother Chris is going to come up and give the eulogy. I bless you. She was special. She was honory, too. Just to say, I'd always go up there and say, "Have you been honory today?" Yeah. [laughter] All right. Sister Anna asked me to read this. Mary survived by her children Rachel, her husband Frank, Ruth, Esther, Robert, her his wife Jodie, Martha, her husband Ruben, Elena, Anna, and John. She had 14 grandchildren. Dedra, Sarah, Sam, Becky, Leah, Jessica, Jamal, Miranda, Mario, Ruben, McKenna, Ian, Jack, and Emma. She had 25 great grandchildren. Andrew, Elijah, Genesis, Armiah, Alex, Jordan, Ma, Damen, Jordan, Brandon, Cheyenne, Brooklyn, Kylie, Michael, Bobby, Ma, Matthew, Evan, Kai, Ka, Taylor, Sydney, Mlin, Weston, Jasmine, Chloe, and Riley. And she had 10 great great grandchildren. She had quite a legacy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Proves she lived a long life. She was Sister Mary. She was she was something. I'm sorry. I you know I known her and brother Rudy I don't know probably 25 years 30 years. I don't know how long. It's been a long time. But they were always faithful, always attended. Uh they were they were a lighthouse to their family, you know, they were always dedicated. They always served the Lord that all the times I knew them and they they were just they were an inspiration. &gt;&gt; Um she's sister Anna's also asked me to do a song. Um usually I do the lighthouse, but I just felt different with sister Mary. Um I'm going do Amazing Grace because it was &gt;&gt; Yes. Amazing grace. You know, [snorts] when you when you come down to the end of life, end of your road, it's only one thing that matters. When we're young, we strive to get a house, to make money, all this kind of stuff. But when you get older, one thing that matters, have you served the Lord? Have you made that decision in your life to accept Jesus Christ as your savior? She did that many years ago. her and brother Rudy and they lived a life before this church, before us people. They lived a life according to God's word. And I'm thankful for that. I see any of this or &gt;&gt; Okay, amazed grace how sweet the sound that saved all edge like me. I once was lost. Oh, but now I'm found. I was blind, but [singing] now I see. was grace that taught oh my heart to fear and grace my fears [singing] relieved. How precious day that grace appeared the hour. I first believe when we've been there 10,000 years bright shining as the son. [singing] Oh, we've known less days to [singing] sing God's praise than when oh we first beun. Sing Amazing Grace with me. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. [singing] Oh, I [singing] once was lost. Oh, but now I'm found. Oh, I was blind, but now I see. Thanks, brother Chris. Well, this was Brother Rome was just too wore out. [sighs and gasps] So he he excused himself and Sister Hannah went back and he she's totally understanding, you know, poured his heart out this morning. Just wore out. So I kind of sprung it on Brother Steve. He was like, you know, hey, and it was just, you know what? Hey, in season, out of season, God gives his gifts something to say. [snorts] And you know, if you could just say just you said, "Well, I didn't know her." He knew her from the for the foundation of the world. Okay. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; My you look at this picture here compared to this picture up here. And uh this is the one I want to look at right here because that's the one I'm going to recognize when we cross over to the other side. But um in the book of Job, the Bible says Job chapter uh 14, it says, "Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble." We can all say amen to that. He cometh forth like a flower and is cut down. He fleth also as a shadow, and contin thou open thine eyes upon such and one, and bringest me into judgment with thee. Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee. Thou hast appointed his uh bonds that he cannot pass his bounds. Turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as an hireling his day. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof waxs old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground, yet through the scent of water, it will bud and bring forth bows like a plant. But man dieth, and wasteth away. Yeah, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayth and dryth up, so man lith down and riseth not, till the heavens be no more. They shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. Oh, that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be passed, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me. If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointment time, appointed time will I wait till my change come. So we can see that Job had a question in his mind and and as Job would look at the natural things, he would look at the tree and the flower and and he would see that if a man cut down a tree um and and and burneth it up and take it away, we see that the tree if it's under kind of condition, it's going to bring forth a life again. It's going to bring forth a branch. is going to bring forth a bow. And and he's looking at these natural types and he's and he's questioning within himself and he's saying, "But what happens to a man that when a man dies and he goes into the grave? What happens to him? Where does he go? What what what is the end of of man after the grave?" And it is a question that has been upon all of our hearts and all of our minds at at at at some point in our lives. And it's very interesting when you begin to read through the book of Job of Job's comforters and this one comes and accuses him of this and accuses him of that and and Job is is down through his journey. No doubt this question is still in his mind because we're always wondering what happens to life after we die here. What what is there beyond the grave? Is there anything there? Is it just or is there nothing there? Is it just you're just in a deep sleep and it's nothing? Or or is there a life beyond this life that we're living? And Job comes to a conclusion in his own life and he answers this question by revelation to himself. And as you look at Job's life, you know, God does the same thing for us. A lot of times we have questions in our lives and we wonder about things and we and we ask and we ponder and we think but God brings us to a place in our life where he gives us a revelation of the questions that we once had and he h he answers this question himself in chapter 19 and verse 21 it reads uh I'll just Read this through. Have pity upon me, oh ye, my friends, for the hand of God has touched me. And uh he says, "Why persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? Oh, that my words were now written. Oh, that they were printed in a book, that they were graven with an iron pen, and led in the rock forever. For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall be whole and not another, though my reigns be consumed in me. And so Job has finally come to a place and he says,"I know that my redeemer liveth and I know that after my skin worms eat this flesh that in this flesh I shall see God." And so he had a a a revelation a aha moment. the the light turned on that he realized that this flesh that shall decay someday in the grave. It shall rise again and within this flesh I shall see God. And [snorts] we know that the Bible says that uh in my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so uh I would have told you. He says I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there ye may be also. And now we we live in a time where we we don't have to guess no more &gt;&gt; and we don't have to wander anymore. Brother Brandham said, you know, I I always wondered about what how heaven would be and what it would be like. And I always wondered and I thought, my will, will will brother Neville just be a cloud that passes by and we'll just be a clouds and and we won't have hands to shake each other's hands and but we'll know who each other is. And God lets him pass beyond the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; You know, God didn't only let that happen for brother Brandham, but he let that happen for you and I. So that the question would be answered of what is beyond the grave. We don't have to uh think of or imagine things or or wander and ponder of of perhaps what it'll be like. He gave us a glimpse into the afterlife of how it will be and who will how the people will look when we see them. That's why when I look at this picture, th this picture is is is an old picture of of how we remember Sister Mary. And I had only met Sister Mary uh a few times and when we went to the house and visited and uh you know she always had such a good attitude and uh and you talk about a real fighter, huh? She never wanted to give up. And brother Chris said she's honory. You know, only an honorary person recognizes other honory people. And only honory people can call other people honory. This is a three-way tie here, Brother Chris. [laughter] But this picture that we see here was is a picture of a a let me say it like this, a decaying body and a decaying image. But the image that we see up here is the image that was in the mind of God since before the foundations of the world. And when we cross over, whether it be a translation of our bodies or if God is to take us by the way of the grave, this is the image that we're going to see of Sister Mary. And so she has certainly crossed over to her reward and she has crossed over to her sweetheart. And no doubt they're holding hands and and and who knows what they're talking about. We can use our imagination for that. But I am thankful that that God changes lives and that those lives when they're changed, they are lived before us. And no doubt all of you could come up here and you could give a an example or a story of Sister Mary um of of how she touched or impacted your life either directly or indirectly. We could all do that. And so sister Anna, we we rejoice with you and we cry with you and we are here for you and don't ever forget that. And um God bless you all. We're just I'm I'm honored that I could be a a a part of this here today. And um just may God richly bless you all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what it looks like. Thank you, brother Stephen. you know that that's why sometimes you don't you can plan and this and that and this is going to happen and but when you let God deal with it and have it it works out perfect. So I think Sister Becky, she has a song When I come to [singing] the river at the end of day [singing] when the last wind of sorrow blown. waiting to show me the way. I won't have to cross Jordan alone. [music] I won't have to cross Jordan alone because Jesus [music and singing] died all my he'll be [singing] waiting. for me. I won't have to cross alone. Often times I'm forsaken and we sad when it seems [music and singing] [singing] heartless. I won't have to cross [singing] Jordan alone. And though the billows of sorrow and trouble [singing] may sweep, Christ myavior, he cares for his [singing] journeys. Our [singing] souls he will keep and we won't have to cross Jordan alone. I won't have to cross Jordan alone. Jesus died all [singing] my sins to atone. In the darkness I see he is waiting for me. I won't cross Jordan. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Wow. I could cross over right now. &gt;&gt; It's that real. Sister Anna would like to get up and say a little something to the church and [snorts] God bless you saints and thank you for coming. I really just have a lot of people to thank, but I want to thank God first for making her his daughter because I'm her daughter. [snorts] A little history on mom. She was 12 when the Lord started dealing with her. She was born Catholic into a Catholic family. And at 12, there was no earthly reason for a idol that she was praying to to turn and burn. It just caught fire. And she knew then the Lord was talking to her. And then she came back across into California and she became apostolic. And that was her understanding at the time. And there was a time where she knew because she would had been listening to messages about brother Brandham and she had been to a couple of his meetings and he prayed for her once and she was healed. And then we came to Phoenix for what we thought was the word and um supposedly brother Brandham's message but definitely no Holy Spirit there. Um, and then because of brother Pollock, Brother Dave, he invited us to my parents to brother Ron's church and they made it their home. And she finally made it home. And there's so many of you that she loved so deeply and so profoundly that she would [laughter] tell me, "Ana, we need to pray for these people who when she'd hear their testimonies as a little bit of admonishment, she'd say, listen to this because the Lord can do a work in you just like that or differently, but still do the work in you if you'll allow it." And so from the Catholicism to the apostolic and to her former church each time a higher ground &gt;&gt; and now she's reached her summit and she's home. &gt;&gt; Amen. [gasps] &gt;&gt; And praise God for that. And she would get upset if brother one wasn't preaching. But then I'd say, "Hey, it's Brother Steven McNeely." And she Okay. Okay. I'm fine. [laughter] And then you know brothers Chua she loved brother Chua's preaching brother Canana brother love all [snorts] she just loved it and then brother Arazola came on and she's like oh I really like him [laughter] and she just had her way about that but through all of her ups and downs with her health all of your prayers is what got us through and we so thank you for that. We cannot even express to the degree that we are so grateful because it takes all of us. It takes all of you to be the church that you are and to help us through to the other side. And I I I just can't even express the love that I feel for you because through her telling me about your testimonies and telling me who you were and she'd even on when we had to watch my screen, she's like, "Oh, there's there's my brother. There's my sister and oh, you remember her and oh, remember we need to pray for that one." And and so [laughter] she she would just be glad that she could participate that way, but always including me about what needed to be done and said for people. And [snorts] so I just thank you and to brother one who has been so steadfast and diligent in the care and pastoring of her and Sister Sandy by his side ever steadfast too. And when I got baptized I'll never forget this. And Sister Judy Dilling, if you're hearing this and you're watching this, mother used to tell me, "Sister Judy Dilling really knows how to hug people." [laughter] But when I got baptized, Sister Sandy gave me such a big hug. And I said, "Ah, Sister Judy, you're on notice." [laughter] So, I just wanted to thank you all for coming. Thank you all for your prayers, for visiting, for your texts, for your cards and gifts, and just for loving my mama. I miss her, but I know that she's rejoicing right now and she sees us all. &gt;&gt; Thank you once again, and God bless you all for being here. Okay. So, at this time too, if anybody [snorts] has any testimony or something, come forward. God bless everybody. [clears throat] Not everybody might know me personally, but I was um [clears throat] she was my aunt Mary. She is my father's oldest sister and I have known her all my life. Um she was a very special to me. She was my favorite aunt. Um, my father was one that didn't really consider, you know, birthdays and, you know, he didn't really, but when my aunt Mary found out it was somebody's birthday, boy, she had to, you know, it didn't matter how big her family was, she always remembered and she made a special uh, day for us. And that's something I do appreciate because I can remember, you know, when you're a child and something happens, you can remember for the rest of your life, you know. Um, and that's something that that I will always carry in my heart. Um my father came to the message came to believe the message through you know like my cousin Anna had mentioned uh she uh she had gone to listen to the message or or you know attend uh brother Brandham's meetings and my father came to uh believe the message at at that time. Uh he kind of like kind of got off the track there for a bit, but uh God is merciful. And uh I uh and the church like she said um when when she just before she came to be part of this congregation uh at the old uh building. Uh she kind they were kind of waiting for me cuz me and my wife got married and they were waiting for that to kind of uh realize itself, you know, happen and then they were going to move on and you know she had been invited to the congre but she and then after that actually a few years later I actually began to attend at the old uh building. Uh so I know some of you do remember me. It's been a while, but um uh I really appreciate uh the care that everybody shared with her and uh it it is very dear to my heart because uh even though I know I know she was my family but now I consider you guys my family. So uh God bless you all. Is anybody feel on their heart to Yeah. Jerry God bless you. God bless you, Sister Hannah. I don't have a lot of big swelling words to say, but I just want to tell you that your mother was a very special person to Sister Gwen and I. She always had that smile that when we shook her hand and I didn't know you guys very well, but I remember your dad and we talked about your father quite often. We talked about him, what a special little man he was. And he just meant meant so much to us and I remember just having personal conversations with him and telling me where he was from and where he grew up and things like that. But I I remember we me and brother Creed came over and painted your house and she cooked us a big old lunch of Mexican food and she just tried to show us how thankful she was and we're going to miss your mother. But when all of us have to go one time or another, but I I keep all these and I put them up in my little office and I'm going to remember this picture because this is the one I'm going to when I see her again. It's what I'm going to recognize her. And we just love you and this we're praying for you. God bless you. Okay. Well, I'll just say a little just a little something else with Sister Mary. You know, she uh you know, after brother the Rudy was gone and then she used to drive herself, come with that little Corolla, pull into the handicap spot, you know, and everything, get out. You just either go help her or then when it's time to leave, you know, here she is trying to back out and we'd be clearing out for her. Come on back. Come on back. Brother John's probably done it a few times for, you know, it's one of those, you know, and then uh then a little bit later, you know, Sister Anna was telling me how they had to take her keys and oh my goodness, you know, [laughter] but you know, Sister Anna started bringing her drop her off and she'd leave. And sister Anna said her mama used to go home and tell her about the people. And Anna, she kept watching. She kept watching. And it was the love of Christ that got your that caught you. [snorts] And next thing you know, Anna comes in. And you know, I I want to give a rose to Anna, what she's done for the last 20 years, whatever it's been to take care of your mama and daddy. [snorts] My goodness. And you know, God don't miss a beat. He knew exactly the right person that could do it. And it was you. a nurse was able to keep her certifications, everything. You can't you can't outplan God. That's a fact. And we know that. And so I honor you, Sister Anna, for your love, sacrifice of love, not for your mama, but for a daughter of God. What a blessing. You think about it, right? My goodness. All heaven's all heaven's for us. Like I always like to say after I heard a minister say, "We're not fighting to victory. We're fighting from victory because that's where we're going." Um, so we got a a little lunchon planned. Hope everybody could stay. If you can't, that's fine. But uh you know, sister Mary, she wouldn't, man, she'd never forgive us if we didn't feed the people. She's one time she she brought tamalies. Now, I don't know if she gave any other deacons, but she gave me some time. [laughter] But, you know, just in her little ways, just But you think back and you're like her heart's desire was to cook a whole meal for everybody. That's just the kind of person she was. And we're going to miss [snorts] Oh, excuse me. The last time I saw her [snorts] at her house here a month or so ago [snorts] and I come in and Anna was there with her and she was at her feet or whatever. She got up and so I could sit in the chair and I went sat down and I said, "Where you?" She goes, "I always just rubbing mama's feet. I don't realize." So I sat there for just a little bit just rubbing her feet for her, you know, and she wasn't really coherent. [snorts] And all of a sudden she [sighs] she looked at me. I said, "Is this Mary?" [laughter] She almost scared me. She looked at me and I was like, "Okay." You know, so I was just talking with her, you know, I was just, "Man, you just don't I'll [snorts] cherish that when I had time to go, you know, I just I said [snorts] gave her a kiss on the forehead, you know, and you're just, man, you don't realize. We were hoping she'd make it to her 95th birthday. That was and you know that was her hop and they had this big you know what she wouldn't change it for the world sister Anna she would she got her present man and we're thankful. Okay let's bow our heads. [snorts] Father, as we pause now, Lord, and close at this time, Lord, we thank you for once [snorts] again, Lord, a life that was lived before us that without a shadow of a doubt, we will see her again. [snorts] Father, I pray you continue to give Anna wisdom, Lord. [snorts] Give her understanding, Lord, and revelation, Father, what to do next and to carry on, Father, realizing, Lord, that we are her family, your chosen people. [snorts] Father, we just ask now, Lord, that you just be with her, Lord, and the family, oh God. Father, we just commit this time into your hands, Lord, and everything that was said and done and sung, Father. We [snorts] ask you to bless the food that's been prepared, Father. The hands that that made it, Father, and we just commit this time into your hands, Lord. We love you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. So, yeah, it's Is it ready, Sister Monica? Okay, let's go eat.
