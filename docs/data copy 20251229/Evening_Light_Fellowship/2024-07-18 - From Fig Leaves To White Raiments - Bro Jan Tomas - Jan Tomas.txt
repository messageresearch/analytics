we have two brothers here uh visiting with their wives and and uh brother Yan Thomas and his wife sister Anna are here they're from Serbia and brother Yan is going to be uh speaking for us tonight and brother OS uh and his wife sister stonka uh they're from Slovenia and they both speak very good English they understand it quite well and we're just pleased Amen to have brother OS would you please come and uh greet the people here before we actually have brother Yan come up he is a pastor in uh the city of Luana and anywhere know anybody know where lubiana is huh okay yeah yeah John does God bless you brother it's a pleasure to have you here amen God bless you amen God bless you all uh I'm bringing greetings from our fellowship in Liana we're just a small group gr but then again we are a group group of Believers of this end time message Believers of God and uh we also are visiting sometimes to the neighboring country which is the country of Croatia the capital city of Zagreb there are no many Believers there but sometimes We Gather there you know Believers from different parts of Croatia gather there so we have regular meetings also in in Zagreb so I'm bringing the greetings from Believers from Croatia as well uh I will say now this is live and I'm not meaning about the streaming but uh I'll I'll give you a little secret so uh I have a full-time job so not many times uh I'm in the actually uh can prepare for a meat uh week service so so what I do I actually invite some preachers pastors from around the world not very many I'm really picky who to invite and uh one of the well pastors that we invite many times is Pastor Ron Peterson what we do we we we just take certain services from the archive from your archives and we actually just play and listen to them so we know you we know you better than you think we uh and I'm saying that uh with all the let's say humility because we really enjoy we enjoy not only your pastor brother Ron Peterson uh we enjoy the service we enjoy the worship service and you know the way I see it is we feel the presence of the Lord when we listen to those recorded Services now imagine you have a live service here and the presence of the Lord comes down and then we listen the same service like three four weeks maybe a year later and the same presence of Lord comes into our room that's why we appreciate you so much because if your right your spirit would not not be right then the presence of the Lord would not be here and would not be in the room when we listen to so we love you we appreciate you very much again many many greetings and love from from our local congregations and may God richly bless you amen would you introduce your wife oh yes please oh I would like to introduce yes my wife sister stanka well okay okay please come here yeah would you please come here yes she's very shy well we both are so anyway us how many children how long you okay okay okay so well we have the 30th Anniversary we had it like two weeks ago and thank you and uh we have three well grown up boys uh the oldest one is 29 and and the middle one will be 27 in a couple of weeks and the youngest one will be 25 again in a week and a half so we are very blessed Lord has blessed us immensely and uh well that's the love of my life so may God bless you amen we when we go over to Serbia and that part of the country there with brother Yan Thomas uh brother OS and his wife and the the boys they come and uh you know when you meet somebody and uh they have that spirit that connects with your spirit that's how I felt both with brother Yan and brother uros and uh uh so we are just so very very pleased to have them this is their first time for both of them to be in the United States so this is you have only one chance to make a uh an impression and we're not trying to impress as far as you know look at what we got or whatever because you know everything that we have is a gift from God God gave it to us God God is good is he not amen and uh we are blessed because He blesses us amen he is our Victory he is our strength he is our shield and uh so um brother Yan Thomas he uh is here with his wife sister Anna and sister Anna would you stand up so the people can see you God bless you and uh um so anyway let's change the order the service let's everybody stand now and you know Saints of god um brother Brenham said that our theme song uh we all know what it is and it's an anointed song around the world no matter where you go because how many times when the prophet of God was coming to the [Music] pulpit you hear [Music] that and he was saying because the angel of the Lord had told the prophet if you'll get the people to believe how many of you say I believe tonight I believe amen and we're just thankful to have ministers that believe this message amen okay these men have learned English and everything one of the main reasons not only just because it's an international language but because of this message so they hear it directly even from the prophet's own tapes amen only be let's raise our hands [Music] now all things are POS [Music] be holy be for all things are possible holy now let's sing Lord I believe yes Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible [Music] I Lord I oh I [Music] all things are possible Lord amen H Allelujah you may be seated for just for a moment amen I want to thank brother Ron for this nice introduction and uh everything he said is nothing but but the truth yes we we know brother the r at least 15 years and uh we're just uh recalling a lot of memories uh sitting together but uh really I was just want to say a couple of things like an introduction uh yes we also have a small group in Serbia which is um uh in sobia we have only two fellowships so the message so it's really precious to have Believers in one place gathering together and because of that we really appreciate every Ministry which came uh to like support and help the people and I can say brother Ron was much more than a blessing for the people there so if uh you would mention in our country and to the Believers of this message in Serbia uh about some things like uh what is that in America like uh Grand Canyon or some waterfall or some any any other Memorial Place uh but the message believe would say in America there is brother Ron Peterson so we we we we we just have that opinion like uh National Treasure of [Laughter] America so that's how we love him uh not to make him big okay we recognize the the gift of God given to the people uh Believers not only here but worldwide and he really was a blessing many times for us we could draw so many things and the people felt so good you know and we could tell testimonies after testimony but yes that's true and I'm glad personally to know him and uh he really blessed me many times so uh greetings from all the Believers from Serbia to you and we app appreciate and thankful that you had have let him go many times because maybe you needed him but you were ready to sacrifice so we want to thank you also and it's not in vain you blessed many people just because of the minister belon even sister Sandy when she was there she left such an impression on many sisters like really many were so impressed and they they couldn't believe such a simple and uh wonderful believer you know and uh a wife of minister they were really impressed so we thank also sister Sandy and to all of you and uh yeah I wanted to mention some other things also but now it uh just uh slipped away from my mind but uh I don't want to take too much time I would like to share some thoughts uh from the Bible and uh uh from the message just um to somehow connect with you I believe that you really uh cherish everything what brother Braham preached and the Bible and I didn't come to preach something new to you but just to maybe emphasize some things in the Bible and the message which you already know and um uh brother R is really uh a great example also for me and uh he is 30 years of marriage you can still learn from him really um a lot uh me and my wife are this year 25 years of marriage so we somehow also have a anniversary and we have four children and uh all of them by God's grace are believers baptized and following the message and supporting so it's only the grace of God you know some of them came very quick our youngest son Andrew he was only 10 years but he wanted to be baptized earlier even and uh the last one came uh when he was 21 or something like that 22 just recently but uh still God's grace is the same you know and sometimes you need to have patience with your children and um pray and believe that the promise is yours claim it and after time it just happens you know so that that's it so if you will maybe take the Bible and have a look in some scripture it's in Genesis we can stand and for the reading we will find the third chapter of Genesis from the sixth verse until 13 so Genesis 3 verse six familiar scriptures if you if if you found I will read from the sixth verse and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the ice and the tree to be desired to make one Vice she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they s soed thick leaves together and made themselves aprons and they hear the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I hear thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I command thee that thou should not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent begal me and I did eat amen let's bow our heads for prayer dear heavenly father we are so thankful for a new opportunity to be here together worshiping you Lord and praying and as the prophet said every time we open the Bible we can have a new vision and may this just open our eyes to see some things in the Bible and in the things uh in the message your Prophet preached that we really be encouraged to understand why is it important to stay here to be together in Fellowship to be together on the road of God and just prepare for the greatest event ever will come and that's the Rapture of the chosen ones we pray Lord that you help us anoint us help me to step aside and Grant all the prayer requests we have prayed already heal the sick and help everyone who needs something Lord may we be blessed Lord even more than we can pray we pray that in the name of our Lord Jesus amen you may be seated okay brother on he really I don't know if this is maybe some making some problem no it's okay okay okay uh brother one he said we we we speak very good English but uh I I I'm not sure if I can really justify his words you will see after one hour but I have a secret weapon I speak German so maybe I will seek some words and ask him uh to help me also don't feel bad uh if I deal with you as a teacher in a class because um I mainly work uh also as a teacher in a high school and you know how teacher are they don't know anything they asked the the pupils the students you know they pretend to know everything and ask the students so maybe I will ask some questions but uh it's like uh when I was uh making my study I'm actually a mechanical engineer but I choose to work as a teacher uh because I want to be more with the people in the church and the word of God and the job of a mechanical engineer would take me too much of course it would I would have some benefits uh but not spiritually you know so that's uh the main thing and uh when I was making my degree uh my mentor Professor told me uh I should just like um defend you know all the work I have done I said Don't You Worry uh when you go outside uh we professors we we we are just uh the same as everyone else uh we go outside he said there wasn't uh one examp example one Professor he went outside and was uh making his uh uh class uh you know uh uh explaining everything and he was writing a lot you know on some board and he asked uh is everything clear and there was one student he stood up and he said no if you can explain again so the professor was retelling this story to his uh colleagues professors he said I hav it again to the board I write everything you know again and the whole board and two boards even and I asked again is everything uh CLA and he can you imagine this student stood again up and he said no so you imagine the third time I was writing everything on the board and I started to understand and he still not so it's just like that you understand sometimes we're preaching things we think we know but when we start preaching it then it unfolds so that's experience of a Preacher I don't I don't know if you can relate with it but you know sometimes you prepare some things and you want to share and you think oh that's really good but when sometimes you speak something out you just wow what did I say you know so it's really something special to be just in the service for God and I believe you hear your pastor many times speaking some wonderful things so I want to go somehow through a small Bible study maybe for one hour so just uh if you can bear with me and help me a little bit maybe there will be a few scriptures because as a teacher we have a saying like um a peasant can go out of his village but his village will never go out of him you know so I'm wherever I go I just try to teach or to say something but I will take a lot of quotes bible verses and because uh my queen's English is not so good I will try to use The King's English King James and the message and I hope when I read these things it will not be too hard for you to bear with me okay so the main thought was actually uh going from uh leaves to White rayment so we have read this opening scripture like uh uh Adam and Eve they realized they were naked and now they they started to make uh fig leaves as we have read in the seventh verse and uh made themselves aprons and uh they started to uh clothe themselves and uh if you would go further on uh in the third chapter the 21st verse says that unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God made quats of skins and clothed them now we see the garments are changed and the FES are throwing away and God gave them a gave them coats of skins and clothed them with that and uh not only that there were car carabins and a flaming swad which turned every way to keep them away from the Tree of Life so we understand it was something which God wanted to do and to show us but uh uh one of the things you can take out of it for example we we have only two kinds of religions so one is uh you know about God so you try to do something for God you try to do something for God and the other one which is the true Christianity not just Christianity but true Christianity is God is doing something for you so that's just two ways nothing else every religion whatever this you know uh you can divide into these two even Christians many times they are just like uh somehow they they're missing the idea they're trying to do something for God and they're falling into a trap you know and then they cannot have the real fellowship and relationship with God so if you go further on and you come to Revelation then uh we see what should be the end of our clothing and the changing of our garments and you can see that God was uh uh saying to the messenger of the Lan Church age in the third chapter that uh I counil the in the 18th verse uh uh to buy of me go try it in fire that all might be rich and white rment that may be clo so we see it goes from thick leaves to White rayment that's our pth and uh we need to understand the changing of the garments that is the key how you can change you know how Adam change from fig leaves to the coat skins and then if you go further on at the end the right the right Ryman should Raymond should come again under the same uh inspiration with the same same key of changing and that must be by God but how it comes I want just to show you through the Bible and through the message if I can in this short time and you can maybe find some other quotes or just uh uh study a little bit when you're at home but uh one main question is actually why are so many people today uh so far from God you know even they uh confess or they they going to some church or wherever they are but many people are very far from God because of one reason brother explained he said in the message conference he said before he could talk to Adam he could not talk to him naked so that's uh something we should just uh notice that God cannot couldn't speak to Adam while he was naked so now you understand for sure was spiritually minded that his uh uh nakedness in body now we apply to spiritual nakedness so God cannot talk to people while they're naked they need to be clothed you know many people they try to come to God and speak with him but he cannot speak to them because there's something missing and uh brother explained of course God killed something something has to die something did die to make a covering that we could hold this conference with God of course he explained further on in the bridge message I think somewhere that many people they claiming the blood but they're not coming under the blood because rejecting the plan how to come so it's okay God killed something and uh prepared everything but if you're not accepting the plan you're actually staying naked and that's a very very big problem for the people and because of that they cannot hear God any anymore to speak so you see a lot of things changed from the beginning because Paul says that uh many have a seared conscious I'm saying yeah okay so uh what happened from the beginning you see in the beginning Adam was afraid when he hear the voice of God okay today people can hear that God is speaking but they don't afraid anymore you know they just something happened to them sure like brother was explaining when this great earthquake was you know and everything was shaking he was there also with his wife somewhere and then some man came out and said did you see what I have done I a Superman or something like that so people have no no sensivity anymore for the voice of God but uh if you look on Cain even that was something very uh strange for me if you read in Genesis 4 it's written that Cain and in the fifth verse Genesis 4:5 but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very rot and his countenance fell so can you understand that Cain even he could understand that his that his offering was not uh accepted today people they don't even realize that the offering is not accepted they're offering prayers and doing many many things so from from the beginning many things changed because of this big change you know we it needed a time that we come again back to this fellowship and relationship with God and God had a plan how to come back to it so uh but B was saying something very interesting for me when I was reading about uh Babylon and Nimrod how he was making a tower uh and you read in the Bible it's a little bit strange there that uh God had to come down and to stop them in their doing because it looked like they will succeed to make a tower and you know when you think about it how could take succeed to make a tower to go into heaven you know they would not succeed like that but that what would happen if God would not come down it would make a wrong impression and a pattern for people in the future because brother Abraham said that what Nim was trying to achieve was that man could run up in heaven if it got bad here on Earth and live in heaven and then come back down on Earth and sin and go back into heaven again in and he said that's been the idea of man all along the road trying to sin and live in Earth and be in heaven at the same time so what are people trying to do in nakedness trying to make themself away that they have the feeling like they are in heaven everything is fine but still living in sin and God had to come down to show it will not be possible he will he will prevent I don't know in what which message it was I'm have noted here but I think mentioned once uh one Pentecostal some other preacher who was uh playing like maybe guitar or singing in some nightclub Saturday and then Sunday is coming and preaching and finally he killed himself he blowed his head with a gun and brother said no wonder he did this you cannot live a double life you know it's too much pressure on you you cannot live a double but people they are still trying to do it you know and uh we are sincere followers of the message we really really not interested in something like that but now we understand why it is important to follow the pattern of God you know not to try your own thing because you will never succeed so brother explained it in one very good quote in the message wisdom versus Faith he said and I hope I will not nobody will get offended because I I saw so many n nice palm trees and everything it's really beautiful here you know know but brother man said the same against Florida he said got nothing against Florida he said I don't mean this for you people from Florida but when I crossed and went in Florida the first time and come back to Georgia Line I stood right there and said as an American citizen I give my part of feed back to the seals where it belongs why they take better care of their yards than I do my hair so he said everything feather edged the palm trees has got lights all over it big Swanky Ys and things and now he's the key trying to bring a millennium without repentance that's what people are trying to do they just try to go in Heavenly places without repentance and then sinning and then when they sinning they feel something's wrong again into experience with God maybe in some church you know has singing some songs and living like that and if God wouldn't come down it would be like it's scriptural we can do it you know but God he marked it you know he destroyed that and he said it's not possible so there is a plan for us God has a plan to clothe us properly and to bring us in such a stage that we can really have that experience which was in the beginning amen so uh brother said that in the message of Grace he is explaining how terrible it was that morning when darkness was hanging in the garden and he said there came Jehovah Jehovah down like a roar of Thunder walking through the garden crying Adam Where Art Thou that's when Adam realized he was naked and had sin before God so uh brother man said okay let's read that quote uh underlined joining church will never cover sin no dry confession will ever cover sin it takes sorrow and repentance and the grace of God to cover sin for the blood of Jesus Christ the one that God killed at Calvary to cover sin so when you think about uh you know when God is speaking uh and sometimes he's asking questions Adam where are th so what do you think did God know where Adam is or not of course he's not asking because he doesn't know he's asking because he wants Adam to wake up hey what are you doing man something's wrong but brother explained that when ad when God was speaking to Adam that's when Adam realized he was naked so you see what's the real realization of nakedness it's the voice of God the voice of God will only open the people's eyes so because of that God had to send a message because people they when they were naked God could not speak to them so he had to send a voice first for them to realize that they are naked they could repent so when somebody does not receive the voice for this age what will happen with him he will stay naked and God cannot speak to him yes so you know it's difficult it was a very I would say uh a bitter experience for me I was uh I have no time now to expl to tell all my uh testimony how I converted but I was first two years in the Pentecostal church and it was a one Pentecostal Church baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and U of course believing in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but as p costal you know they believe that when you speak in tongues you are baptized with the Holy Ghost so when I hear there is a holy ghost I really wanted to have the Holy Ghost and uh uh of course there the doctrine is you need to speak in tongues and uh believe me I would do anything what the what the preacher says if say speak in tongues or stay on your head to receive the Holy Ghost I would do it because I wanted to have the hly Holy Ghost and then watching people they are getting baptized and the preacher says I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and God will give you the Holy Ghost you know and then some other were baptized you know and the preacher says I baptize you in the name of the Holy uh the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord God has already given you the Holy Ghost I think oh my that's special you know so I hear that actually yeah some people are receiving the Holy Ghost G before and because they have spoken in tongues so I said Lord I want to have the Holy Ghost and I prayed and maybe just to maybe touch a bit this testimony I was making my study uh in University preparing for my exam it was maybe like 2 3:00 in the morning if you're a student or real student you know they like to learn at night it's quiet you know nobody disturbs you and I I was really happy you know I prepared I was just glad that everything I covered you know I will be ready next day so I thought okay I will I will just thank the Lord you know so some voice was telling me come on the Lord knows that you're thankful just get in bed you know you need to sleep so I said no I will thank the Lord you know so I I was kneeling down it was a small small room where I was and I started to say Thank you Lord Jesus that you're helping me you know and I was praying and uh suddenly I he some strange noise you know and it was at my window that I thought somebody is and he's knocking you know I thought my what's going on it seems I'm praying too loud and somebody's coming and he's you know U not happy because of that so I stopped but then no noise was here so I I thought strange okay I started to pray again but again strange noise and words you know and then I realized that's me speaking you know I was speaking another tongue another language and suddenly I felt so happy I was glad you know I get the gift speaking in tongues and I still have it of course it's it's really a gift from God and I can speak in tongues and I'm glad for that but at that time I was thought it's it's the baptism of the Holy ghost and I have the sign that I'm ready to be and to uh to meet the Lord Jesus so I was happy of course and I believe it's really a gift of God but the doctrine was wrong and I don't know as far as I remember that time I think I was still wearing shorts sometimes you know and so going around have any bad feeling but once the Pentecostal Church where I was attending and nearby was quite the big church about 400 people you know I like to go there because a lot of young people were there and I had a strange dream I had a dream that I'm going to that Pentecostal church and uh as I'm going there entering there was like a balcony where the young people were and I was going up there and all the young people some 50 60 young people looking at me and pointing in I thought what they are laughing you know what's wrong and was looking at me I'm in my underwear how I'm coming to church in my underwear what what happened to me oh I was so ashamed I didn't want to run away because they would laugh even more there was some guy you know he said why you laughing everybody can come how he wants you know God will accept everyone so I said okay I will sit there but I didn't feel comfortable you know you know in your underwear so I knew something's wrong you know with my experience or my Doctrine when I woke up I I knew immediately something's not right you know I didn't know the message but I know nakedness is not a good sign you know for sure the Bible teaches us like that so I I'm reading in the Bible that we should cover our nakedness and uh the that's a spiritual application so nakedness means unbelief you know if you have a dream that you're not covered properly maybe just think maybe some unbelief or something is bothering you and God wants to help you but you know at that time I was really troubled and I didn't know what to do you know but uh maybe I don't know how long after that the message came into my life it's a long story now to tell but uh when I was reading all the things brother theah was preing in and listening to it I understood my Doctrine is wrong I'm not I'm not not clothed properly I'm not taught right I need to receive the message for this age so I was glad that the message came but you know it was not easy for me uh I felt so good that I speaking in tongues I was not even yet baptized you know and now somebody's coming and he's just throwing everything to the Earth you know it was a disappointment but this message you know we try to make it nice for people but we we we we must not forget this message comes for one purpose yes sir that people die to theel you can it you can make it nice however you want but at the end Everybody Must Die so uh you must die to yourself to your own understanding to your own doctrines to everything to your imagination Everything Must Die it must be a full capitulation you know full surrender I said like in the second world war you know the Germans they lost so some of them they thought maybe okay we lost now you Americans and Russians go home we we stay here and uh we lost but it was not like that the the Americans stood the German the the Russians stood you know the French the English men the Germans were not happy why because now they have not only this man here but they have first they had to clean the mess the themselves you know the Americans and Russian will not clean what was left from the bombing so they were not happy to have a lot of mess cleaning and that's what's happening with us when God comes in our life there's a lot of mess we have to clean and we we are not happy with it but it has to be done and somebody supervising you you know he's ah no no there's some left you know go there you know you can say no that's my country no you have lost the V you you need to clean this mess and you could see on many documentaries if you watch you know the German women they were not happy the Americans ah they are making a video you know and now we have to clean this why they are not cleaning they have bummed our country and so forth but that's you know the rules and not only that then the teacher in the school he could not teach anymore Germany is the biggest Nation or something they they had to change the teaching everything but they were teaching in school uh everything was different the judges were not uh anymore the same you know they could not judge someone because he was saying bad things about Adolf Hitler or someone else other judges coming in you know and they were judging different so this message comes in our life to change everything if it's a full surrender if it's not a full surrender right we are just missing a lot of things in our life and we cannot expect that at the end we will be clothed in white reignment okay so brother man says people stay people say in the message uh thirsting for life they say people say I can stay at home and be just as good a Christian as I can at church but man says you can't you cannot yeah so that's a voice like a judge you know if you make a full surrender and you say I I'm doing this you know I can do what I want and the voice of the judge says that's not what I'm speaking that's the voice of God to this last age who has an ear and can hear Let Him hear what the spirit is speaking so the spirit says you cannot it's simple somebody they are saying no I can I I I I can feed myself I can do that and that but uh you know if you read the Bible if you read brother Braham is quoting the Bible verse where it's said not for said not for sake our our assemble ourselves together and so forth you know Hebrews 11 yeah or 12 and he said if you a Christian you long to go where other Christians are and fellowship with other Christians so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life you cannot do it that's the truth you know that's the truth so uh okay I will skip some of that because I I think we will not make everything in time but there's a lot of things uh which comes with this thing uh verses quotes So first uh if you look back uh God's voice was making Adam uh his senses open for his uh stage and uh his uh image how he's looking like you know so the voice of God you cannot skip the voice of God and God is putting his voice voice in uh uh a fivefold Ministry if you listen and read Ephesians you can see that the fful ministry is actually put to uh bring in the mature stage okay so to to Really I cannot quote now in English but you know what you can find that Bible verse okay and if we don't take that if we take our own righteousness uh Isaiah says it's all as filthy rxs okay so our own understanding what is really good for us is as filthy rexs so now let's see what actually is bringing this nakedness the spiritual nakedness there is a very good example in Exodus 32 and uh I would like to go into this just to read a few verses Exodus 32 from the 21st verse and it was when Moses was on on the mountain and he came back and he saw the people of Israel what was happening with them and he came not to the people but to Aaron and he said what did these people unto thee that thou has brought so great a sin upon them so think about that he is blaming Aaron that he has brought sin upon them so Aaron he could say no I'm not guilty I know they are such and such people are stubborn and they will not listen so I was just uh serving them whatever they want but you know uh Moses was speaking uh about was actually really important to recognize who is responsible who is responsible and um okay let's go maybe through these verses and Aaron said let not the angel of my Lord re th knowest the people that thou are set on Mish so Aaron was blaming the people you know for they said unto me make with Gods which shall go before far from this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we want not what is become of him and I said unto them whosoever had any God let them break it off so gold let them break it off so they gave it me then I cast it into the fire and there came out this Cal so if so a cal can out can can can come out of fire it's really strange put some gold and a cal comes out it's a very very cheap you know explanation what happened here you know we break some gold put it in the fire and a cal come out but you know the 25th verse that's the key verse when Moses saw that the people were naked for Aaron had make made them naked unto their shame among the enemies now we are understanding where the nakedness of Israel came it be it was because of a weak leader a weak Ministry Leading the People and permitting sin in the Camp so if you take actually that word made naked uh it's the Hebrew word I think it will not be of many use I can say it's like par but if you take this word and have a look on it the meaning is to lead act as a leader to let go let loose ignore let alone to be let loose be loosen of restraint and you can understand that he didn't took uh the garments of them and made them naked but it was a spiritual nakedness and he was responsible because he was not standing as a leader in front of them his ministry was not good enough to lead them but the opposite they made naked this ministry of Aaron and Moses was angry on him you understand so there is a responsibility in every age uh and we have some more Bible verses maybe in 2 Chronicles if you read the 28th verse uh 28th chapter the 18th and 19th verse maybe maybe just the 19th uh it's written for the Lord brought Judah LW because of AAS king of Israel for he made Judah naked so you see the leader the King was responsible for the nakedness of Judah it's not the people it's okay they are responsible of course also but God is making the leader the king responsible for the nakedness of the people amen and and and you can understand uh why it is uh so important to have a true leadership a Ministry which will stand firm with the word of God and will not just under pressure of people make some things and then you know play the blame game you know that's not it so the same word for making uh naked you can find in Proverbs 29 where it's written where there is no vision Vision the people perish uh you can uh translate it like that where there is no vision the people are being naked they become naked that would be the application of that word you know but of course uh it's written like that you don't notice it maybe but it's the same Hebrew word and in Proverbs 8 it's written hear instruction Proverbs 8:33 hear instruction and bece and refuse it not refuse it not that means don't be naked so instruction hearing instruction makes you clo it refus instruction makes you naked so now we understand what is happening how God is clothing his people he's sending people giving them instruction to a minister and receiving that instruction cloth you and you will be found clothed refusing instruction makes you naked however people feel they they are clothed but in God's eyes they're naked so it's really very simple to follow that uh line in the Bible understand that God actually provided for his people but people because of their uh uh heart and the the the hardness of their heart they refuse instruction and they will like Paul said seek teachers like their ears tickling them or how you say okay so so that's what people are doing and uh sometimes you know you can pity the people in churches and say oh pity these people they you know but actually it's not pity the people it's God judgment they refused God so God send them a strong delusion you know just because they don't want to accept you cannot pity the people everybody will bear his own burden so you have a right to pray like the the message came to me I had to make full surrender everybody has to you know so you don't even know what that does this mean you know I didn't know what does this mean I knew I had to left the church the Pentecostal church and they told me why leing the church I don't know it's the voice of God calling me I cannot live anymore like that where will you go I don't know I I I told I don't know so we left the Pentecostal church at that time me my brother Adam brother R knows him and some other you know it was a difficult time we were gathering at some houses at my home some other places we are trying just to use whatever we had you know from the message we had just little booklets you know small amount of them and uh trying to understand what God wants from us but we had nothing only God and his voice but that was enough you know that was enough and God started to open our eyes and show us a lot of things and you know let's have a look uh just a little bit more in the Bible the Bible says in Revelation one that the sixth verse he made us Kings and Priests and uh we understand the priesthood everybody of we everybody are priests into in God's eyes and then in the 2 Chronicles 6 6 4041 maybe just 41 2 Chronicles 6:41 it's written now therefore rise oh Lord God into thy resting place thou and the Ark of thy strength let thy priests oh Lord God be clothed with salvation so it's it's a prayer we as a priesthood should be clothed into salvation so our clothing is even called salvation and uh in the 132nd Psalm the n9th verse let thy priests be cloth with righteousness so you see the clothing is coming to the ministry and in God's eyes receiving that Ministry is making you clo into salvation into righteousness you know all these things so actually we should be aware that we are clothed before the Rapture happens because Revelation 9 says that we should be happy and merry because the Bride of the Lamb has prepared us and she is clothed into white Ling so we should be aware if we are clothed or if we are not you know you see the biggest difference if you look in in in in the scripture also at that big Feast when there was one guy who was actually one man who was not clothed properly that was the difference yeah he came in brother man said not through the door not through the world maybe through the window or something but his clothing was not properly so what's wrong he received wrong instructions refused true instruction he was somehow clothed but as a foolish virgin not properly the Holy Ghost was missing because the Holy Ghost comes with instruction which are from the word you cannot receive the Holy Ghost and refusing right instruction from the word of God whatever you believe you can be as happy as you want but if you re if you reject the word of God the Holy Ghost will never come and seal somebody and that was a bit experience for me but I said Lord thy Ro is true I'm ready to change I'm ready to accept everything you have you know so the foolish virgin is in trouble also you know so let's have a look in uh just a couple of quotes more brother man said in the present stage of my Ministry 121 he says well all man has forsaken me but there is one thing he stood by me I wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision that happened down there on the river I've stayed true to him he has been true to me I'm trusting in Him someday I don't know when and now for for a crowning of my Ministry and then he says I don't know what it will be I don't know when it will be but he says I hope he will Crown my Ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the cloth of the world and for his righteousness amen so here we are everything is perfect amen the world his righteousness is our clothing it's our salvation and brother Braham as a crowning of his ministry that was he was preaching is doing it it's so beautiful sir so brother man said in the in the message God hiding himself in Simplicity he said now he's including not only him but there is a fivefold Ministry and you see in that uh uh message he said oh Lord God let it repeat again as we give ourselves to De with the with the church in dedication for service we commit ourselves with our offering of the church this morning to you for service for the Le day light for the evening time lights that we might bring he said we might bring consolation and Faith to the waiting people that's waiting for the coming of the bridegroom to dress a bride amen in the gospel of Christ for the Lord Jesus to receive so you see there must be a Ministry who is dressing the bride and because of that it is so important to have a real leader who will not make you naked but will clothe you with a true Ministry to the word of God to this message because we know the bride will be uh prepared to the messenger of the last age for the Rapture and through his preaching which the inspiration is coming on the fightful ministry because of that we cannot teach anything else just the same that is clothing the bright if we teach something else it will not cloth but if we teach the same it will make the clothing and you can be just happy and be assured God will receive me amen yeah there are so many quotes but I will skip a lot of them and sometimes some things are very simple maybe I will just take a couple of quotes in the New Testament first Peter 5 first Peter 5 five he says likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yeah all of you be subject unto to another and be close cled with humility so you see the clothing includes humility sometimes people they taking a big Revelation and then they are just stamping on all the other because they are so small you know but humility goes with the world if you receive the real clothing it will make you humble because Peter identified identified humility with cloting so if somebody has big Revelation and he's making you small something's wrong because Peter is testifying the opposite okay so uh Ephesians 4 uh maybe I will Skip and 24 Ephesians 4:24 he said and that he put on the new man so a new man is quoted okay which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness and now he's explaining what does it mean to uh uh take take off old clothing and put on new clothing okay putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be angry and see not there must be a stop to the angriness okay let not the sun go down upon the rat neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labore walking with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to them that need it let no corrupt communication proceed of of your mouth but that which is good to do the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers G out the Holy Spirit whereby are sealed on the day of redemption let all bitterness and rra and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake had forgiven you so that's all take doing away the clothing wrong clothing and putting on the right clothing and every Ministry every true fivefold Ministry whatever he preaches it must be included the anointing of these verses must be in the minister to anoint his preaching if he's preaching something other we are the big group these are the small group we are the bride they are not the bride and so forth you know it's difficult to explain but just understand for example Abraham Abraham he was a type of a bride of the Bride he had lot his nephew which was a type of a foolish virgin but when lot was in trouble you know what Abraham has done he fight for him he helped him you know so you know how much more we should try to help each other if we are believing the same message fighting you know Abraham had I think 318 circumcised men fighting you know to to redeem Lord out of his trouble and that was the spirit of Christ the spirit of Christ will always try to sacrifice you know if you try to belittle some other who is not believing you know Abraham was never speaking wrong uh bad things about lot he couldn't convert him but he was trying to help him and I believe all these anointings which are in these verses must cover the preaching it must be part of the ministry he said if you be risen with uh Colossians 3 if you be risen with Christ seek those things which are about and uh said second verse so I said Colossians 3 second verse set your affection on things above not on things on the earth and uh okay okay the ninth verse that he have put off the old man with his deeds and now again now is the clothing and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him so it must be a renewing of the of of our spirit you know and uh we are not going to Romans uh 12 and so forth but he said in the 12th verse put on their force delect of God holy and beloved bubes of Mercy kindness humbleness of mind me weakness long suffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man had a quel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye so that's all the clothing all the clothing of the new man you know and uh I believe that uh when somebody really sincere is seeking the counsel of God he cannot skip these small things written there people are searching for big revelation you know and to be clothed with some big thing but when you see the fruits of their life you can see many times something's missing there you know you know all these things we have read here so the True Church of Jesus Christ the bright is likened to pure gold so to be pure gold I believe all this must be part of our life her righteousness is in his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there's no fault in her she's all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she's the work of the Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is sumed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God so how can one fatom it how can one understand it so we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for God had spoken it worthy of the Gospel is this Lely Bri of Christ amen so I believe just this message uh wants to bring us back to the world because of that I read a lot of scriptures of the Bible it's just so simple that many people have forgotten that you know so I hope it could encourage you and to understand that a true ministry will cloth you uh avoiding a Ministry means you don't want to be clothed that's really dangerous you know and I believe you understand and you are enjoying you know when God has Anointed The Fold Ministry or all the Ministries you have here and we want to have a touch from every Ministry from time to time I like to invite an evangelist and teacher and Pastor uh just to have a touch from everyone to be cloth at every piece I don't know here in America but in our country a BRI is preparing herself for wedding she is not able to clothe herself she needs help I don't know how the brides are here clothing in America but the the the that garment she's putting on she's not able to fix every detail on herself she needs help so it's spiritual application we cannot clothe ourself we cannot teach ourself we need to have have the min Ministry which is helping us and a real uh Ministry of God will always stay humble and uh not trying to be big or bigger somebody else and that's our experience that's our desire for us for the bride in Serbia and I believe we can just really have the same understanding of these things I hope I could help you a little bit to see how we see this message and the word of God and how we enjoy it and um because it's a evening you know I don't want to show how big a preacher I am you know I just want to be a blessing for you and I'm really thankful for the time that you could bear with me uh maybe we could stand together and pray dear heavenly father we are so thankful Lord standing here humble and seeing that the word of God in the Bible and this message of this last Church age is going so together we can see it in the scripture we can see the Fulfillment we can understand how important it is to be in under good leadership under good Ministry which when it's ministered to the people is actually clothing to hold bright so we are clothed through the ministry of the word of God and we are so thankful Lord that you have send the fivefold ministry and helping us and that you want to prepare us to help us to make a full surrender in our life in every detail you ever want Lord and make this a revelation for us to think about and and just to receive correction from you Holy Ghost if you see anything in our lives to help us to change and just to be ready for the Rapture that day we pray that and I pray the blessing upon the church and the pastor and the ministry here in the name of our Lord Jesus amen amen amen God bless you brother amen did you enjoy that boy if I could speak another language as well as he speaks our language and and and everything but I so enjoyed it um he read that quote there it says uh well I can stay home and still be a Christian he said no you can't I wonder how many people in the message read that quote really huh he said it don't work well I can just stay without he said no you can't do it see we want to agree we want to be clothed upon he says I counsel of thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire white rment that thou mayest be clothed huh and that the nakedness does not appear leadership helps clothe you in the word and obedience is being clothed upon any of you ever had a dream of going somewhere and all of a sudden you were in your underwear or something you hey I I've had that and I thought what am I doing here the Simplicity huh and how that the leadership was made responsible Aaron was made responsible for making the people naked Aaron you caused it what a responsibility you know on one of my favorite quotes as brother Bram said now if God is pleased with me and he'll allow me to do this if he'll allow me or my Ministry to be crowned by taking the clothes of the word and dressing his bride and he said and the bride she needs little [Music] help huh because there's buttons in the back or whatever in the veil and all of that oh God send us Ministries with true instruction with true leadership with truth and then let us have the right heart oh God if I'm refusing it if I'm rejecting the word I'm refusing to be clothed upon you see how simple it is and then we as the bride we have to sit there brother BR said if God will be gracious to me he allow me to Crown my he he will Crown my Ministry allowing me to take the word of God and clothe the bride so we say Lord here I am [Music] that which is not like you take it away and clothe me Lord cover me that's what Ruth did she covered herself Amen brother Yan
