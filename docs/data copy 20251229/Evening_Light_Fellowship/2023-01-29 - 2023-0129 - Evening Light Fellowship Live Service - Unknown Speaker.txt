me you are faithful oh Lord you are faithful [Music] oh Lord every day and every hour you are faithful oh Lord God bless you all you can be seated if you would good morning everyone it's good to be here uh in my I feel like my second home it's good to be in a place you know you like to walk into a places sometimes you feel a little nervous which we always are and uh but a good drink of the Holy Spirit usually takes care of that you know they say the worldly performers nearly become drunks because every time they get to stand before people you know everyone views the spirit you're a different attraction and when you face them it takes an anointing many times to them it took a bottle or drugs to us it takes the Holy Spirit now once he comes then you don't feel that way and good to be here today and uh with the you know we got a Canadian bench sitting there right there Ryan and Jen and Abby and Noah flew in as well and Kim Nettie good to said he's good to see you there uh that's we need more Canadians here it's always good this is uh I want to sing a little song before we go to the word today and I'm always uh I'm Joy singing it's something that you're born with and uh you know I was when I was grew up a young boy I figured that uh I never did want to be a ball player I would like to play ball or hockey or things like that or be a sports person of some kind but I always wanted to be a singer and then I you'll say my heart out but there's nobody to listen I'm glad the first song I ever sang in from the people was for the Lord I never did start saying until we until I was born again filled with the spirit of God and then the songs are not just songs this Bible holds several chapters of Psalms that David wrote and Jesus referred to them all the scriptures referred to them from time to time they'd pick them out you ever notice how sometimes just when you really needed a Psalm jumps up said oh I remember what David said I walked through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil must have been anointed when he wrote that amen this little song I like it you know we have uh different songs we love and I sure appreciated the choir singing on the different specials Everyone is always expressing the same goal that we have we're trusting it all our roads and everything we do will end up in immortality in a body that we have here we have no continuing City but we keep singing about a city we keep reaching towards the city we keep watching the roads and we always know this song is simply called there are two robes and we're always we recognize that here comes the angel the messenger of this age and begins to take and begin to define those two roads very clearly one is a despised Road not too many people on that one the other one's the broad Road it's full of joy and fills all kinds of excitement here but it's aimed as death one is life one is death one is light one is Darkness and I was saying this and you helped me in the courses if you wish to because we're all a part of that [Music] there are two rules you can take one by side and one by faith take the word of God or what you see what you believe is what will be so set your way to The Winds of faith and you can fly [Music] to a higher place do not struggle it's by Grace set your wings to The Winds of Faith watch your name watch your cry watch your mountain is it much too high just speak the word of God and by and by it will move or you will fly so set your wings to The Winds of faith you can't fly to a higher place do not struggle for it's my faith set your wings to The Winds of faith I like this last verse because it takes it out of our hands foreign [Music] for the power that makes him rise is already [Music] in the sky so set your wings to The Winds of Faith you can fly to a higher place [Music] set your wings to The Winds of Faith oh do not struggle for it's my grace [Applause] set your wings to The Winds of Faith amen amen would you stand with me I want to read a I just want to have a word of Prayer but I'll read a little prayer this morning that I yesterday when I was looking at some of the things you know that we always we've got a tremendous archive we go to and and to get through into the once you get into the message is just a word shall upon word cell everyone just building well I read this little prayer and I love it preach way back in uh oh I didn't get the time yes 1963. brother I am prays and let me let me just pray like this if you bow your heads he's praying at the end of the prayer and he says Lord by your grace your help I claim everyone that hears this message I claim them for God I pray thee Lord both here this morning and those that will hear it on tape and if there'd be a seed anywhere that predestinated Sea Lord to hear the word of this last day may they come now sweetly and humbly and lay their trophies down at the cross or theirselves as the trophy of the grace of God that's called them and may they be filled with the Holy Spirit and display the token of the life of Jesus Christ in his resurrection as long as they remain here on this Earth granted Lord yes and granted Lord this morning that you would continue to bless us and as we walk in some of the places Lord that you want us to move this morning guide my feet hold my hand Bless the people together remember the elect lady Lord not only here but around the world out of every nation Kindred people in tongue how we Rejoice Lord to see the great Holy Spirit move in preparation for Rapture rapturing faith build this Rapture and Faith again this morning we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can be seated thank you brother I think I'll take well you got me hooked up all right good I was always this you know to get a little part that we wish to move into your heart is read or something and then uh move into the the thoughts but uh I would like to take and read a couple of scriptures if you would with me it's always in respect and of course I already had you be seated but uh since I'll I'll be reading a couple of them you just remain seated I think they got they got the I got it on the board I believe I'm gonna read Isaiah and uh I just want to entitle something this morning that was that I you know you hear Brother Brown say some things that strike you and then you go back to the Bible I've always believed this the prophet said Isaiah 45 is you're turning there he said we do not search the scripture to prove whether the prophet's right or wrong we go to read the scripture find out if our understanding is right or wrong we know God the word comes to the prophets we're not here to correct the prophet or sometimes people say well I don't believe it the way he said it that hasn't I don't whether I understand it or not I believe it the way he said it because I believe the word comes to the prophet to a prophet a Seer a word Prophet as we know we under that's under whose wings we are flying to stay and I do not believe I've heard people say well brother Brown was a little wrong there and he was a little wrong there now you all have to remember that the prophet like all prophets they grew in the grace of God as they understood and as the Lord unveiled more I've got just a little bit much treble up here or maybe too much Echo uh I'm sounding maybe I'm very loud I'll try to keep my voice down a little bit but I do believe that that as we understand the scriptures now from and I've been around for a few years now so I know that I've had the blessings of God to have been in this message for 57 years or more and been been you know as a child and nurturing upward yeah just a little less on the on the monitor here yeah the floor monitors but I've seen it develop and you know how the prophet said even his own Ministry he said I used to think remember when he was like in the early years he said I used to think that God loved me but or Jesus loved me but God was my judge and always looked to see if I did something wrong he would condemn me but but Jesus loved me so one day I found out the same one so he said I got a different opinion of who I'm walking with and talking with and a different understanding that just because he changed his mask and the morphid god changed himself to fulfill certain portions of a scripture didn't make a different God the same God all the time under the law all the same God all the way through for four thousand years the same God just changed it in many forms and we're not going to go there but my my thought this morning is from the bosom of God and I I just it yeah you know the prophet makes interesting things but I'll read these scriptures first Isaiah 45 1-8 thus saith the Lord to his anointed pardon me thus saith the Lord to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I have Holden to subdue Nations before him and I will loose his loins of Kings to open before him the two leave Gates and the gates shall not be shut I will go before thee and make the Crooked paths places straight I will break in pieces of the gates of Wrath and cut in sundered the bars of iron and I would give Thee the treasures of darkness and the hidden Riches of secret places that thou mayest know that I the Lord which called thee by thy name am the god of Israel I want you to notice here Cyrus is not even a believer he's a he's a king here now for Jacob my servant's sake and for Israel mine elect I have even called thee by thy name I have surname thee and thou Hast not known me God knew him but he didn't know he didn't know God I am the lord and there is none else and there's no God besides me I girded Thee and thou Hast not known me that they may know from the rising of sun and from the west and there is none beside me I am the lord and there is none else I formed the light and create Darkness I make peace and create evil I the Lord do all these things drop down ye Heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness let the Earth open and let them bring forth salvation and let righteousness spring up together I the Lord have created it I did that as a little background let's turn to Corinthians and I want to just last a couple of weeks well not her brother Ron and brother was the other brother perceived right yeah and they were talking about changing the language and and boy I sure and did enjoy those messages they just were good for me I I like it when it when it's just dovetails the sixth verse and I would I'm choosing just read a little something that brother Ron read here Wednesday night but I'm not going to take that thought but I'm just dropping in for a little uh background here before I open my thought now verse 6 of First Corinthians the 14th chapter verse 6. now Brethren if I come unto you speaking with tongues and I shall profit what shall I profit you except I speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophecy or by Doctrine and I want to read those again except I speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge not man's knowledge but God's knowledge not Prophecies of my own thoughts but the actual word or by Doctrine and even things without life-giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or heart and we are very much familiar in life that there are so many things that have to be that way that in music for instance you notice that unless you strike an exact note of what is the sheet music the people won't know what song you're playing and uh for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle so like was he accept ye utter by the Tongue words easy to be understood that's good for all of us how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice I shall be unto him that speaketh the Barbarian and he speak it shall be a barbarian unto me even so ye for as much as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that she may excel in edifying of the church I want to just take that and use the part that that uh in conjunction with my thoughts here this morning is that all the things that God has done and is doing are all his thoughts expressed none other there's is there any great is there evil it's not the there's none else that is in charge God is supremely in charge of all things sometimes we get excited and we say oh it's going too long now I have to confess and I I I'll just let down my hair a little bit you know how it is we all have had our images of what we thought how this age would end uh brother Mike you've been around as long as I have and uh we were then the part of the last part of brother Bam's Ministry and uh so when the prophet off the scene and we heard the last part of his ministry for the last well 63 to 65. you ever listened to those everyone he ends with such urgency that we are about ready to walk off the earth without dying he just everything that he that he speaks that was a this is not working Utah oh really but everything that he said he was pointing to a a closing off of an era a finishing of civilization or of the book of redemption how that the redeeming part of God's great work that he's done for six thousand years of bringing man taken from the first part of the first time he slew an animal to cover man's Sin from that time he has labored and labored and brought himself and each time he did he expressing himself what's in him and who was in him not only what was in him but who was in it and where we come from and why we're here what are we doing here and that's always expressed that always excitement then I hear Brother Brown he's talked about yeah you know the the time when he's talking about the the uh the Dew Drop and said oh it's such a simple little thought but let me just read you something you've read it no doubt but uh I'm gonna get my notes yes um program says this in a little message called birth pains and he's talking to the assembly concerning some of the important things he said like a little Dew Drop where we take it so for granted he said but but what's the formula I said I'm I'm not a scientist it might just be a something like a congelling of group of atmosphere come together in a dark night and it falls on the earth and when it does it's born in the night but in the morning it lays there cold and shivering on a little blade of grass or hanging off the clothesline but just let the sun shine out once now there's a great message you could go in the morning get one of the greatest messages you could ever hear watch the dewfall watch it disappear where did it come from and where did it go to these are all that's that's just what I thought see too simple the prophet said most of the time our struggle is not to get through to God as we're not simply enough oh said but I we need to study in certain and that makes the weariness of the Mind much study makes a wish you study and you study and unless it's by Revelation it'll never dovetail you'll come up to blockage after blockage and you find it and refine this around this message not just because we listen to the message of the tapes do we have a revelation there's a many a person that listens to the message maybe on a good average point that doesn't mean that they have a revelation of God as it's devastating together you that or there wouldn't be any different doctrines if everyone could understand the message the moment they listened to it then it wouldn't be by revelation but it's up to God to reveal to whom he will and he does it that way listen to the little part that's where I got my I want to draw my text a little bit if I can then it then what but watch in the morning are they shivering and look like hang in there but just let the Sun get out once did you notice how happy it gets it just glistens and quivers why it knows that it's that sunlight is going to draw it back to where it was in the beginning now just watch what's what's what's this message all about to us it's drawing us back to where we were in the beginning it's drawing us back it tells you first thing you know when I heard brother by him say I'm not the son of Ella Branham Mom and Dad Charles and Ella Branham said I am a Son of God from the bosom of God and now manifest said we bypass the orphanage come directly to be tempted and tested here but it was his purpose that way now you know when Melchizedek was on Earth and uh when you know Elohim came to uh offer Abraham came to Abraham and said to him I'm going to keep my word to you now you're going to have that child you know the story brother bam talked about you know he could have right then give his life for the atoneer of sin he was a man he ate bread drank the milk had buttermilk brother Brown said sat down talk with Abram they cooked for him and he could have done right then he was in a human body but sin didn't come that way sin came through the womb and by relationship and he had to come the same way in order to cover that sin he couldn't come as God he had to come as man but it's all the time the same one wasn't a different one oh my listen how he finishes here why see oh it's so happy and everything and so is every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God there's something about it when light spreads over us and that that we're happy because we know that we're coming back to where we come from from the bosom of God we come back from the heart the soul of God we come back where we where we left off we we didn't know that we come from there until the Holy Spirit quickened us and made us a new creature in the book of Hebrews a little message the Hebrews that brother Brown takes uncovers some of these things so beautifully and anybody that's uh a study of the messages of the book of Hebrews they've been some of the most anchored how to Anchor the church and how to conduct ourselves how to can take care of things and as pastors know I went back to it many of the times and read it over again it wasn't the troubles come in churches or in the homes or what do you you go back to those book of Hebrews you find out God answers the questions of how to conduct ourselves and how to bring and how to be successfully walking with the Lord and keep sin out of the church out of the people and how to keep people on track with God Hebrews is one of the strongest areas out now others simply made it Greater but brother I'm talking a little about here said in the paragraph 590 and I want to take a little time on this if I can kind of my base he said in the veil he's talking about the human Veil he's reading um and I'll read this too Hebrews the sixth chapter we should give strong consolation who have fled for Refuge shall lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul the hope the sworn oath of God we have as an anchor to the soul both sure and steadfast which entereth into that which is within the Veil he said let me just I might pass that the other day said let me just speak a little on the Veil The Veil is the flesh the veil is what keeps us from seeing God as a Sunday good Sunday school lesson here the veil is what keeps us from seeing God face to face in his church the veil is what keeps us from seeing the Angels at their position this morning can you see your angel I can't see mine but I know he's there how do I know he said so the veil is what keeps us from seeing him we are hid behind a veil and that Veil is the flesh we are Sons and Daughters of God we're in the presence of God the angels of God on camped around bounce that then fear him we're in the presence of God all the time because he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you but not only will I be with you but I'll be in you I'll be with you even unto the end but the veil of the flesh is what keeps us out of his presence but through the Soul and Spirit by our faith we know that he's watching us he is standing by here he's here now then he goes on to tell a little story about Nathan and and you know how and the syrians had him surrounded in the crumbs cry he said oh you were surrounded and uh tells a story about how you Hazel I was so excited and and Elijah said Lord just open his eyes and but they were the same one was a prophet I don't know if he saw him but he knew they were there but he said now I see them because I'm looking at the promised word and I know he said he'd never leave anybody even my physical eyes don't see him but I know he said it now if we could see every promise like that I'm talking to myself when you're sick if you see yourself already well now that's what brother Ram says he said if you're sick just Ari look at the promise say I'm I'm already well if you've got a need in something something you're going through some battle you're going already see it finished look if you're walking today and don't see it are a finished product that you've passed from death into life and you're just carrying out the will of God here in this life go look again look again find out it's there let him open your understanding your Revelation to you one time that you come from him and you're here on his on his journey you're here for purpose oh my God I need now here let me paragraph uh 596. here it is hold it tight the veil is what keeps us from living the way we should do you ever feel that way I wish I could live a better life for the Lord I wish I could be all the time so near with the Lord but let me drop a little something here that might help you in our present condition we can only take so much of God you know you've got to get up in the morning go to work your wife has to do things and your children have to go places well you have to leave him because you have to go and do your work many times you'd get pretty lonely but as long as this flashes that's why he gives us the Holy Ghost just a lick of Fire a tongues of Fire just enough to be the earnest the down payment the overcoming power above sin and unbelief and the only sin there really is is unbelief all the other things are just attributes of unbelief people you know sometimes say well I got this happen I got just get in Christ one time let it fill you with the Holy Ghost The Habit will fall never have to worry about things falling off uh just let get into Christ and many times we get into the place where we're trying to solve how to get rid of the things without getting into Christ how to solve the problems in this church without the Holy Ghost doing it but the Holy Ghost will always work by the word just put them in put them in his place it'll accomplish what he sets it forth if God ever speaks anything it must come to pass just that way he cannot he cannot change his mind you know he's never had a better thought that always makes me feel good sometimes saying Lord I wish I was like soon so I was like this but it pleases him to be what you are and never let jealousy or count it out to get to the place to where you it would it hinders you just be who you are God loves you the best of course the worst thing we ever do is when we start copying then we see what we got in Hollywood here today everybody wants to act what somebody else is doing the actors want to play other people's parts until almost they get to feeling like they are the other people but they're still only acting see Christians don't act when you're born of the spirit of God we walk in the light for we are the lies listen how it continues here a little bit I I and uh because the Veil is what keeps us from doing the things that we want to do and God became veiled in flesh and the veil was torn in two and God became God again and it raised up the Veil that he hid himself in that's the resurrection of the Lord Jesus prove to us that in this Veil that we're living now today by faith we believe it and accept it and when this Veil is torn into I'll go in the presence of with the Assurance knowing that I know that my I know him in the power of Israel his resurrection at the coming of the Lord Jesus this Veil will be raised up again in Perfection way till I'll walk and I'll talk with him as my savior and my God we'll need a new body we'll need a new body to fellowship with him the way that we really are made to do but here we have the down payment of it and we walk in this and I I just want to let you know see when God was took himself even when he came you remember how when he when Paul on the way to the Masters to arrest the Christians and when he got struck down as we know the story real well when he got struck down by the pillar of fire he asked the question Lord who are you because he Jesus is the one he was persecuting but when he said the voice said I am Jesus he'd gone back to being God again but he was he already redeemed his work was finished on Earth he went back to being God again and when come and met him in the pillar of fire and when he went back to me and God again Paul said who are you said I'm Jesus and that now that shook up the whole itinerary that Paul had because everything that he ever learned about God everything had ever started and searched out now the very one he was persecuting was the one in the standard performed as a light now he got to know him by revelation and he didn't leave until he knew that he'd take the old and the new together and went away and studied it and and didn't study it by his mind he went to the Lord said Lord reveal this to me make it real to me you mean I came from you and now I'm here on Earth as your attribute yeah that's what I'm trying to tell you why did you believe it when you heard it why was there something inside of you that struck you there's another person sitting right next to you said I didn't see anything uh you could be right sounds good sounds reasonable but something inside of you stopped you in your tracks and changed your whole life around it altered my whole life always had plans of what I wanted to be last thing I want to be as a preacher I hated public speaking oh it was the worst thing if I'd go clean out the barn any day I had a day that just that but public speaking oh I was dreaded those things in school little did I realize never even thought of never even gave it a thought some people say oh I always wanted to be a preacher person I'd be lying if I said that I'd want to be a farmer I want to be anything else I want a Rancher a cowboy anything a singer or anything but I didn't want to be a preacher and now for 60 years 58 I've been behind the pulpit preaching the Good News it's good news to me and we'll live it goes on we live forever let me just drop past a little bit I need to finish that last part there in the present Assurance I know I'm in the power of his resurrection at the coming of the Lord Jesus this Veil will be raised up again in a perfected way till I'll walk and I'll talk with him as Savior and my God when he takes the Throne of David now we were talking a while ago about coming back here in the millennium then we'll walk and we'll talk with him because our bodies will be changed and we live forever in this Veil after it's been perfected but this veil has sin in it it doesn't matter I don't never think you'll be glorified body in this earth it's got to die same as your soul had to die to be born again and so many times and I want to just assure you and it's not not to assure you that go ahead you know well I I I want to do certain things but I feel they're wrong to do them you always will have that that's the that's the holy spirit in their telling you where to walk where not to walk and there's a little National part here uh it's kind of very simple but it's beautiful to me because I want your kids too too great uh I it leaves me but in the perfection he's talking about Hebrew said now let's walk away from let's go on to Perfection laying not laying again the foundation of laying on of hands and baptism so but now let's go on to the level where we know where we come from why we're here well let's go on to Perfection where you see who's doing the work and who's in control of the work that we're not in control say you got a nice congregation here but you've come in from everywhere and anywhere you're probably having people crossing the streets here to get here they could fill this whole place up three times if they would just come locally but you come from the East and the West the North and the South you've moved in you moved out everywhere you go to it's the same because it's by-election by the grace of God he calls me will but Perfection he said it's not eating meats and doing things in Perfection of the body you'll never have it and you've got to quit this and you've got to do this you've got to do that and do this that's law that's legalism we don't believe in the legal forms of Salvation no sir I don't We Believe it that by Grace we are saved and it's not you you have nothing to do with it it's God elected that does it God's election does it no man can come to me except my father draws them first all right that's all all Jesus come to do was to get those that the father foreknew and predestinated them before the foundation of the world to become the Sons and Daughters of God the very word that most religious hate is the predestination word of God makes us rejoice so real you know that you couldn't come unless God do you it's impossible for you to even come unless God draws you and if God draws you who's going to keep you from us amen not him that willeth or run it or him that willeth but God that short Mercy now I want to say that I don't think there was too many of us who are looking for God I wasn't and I'm you know I'm 80 now but I I was 18 and 16 too so when I was 16 and 18 uh I believed in God absolutely because I believe the Bible I don't know why but it's always something my parents read the Bible all the time they were Christians but I didn't realize that they were praying the way they were because you know you need a lot between 16 and 20. it's a bit of a rough area because your hormones start paying tricks on you and the only thing you see is some pretty girls somewhere and it's a fact or the loudest Muffler car or something like that you know this most powerful man I that that's what I wanted that's what I did and there's a little testimony but I say that until I found the right little lady who's sitting back there right now that we're married 60 years when I when I found that one suddenly the cars and everything started taking second second fiddle first thing you know they didn't mean quite as much and then the first baby come along and they met even less then the second one the third one then I wish I had something different and then the fourth one topped it all off and now that made us pop on Mama now we're now we're a great great yeah great grandparents are great grandparents and um well at least a great grandmother and she's always great I didn't mean that just to say that I really mean that you can't be married to somebody for 60 years and put up with you you know everything that you are and still smiles and says I love you Just the Way You Are by November time I was talking to a couple you know during the last 45 years or as pastoring and 40. years you run into a lot of things that you don't talk all about but you you realize there's been many times and you come up to a a dead end and you unless you find the answer there's going to be a separation and uh I remember one time talking to a couple and I don't get too personal because I got some of my own congregation sitting here so but uh but there was a case a situation that that where she was trying to change her husband with everything that she had in her and I was talking after a while I began to notice that everything was about he needed to change he needs to change and I I finally I said now when you married him did you marry him with that in mind she said yes I said oh you're going to have trouble you started wrong to begin with that's what it is many times the problem with Christians is when they become a Christian they begin to read the Bible to change the meaning of the Bible to fit their desire to fit their conditions to fit their desires and their wants in life they want that they're trying to take they're trying to take this message and you find many times you talk to people that have a problem they're trying to shift the message so it'll fit their conditions and they never get Beyond it they stay there year after year and that's exactly what happens they pretty soon they have a shifted understanding of the word of God and it's not home sweet home anymore now I know we all have that we all like to see our spouse be a little different than we think well I didn't think it would be this bad I didn't think it would like that but a lot of it depends your attitude on it I find that also true your attitude towards the condition in God's word and many times we find ourselves when we're sick or unneed we get our place as a family and all of a sudden we meet a crisis you know it's that time that you don't want to change the word of God at that time that you want to say Lord God I want to believe it just the way you said it because I know it won't work unless it comes exactly the way you said it and meant it because if you claim anything contrary to the word of God you can run as far as you will it'll still meet you right there you've got to come back to where we left it if we get away from how many times have we backslid we buy you know we we know that we backside every day the prophet said why is it that every day we say Lord forgive me my trespasses even when I forgive those that trespass against me you can't go to bed at night or get up in the morning but would you think of Lord here's a new day Keep Me From Evil keep me from harm you haven't even got to the bathroom and already a thought will strike you where did that come from you're in a spirit world but let me just show you not him that runs him that willeth I'll hurry with this quickly I don't want to see it and haven't but here's what I like there's nothing not a thing in the world you did God by Grace save you and not you yourself if you do then you've got something to brag about well I tell you what bragging rights are pretty low and among our as we as believers because you're believing a message that is literally turning the hearts of the children back to the mind of God to literally walk off of the earth without dying you're the one people the one people that no other ages had the privilege of staying to that place for all other ages of falling asleep and I don't know we might many of us might fall asleep yet as we have but we'll be up first anyhow so then don't worry about that brother Mike we'll be up first if we go before anybody we'll be up first that's what the prophet said I'm that's why I believe the prophet's going back people say oh he's coming back yeah I believe that too I believe we'll stand with them too I believe we will be gathered around the inspiration of the of the voice of this last age for that voice carried right clear up into the millennium absolutely I believe that with all my heart there's many other ideas about that he has to come back and finish this and finish that and finish that but I have to confess myself I believe Rapture and condition and rapturing Faith lays on the tapes not on the tape in the voice of the age it lays there when it strikes you it settles the question listen here there's no Bragging all Praises goes to him it's him then he gives you that sure hope sworn by an oath of the impossibility for his children to ever be lost I said it goes on talking a little bit here and you know this paragraph nine five he goes on talk about making mistakes and so on he said now you'll make mistakes sin has passed from you but listen you'll make mistakes but he said God God will not get let's get by how many made mistakes in his life and you know God didn't let you get by with it oh yeah get ahead of God or get behind God I'd rather be behind God than ahead of him because I might be able to catch up but I'll tell you one thing you get ahead ahead of God and you get in trouble and even I heard brother Brown say last night did a little message you said I'm preaching here right now standing in that kind of condition where I've been ahead of God God told me to do a certain thing and I didn't do it he said I've been suffering and struggling here now for months on this he said and until I get that thing off my back until I go make the thing right you know when he went to India instead of Africa and the Lord took him aside and said I told you to go after the first I believe it was and they said oh but India is ready for it he said now listen to them he said and he told me distinctly before and give me Visions at all how the meetings would go he said I bypassed it he said and I have struggled he said I'm standing in the Pulpit right now I'm paying for it right now oh yes but that hasn't got one thing to do with your soul no sir listen he goes on saying now even our children he goes to the other part here see even our children when they're wrong and sometimes you've got to take them and take them behind the the barn as I remember my we had some of the best education we had out behind the barn I wasn't a fool no siree and I know my dad when he meant something my dad wasn't the one that counted not son if you do that one more time one two two and a half three my dad didn't count if you said men don't go do it usually didn't say go do it he said run and do it it meant exactly that it meant that today parents are struggling with the children to give them understanding what it means don't do that it means count to three hello counting is different than doing it do it and sometimes the hardest education and you know we got all the things we got politics and everything telling us don't even touch the children always said it'll it'll stunt their natural growth spiritual growth oh don't touch them well you you get around the word of God and you you broke the greatest promise there is train up a child in the way it's so cool and when it's old it'll not depart from it who will not depart from it the Holy Ghost will not depart from it because you've trained him by the word brother Bamford doesn't mean that the person won't get away but said God won't get away I got a daughter like that right now she's already 50 years old or more I'm still claiming this I got grandchildren coming I claiming it lay it right there thank God every day for the promise that I believe the promise you and your Offspring will be there but listen what I said certainly you'll make mistakes but still you're a child it's impossible for that man to ever be gone again that's once been born of eternal life God is not an Indian giver he that Hearth my word and believeth in him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never come into judgment but his past from death into life and I'll raise him up in the last day that's God's promise now if you go and say oh well then I'll just uh say I always do what I want to do but if you're a Christian you don't want to do the things that's wrong that's a good one to labor on a little bit that's the one thing the Holy Ghost takes from you is to want to that portion of the Holy Ghost when he comes into you takes the want to the sin to disbelieve God's word it takes to want to out you'll still be tested and tried in every way but to want to they want to but listen what he says it goes him a little further sometimes we get we condemn ourselves so much because we struggle with certain things we battle with certain things and especially as we're younger we think well we've got much hope because I'm still bothered with sir they're very natural things that you're bothering only train them rightly it is it is a fact that they that the desire of a man is to find a wife and vice versa but go about it God's way commit thy way to the Lord and he'll get you the right one that you won't have to sign divorce papers down the road because he didn't give God doesn't give marriages that just last for a season is till death do us part I like that he said but you don't want to do wrong he said but if you're a Christian you don't want to do wrong you don't want to do things that's wrong because the very life in you the very Fountain if you want to do wrong it shows that that shows that wrong thing is in here how can a bitter and a sweet Spirit or water come from the same Fountain so you've been all mixed up he said maybe buy some emotion or something something like that but forget it just go back to the altar of God hinteth what I like take God and say God take my old sinful life away and put put me in such a condition that my whole desire he that's born of God does not commit sin that's it he has no desire to do so certainly the devil will trap you here and there but not willingly the Bible says so the devil will trap now here and then say then I tried to throw the Trap uh he tries to throw this apartment he tried to throw the trap on Jesus he did it on Moses he caught him did on Peter he caught him but generous one he did it on Jesus he didn't catch him because he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was our defense amen and caught him he did that and Peter even denied him and then he went and wept bitterly there was something in him that's the something we like to talk about all the time what makes you repent last quote him when the dove was turned out of the Ark the crow went out and called around he was in the art all right but when he went out his nature was different he could eat at the old dead carcass and he wanted to and be satisfied see he was a crow to begin with he was a scavenger he was no good he was a hypocrite why did he have him there he's the designer he's got everything made in its place he could fly anywhere the dove could fly and can eat what the dove could eat but the dove couldn't eat what he eat for the dove is a different makeup she's a different make she's a dove and the dove cannot digest rotten rotten food because it doesn't have a goal see the dove could fly out and they they Crow could fly to the same place it goes on a little further if you want to read that but he said if the dove accidentally dropped on a dead carcass said quickly it would leave and sometimes we drop down on a dead carcass but it is a fact that God in Christ are one it is a fact that God cannot if that desire of God is in you and you drop on some sinful thing sometimes unawares brother bam said you might he goes on to talk a little bit more he said you might go into a bar room sometime and quickly you realize oh what am I doing here you might go to some place sometimes where you often you find yourself in a condition that what oh my and quickly you get out of there why because it's that nature inside that holds to God's word see there are there are certain conditions and uh sometimes you know you you realize we are we're in the greatest battle has ever been fought by mankind yet we feel at times we feel quite at home say well we're like young people you've got your wife and family you're building your homes on brother bam said go on write it go on right on building do it do what you can what you do but never lose sight that the Rapture might be in the morning you're always we were coming home some time ago and this is just how sometimes God picks things up and just makes them makes them harmonious make sure they start dovetailing and uh I was uh driving along and Irene was a bit dozing we've been driving quite a while and so I I was uh I just stay awake I started singing quietly I said it shall be light about the evening time start singing the path to Glory you will surely find listen to the words of the song The Prophet sang so casually it shall be light about the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find in the Waterway is the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus Christ see the whole formula in one short little song young and old repent of all your sins the Holy Ghost will surely enter in for the evening light is come it is a fact that God and Christ are one then I kind of like a broken record I said it is a fact that God in Christ are one it is the fact that God and Christ it is a fact it is a fact that God in Christ on it is a fact that the seventh angel has sounded his message it is a fact that Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new it is a fact that there's a bride on the Earth right now she's word sell to word self to word shall she's taken on the word it is a fact that God is doing the work and no man is over her it is a fact that she has one head over that's the revealed Vindicated word for this hour it's the Vindication it is a fact that all the things that God's promises take past right now it is a fact that everything is done and the fact means it's something that's already done it is a fact is not going to be he's not going to add to it there's not going to be another messenger come up it is a fact that rapturing Faith lays in his Souls of people this very morning you're a human you walk right through the same you plow the same soul that the rest of them do but you're different people you're a new makeup God is quick and you made you alive you can never be a part of the world anymore it's impossible and I'm not saying that everyone's here but I pray that everyone will take that step and you young people don't worry about the things sometimes you feel like you've got problems and things like that that's good for you it it shakes you down makes you realize you either stand I've been there where you shook down so bad you think Lord God you've forsaken me Oh no just sometimes a little quieter a little longer because he wants to know how sincere you are but when you let down say Lord God whatever it takes to do thy will that's what I'll do whatever it takes bring me to that place no matter what the world thinks and what anybody thinks now when you die to yourself that's when you become alive in Christ because you cannot live until you die first there's no Resurrection unless there's a death first sometimes you wonder when you think of God why did he do it the way he did his whole purpose I love what the prophet said you know the people say oh predestination of that if that's the case he said then who can come who can you can't unless God calls you that's the gospel no man can come to me except my father draws him first so I don't like that God's not going to change his word for anybody see because he's the author and the finisher look at how he acted in this day so humbly so simply he sends a messenger and and calls around the world and sends a message have you I know you have but isn't it glorious how when the prophet went off the scene this message was hardly in any country in 1956 and prior brother Brown said oh he said if I could have just had preachers over there at that time that I could have said in order said but every one of those people 25 000 in one meeting and everyone gave their heart to the Lord and they they threw the idols and burnt them and and claimed that Jesus Christ was the god that they were going to follow all their Idols their heathens Idols they they destroyed them and burnt them he said well what happened they just drifted right back there was nobody to teach them and to lead them but you know what the last 50 years has done look at around the world I've been there there is churches message churches that believe in this message around the world they've got the tapes they got the books they're craving they're still craving for more books and so on they'll never be an answer to that craving because we'll never meet it all together but there's a bride around the world and and and we here in this nation we are here in this in in this well where the message came from you know what the prophet said and we'll be go we'll go right on plugging along sometimes until all the rest of the seeds around the world has come to maturity sometimes say oh there's going to be a Revival in the emotional Revival things like that going I tell you what I've been a Revival for 50 years this message revives me revives me revives me all the time I get away from it for a while and it revives me again pulls me back again and it never leaves it's just for glory to glory to glory but it always becomes more precious every time it revives said oh now I know I had to go through that Valley to get up to this mountain I see it different here now from glory to glory to glory and just keep on walking Keep On Walking and that the truth but like that's the truth I've been there where sometimes you think oh this doesn't seem to dovetail but wait a little while yeah just wait a little while just be patient with the Lord first thing you know it begins to fit in exactly why are you here in this area I'm telling my wife you know sometimes we come here and I've come here since 1969. when brother green had the first international meeting in Tucson and the Believers came and sang For the First Time in 1969 December meetings the first time we ever had an opportunity to sing to elect lady which we didn't even understand at the time you know when recently and I always wanted to sing it was something I wanted to do you know how God does things so sovereignty the first thing you know he said oh we've already done it oh I didn't know I didn't know we were doing it and I give a little testimony you know brother Brown said in 1949 when he was in Saskatchewan he went to Prince Albert 1956 pardon me and he was in Prince Albert and brother Ram was was preaching and then notice how the people there it was he called it the end of the world and from here and it's just Arctic well the roads have gotten further north now but but it's not the end of the world it's just the end of part of the world but when he talked over there he's like he's talking about all said these people like to sold their cow to get to the meetings they they said talk about sincerity and it begins to encourage them he said if you if you will take God at his word here he's speaking to the local people he said if you'll take God at his word said you're going to see a Saskatchewan Revival strike Saskatchewan that the people will come from around the world to see the Saskatchewan Revival now that means a little bit to me because I make that personal I live in Saskatchewan I want to be a part of that Revival first thing you know I found out I was a part of the Revival oh it's already gone yeah do you know what from 1970 to 1980 we had about 10 years of camp meeting every year and during those years I saw ministers come from every part of the world I mean every part of the world from Africa India New Zealand Australia Europe everywhere they came from around the world to see the Saskatchewan Revival later on another Minister coming to that area and I'm not criticizing I'm just saying you know hey one day he's he he's LED is led into that area and now everything's overrated it's now it's in the 2000s above that come in the area and and uh he's thinking about he's going to be a real revivalist in the area and strike the whole things and bring it back to what it was make sure and he ran across this quote and he's talking to preacher said oh there's going to be a Revival here in Saskatchewan they're going to come from all over the world to see it and I looked at him one day and I said you know what Sarah said uh that's good thinking but it says sorry pass said what do you mean I said you're looking at the Saskatchewan Revival I am the Welsh Revival I was the one that was born there I remember my dad getting for the first time and took the tapes home and started listening to tapes in 1957. we knew nothing about a messy we knew we just knew about Divine Healing but Dad took the tapes something inside of him struck and said it's got to be it's different than what I've heard till now we heard brother Bama in 1957 when he was when he was there for the meetings I was 15 years old young fella but I know from that time on something changed in our home or we didn't say big mountains and Thunders and Lightnings but little by little one seed was sewn another tape another book another message first thing you know it became the talk then it became a Revival and I began to see every Sunday and brother got there there's only three three four families and brother Gunther he started preaching what little he knew what little he'd read he'd take a little part we still didn't know it was a prophet but on a Revival began to break out and and in the village there's only one Village North of Saskatoon for 50 square miles and in that one little village the angel of the Lord touched down never struck another Village even to this very day not one more Village but that little village and saved about the half of the village and from out of that come a Revival that that up to 300 people and I remember at camp and he was up to 700 people all the way from uh all the way America brother green of course came as one and brother Vale came the different man at those time those times we all played in the same sandbox you know if you mention the name you're a prophet if you believe William Brown was a prophet said amen it didn't matter what they were you know all the brothers from here you know wherever you went to your brothers was until after the prophet off the scene we all started getting our own idea well I think he meant that no oh you weren't there I was there look I wasn't there when Jesus died but I believe it I wasn't there when Noah was there I wasn't there but I believe every one of those words just the way they're written I wasn't there many times but the one thing I was there when I saw the Revival being poured out and begin one after another began to get saved one by one be God begin to do things and and begin to you know it wasn't just we were all married at that time now remember we know nothing about the message when I married my wife we were both what we call nominal Christians I was 19 and she was 20 oh pardon me uh she would yeah well we were about the same age but so I had to look up to her a little bit well when we got married and this is just something I say to the glory of God you know God knows how how to make himself known to anyone and if you're a seed of God he knows just how to how to make it known to you what came to me this way and that's why brother Ram said I don't tell my experiences too much because people think the way I got it that you have to get it that same way oh no no he gives it sovereignty the way he wants to you're all different he gives it to you a different way and when he seals you into the kingdom you'll be a different emotional person you might be one's real high one's real low oh well that fella gets way too excited he doesn't get excited enough what's that got to do with it that's merely an expression you know what if you gave come up here and say drop down to give me a million dollars I wouldn't care how the fellow was dressed what he looked like what is what color he was would make any difference what had a degree uh what no matter what he was if he laid on a million dollars and gave it to me and I needed it I'd say well that's nice thank you very much are you kidding most of us Yahoo oh yeah and it's just a natural thing but you know what there was a million dollars just the same just the same that's why you never look at somebody else say well he acts this way she acts that way just let him act the way they want to act just be that way I don't know why God put my wife and I together but I know now I didn't know them you know what is love you don't know it was attraction yes could have been all it was but one day when we started walking together and the message begin to take a hold and I I'm taking too much time I'll I'll what's that time save there oh it's midnight already yeah but I got to give this testimony because the glory of God and make me you know it makes a minister so happy to see God do a miracle in your home that no one else can do now if you get sick and go to a doctor and maybe he can operate and then God still has to do the healing but who's going to heal the soul what school could you go to to give an operation on your soul today is give me give me eternal life there is one school it's called the school of God that he takes us and reveals himself to whom he will my wife was a good wife as she is the best one there is or I would have found someone else she's the best one doing this for me and we were we were happily married and the message began to I started just started listening to the message the tapes and we got a tape recorder we moved in and we made home and uh first thing you know for about three years first baby came and I kept listening the more I listened the more I began to put on you know the word began to put it on more and more I look at her I said you know what honey you're just thinking about cutting hair said you know you're going to stop cutting your hairs it's not right you know how the legalism and I'm sure I was pretty legal legally right but illegally by the Holy Spirit but I said you know what I think it's right I don't believe you should cut your hair she said all right and I think those pants those shorts they're gonna have to go yeah all right all right one by one she did them became subject but I knew it was never real to her when she'd hear she was well she was kind of excuse me honey but she she was a little more educated so when brother RAM used the Hanks and the totes and things like that well it you know it didn't sound so good but one day by The Sovereign Grace of God in 1965 when I was in brother Ram's meetings marriage and divorce series I was sitting oh well the Mark I was sitting about that far away as you are from brother Brandon when he's speaking and it was the series of this days of scripture were filled who was this melchized marriage and divorce and one night to one time you know in those meetings brother Brown didn't have prayer lines or may pray he just spent a little time on discernment a little bit and then he would take him off the off because he was preaching those series he didn't take time for The Healing Ministry well he when he asked us one night to pray I said oh this is the night the Lord's going to speak to me I was so sure that he speak to me he did speak to me but he didn't do it right then he heard my prayer but the prophet didn't speak back to me but if we left those meetings went home and shared with the family you know what God had done and so on all excited and and Christmas Day when the day that brother Brown died we got a phone call and and we were her the in-laws and phone rang and uh said it's for you meno and I took the phone and said uh my brother-in-law called and said uh brother Brown just died well you know brother Mike were you around during the time how many how many ever heard was anybody in brother Brown's meetings here oh yeah yeah good good good good well that's close enough in spirit he was that's good well well when we were when we were when we went to bed that night I said no you know honey I hope we see you tomorrow morning I already do because we believe that when the prophet went we were gone I might as well just confess it I did I said we're going you know and God in Sovereign Grace I can say this we had one of those prayer meetings you know the where God comes on the scene where he came on the scene that evening by the morning when we had come through and I won't go into detail but by the time we come through that in the morning when we headed home we briefly touched on these things and went by and that following week I think within one week I had to go to work that afternoon and and she was doing the ironing and she'd just give me some lunch and I was leaving around 3 30 to go to work working shift work and she said emotion she looked at me said honey I need to be re-baptized she was baptized I was in the titles of father son Holy Ghost and you know the water is a little hard in February in Canada so it was it was very very needful and she I said do you mean that she said with all my heart said I want to be baptized in the name of the father son Holy Ghost so I said all right I went off to work I said praying the Lord and where we're going to get water to baptize and we didn't know where we're going and we started talking and then we start Brothers we started talking one of my brother-in-law said you know what why don't we go to Jeffersonville I said oh that sounds good you're at that time everything was there in Jeffersonville now I don't condemn Jeffersonville any difference still the same place but God doesn't live in Jeffersonville or in Phoenix he lives in his people and he's got them around the world and there's no headquarters that God has but Christ himself and this Angel of the lord well we went over there and I I've got five more minutes there had been some confusion in the baptism somebody had come along and and uh the pastor at that time brother Gunther was he's a Believer they believed it all we knew that wasn't the titles but we didn't know the revelation of Father Son and Holy Spirit so one time in the course of baptism he was baptizing and there was a brother that said he was so excited he just heard the truth said oh he said today he said he said I'm going to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he would just move it all over and one of the brothers said I wonder if one wonderful so we get down to the river and brother Gunther takes him in the water and when he's baptized him he said I baptize you in the name of the Lord with a brother that that went down he all he heard was the Lord he thought it was the Lord Jesus Christ all he heard was Lord he comes out he's excited and the brother on the bank said Oh my he said I wanted to stop the pastor I said no no you didn't do it right do it again foreign and uh but he said I didn't have the nerve I felt so I felt so bad so we're sitting there that night in Jeffersonville Indiana Irene's going to be baptized the next next day and uh and big snowstorms coming into Jeffersonville so oh my so that service was canceled but we we got there that evening I believe it was and uh while we're sitting there that night one you know how God works in mysterious ways one of the brothers said brother Walter Rose by his name he said by the way brother man how were you baptized well I said what do you mean I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said did you hear it Wally well I think I did you mean and then he started telling me what happened he told me I'd never noticed it till then he said oh yes I've noticed and said then I talked to the pastor about it said I I don't believe it's right he should be baptized in the name which is the Lord Jesus Christ well I said absolutely now I'll get this now I'm listening to him and I said wow he said are you sure I said you know what no sir I am no longer sure you just put a doubt in my heart now that isn't of the Lord now you know you can't get any further than that doubt and I said you know what I ha I don't know I said but I'll find out I said I'm going to go to prayer tonight when we go to our room we went to our room we Nelson prayed Irene and I she was going to be baptized and my sister and my brother-in-law and brother Walter and sister Marlene they were the six of us we traveled all the way to Jeffersonville and uh to be baptized for just for her so we went to the room and I prayed and I knew right there I had been seeking the Holy Ghost I was just a young Christian I knew I wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost you know when I was in the service I knew oh I said no I got it I got it now next day I made my mistake oh I guess I don't have it anymore oh I guess I lost it oh Lord give me the Holy Ghost sometimes we pray that way because we're not quite sure and I went and we prayed and I said Lord God that's simple we'll get this real quickly we'll settle it Lord now that I have a doubt we're going to take that doubt away first I told my wife I said I'm I'm baptizing too but we didn't say anything but we've talked to the six of us so we get there and brother Neville is in the in the pulpit and has come to the end of the service and brother Neville uh a godly man I just loved him and he said now we hope some candidates for baptism real soft like I said how many is there and all six of us got up I looked at them they looked at me yeah you too yeah me too all right brother man and brother wheeler baptized Irene and I and the rest of them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ well I knew I was a candidate for the Holy Ghost after that as in now Satan you've lost and here come the Holy Spirit absolutely filled me with the Holy Ghost I tell you what when we come out of that water and I say this between Jeffersonville and Indianapolis how far is that Brother John foreign I don't know who did the driving but all six of us were so in the spirit we shouted we sang We screamed and I announced my own brother-in-law he was driving he had both hands in the air I don't know what happened but we slowed down for Indianapolis everything God got quiet but everyone was filled with the Holy Ghost when he come out of there and I and I know from that time from that time Satan had lost the battle okay and when God made it real to her it also triggered something to me and settle it when we come back home now you now you know what happens I'm a pastor now and usually when where the wind reaches the storm it reaches home before you get there and uh it before we even got home now someone had not even baptized yet at all in those days you know it was just to try out some of you Elders know what I'm talking about some are holding on and said well I I think I write I had the Holy Ghost and I spoke in tongues I believe I got it and uh somebody got home and told one told the village we lived in the city about 30 miles away and so we were going to go there for the weekend so when we by the time we come home the village already brother Gunther and the deacons they already knew that we had come up with a new baptism all this false Doctrine coming in went to Jeffersonville picked up some false spirit when I came home of course my brother-in-law he talked to my dad and he said now I'm not going to bother you I said uh but wait till Manuel gets home he's gonna I mean he's gonna hear from me so when I got home I he said where's Dad he's always in the barn I said all right well went to the barn and I walked in and said he greeted me and said hello how are you doing he said what have you done I was already a married man I still respected him I said what well you you were baptized already before I could even explain it you know he was demanding an answer I said Dad I'd like to explain it to you but before we do you haven't even baptized at all I said you still got that old title baptism I said before you go any further I said why don't you get baptized first and then we'll talk about this yeah yeah he said I know why no yeah of the end of the argument but I'll show you how God works in mysterious ways that why that Revival that I'm talking about that spring the complete Church says about 80 68 to 80. I forget exactly the number of people they all went to Eagle Creek and Jesse Taylor was baptized this time he went under for the Lord you know the song this time and from that it was settled forever every time the past runs so now I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Revelation strikes it becomes real ity amen God bless you it shall be light about the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find in the Waterway here's the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus young and old repent of all your sins the Holy Ghost will surely enter in the evening light has come here's a fact that God in Christ are one and that beautiful when the Lord began to show us not a Trinidadian Doctrine not a Oneness not a Tunis some have tried to make it a Tunis around this message don't get away from the Triune being of God he does all things in three but he is one he said I don't understand it if the universe says they do understand it that means you understand God's mechanics how do you understand the mechanics of God he speaks it and it is who is what scientists can break down the spoken word being the original seat you can't it's all Beyond us but by faith we know it's the truth the spoken word is the Original Seed there is a source you're going to play that for me I'm going to close in one song If you if it's all right with you brother there's a source and time of need I like that I don't know what your need is today but whatever it is there is a source Jesus Christ is that source I have just I'm here at the first time I'm I'm a little vacation because I just stepped down from being pastor and brother Dwayne by the way I talked to him this morning brother Dwayne and Connie they sent the greetings to the in-laws and ex-laws Outlaws they said hello to everybody brother Dwayne I know he'd like to be here too I I don't like to call him too much because I don't tell about how nice the weather is even though it is cool but not to us it isn't cool it's nice but I don't know what the Lord's got from here I probably won't be preaching much more anymore but one thing is true there's a reward that lays just beyond this this journey here I'm so
