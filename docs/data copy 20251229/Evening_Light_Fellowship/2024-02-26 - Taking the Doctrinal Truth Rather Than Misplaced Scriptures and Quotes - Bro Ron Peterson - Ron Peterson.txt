bring it to you we claim it in the Victorious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you thank you musicians and the song specials they were very very nice second Timothy 2 then we'll go to 2 Timothy 4 amen second Timothy is quite a quite a book because Paul is admonishing uh Timothy as his son uh in the scriptures and he's he's admonishing him because false doctrines and seducing Spirits have come and different ones and and uh some have taken others off and uh uh so he admonishes him and uh tells him these things so uh Second Timothy chap 2 and I'd like to read verses 14- 18 of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about with words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hus and filus who concerning the truth of ER saying that the resurrection is passed already and overthrow the faith of some could you imagine those that were following the word of the hour in that time and they had added to and taken away and they come up with a new revelation that guess what the resurrection's already passed and overthrew the faith of some five second Timothy chter 4 verses 2- 4 preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering IND doct for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lusts shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and they shall be turned unto fables what is a fable there are stories that are passed down but said it was true but it's not it's a fictitious story could you imagine going away from the truth unto some Fable God help us God bless you you may be seated this this morning may God add the blessing to the reading of his word now uh I would like to title my sermon this morning and it's kind of odd and kind of different it's going to be a little bit of a teaching service and so I want to take it a little bit slowly and uh to show you because I believe that uh a Workman should study the word of God and that he's not ashamed that he rightly devis the word of truth yes amen amen I want to title my sermon this morning and listen carefully taking the doctrinal truth rather than a misplaced scriptures or quotes now how do we get all of these isms within the message they start with a quote they start with the scripture did not Satan come to Eve right in the garden and quote to her scripture brother Bram said the channel of reasoning don't you want to be like God and he just added to take take away and I'd like to take a subject this morning of The Book of Life in the Lamb's Book of Life amen I want to look at this I want to know the doctrinal teaching yes and I've done quite an exhaustive search myself of this and I want to bring to you some of the findings that I've seen so that we will be a very well balanced in our understanding concerning Book of Life and the Lamb's Book of Life and so before we go any further what I'd like to do is let's read some more scripture to lay a foundation of which I want to launch off into so we'll go to 2 Peter 1: 10-13 second Peter 1: 10-13 wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to your calling and election amen to make your calling in election sure notice that calling many are called but few are chosen so I don't want you to just Rejoice praise God I'm called right I want you to go on yes to make sure you're calling an election for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the ever ever lasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth amen yeah I think it meet as long as I am in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance that's all I want to do a faithful minister just put you in remembrance of what's already been said I have no message of my own there's been a messenger come a seventh angel messenger one prophesied according to scripture and his message has become my message re uh Revelation chapter 22 verses 18- 21 for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy yeah God shall take away his part out of The Book of Life yeah and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book yeah he which testifieth these things sayith surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen now I want all of you to understand that the vast majority if you were to study this at home on your computer at your own convenient time and you know that you can put in parentheses to for example if you want to study the Book of Life put it in parentheses and look at it within uh the message of the hour but always you go back to the scripture first where is it mentioned about the book brother Brenham calls it the title deed of redemption right he says this book of redemption that went back into the hand of its original owner we know that it's been returned back to the church Adam lost his right to eternal life he lost his position in the garden right right he lost his dominion over the Earth and over uh the animals yes so we understand he lost something what was that he lost his right to that Eternal book of redemption but God rich in Mercy he knew exactly he wasn't ringing his hands in heaven in fact he knew this would happen and he had provided a way before the foundation of the world praise God so I want you to notice that when you do this study that the vast majority of the quotes when you type in The Book of Life you will find that I would say well over majority let's call it 90% of the quotes brother Brenham says he who adds to and takes away and he's quoting what I quote quoted you from The Book of Revelation so it's extremely important everybody body know you do not add to and take away amen if more preachers within this message would listen to that they would not be so free to say well here's my interpretation I don't need your interpretation I don't want your opinion now if it is your opinion state it this is my opinion because I have opinions and I have a right as a student of the word of God and then I tell you here's my opinion okay and you just take it as my opinion right and uh now we're going to be looking at some of these quotes and we're going to first start in the scriptures and then we'll go into uh the message of the hour now when you take the Lamb's Book of Life and you put it in parentheses and you research it throughout the message he refers to the Lamb's Book of of Life 261 times so I have read every quote I have looked at it in detail then you take the Book of Life parentheses 518 times I've read every quote I look at it in detail because there might be some that he said in there but can we read all of those quotes here this morning no no so what I do is I go and I take just a few because for the sake of time I want you to go home and let you do the study yourself you read the quotes you see what he says and then you find out really where and then he he type in the book of The Living it's only mentioned one time so when you study the message you have to understand that the message that was coming to the messenger was according to his season of understanding that's right he didn't fully understand this gift that he had and to pray for kings and monarchs and on and on while his early Missionary Baptist pastor told him it's of the devil he had to go and pray and the angel had to come and just correct him and bring him back into balance so it was an unfolding Revelation to him so there are things that brother Brenham taught doctrinally listen to me now he taught doctrinally before the opening of the seals that when the opening of the seals comes God corrects that wrong doctrine that do does that offend anybody it should not offend any of you because God has let us see within the scriptures that every one of God's prophets and men of God made their mistakes they were human beings just like you and I and so brother Brenham says I'll show you by God's word he said that God's prophets have all made their mistakes a direct quote and he says but God makes no mistakes so what you have to do when you take the message of the hour and you begin to study it you have to study it in a chronological order amen because he may say something up to the opening of the first seal as an example white horse rider right amen many of the the sermons that he preaches that he titles the same uh the mighty conqueror every one of those prior to the opening of the first seal guess what that Mighty conqueror riding on a white horse was Jesus Christ and he says oh when I came to the opening of that first seal the angel come and told me incorrect wrong he says it shows that you need to stay before God to let him and I've said to this to you before the rest of you that you might understand God took this message and gave to us a sign of circumcision he cut off all the flesh a former teaching Clarence Len and all of the different ones the are you understanding that because all of that brother Bram said I looked into the Glorious Reformation I look at hops 2 Babylons and he names this he did a lot of reading TR yes that's right and so he was trying to take those men who probed at these things what they meant right amen and he says so he took from their teaching yes but my with the opening of those seals he got alone with God and he said I have no idea God I am I am just helpless without you I have no idea what that first seal is amen lays himself before God and here an angel walks into the room and he breaks to him the revelation of the first seal my what a supernatural gospel we have so if you isolate the scripture or take it out of text you come up with the wrong interpretation of the word and you become imbalanced eat drink and be merried for tomorrow we die that's in the scripture if we preach that out of text yeah let's just go do our thing or an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth do you see what I'm saying so you take scripture out of text you can make it say something they did it with the disciples Jesus said about John what is it unto you if if this man terries until I come and the Bible says and the S wind among the Brethren that John shall not see death right but I John testify unto you he didn't say that he just said what is it unto you if he Terry still Ain come do you see what I'm saying so they took words of Jesus and made a doctrinal teaching are they made a teaching out of it but didn't take his Doctrine understand so I want to take doctrinal teaching let's look at it chronologically are you with me in that understanding and so uh a few of these others body Spirit Soul he taught Body Soul Spirit prior to the opening of the first seal after the seals he said oh no no body spirit soul soul is the inside it's the holy of holies born again and sealed to adoption brother Brenham when you go through the adoption series you will see that he clearly differentiates and I will go into some more of that perhaps because we got some quotes um you take uh seven years of tribulation it's amazing right now how many men in the message ministers right now this week are preaching we have seven years of tribulation that the 70th week hasn't even started it's going to be the Rapture of the church and then the tribulation starts seven years of tribulation and and they get it all mixed up and I ask why don't you keep reading that's right brother brandham answers the question but prior to like have any of you ever seen the graph that he drew and he shows the church ages and he says and here's the Rapture of the church and then he puts seven years of tribulation any of you ever seen that well that's being going brought around to people oh my brother Brenham Drew this graph yeah prior to the opening of the seals prior to his understanding he didn't even understand Daniel 70 weeks okay so we're together on that aren't we otherwise you're going to get confused is it 7 years is it 3 and 1/2 years when was uh Christ cut off in the midst when did the 70th Week begin when was it cut off when does it start again uh we got answers but it's in the message you got to keep reading absolutely that's right uh here's a good quote I'm just throw this up here just because in this one quote he kind of covers a lot of this doctrinal teaching just watch this questions and answers 1964 the church age ended and has blacked out the bride is called and we have already entered into the tribulation period this is a question yeah oh my church age ended we've already blacked out remember there's no more light it's gone into total darkness right and we've already entered into the tribulation period no no no the bride when she's taken from the church the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease so when does the church age cease L you seea God's no longer dealing with the times of the Gentiles Christ leaves The Mercy Seat no more blood so he said there'll not be another Gentile Sav D why God's not dealing with Gentiles anymore that's right so those listen doctrin that that are martyred the Gentile Remnant that's left over right they give their lives but when were they saved we'll get into this church H Lota goes off into chaos the bride goes to glory and the tribulation sets in upon the who sleeping or foolish virgin are we together for three and A2 years they're there's finishing the last half of the 70th week amen while Israel is getting its prophecy then tribulation sets in upon Israel then comes the battle of Armageddon which destroys all things and then the bride returns back with the groom for for a thousand years the millennial Reign after that comes the white Throne judgment right after that comes the new heavens and the new Earth and the new city coming down from God out of heaven in eternity and time Blends together how different ones within the message now message preachers are preaching we're in the Millennium raptures already happened it was spiritual we're in the Millennium wow my so these are just a few of the teachings that's going on because they have their certain quotes they isolate that quote I I've often said this I don't I give you quotes I show you but I tell you the best thing for you to do is go back and listen to the tape cuz I can only give you a portion if you want to hear the fullness of it go back and listen to the tape then you'll hear it in its full perspective so some have said well brother Ron why don't you teach us what's wrong with every ISM or every false Doctrine within the message I don't have time let's preach the truth of the true message and let's study the real that when the counterfeit comes up you say ha that's counterfeit man do you know when they study the US currency yeah the people that work at Banks and they they never study a counterfeit they study the real that's right and they know it so well they put it up to the light yeah looks like the real thing why been studying Amen to know that this is the real thing should also be in your heart let's study the real thing amen three things that the prophet of God said we must not do now you ought to write that in the front of your Bible and he said three things you must never do why is to misinterpret the scriptures do you think God will turn to cheek and just it's okay my son's misinterpreting the scripture the very thing I said don't do he said do you do you think God's going to just turn a blinded eye and I'm going to let him because I love him so much I'm going to let him misinterpret the scripture No God's an exact don't misinterpret the scriptures don't misplace the scriptures well that belongs over here and this and that that's why hus and filus misplaced the scriptures they gave their own interpretation guess what they came up with a new doctrine resurrection's already passed and overthrew the faith of some and to dislocate he said to take it out of its true position so three things misinterpret misplace dislocate now I'll show you these quotes and I'm going to uh I'm going to tell you that I'm going to show you some quotes that if you don't know his doctrinal teaching you might think oh my our message is full of all kinds of erors right okay but I've told you remember because if we isolate a quote from 1957 and we start teaching on that right then we could come up with some kind of false Doctrine out here did the prophet of God say it look at it that's right where they say what he said but man haven't you kept reading okay so for this morning I want to take a detailed look first at we'll go to the scriptures and I want to look at everywhere it speaks of or pertains to the Book of Life okay so I want to have you you don't need to turn with me cuz we'll have it on the overhead but if you go back to Exodus 32: 32 and 33 now Brethren you stay with me because we're going to go quick quick quick yet now if will forgive their sin now Moses is standing in the Gap and if not blot me I pray thee out of thy book which thou has written what are we talking about Book of Life right boy I tell you what he's standing in the Gap yes don't take them take me and the Lord said unto Moses whosoever hath sinned against me him will I blot out of my book yeah you understand we're talking about the book of life right amen we're seeing Snippets of where the first place we can see where it's mentioned about the Book of Life Daniel 7 veres 9 and 10 and I beheld till Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow on the hair of his head like pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousands time thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were opened wow we're going to look at this books books didn't just say one book books were opened Daniel 12:1 and at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book again we're referring to something here's a time of trouble yeah there'll be a time of Deliverance and everyone that's name is written in the book God's going to deliver him Revelations 13 8 and9 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him somebody say all all whose names are not written in the book of the life of the Lamb excuse me I'm I I I I I'm sorry I passed it up I'm sorry let's go back to Psalms I just looked down on my notes I'm sorry Psalm 69 verse 27 and 28 add iniquity under their iniquity and let them not come into thy righteousness here's David under an inspiration let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous now I want to take this that's the Old Testament we want to bring it down in the New Testament righten so what is the New Testament say about it first writing of The Book of Life Philippians 4: 2 and 3 I beseech udias and beseech cage that's however you say it that they be of the same mind in the Lord and I entreat thee also true yoke fellow help those women which labored with me in the gospel with Clement also and with other my fellow laborers whose names are written where in the book of life now we're talking book of life right now we'll go to the Lamb's Book of Life here in a moment Revelations 3 verse 5 and he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white Raymond and I will not block his name name blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels now this next one I got it out of order but I'm going to leave it there because I will cover it over when I go to the book of the life of the lamb but let's look at this Revelations 13 8-9 all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb you see the wording changed a little bit wasn't Lamb's Book of Life but the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him here yeah Revelation 17:8 the Beast which thou sawest was and is not shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is Revelations 20 11-2 and I saw a great white Throne so where are we at now great white throne and he that sat on it whose face the Earth and Heaven fled away and there was found no place for them I saw the dead small and great stand before before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their Works Revelations 204 says and then death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death somebody say second death and whosoever was not written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire now I want to go back for just a moment because in Revelations 20 and verse 11 there I just read it the Bible says that let me just read this again I'm sorry let me get my texture another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things so we're white Thro which were written in the books according to their works now the Bible says that if you have never heard the law of God there's another law written in your heart well what about these heathens what about the people in Africa India in different places outer parts of the earth that never heard about Jesus Christ never heard about the word of God God how will God judge them good answer good question there is an answer so let me read to you Romans 2: 11-15 for there is no respect of persons with God right for as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law right for not the hearers of the law are just before God but the doers of the law shall be justified and for when Gentiles watch this which have not the law they've not heard the gospel do by Nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves yes watch this which show the work of the law written where is it written in their heart their conscience also buried Witness yes and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another yeah look at that your own words and your own thoughts will condemn you it will not be someone else oh yes God uses by the mouth of two or more witnesses that's true but I'll tell you what if you are condemned the greatest witness against you will be you you that's good your thoughts your actions recorded and just play it back there'll be no well well I didn't mean that no you did mean it you said it you did it that's right Matthew 12: 35-37 a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of bringeth forth evil things but I say unto you that Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall give account therefore in the day of judgment where we at judgment time when you going to give account on the day of judgment watch this for by thy words Thou shalt be justified or by thy words Thou shalt be condemned who will condemn you yourself good you are the greatest witness against yourself yeah there'll be others that stand there yes I heard him he said this he told me but listen once you hear it played your thoughts your actions that's right play back before you you listen You'll want to run amen true the most condemning words will be your own now I have a few referen is now to the Book of Life and the Lamb's Book of Life but we're going to start with the book of life and we're going to start this in a chronological order if you study the message you'll know that you'll get the oldest quote First you come all the way to 65 am you know that so what I did I typed in book of life parentheses so I'm giving you only a few remember I told you 28 81 of the Lamb's Book of Life 500 and some odd of The Book of Life whatever you look them up yourself okay here it is the living Jesus Christ 1953 now I do not have time to read the whole quote so I'm going to read just the highlighted portion okay so the living Jesus Christ if you put it up brotherr now the Indians when they see this power of God moving or Down in Africa over in the islands they don't question it we who's got all the scholarships we're the ones who question it he says watch this why they've explained it all out Dr so and so Dr so and so but listen God wants us to believe his word just like it's written then he quotes Revelation whosoever shall add to take away shall the same shall be taken out of his part of The Book of Life remember I told you vast majority of quotes the prophet of God talks about adding to taking away and you'll be taken out of the Book of Life brass serpent 1953 he takes away or adds to the same shall be taken out of his part out of the book of life so he wants to be sure that we keep our doctrines always on thus sayith the Lord Seven Church ages now how many of you this is 1954 brother Brenan preaches the seven Church ages in a sermon in 1954 brother Brenan preaches the seven Church ages in sermon form that we call the revelation of Jesus Christ yes when did that start that was December of 1960 he preaches almost all of December of 1960 into 1961 and then later does anybody know when the seven Church age book was printed I I texted brother George Smith because he's said he he he he knows a lot of this stuff I said George when was the church AE book printed when was it handed out he said it was printed three weeks before brother renham died and he gave it out to all the ministers he said it's my book it's not Lil's book it's his book there are all kinds of different ones and I've shared with you before different on said well I talked to the prophet about burning the book well you should hear the whole story the rest of the story and because brother renom there's a couple little things that he said hey some of the wording is intellectual and he said they know that I don't talk like that well if you don't like it brother brandham why we'll take those books and we'll burn them and we'll we'll make it to where you like it he said no no no it's okay I went before the Lord and the angel said give it out yeah right so it's not lale's book in fact doctrinally speaking the seven Church age book covers every major Doctrine in the message one of the best tools if you had only one book to take with you to go somewhere and you're trying to introduce the message Church age book is a is a good one now um so 1965 three weeks before he died he gives out the church age so here here is from the sermon the seven Church ages 1954 as it's written in here he that takes out of this shall be taken out of his part out of the book of life and he who adds to it the plagues shall be poured out unto him now questions and answers 1954 very good well only those who have the B baptism of the Holy Ghost be in the Rapture of the church or will all believers be indicated do you guys understand that question amen will only those who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost go in the Rapture of the church or will all believers be indicated well I ain't got time to justify that only the Holy Ghost Bride will be in the rapture see the Bible strictly the others won't be lost why would he say that yeah come on Amen well let's keep reading the Rapture the church had done gone now he's saying that that the the bride is actually the church there but we know what he his Doctrine will the Rapture the church had done had gone on the bride she's gone on then they come down and the Judgment was said what is a white Throne books were opened right is that right another book which was open which was the book of life now watch this he put this in here I did not he put it in parenthesis I did not the Sanctified believer that hadn't received the Holy Ghost right what book book of life right amen amen watch his doctrinal teaching amen please note that it was another book opened Book of Life for those Believers that had not received the Holy Ghost that includes all of the foolish virgins yes Divine Healing 1954 I say it's inspired every word of it is the truth every word of it is the truth let me say to you something Jesus Christ said he wrote this in the last chapter in his Bible and he shall add to or take away of this word the same shall be taken out of the Book of Life everlasting life and how to receive it 1954 and everybody anybody that'll take out of that book or add to it the same shall be taken out of the Book of Life and God's in Revelation whosoever taketh away or addeth to this that is God's complete will and revelation of Jesus Christ to the people 1956 I say I Jesus have sent my angel to testify and he'll take out whosoever shall take out of this book or add to it same shall be taken out of his of his part The Book of Life and the plagues are written in this book will be added to to him if he takes if he adds to or takes away you see how serious deep cth to the Deep 56 the but the history of the meeting will be on the pages he's he's praying he's talking about the meeting he's having right there he said the history of the meeting will be on the pages of The Book of Life people's decisions and how they acted concerning you who do you say this is what is the attraction you follow me seven Church age the church age book this how many of you know that brother Brenham went ahead and gave it to Dr leville and he went ahead and took out all of the uh reiteration and he made it into a book form and many times when you preach sermons you go back with the sermon if you're on the uh the Third Church AG you go back a little bit into the second Church age pick up and then go into the third do the same with the third and the fourth and there's so much reiteration he said no when you read a book huh it just goes on and on because you got it from the second age now we're in the third so look at this sardian church age this is the the church age book The Book of Life is definitely located in heaven and will appear at the great white Throne judgment The Book of Life in these verses Jesus said that their names were written in heaven they were written in the Book of Life for that is where names are placed Jesus was speaking to the 70 in verse 17 but he also speaking into the 12 verse 23 these all had been rejoicing that Devils were subject to them in jesus' name Christ rejoined her never heard that word before just learned it so Christ's answer his rejoiner was Rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you but rather that your names are written in heaven Book of Life brother Brenan put that in there I did not you will know here that Judas was one of those who were casting out devils in jesus' name but we know that he was a devil the son of predition come on Jesus answered them have not I chosen you you 12 and one of you as a devil he spake of judas's scary the son of Simon how many of you know s said it would have been better that he never been born yeah amen while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou Hast given me I have kept and none of them as lost but the son of predition that the scripture might be fulfilled so now brother Brandon paraphrase this now if language means anything at all we must admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus quotes the scripture John 13:18 yet he was not clean Judas was also given to Jesus by the Father John 1:2 Let It Be noted here that the choosing and giving is the exact parall as in the illustrations of Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau for though Esau and Pharaoh were both forn they were predestinated to wrath listen I'm going to blow your mind some people are born to go to hell you can't read it any other way while the end of Moses and Jacob was glorification amen 1 Peter 289 shows of both reprobates and elect even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed they were appointed guess where they're going they have an appointment right but ye are a chosen generation okay a little bit more time now now let's go on that was just the quotes on The Book of Life let's go into the Lamb's Book of Life Is there a difference because on the book of life I'm going to show you I'll make a final graph for you and say okay Book of Life over here Lamb's Book of Life names can be stricken off Boom book of life Lamb's Book of Life Never yes amen okay I'm not going to get ahead of myself I just provoking you huh okay let's take the quotes on the Lamb's Book of Life we're going to go to Revelations 13 again starting the scripture Revelation 13: 78 it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kreds tongues and Nations and all that dwell on the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world now I'm going to throw you a curveball here that includes foolish virgin are going to worship that's right the wrong one they had a chance yeah but the Holy Ghost who is the Divine revealer of the word they didn't get it right amen so therefore they're foolish and go off into foolishness my Lord delays his coming right this message why you make it too much it's just rules regulations we're going to get into this it Revelations 21: 27 and there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defiles into it go back and read Revelation 21 the New Jerusalem yeah amen and no wi enter into it he that defileth neither whatsoever worketh an Abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life New Jerusalem only the Holy Ghost Bride amen the others are without the city are you understanding amen know that not All Shall enter into it New Jerusalem only those whose names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life the New Jerusalem is for Christ and his bride only amen now let's take we took the scriptures let's take the message of the hour again starting with early quotations chronologically I will restore 1953 watch those Vines Jesus said let them grow together now I want you to notice another place we could bring it to Esau and Jacob if you wanted to before either was born God elected Jacob by election how many of you know that it says before either of them were born before the works that they did Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated right brother Ram said Esau was a far better man sir as far as just a man right little old Jacob little Shyer hiding behind his mama skirt had it been for his deceiving mama hey I I overheard thy brother Esau what he's going to do you better go in and get the birth right yeah and I'm going to help you deceive your old daddy how many know right you mean God would allow deception yes sir yeah guess who started his mama he went in there and then it's okay that's what's the matter today we're having these revivals all over the country it's nothing but ProTrac of meetings what we need today is not stand up and accept Christ as personal savior but Get Down On Our Knees until you're filled with the Holy Ghost God seals you into the kingdom that's what the church needs today Not Shake Hands join a church pack the paper from place to place get your name written in the Lamb's Book of Life and it'll stay there forever somebody say forever forever amenl we're talking doctrinal truth not an isolated quote 1957 hear ye him in Phoenix but God these tonight has raised to their feet let the recording Angel put every name down for their standing for Jesus tonight confessing their sins accepting him as their personal savior God put their names on the Lamb's Book of Life knowing we know it can never be blotted out okay next quote here on Revelation CH 5 the enemy in the last days that religious enemy would get amongst people and have organizations and so forth and Cults and forth as they have today and would deceive the very elected if it was possible and would deceive all those whose names are not on the Lamb's Book of Life since the foundation of the world when was your name put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world when was Christ slain 1900 years ago no sir before the foundation of the world the lamb slain before the F see what it's doing in these now watch this in these seals opening up just begin to reveal the Plan of Redemption how he did it it's all over now see just about finishing up so we're at the end time that's why these things are being revealed wow the unfolding of the word he's going oh my this is amazing here it is in the second seal but there is some that's got their names written on the Lamb's Book of Life yeah and when them seals are throw back or throw it open there they see their name there and the Holy Spirit speaks to them yes and they come that's why when you begin to have your eyes open and the eyes have of the Holy Spirit shows you the voice behind the voice the message within the message is it you're seeing your name where Lamb's [Applause] Book and they come that's the very reason that this message has an action has an action on you to bring your reaction sir it puts you into action why I saw my name in the bookall good 1964 again I'm going to show you quotes and some of these are going to throw you a curveball just read read what he said was Judas iscariot's name blotted out of the Lamb's Book of Life or was it ever on it be careful now yeah yes it was on it and it was blotted out again I'm reading you the question was judas's scariot name on or name blotted out of the Lamb's Book of Life or was it ever on it yes it was on it and blotted out but watch he now he says Rejoice not that the devils are subject to you but Rejoice that your name is written in he's quoting now Book of Life That's Right Judas was right with them judgment was set and another book was open which was the book of life every man was judged thus so again I'm not afraid to say what he said now when you go back now I'm not giving an excuse to the prophet except for this one thing he was so hurriedly going through the questions that I think it was just a slip of his tongue because that's not his doctrinal teaching can you swallow that that's not his doctrinal question well yeah was it on the Lamb's Book of Life yeah let me see yeah yeah yeah it was on it was blotted out but that's not his doctrinal teaching again I don't want you to sit there oh man brother Ron's showing no no say what he said but let's keep going let's understand his doctrinal teaching and when you understand the doctrinal teaching when it makes a slip of the tongue he might say 700 and he meant 7,000 you going to freak out well he made a mistake or you know what I'll tell you what prophet when he says something it's thus sayith the Lord everything he says the next thing you know you got your kids and nothing but a bunch of confusion then brother Brenham has to answer it four or five times the questions asked brother Brenham didn't you mean to say 7,000 instead of yeah yeah yeah ah man he says oh thy stupid servant yeah I said it just quickly just how many of you ever say things like that with your kids huh you tell your kids something I told you to go straight here I'm sitting at the dinner table I'm telling a story and uh Sandy will say well you said that wrong I never said it wrong I said thus and th so I look at my kids I appeal to the court of the kids at the table did I say it wrong yeah you did no I didn't okay okay I said it wrong but you know what I meant yeah but you still said it wrong my wife and I have those discussions all the time I said man I wish we had a recorder here all the just play it back by your own words so 19 65 proing proving his word now that's a big word predestinate but we all know that it's the truth we absolutely know that the infinite God predestinated all things by forn knowledge before the foundation of world even the lamb was slain and every name that would ever be on the book that was found on the book before the book was ever written and Jesus came to redeem those who were in the book in the Bible the lamb came from behind the curtain taking the book and opened the seals that it was sealed with and he come to claim all that he had redeemed the intercessor now an intercessor making intercession for those who has redeemed all those whose names was written on the Lamb's Book of Life is redeemed and only once at the end time now Lee there comes your name on the book talking to Lee Bale he says see it's Dr Le Ville sitting here he's grammaring the book of The Seven Church ages and the problem come up or the question about your name taking off the Lamb's Book of Life see it's puzzled a lot of ministers but wait until you get the book which book Seven Church ages you'll understand if you got any light in you it now you all know that the prophet preached the seven Church ages again in the revelation of Jesus Christ series 1960 right December of 60 through January of 61 amen so he was having Lee Vil to condense it summarize it make it a book and there's no dispute that the seven Church age covers every major Doctrine in this message amen now let me show to you I got three more quotes here and it'll be good because we'll come out just perfect but I've got a whole another sermon I'm going to show you some real super quotes that'll put everything in its perspective because the answers are here amen it's an open book test the invisible Union of the bride of Christ he opened those seven mysteries in there that shows forth brings forth those things that's been hid since the foundation of the world might be revealed in the last days to the sons of God they brought that forth now before thy people that they see it there you know to this undenominational bride that's us undenominational bride musicians have you come there is your two books one of them is the Lamb's Book of Life yes your name is there your name on there is predestinated on there it can't go because you can go no more take that away than nothing see because it was for dained to be there right but the regular Book of Life can take that off at any time invisible Union of the bride of Christ there's your name on The Book of Life The Book of Life is the word of God because the word is God and God is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible become the word wow here it is a prophet going back into Before Time began right amen our Bible begins in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth guess what this Prophet did I'm going to go beyond the beginning before there before God became God yes I'm going to take you back into the very Mind Of God because a god is an object of worship and there was no one he began to create angels to worship him that's it he began to have thoughts I want to be a redeemer I want to be a savior I want to be a Healer he's got all these thoughts watch this where is he forming this where is the Woman's Place to form that which has been placed inside of her in her womb that which has been given to her to conceive she takes it so brother Brown said there is a womb to the spirit and there is a womb to the Natural and God in the womb of his mind Hallelujah began to conceive seed Lord he had all these thoughts but a thought unspoken remains a thought but when he said let there be there was he said when he said let there be light he said it made have been eons and eons of time and there was light I created the heavens and the Earth and there it was do you see what I'm [Music] saying works as Faith expressed 1965 this is my last quote the Baptists believ there were two separate [Music] books and in one way it is is two separate books in another way it isn't two separate [Music] books keep reading man otherwise you're going to stop well I don't get it just keep reading there's only one real one book of [Music] life he talks about the germ and the wheat and he goes under the stock and the tassel I'm going to read to you the highlighted that's the one place it sounds like you can have your name taken off the Lamb's Book of Life in the other place you can't do it so that's where it is it's all in that great Revelation there which was made known during the time of the Seven Seals why is it how is it so some people can't believe it do you see where the seals [Music] become the place where brother Brenham said even the full truth of marriage and divorce came with the opening of the seals he said with the opening of the seals came the full truth of serpent SE that's right he preached those doctrines long before right but now with the opening of the seals I got some really good quotes I couldn't bring it all to you today because it would be too much on our plate and it would be too much reading and guess what my voice is almost gone so by God's grace we'll continue on with this cuz I tell you and if you miss the next sermon I think you'll miss a an integral part so make sure if you're a visitor and I don't tell people to come back and listen to my sermons but you'll need to do it on this one here because say what he said is that okay with you you still love [Music] me amen let's just bow our heads for a moment father God I know I am held responsible for every one of these people especially they that claim I am their Pastor so I am not trying to correct everybody out in the internet and all the ministers within the message no no no I'm just going to preach the truth as I see it to our people because I substantiate it through the word of God and through the message of the hour that there be no confusion because so much of the time father what is taught as a doctrinal truth later you find out it wasn't that's why we need to study to show ourselves approved a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth and we'll look into this father because I'm excited and I know that you gave us a key because you told us that the Book of Life Is there a difference between the book of life and the Lamb's Book of Life he said no they are one and the same but then he turns around and he said but there's another [Music] record he said that there is another record within the Book of [Music] Life there is an addendum it's called the Lamb's Book of Life so hidden within the Book of Life is an addendum is another record I pray Heavenly Father may it be so clear and evident to your people as we look into it in our next service I commit this service and that one to you father that you'll take my poor way of bringing it all out but bring it to their understanding because the holy spirit will lead and guide us into all truth I thank you I praise you I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen now I'm going to show you have any of you ever had a book that's had an dandom inside the book National Geographic used to do it all the time oh you here you got the the deal and then you had a three-page fold out right in the same book there's another record within the Book of Life here it is another record what is it Lamb's Book of Life and those let me tell you those whose names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life they'll never be deceived their name will never be stricken off it was put on there and I will show you the quotes where brother brm said guess what it was written in his own blood your name written in his blood before the found God oh I can start preaching right [Applause] now before the
