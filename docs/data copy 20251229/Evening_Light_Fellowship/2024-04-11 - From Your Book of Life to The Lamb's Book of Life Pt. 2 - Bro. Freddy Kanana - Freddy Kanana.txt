you're aware of it brother Peter Chandler the pastor in in United Kingdom passed away today and uh yeah he was at church from what I have been told he was at church early he was either going to be there for counseling or something and one of the brothers came in and they found him on the on the floor and uh so uh be praying for the church be praying for his family uh because it's it's very unexpected so far as we know and everything um I enjoyed brother Peter he was one of the few men that I knew within the the gospel uh that was a real gentleman you know he and uh men like Harold Becket and Peter Chandler they're just gentlemen U and so I I'm going to miss him uh be praying for Sandy and i a week from today a week from today we're traveling to South Africa and so the meetings that we had had scheduled for January was supposed to be there for dibl and Zoe for their wedding and we couldn't and and everything but the meetings that I had for Emanuel Gospel Center um and then for brother Ruben Daniel um we had to cancel those so what I'm doing is I'm fulfilling a an obligation that I had given to them way back in January so the Lord willing we're going to be traveling to U South Africa so be praying for us because uh it's a long trip and uh everything and so we'll be preaching um the Sunday that we get there at Emanuel Gospel Center and then that evening we'll be having communion and foot washing with the Saints there then we'll spend a little bit of time go down and see brother Brian Jones down there in in Maho Holo and take a couple days and uh just enjoy ourselves there in the African bush and then we're coming back and being with brother Ruben Daniels and brother uh Brian Naidu said brother Ron I don't care what day you can give me you let me know you let me

another couple we're going to travel a little bit and see some sites and so um and I I I I tell you the truth that hosting meetings is much more pressure and nerve-wracking on me than ministering them oh yeah I'd rather preach the convention than I would to hosted because in hosting you got this and that and you're juggling all this and uh you know anyway so I'm going to need a few days just to uh to relax and and and everything so anyway uh I have full confidence in the ministry that we have here while we're gone brother Mario it's going to take the first Sunday that we're gone then brother

we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen having predestinated us unto the the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen shall we go in the Book of John chapter 4 verse 21 to verse 24 after this and then you you can have your seats Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father you worship you not you know not what we know what we worship amen for the Salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth amen for the father seeketh such to worship him God is spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word as you have your SE it's kind of um a special evening in term of organizing my note I thought I send the notes to the uh Brothers to kind of project them on the screen but I realized I didn't click sign I was like what's happening here yeah not that old I thought maybe it's a short notice that the the pastor has sent me last Friday but Freddy would you mind taking the service on Wednesday say yes I looked at Wednesday the 10th I was like why it's not it's next week man I was like okay and I was telling the pastor back there when uh brother Gideon kasonga was here he spent some time with us it's my place him and I having fellowship and he was asking me uh how much time does the pastor give you before you go to the pulpit I told him two to 3 weeks said that's a lot and he said the way he learned the way he was trained by his Pastor when uh brother viida noticed that he has a Ministry the gift he came over to his place at 400 p.m. on a Saturday was like I was looking for you you get a priest tomorrow like what he was telling me I was like what he said I didn't read I didn't eat I didn't pray I didn't prepare myself so what am I going to do read pray sleep what so he did what he did on that Sunday the worst part of it was another Sunday cuz he was a deacon in the church he was at his post of Duty singing like the rest of the people and and then he saw another deacon coming to him was like brother it's the time for you to go to the pulpit what that's the way he was trained but I don't want to brother run to do [Applause] that so that's the way we Are Soldiers so we need to be prepared yes sir in season and out of season amen there's no question about it when the Holy Spirit will pick on you you got to do the job so you pray for me and uh so that I can deliver my message that I have in my heart so the my sermon tonight is from your book of life to the Lamb's Book of Life it's a part two and for subject is the true worshippers we worship the father in spirit and in truth amen I think I have to repeat myself tonight again so to make myself um um understood as we journey through this life we do things because brother bam says when we are born there is a spirit that God has ordained to occupy is body of Flesh and that spirit will cause us to say things and do things that will be held accountable to us and we need to respond for those things that we have said and those that we have done evil like brother bam says in the message Christ is revealed in his own word he says when you are born God sets a record on or a recorder on it don't make or put a record on it don't make much noise for a little while you know that's the little baby till it comes to accountability then the noise starts he starts saying things and doing things he has to answer for and when the life ends the record or tape is took off and laid in the great big library of God now how are you going to get around it at the Judgment bar it's played right back in front in front of you every move you made every thought that went through your mind can you see that you see so we do things in this life good and evil is God is recording them and baram says in one of the message when we're born the Spirit come in us and in a certain period of time we have to make a choice to worship to worship God because with the five senses of this Spirit we have love right that's ail of love that will make us worship you make us love God and love people and in Genesis chapter 6 God repented after he saw the condition of the earth and how people were just uh um evil and he he repented and he said my spirit wants wife with a human being because he's a flesh and his days are only 120 because by bam says before the fall I mean right after the fall Before the Flood I meant to say people used to live a little longer amen and after the flood our numbers our time here on the Earth was reduced so from 120 and if you go with the book of uh in uh p Psalms 90 chapter 90: 10 that's the prayer of Moses he said our time here on the Earth was reduced to 3 score and 10 which means 70 years from 120 to 70 and here when he he talks about the recorder being put on they don't put it on the day you are born it's after a moment when you reach the age of accountability and then they start recording your stuff so when I say from your book of life to the Lamb's Book of Life which means because the book talks about life whatever you have done in this life so the teaching on the books brother Ron did it in detail this is just a jumping board that I'm using to go uh bring my point across so God will record all of that until the time you will make a decision to start worshiping him and in this Spirit we can go to church we can do things we have the first uh worshippers we have Cain and Abel all of them that were in the message of that hour and the pastor was God himself preaching them his word all of them they have the same benefit but one had Revelation the other one didn't have Revelation Abel was connected told the father Cain was not connected true even though he did evil God came back to him yes rehearsing some things telling him to do exactly follow do what your how your brother is doing if you do exactly how he did then you'll be considerate or your offering will be considerate but since he didn't have since he didn't have that seed in him since he was not the elect right he didn't take it seriously and he ended up slaying his brother so he was worshiping in this body in this Spirit he was worshiping but he didn't have a revelation he didn't know what he was worshiping we have Moses he heard from his mother how he was going to be a redeemer how he's going to be uh bringing the children of Israel out of the bondage but with his own strength as a human being was trying to do that he was a religious and he ended up killing an Egyptian until the time where God appointed him to to be called to really do the job butam says it took 4 years for him to be to have the doctrines of Egypt in him and it took God 40 years again to remove all of that from his life amen and Bam says that's how it's supposed to be the deeper you went in the world when you receive Christ you have to go even deeper in Christ to balance things out and Moses was a killer though he was a Believer but he killed he was doing evil and he was doing good at the same time we have Paul he learned from Galia one day he was persecuting the Believers he thought in his mind he was worshiping God which he did but he didn't know what he was worshiping amen he didn't have a revelation it was just his Spirit he was going to church as a matter of fact he has some notes to persecute the believer right and he did was violent until the day he made the pill of fire Hallelujah and when he met God he was a changing man he made God first and he went straight to the world three three years and a half butam searching the scriptures and he ended up with one statement a strong one Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen we have Peter very aggressive he was in the message of that hour yeah right he was in the message but the message was not in him yet one day he was aggressive when the soldiers came to get the the Lord pulled out his knife and cut off the the ear of the the soldier the Roman soldier amen and the Lord looked at him and said no this is not uh physical thing Affairs this is spiritual mother and he put the ear back Hallelujah one day Peter he came to the Lord cuz the Lord saw him he knew they were flesh they were weak in the flesh one time he called them to go prayer in the mountains they didn't stay in the prayer for that long not even one hour and he said the flesh your spirit is willing but your flesh is weak he understood them because they were still in this side of worshiping they were worshiping but not truly worshiping amen and one day he called him we are in uh Book of Luke chapter 22:31 1 to ver 34 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan ha desired to have you that he may sift you as weit but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren amen and he said unto him Lord I am ready to go with you with with thee both into prison and to death and he said I tell you that's this is the Lord telling uh Peter I tell thee Peter the shall not crawl this day before thou before that thou shall thri deny that thou knowest me amen see he was in the message you see he was in the message going to church coming back but he was not converted because the the Lord he knows everything amen and he said when you will be converted strengthen your brother don't forget my subject is the true worshipper we worshiping the father in spirit and in truth that's what we're talking about here David he was a man after God's heart he did good things and he defeated Goliath on his you in his youth but one day he did an evil thing adultery but when he met the Lord when God sent Nathan the prophet to him with a message he realized this is a message coming from the Lord he took it seriously and you saw all the Psalms how he cried out to the point where God gave him his enemy Soul because of the love of God because this is David after conversion he couldn't kill Saul his soul just not kill him he he's following you try to kill you no no no no no he's a servant he's an anointed of God he just got the Hem of His uh robe and then showed him I would have killed you but you know one day A crippled man and spilled on his face he Soldier we need to take his head off I said no the Lord knows amen you see that's David after the true conversion it just same with us you see people coming to church and day in and day out sometimes doing evil things doing Godly things you know if you don't have the spirit of God if you don't receive the Holy Spirit then it's going to be tough for you that's why the Lord told the disciples ter you in Jerusalem because he knew all of them were not converted yet even though were in the message but the message was not in them like the children of Israel that were in Egypt for a long time until that the Egypt was in them when they left Egypt they were in the wilderness they've been bothering Moses the prophet When Death sets in when they were facing troubles and things they said we should have stayed in in in Egypt because the Egypt was was in them they left Egypt but Egypt was still in them the disciples were in the message but the message was not in them that's why the Lord could see all of that he knew their weaknesses and he told them go and wait until the power from on high will come on you and look at the Peter after they received the Holy Spirit was a different man oh that's right because he was converted all the things they heard from the Lord they were even questioning the Lord what about this what about that when the Holy Spirit came on in on in their lives he was leading them through all of that amen because the Lord says I'm not going to leave you alone comfortless but I was saying the spirit my father will send the spirit the comforter in my name thank you Lord he will lead you in through all the truth he will bring to your remembrance what I have told you even tell you things to come we all go through that in the Book of Ezekiel The Book of Ezekiel chapter 36: 24 to 27 don't forget this is God talking to Israel and the same way he dealt with Israel is the same way he was dealing with the church he said for I will take you [Music] from among the the Heathen and gather you out all the countries and I will bring you into your own land then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your fithness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit I will put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you in heart or flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes amen and you shall keep my judgment and do them amen this is God remember before um the Covenant he made with uh Abraham he had a covenant with Adam whereas if you do this I'll do this if you do this I'll do this but he realized that a man is just he's weak amen an unjust man and a just God we could we can't it doesn't fly but he changed it to another Covenant and he made it with Abraham where you don't have to do nothing you only have to depend on what I've done God I have everything don't you worry this is what he's doing here I'll gather you from all the Heathen countries I'll bring you into your own land I'll take out the Stony heart and I'll give you a heart of Flesh amen I'll give you a new spirit am the spirit that will be yielded to the leadership of the Holy Spirit a spirit that will say Amen to the word of God not only that but I'll give you my spirit which is the holy spirit don't forget the Lord like brother bam says when he went back because Moses God showed him what he had done what we didn't see but Moses saw that and with John God took him a little farther but in these last days God took us way farther than all the prophets praise the lord we even knew what was going on in the back pack of the man of of God and we know that because of the message of the hour bam is telling us that because the Bible says God is spirit amen and the true worshippers we worship Him in truth and in spirit that's right what is truth yeah Jesus said father sanctify them by the truth your word is truth amen amen yes and Bam says God is a great being was fulfilling the time in the space there was nothing not even an atom not nothing molecule nothing was only God but in him he has attribute Amen to be father to be son to be savior to be all of that right how could he express it because he was fulfilling the time and the space he created out of him came the logos the pill of fire which we saw above the prophet he said that's the Son of God he came out of the father father's bosom and B say the holy spirit that was fulfilling the time in space condensed itself in that body of the word amen you see God is Spirit we have to worship Him in spirit and truth amen a question was asked himam what should a Believer do to grow up spiritually he said read the word and pray because we have to Worship in spirit and in truth when Moses was leading the children of Israel was not just leading them like that he was leading them because he was commissioned by God to lead them he was acting according to the word of God like bam says if the Lord didn't send you don't go right because when you face troubles over there it's going to be you and you alone but if he commissioned you to do something he will back you up amen and every single time when the children of Israel were giving Moses problem uh problems Moses was turning back going to God he was connected with the spirit yes he was connected with the father and he was showing him what to do yeah and when he he passed on God looked in the congregation he saw Joshua he told him stand up he gave he gave him an encouragement cuz he saw a gift in him amen stand up you're going to take over right and look the how Joshua led the children of Israel and he told Joshua you have to meditate you don't have to do anything like that no no you do it according to the prescription of Moses because that's my word amen you have to do it according to the word of God Amen Moses was I mean Josh was doing that following the advices from the Lord and when he was encountering the problems he was going back to the Lord he was connecting with the spirit he was connected with the father he was worshiping in truth and in spirit now God says I'm going to gather you from all the countries the Heathen one I will put you in your own land I'll clean you I'll give you a new heart for you to obey my word to write the Old Testament Moses didn't go just hophazardly and then no no no he had to have the experience with God Amen he made the load in the burning bush after he made the load that's how he wrote the Old Testament book Paul did the same after he met the Lord face to face he had the burning bush experience too he saw God in the form in the first form he revealed himself to the humankind that's how he wrote the New Testament and in this end time to bring the interpretation of the old in the New Testament William brandham had to come here in Arizona had to meet the Creator the pillow of fire yes had to meet with God Amen that's why we have the interpretation of the new in the Old Testament and B botom says this form this hello this pill of fire that's the attribute of the fullness of God yes hate you believe that and by bam says this attribute in one of the messages he he spoke it in many messages he said it's not far from he from me and as a matter of fact he he's dwelling in me now why to manifest the son of man or to reveal the son of man was not William brandham but it was God he said not me the angel in me amen we don't worship William brandham that's the angel because Jesus said what took place in Sodom and gomorra will take place a the revealing of the the son of man not what happened now not what happened in the time Jesus was here on the earth because Jesus brother bam says that's the attribute that's the fullness of God Head badly even the body that's God himself but in Genesis 18 that was a man like you and I and Bam says they questioned him where did God get that body he said said he took the same Earth because we are composed we are formed from the earth that has 16 elements the same God took the Earth and formed three bodies one Michael come in the other one Gabriel and the other one he dwelt himself and after he finished his mission on here on the earth he left and that body went back to the dust so I want you to get that just just came freely amen so Abel received a true revelation of what took place in the Garden of Eden but abam says how would that boy know what took place if it wasn't for the Holy Spirit revealing to him right true we need to be connected cuz if you're not connected then nothing will happen and when Jesus told the disciple to stay until the power from on high will come on them he knew what he was talking about and I'm going to ask you a question the Pentecostal people they are worshiping they going to churches they're praying and they do all of that what makes them different from us here's the answer we were chosen before the foundation of the world thank you Lord we are the elect of God we were predestinated we can come back to our scriptures kind of going back and forth and I don't know how the Lord will lead in Ephesians chapter 1:3 Paul said blessed blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all the spiritual blessings but says we have been blessed before the foundation of the world all the Heavenly uh spiritual blessings he said according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy even our Holiness you have to be chosen before the foundation of the world otherwise you're going to make your own effort and at the end of it you're going to quit because bam says Judah is scariot he Jed at a certain time and the evil spirit kind of obeyed even him and he rejoiced along with other disciples but Jesus told them don't Rejoice because of the evil spirit we subject to you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in the Lamb's Book before the foundation of the world because bam says he jined with them until that day before the uh the uh the event of the uh the coming of the Holy Spirit he was gone already because he couldn't keep up he was not the elect John Luke and all the disciples they made it through and they receed the holy spirit so through this life we do things and we go to church we do Godly things but we need absolutely to have the burning bush experience says it's not only the Believers even us behind the pulpit if if you don't have that experience you don't have the right to be behind this sacred desk amen you have to have the burning bush experience let's read the prophet in the uh in the message Vision the Patmos Vision he's repeating um John I was in the spirit isn't that beautiful my I love that you could just call those words the whole of the Christian Life if we are going to live as Christians we have to be in his spirit amen John was not talking about being in his which means in his spirit that would not have brought these Visions amen it had to be the spirit of God Amen it has to be the spirit of God with us too all all our efforts are in vain Paul said I will pray in spirit I will sing in spirit I will live in spirit amen if there is anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest in the result it Bears because Jesus said my words are spirit and life you see word spirit and life as surely John needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the Revelation that God has given given to us to live by in his word for it is the same Spirit look look at it this way all too many read the Bible where it says in Acts 2:38 repent and be baptized and every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of the sins and you shall receive the gift gift of the Holy Ghost and just pass right on they don't see it if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that if they want to receive the Holy Spirit they need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus and then God would be Duty bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the Holy Ghost amen they never getting in the spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says pray to God for Revelation by his spirit amen that is the first step get in the spirit amen let me just use another illustration suppose you need healing what does the word say well we have all read we have all read it countless time but did not get in the spirit when reading it did we ask God for his Spirit to teach us the real truth of it yes sir if we did we would call the Elders confess our sins be anointed and prayed for and that would be that it might not come immediately but in his Spirit it is all over there is no other quot to of appeal God will fulfill his word oh we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done don't go through the ACT first get in the spirit and then go through the act and watch God will do it amen if it wasn't getting in the spirit ezekiah would have been dead you see when when God sent the prophet Isaiah with a message of him living the Earth he took it seriously because he knew that this message comes from God am the Bible says he turned back and he look in the wall and start praying earnestly so his prayer took him up in the presence of God he saw God face to face and the prophet Isaiah left because of his communication Isiah communication and God God sent another message to his Prophet because he was in the spirit if it wasn't praying in spirit would have been something else and the prophet Isaiah where he was he was sure this is the message from God see what is taking place now because he was in the spirit amen and he made God face to face he touched the Throne of God and God sent another message to his prophet and Isaiah was obligated to come back and give a different message amen when barabam was praying for the young lady that was sick for nine or so years he was giving his experience he said he went up to the mountain to pray go this way too many rocks couldn't kneel down go that way tilting leaning this way he couldn't kneel down he go the other side mosquitoes and he was finally he say you know what mosquitoes can do whatever they want I flew my hands up and I was lost in the prayer couldn't hear the mosquitoes couldn't feel anything he says that's praying in spirit amen you get my point worshiping in spirit and in truth and he got the result after he got out of that prayer the prophet of the prophet of God says in in the lamb Lamb's Book of Life he says now believer have you got your joy shoes on listen to this if you are a Christian if you are truly God's child the Bible say that's not a old preacher like Freddy here that's the Bible it's said your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world oh my the same time that Christ that God sent Christ to be slain he wrote your name with his hallelujah hallelujah there you are your name was written in he said and he deceived all Greatful so many were church members we don't want to be church members pretended Christians he deceived all whose names were not written not in the church book but in the Lamb's Book of Life when before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life by his spoken word and sa Christ the sacrifice to God to redeem that same group I believe all of us who were there that same group amen that he had wrote their names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world like bam says we made the choice to follow God not now not today we made a choice before the foundation of the world Amen and God knew who would and who wouldn't make a right choice those that have chosen him he put the names in the Lamb's Book of Life those are the one that Christ had to come down here to die for and you can tell they recognized him when he came here on the earth that's right that's why he were was having conversation with the Pharisees telling them all kind of story they didn't get it he said now I understand you are not of my disciples amen cuz my disciples they understand my language they've been somewhere with God hallelujah they've seen me somewhere familiar places familiar voices right I'm doing the same thing I did back then but you don't recognize it guess what even in hell even in in in in um in Paradise when when Jesus went there the Believers still recognize him butam says they didn't have to to start questioning no look at the way he was presenting the descending of Jesus Christ in hell he started with the non-believers when he was coming there he presented himself to them he introduced it to because they didn't have any clue of what he was but look at when he was going to the Believers when they saw him each and every one of them saw Christ coming in the form they saw him on the earth he didn't have to introduce himself to them they had the Revelation because they were with them before the foundation of the world this is the key thing tonight amen and with this Jesus said Rejoice because your name are written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and you make sure you're going to win the battle amen yeah if you're not of the elected you're not going to win the battle you will quit halfway that's right so let's continue reading the prophets he said in the in the message Israel and the church he said don't be deceived you better search this now no yep there we go if you keep on saying well it don't condemn me to do this it don't condemn me to do that things of the world now I'm going to hurt you just a little bit pull the feathers back the other way but it's this one sure evidence you have never been to Christ you've never been born again here is the difference between us and the rest of the worshippers when we receive the Holy Spirit since we have the seed of God in our souls it will Quicken the that seed and for us it's it's a new birth whereas for them that spirit will only anoint this their Spirit there's no seed in them amen for us it's a new birth because we have the seed of God that was put in us before the foundation of the world but for the rest it's only the anointing and Bam says to to prove that they are not of the elected bring the word a woman should not preach oh no she can preach Deborah no Deborah was not a was not a preacher bam says the the period where Deborah she was not even she was not a preacher she was a judge that period of time Israel didn't have any prophet and God instead sent judges Deborah was not a minister see bring the word and see how they react to the word you will for sure know they are of the deected or they are not the elected right amen it's only the anointing they can go pray for the sick the sick can get healed because Judah Iscariot did it too but his name was not written in the Lamb's Book of Life and when the Holy Spirit come in you comes in you when you are being being born again you will be about the father's business amen because Jesus himself with the Holy Spirit in him God showed him how Satan was coming was trying to get Peter to get done with him and he told Peter Simon Simon Satan was looking was after you but I prayed for you to strengthen your faith thank you Lord and he told him when you be converted strength stren your brother you that claim to have the Holy Spirit when God shows you something in your brother's life whether it's a weaknesses in spiritual life whether it's a financial situation emotional or something don't gossip amen be about the father's business pray for your brother pray for your sister don't be listening to the negative report that's me I hate listening to the negative report this going on in the church this no come on you hear something either go talk to the brother or to the sister yes make sure it's the right thing you don't have to go report it to somebody else as a man of God like brother bam when brother Evans they had a issue with with the stolen car they came to him but B didn't say I have the solution the true man of God will take you to the Lord amen you bring it to me I bring it to the Lord out don't have nobody else to whom I'm going to tell no I take it to the Lord period amen we'll be about the father's business amen that's right because in this side or on the other side of uh new New Birth people people will do all kind of things and we are living in a critical time where if you don't pay attention you'll be just church member we don't want to be church member we want to be the true worshippers amen we want to be about the father's business we don't want to be uh negative report listeners we want to be positive all the time and that's the gift of the Holy Spirit we have to be positive all the time because we have the Holy Spirit in US amen amen you see Peter after the New Birth he was about the father's business right it's not the same Peter before New Birth it's not the same Peter before the Holy Spirit he said Gold Silver and silver or Silver and Gold Have I None such as I have I give it to you stand up and walk amen he's the one that stood that day of Pentecost to tell the people that no these people are not drunk as you think they are why because he was about the father's business was not the same Peter he was serious because he was about the father's business amen so we need to question ourselves are we about the father's business are we taking Ser because this the this is a battle friends that's right you see something going somebody going through some situations it's a battle we don't joke cuz it might be it might be you what if it was you what you going to do most of the time we don't realize that yes sir it's a battle sir and if we are holy spirit filled we should be about the father's business that's why Christ saw Peter when he was talking no I will do this I'll do that no no no you're not ready yet right and when he received the Holy Spirit the Lord didn't have to tell him he was going through smoothly why because the holy spirit because the father because the spirit was in him God's spirit was in him like he said I'll put my spirit in you to cause you to obey my word yes sir that's right if you don't have the spirit of God you're not going to obey his word butam says this in the question and answer number one Those whom he called he justified Those whom he justified he glorified and every redeemed person in the world this morning that's under the blood of Jesus Christ filled with the Holy Ghost have everlasting life and can't perish and it is already in Heavenly places with Jesus Christ Hallelujah and shall never come into condemnation already redeemed because listen he's Paul is talking in the past which means it's something that happened before the foundation of the world have redeemed have called when did he call you before the foundation of the world Amen see already redeemed already glorified that's lovely amen when you leave this earth you have a body already waiting for you friends we we we have a message that is Suess the understanding of humankind we don't have to take it uh uh like granted we're supposed to go deep in this message there's many nuggets that we can enjoy and because we don't Fellowship enough true because some of the things we know we got them from fellowship right some of the questions you have you might have like the pastor invited the visiting ministers and they just speak on something that you have questions long time sure or might be in fellowship with brothers or our pastor can just come here one day and bring the clarification on the things you used to have questions all of that it takes it behooves us to have uh an awareness amen you know to be up to be connected you know I remember one day we uh it was um Thanksgiving Day last here but Joshua kind of uh called The Believers to come together I think he T to uh brother Ron about it and um we had brother Gideon kasonga here so it was the time to welcome him and to be together and but Joshua KH he was inspired to say okay if you have something that the Lord has done in your life you can give a testimony here friends one testimony that touched my heart was one of the sister jolia I don't know if she's here tonight and I told Brother Joshua all this Gathering was for this testimony she said she her last baby she has a baby she said since she gave birth to that baby she went through all kind of stuff they told her your sugar is up and this and that and she she was like overwhelmed by all kind of problems to the point where she was ready to commit suicide why because she was alone and Bam says the lion or the wild animal will follow the lamb that being isolated from the rest right she was by herself her husband may be at work something bad could have happened she said she was disclosed to take the knife and kill the baby why because of lack of fellowship and I told Brother Joshua we need to have Fellowship more you know go visit the brother like we spend time with Brother Ray talk about the Lord and I have another uh brother but uh NE but Neil I keep promising him and he told me he was going to call me I'm still waiting for the call friends we need Fellowship amen we need to pray one for another amen the time is very critical it's very bad the last thing I shared with uh the pastor Gideon he told me about a group of the Believers from his church that need to be the tape listeners they came to him they said okay pastor we think uh we're going to be listening to the tapes and and we have found a place to rent that we need to start fellowshipping over there and listening to the tapes he said well that's okay I understand that I admired him because he was very um wise he used wisdom and he told them I understand the person you don't want to listen to is me okay so he's one what what we're going to do you paid your ties you paid your offer and everything for this building to be what it is today so I don't want you to go spend the money there you can just keep coming you don't have to come and listen to me preaching you can come here when we don't have Services put the tape and listen to the tape as a matter of fact I might as well come and listen with you together how's that you know what happened the majority of that group is ah he's wise so they didn't know what to do you know what you might we might as well just go back you see that was a bad influence and you have influences like that throughout the land that's right you don't know cuz some people they need to be free in their sinful lives and they will influence you in something that you don't even know nothing about so that was wise and then I admired him for that amen so the people the Believers came back to the church y cuz they didn't know what to do he said you can come when we don't have services like on Thursday you put the tape and I can come and listen with you God bless you richly I love you uh so much you pray for us amen amen amen uh I'm glad that brother Mario is back uh I was telling his son um I'm tired of filling in his position now that he's back cuz I heard the pastor talking about him so God
