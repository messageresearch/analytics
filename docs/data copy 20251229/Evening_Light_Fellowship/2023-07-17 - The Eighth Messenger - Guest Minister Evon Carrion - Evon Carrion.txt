Hallelujah there's no place I'd rather be and that's in Christ glory to God [Music] amen amen we're just so pleased to have our brother Yvonne Carion from New York City and his wife's sister Linda God bless her come he's a real believer comes here during a heat wave I don't know of anybody else that comes during a time a heat wave record-breaking heat and yet he he he came and he don't even like the heat so the Lord bless him thank the Lord for air conditioning right now huh amen you love him this morning amen let's sing that song once again as we do uh we'll have our brother Yvonne come on up here and may you take your Liberty my brother and whatever is upon your heart let's sing that song again love Love With Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] your love in our lives oh God amen and while you're standing just turn in your Bible we'll read a verse scripture perhaps it will allow you to sit I think we should maybe go over to Exodus 23. and verse 20. just to get a startup point Exodus 23. and verse 20. behold I send an angel before thee keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared now notice we know Moses was an angel he was a messenger and but God said he's going to send another messenger another angel keep Moses and to keep the people to bring them into the land beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for we will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an aim an enemy unto thine enemies in an adversary unto thine adversaries for mine Angels shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites and to the Hittites and the parasites and the Canaanites and the hibites and the jebusites and I will cut them off and another verse to kind of use something in a new testament to help us understand Exodus 23 let's go to First John and the fifth chapter and the 20th verse and we know that the Son of God is come and have given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life may God add His blessings to read him his word be seated may the Lord bless you all amen we want to ask thank for the Ron for the opportunity to speak to his congregation we come here we're sister Ruth he is Ruthie here and said brother Wes God bless you all brother Wallace God bless you um sister Ruth he had a baby the other day hey how long has it been six weeks or so and she said you got to come see your grandson so I feel like I needed to come to Arizona to see Ruthie's baby she come to the Lord in our church and married brother Wallace and I'll give brother brother Wes uh is that a is that a mustache or a beard you're wearing brother I got in my mind whenever I think about brother Wesley I think about him being a thief he stole my best musician and we're out of the Arizona amen we love them all with all of our hearts and I just want to maybe I've always told my my church my my wife whenever I come and I've only spoken here a couple times but when I when I preach here I feel like I'm preaching to my own church back in the Bronx you have the same atmosphere that we have over there so it must mean we're preaching the same thing different doctrines produce different atmospheres but brother Brandon said love has to control everything that's done in a congregation and so I know if we preach sound Doctrine it will produce the love of God in the church a loving atmosphere to be able to see all of our little church there in the Bronx we were persevering there now in August or September I think it is 25 years now I've been pastoring there in the Bronx we've survived it all somehow by the grace of God I'm originally from Ohio the Lord sent me there many years ago to start a little church and and then the Lord blessed it and just grew a little bit and he five years ago to pastor and I don't know how we've survived at all but we have by the grace of God and I'd like to say I love the Lord more today than I did 40 years ago when I give my heart to the Lord um I believe the revelation of the the message of the hour will bring us into the revelation of the word there's been so much emphasis on different uh topics certain subjects in the message of the hour and I feel that really the message came to bring us into the the depth of God's word and that's for rapturing faith will come from is the depths of God's word which is God's love extended to us right uh we we've had so many different uh uh I shall I say interpretations of the message over the years I've been in this long enough now that I've seen disciples uh repeat themselves three or four times now you know there's there's always 40 years when I came about 38 years ago when I came there was uh popular ministers and in famous ministers and and then after a few years that that waned and another group came up and and then they that Wayne and another group came up and uh I was uh taught by an Old Saint something very important many years ago when I was just a young boy he told me he said brother Yvonne whenever you see a star arising in the message of the hour he said that's a sign that one day he's going to fall he said there's only one star that never moves and never Falls and that's Jesus Christ the North Star because you remember that don't you ever run it after a rising star you keep your eyes on Jesus Christ and you know that's kept me all these years he gave me something else that I think was very important in my life that especially as a pastor he taught me he said believe on when you listen to a preacheron we've learned over the years when we listen to a preacher we never listen to his words and what he told me is I said well brother how how was that when faith comes by hearing he said no brother he said you don't use your ear to hear you you use you your your ear to see and I said how's that he said while you're here but you're actually seeing because he's taking you somewhere there's an objective a goal that he's trying to retake you to he said now preachers use the message of the hour and the scriptures he said but not every preacher is going to take you to the right goal there's many that are making disciples to themselves their goal is to bring you to themselves he says so when you listen you see you see with your ear and you watch where he's taken you see and you know brother I thank God for that word of advice because it's kept me all these years I usually keep a scorecard when I hear a preacher preaching I keep a scorecard because there's there's uh topics in the messenger of the hour that deal with Redemption and uh brother Branham says that every Everybody born with a portion of faith in their pocket some with a nickel of Faith some with a dollar's worth of faith and you know you go you you have the faith that God's given you you that's just God's grace to your life now if you have a nickel you should invest it you'll get a dime you invest your faith in works right and so I I've learned that when we preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ when we preach the message of the hour every sermon has to have a value of redemption included in the sermon now if we preach uh the scriptures we preach the message but there's no value of redemption that it's just a vain sermon it's just a corporate uh uh speech that we're giving trying to draw people to something else but the gospel came for redemption's sake the message came to bring us into a revelation of that Redemption and so every sermon that we hear we've got to we've got to see a value of redemption in the sermon and I've watched all these different doctrines of the river risen over the years and I don't see any value of redemption in these different interpretations of the message the gospel cannot change it Remains the Same brother Burnham did not come to bring us to the revelation of himself or to the revelation of private Revelation interpretation but he brought us to the revelation of redemption through Jesus Christ Our Lord now it's old-fashioned but the old-time gospels the only one that can save you amen I didn't hear loud enough amen now listen Church uh Redemption comes with joy but see you can have joy and not have Redemption I've seen people run the aisles and and do all the things that Pentecostal people do it's become popular in the message of the hour to run for Jesus even right but that doesn't mean you're redeemed it doesn't mean you redeem Redemption comes through faith in the blood of Jesus Christ there's no other way that's God's provided way you know the absolute is is something that that has been discussed and argued over for years now in the message of the hour I when I came in that was an issue of what's the absolute and and some say it's the written word some say it's the message of the hour some say brother Bam's in absolute but when I study that that topic in the message of the hour I find that brother Branham actually tells us there's about six or seven different kinds of absolutes he says that the written word is an absolute he says an experience with the pillar fire becomes your absolute he said Moses went to Egypt with an absolute which was his Commission he says a vision is an absolute he says a dream is the same as a vision therefore a dream given to you by God is an absolute and he he teaches us also that the revelation of his message becomes an absolute to you so there's a Common Thread through all these absolutes which is the Holy Spirit whatever God does in your life in whatever form he does it becomes an absolute to you but it's not enough the absolute must mature in your life the maturing of the absolute you know the written word is an absolute how many can say Amen but the written word can't save you the Bible says a letter of the word is death to you see there must come a revelation of the written word it's got to mature the Baptists have the written word but the revelation of the word they're lacking in the revelation of the word so it must mature we've got the written word and many of us have a revelation of the written word but still that that Revelation also must mature because the revelation of the word must become the Living Word in your life you've got to become it's got to become the word in flesh in your life so I thank the Lord I prayed about that for for years I prayed and said Lord you know my wrong I put so much emphasis on the written word am I missing something in the message of the hour am I leaving that out but the lord gave me the answer in prayer it really it's a maturing process in our lives and and the goal is to bring you into a manifestation of the word now not with you you go back into the Book of Genesis and you'll see that that God spoke seven six times to create the world Amen Genesis the first chapter but but the Sabbath was in the second chapter when he said it's not good that a man be alone right but then Adam spoke and Adam said this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh because she came from me with the word so the eighth voice was Adam speaking revealing the manifestation of the Bride and I want to title this message the eighth messenger and I I wrote it by your pastor before I I dared I said I want to cause you problems brother because it's a dangerous subject there's been so many different eighth Messengers I I you know I run into one in Peru years ago I run into one in India years ago everybody's got an eighth messenger but scripturally there is an eighth messenger amen and the eighth messenger is the revealer of redemption because you know brother Benham could not reveal Redemption to you he was the seventh passenger there's got to come one after him that takes you into the revelation of true Redemption I don't know if I said that last time I was here I I've used this I I like to use this of every once in a while God will give a minister something that that uh that might help everyone and years ago I was preaching in Mexico somewhere and I was preaching the real real uh humble people of poor Origins they weren't real rich and and so God gave me something to try to explain this to them very simple and I walked out to the end of the Pell platform and I said I'm standing here on the end above a diving board I said now now watch the diving board is built in a certain way there's a power in the diving board but the man that's on the end of the diving board has to know how to use that power and now there's a purpose for the building of that diving board and the purpose is to be able to project this man up into the heavenlies right and I said but the man that's on the diving board has to know how to take that step of faith and when I was a young man I was a really good diver and I I kind of want my wife over what diving she was watching me dive and I kind of seduced her with my diving I could do the flips and all that stuff you know and I learned how to hit that just right so so the minister has to know how to hit that that board just right now the diving board is the messenger of the hour now that's the inspiration that takes a man up into Heavenly places now notice the purpose of the diving board is not just to take you up into Heavenly places but it's also humble you and take you down into the depths of the water now we have lots that get up way up in the Heavenly places and may you stay there up in Heavenly places we have some that don't know how to use the diving board some they get up there and they want to stay up there you know I've had them in my church they walk around with a a tape recorder in your pocket listening to the message while they're in the subway out loud thinking that somehow that's going to produce rapturing faith super religious people that never humble themselves because if God ever reveals a message to you it will bring you down it will humble you you know I've come to the place where there's I realize there's nothing I like about myself I I and I say that sincerely I hate the fact that I lost my hair you know I I don't like the way I dress I dress this week as my wife dresses me this way you know I I don't I can't see myself preach because I don't like the way I preach there's just nothing I like about myself and you know why it's because I love the Lord the more I see him the less I like myself see so so the minister must get up into Heavenly places and then he must go down deep into the depths of God's word the purpose of the message we got too many to get out on the diving board and they say brother banham came brother banham came brother Venom came but it never go anywhere but never take the people to the depth of the word and if you don't take the people into the depth of the word there will be no Rapture in faith in the church rapturing faith comes from the word of God now I'm going to try to explain to you uh you know I I've learned that A good sermon doesn't come because you study a lot uh I think it was uh Spurgeon or maybe maybe it was purging that said this he said oh is John Wesley I think it was he said I'd rather pray three hours and study one hour than to study three hours and pray one hour so uh best sermons I've ever ever preached in my life we one where I I got a thought from God while I was praying see not yo I've had about every experience a Christian can have I I've run the aisles for the Lord the Lord has touched my touched me with anointed made me run and I've I've spun around in circles and I've I've done backflips in church I've done all those things I wasn't in the front row of my church one day and the ministry was preaching and he said something and and the power of God come into church I was the first one out of my seat you know sometimes I'm afraid to even say these things because people want to imitate you have an experience and people want to imitate it right but I'll share this with you I I jumped out of my chair and I raised up like that and right here there was another atmosphere and when I took my hands through that atmosphere I felt 600 volts going through my body and I was just shaking and shaking and I and I was conscious that it was right here I entered into another dimension right so I lowered my hands down and I stopped shaking I said now Lord if that was you let it be there again and I raised my hand up and just as I touched it I felt that electricity going through my body again now this is going on in church and everybody's watching the pastor being real Pentecostal and I'm conscious of that because I don't want people imitating me let them have their own experience sometimes we we get so reserved that pastors you know they just get so reserved they're afraid of these Supernatural things they don't they don't know what to do with them but you know when that happened the second time and I said Lord not only my fingertips my whole body and I just jumped up into it the power of God struck me right here and I flipped and landed in the Pew behind me now my wife's sitting right here she'll tell you she was sitting right next to me when it happened and it was genuine Holy Spirit you know what I found out the next day I was the same person it didn't change me in any way I've run the aisles I spoke in tongues I've done all those things but those things don't change your soul they're a blessing we thank God for them I think they're they're part of a Christian experience but what brought me to Christ was the greatest Revelation you know what it is that I was a sinner you know people think that the revelation of Jesus Christ is the greatest Revelation it really is not the greatest Revelation is that you're a sinner and when you God reveals to you that you're a sinner then you start searching for a savior now God can reveal Christ to you the greatest things that have happened to me that have changed my life happened to me when I was praying in my bedroom by myself just weeping before the Lord and humbly myself and say Lord I I need more of you I I love you Lord I and Lord I'm just worthless in this condition you got to do something to change my life and that's when God Has Come to Me you know how God revealed this message to me I was praying and maybe a year and a half after I started attending quote-unquote a message church and everybody was telling me God sent a prophet and you know I was afraid of a prophet I didn't want that I wanted Christ I didn't want nothing else but I was praying after about a year and a half and I said Lord when I sit down with my tape recorder or my my tape could set player and I listened to this man he makes me weep and I can't stop crying and I sit there with my Bible opening listen to this man's voice and he's he's making me weep and cry and Lord here I am on my knees praying and I said I'm talking to you but the outward man is weeping and crying and I can't stop it what is it about this man's voice that affects me this way I can hear all the other preachers of the world and it doesn't affect me that way what is it about this man's voice that's different and down in the bottom of my soul the Holy Spirit spoke to me you know what he said it's not his voice it's mine and that's when I understood who brother Branham was he was the voice of God for this age it wasn't the voice of these so our Acer the man it was the voice of these sort of man that's why it was affecting me that way the brother and sister we've got to come back you've got to come back to that original fate based on Revelation Redemption is a revelation Revelations 10 10 1 now all of you know the message of the hour you're well taught here it is the Angel of the Lord the angel the Covenant coming down to claim his possession right he's got the book of redemption in his hand and you know you can't place a date on that there's been so much arguing about when it happened in 1963 or when it happened it's an eternal Redemption see it's symbolic of Eternal Redemption I asked the minister one time in Africa he was arguing this point with me I said brother when were you saved he said 1972 I said no brother you were saved before the foundation of the world you just come to a revelation of it in 1972. see the angel the Covenant is the only one that can reveal Redemption to the individual so we see that in Exodus 23 God sends another angel and let me let me just go back to my notes and maybe start preaching to you now now my my desire was it was an Apostolic man that came to my church and he started attending and and he was very very uh uh much afraid of this message and uh so I prayed and I said Lord would you just give me a sermon that's scriptural I can teach him that this message is thus said the lord it's in the scripture I said give me something Lord I need something in the scripture that will help him understand this message and so the lord gave me this message and we've preached it now to be able to confirm and establish that the end time message is a bible-based fact that has brought us to a promise from God for the intention of a complete restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ we're not we're not preaching the sermon uh with uh the intention of exalting ourselves or anyone else we want to exalt Christ and Christ alone it's God's Redemptive work God that's given us this wonderful gospel it's God that's restored us back to the original faith notice the word was never restored it's our faith that must be restored in the word God the word is God never backslides he doesn't need resurrect it's our faith that needs restoration so God wants to restore us back to our original positions and there is an eternal truth that is an encouragement to me personally that man's fall is not greater than God's love I don't care how far you've gone God's love is greater than your fault and your fall man's fault obligates God's love to manifest itself as the grace of God and there's a thought a hidden thought in the heart of God that's on display in humanity and it that comes into display when we have a need his reaction to our knee is to supply away to supply our needs oh I'm so thankful that he made a way for me so we see that this message came it's God's way of supplying our need to overcome this Dark Age we live in now we know that whatever God does he does it the same over and over again the title is the eighth messenger but the subject is cyclical Redemption Redemption comes in Cycles and the cycle never changes whenever God redeems you always redeems the same way he doesn't have to change his way of redemption somehow or another I hope this isn't wrong I I don't want you to under misunderstand me but I I do not believe that that you can be redeemed solely by a message book it comes by a revelation of the blood of Jesus Christ when Christ was hanging on the cross he did not bleed ink he bled blood I know the devil doesn't like that but that's the truth see it was suffering that paid the price of our Redemption he was blocked and it's a revelation of that blood that that saves a man and brings him into Redemption now the the fall of Man introduced God's provided way which was the death of an innocent and we already said that there were six voices that God used for the creation the seventh voice came in Chapter 2 and the eighth voice was Adam himself declaring the manifestation of his bride and then they fell into sin and God revealed his way of redemption which was the death of an innocent one that sets the pattern for the entire Bible Hallelujah theologians call it the identic dispensation the dispensation of Eden but after the dispensation of Eden the Bible is essentially made up of three dispensations Patriarchs dispensation the dispensation of the law of Moses and the dispensation of Grace in every dispensation in every cycle of dispensation there's also a cycle of redemption and that cycle never changes praise the Lord Hallelujah now let me show you I I believe God is showing us these things because he wants us to to have our hearts completely filled with faith in his word now in in that the first dispensation the dispensation of the patriarch God actually had seven voices in those seven in that first dispensation of the Patriarchs the first voice was Enoch the second voice was Noah the third voice was Abraham the fourth voice was Isaac the fifth voice was Jacob the sixth voice was Joseph and the seventh voice was Moses which was a restoration prophet and what did he do he introduced or reintroduced the original lamb at Passover but that could not bring them across the promised land and into the promised land because we know Redemption is twofold brother random said it's going it's coming out and going in and the restoration Prophet has to manifest that are coming out and going in Moses brought them out but Moses could not take them in there was a need for innate messenger and the eighth messenger is the one that took them into the Promised Land which is the holy spirit himself the messenger the Covenant revealed as the pillar fire I want to just stop and think about that a little bit do you know why the Red Sea opened up because the eighth messenger came to defend the blood of the Covenant Pharaoh could not destroy the Redemptive work that God was doing and the Red Sea could not be a hindrance the pillar fire had to come and confirm the blood of the Covenant what was it that took Israel across the promised land what was it that provided the manner and the water from the rock it was the pillar of fire confirming the blood of the Covenant I want you to know that if you take part in this Redemptive cycle there's got to be an eight Covenant eighth messenger in your life that's going to guarantee your passage into the Promised Land Hallelujah that's why the pillar fire disappeared once they cross over into the promised land the pillar fire had fulfilled its purpose of complacon fulfilling the promise that God gave the people anything that came against that promise the angel of the Covenant was there to protect and and fulfill and confirm the promise that God had given to people now if you study the scriptures you'll see that the pillar of fire reveals the power of the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah you have no power in your life until the the faith or the Revelation in the blood becomes a reality to you and that's when the pillar of fire comes into your life taking it back to the the The Upper Room in Acts the second chapter what the pillar of fire did did was come in and confirm the promise that Christ had given to people we've got to get back to the original Pentecostal faith and we can't do it unless we preach the blood of Jesus Christ it's God's provided way oh it becomes so unpopular to preach the blood of Jesus Christ but the Bible teaches me praise the Lord it's the power of God unto salvation if you want power in the church you've got to preach the blood of Jesus Christ there's no other way to bring power into a church but the preaching of the Cross is what brings the power of God into a church brother bam said you can't get the Pentecost unless you come through Calvary Hallelujah the problem is the people that want to pay the price because there's also a mystery in the preaching of the cross the denominational curse is that they preach Christ crucified but they never say the bride must be crucified they never teach you that you've got to be dying his likeness you've got a rot Hallelujah before you can ever be raised again in the likeness of Christ that's really the denominational curse they preached the Cross of Christ but they Don't Preach your cross do you know the Rich Young Ruler he he had a pretty good religion and Jesus quoted five Commandments to him and every one of those Commandments dealt with his relationship with him and other parts of humanity but Jesus said well if you want to have a good relationship with the father you've got to sell all you have and distribute to the poor take up your cross and follow me and the Bible says he became very sad because he had much riches and much lands much possessions Amen in other words it's religion the religion he was practicing didn't touch his pocketbook he was in a religion of appearances he appeared to be righteous but a surrendered heart to almighty God we're going to cost them something oh you I can't it's it's difficult for me to preach this in New York City because the rents are high cost of living is really high in New York City see but if you follow that Mark the 10th chapter the next verse he says nobody can enter into the kingdom of God unless they become like one of these little children in other words depended on the father and that's the evil of that kind of religion see you you depend on your money to save you instead of Christ saving you see the Bible says he was very sad and he walked away and brother Branham actually said he turned away from salvation why because it was going to cost them something oh maybe maybe I should preach hezekiah's Revival brother Ron you ever studied job hezekiah's Revival go back and study your church over in the book of Kings you'll find out it Hezekiah the first thing he did was cleanse the ministry and then the second thing he did was cleanse the altar that he cleansed the temple then he went out and cleansed the people and the last thing he did the seventh step was He restored a tithing Covenant strange that hezekiah's Revival actually finished with the restoration of of tithings in the church I thought well why why that way well it was simple because they were unclean he had to cleanse the ministry first because the unclean Ministry can't clean the altar of a man's heart an unclean Ministry can't cleanse the temple can't cleanse the temple or the people but once you get the people all cleaned up now you can preach tithing to them and restore the Covenant of tithing to the people you know I was thinking about preaching that actually but the Lord changed my mind I don't think we have that problem here maybe somebody out there on the internet has that problem but if you don't give your tithing is it because you're unclean and go back and study the scriptures or bring you into a revelation of what you really are you got an unclean heart you haven't surrendered yourself you're like the Rich Young Ruler you still have the root of all evil in your heart the Love of Money she's kind of thinking to you but that's the way I preach at my church you know I got to preach it this way in New York City brother I have to preach it this way yeah you know I I I'm so thankful I'm so thankful that the Lord revealed to me when I went to New York City that I didn't have to depend on the people for my support see I don't have to worry about that there's 20 message churches in New York City choose wherever you want to go it don't matter but here we're going to teach you the right thing Let's see we will understand that you'll never understand the gospel until the Son of God comes into your life see the Son of God has given us understanding and the Son of God is another term for the Holy Spirit notice John didn't say the son of man has given us understanding he said the Son of God has given us understanding Moses was the seventh but the eighth was the pillar fire himself and he came to reveal the power that was in that blood now we go on to the next dispensation and we find out that it's the dispensation of Moses dispensation of Moses we find there's seven Messengers major Messengers that God sent to Israel during the time of this dispensation the pattern the cycle of redemption repeats itself starts with Samuel and the reason we start with Samuel is because Israel had fallen into idolatry in judges the 17th chapter Joshua took him into the Promised Land judges begins with the first and second chapter and then chapter 17 actually belongs historically between chapter 2 and 3. Michael oh boy isn't that something Michael deciser have a house Church the ark was in Shiloh but he set up an eye on his house and he hired a levite to become his priest that was the beginning of idolatry in Israel a house Church you see how the Cycles repeat themselves the age we're living in it it's an indication of a fall from the grace of God because God said you've got to come to my altar Redemption Comes This Way it doesn't come any other way let me get off that subject starts with Samuel then we have Elijah we have Isaiah we have Jeremiah we have Ezekiel we have Daniel and then we have John the Baptist as the seventh voice and once again he is a restoration prophet just as Moses left he come out and he took the people in we find John the Baptist comes out from the Pharaoh the religion of the Pharisees and the Sadducees he comes out of the Jewish religion he's the restoration prophet and he introduces the original Land once again the restoration Prophet always says Behold the Lamb of God oh Hallelujah but it's not enough the messenger of the Covenant had to come reveal this Pillar of Fire at Pentecost and that messenger reveals the power that's in the blood of the Lamb and he is the protector of the Covenant when you see a man backslide and leave the message of the hour it's because the eighth messenger was never in his life the eighth messenger confirms the message of the seventh messenger Hallelujah and reveals the power of the blood to the individual we are of the opinion that we cannot preach this message unless God reveals it to us the same way he revealed it to the prophet we're not here as parents repeating what the prophet said but we have to be Eagles and get up high in the Heavenly places and receive it directly from God the same way brother Branham received it from God amen a preacher preaches what God reveals to him on a personal basis we're not here to repeat what other people say we know that that message that diving board is the inspiration and the things we see we would not be able to see without the inspiration of this message in our life it takes us up into Heavenly places in Christ and reveals the word of God to us and it produces the faith that's unfailing I don't care what the circumstances are God has made you an overcomer Hallelujah every age had a promise to the overcomer and every age has a bride that overcomes Spirit that's working in her age the Antichrist Spirit changes forms and produces a bachelor in church but the brother Christ is able to overcome because Revelation says because of the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of the lamb and the word of her testimony and they love not their lives unto death overcoming power only comes one way through the original Gospel of Jesus Christ once again that dispensation starts with a prophet ends with a prophet a restoration prophet and of course we know under Grace Covenant dispensation there's been seven Messengers that have come we'll repeat them to you although you'll probably know better than me Paul and iranius and Martin and Columba and Luther and John Wesley and Elijah's Spirit William Branham has a restoration prophet and what his message is he re-introduced the Lamb of God the original lamb that's why Revelations the fifth chapter is the introduction into the seals because without a revelation of that lamb that John saw there is no revelation of the Seven Seals in your life the messenger the Covenant revealed as the pillar of fire in this age this is why the pillar fire had to appear over the prophet's head as the witness of the eighth messenger Hallelujah that picture was no coincidence it was God revealing the eighth messenger that was present in the seven Messengers life Hallelujah it still has to be present in our churches the eighth messenger must be present in our congregations because he is a revelation he is a revelation and he is the revealer of the blood of Jesus Christ it's a return to the Pentecostal message it's a return to the Lamb of God brother Benham tells us in the invasion of the United States He said I'd like to show how the seven Church ages typed out in the Old Testament how they began just exactly like at the beginning of the church ages of the Gentile Church and went right down through a similar Dark Age and come out into the Glorious time of Pentecost at the falling of the holy spirit in the early church then going through another period of the idential church in other words another cycle of redemption Israel fell into idolatry and God re redeemed Israel true Israel was redeemed at Pentecost it was a cycle of redemption and that cycle is repeated itself in our last day in this continuous revelation of God's Redemptive work we see that God in every dispensation exhibits displays his work of restoration in the same way in every dispensation there are seven Messengers that culminate in a restoration listen to this church it's a restoration that reveals the very heart of almighty God the heart filled with thoughts of rubber of redemption it's a worship God produces Worship in a church in a church that doesn't worship has no revelation of redemption the Bible says the living they Worship the Lord they praised God but the dead prays not the Lord we're a people in a revelation of what Redemption is all about we see it all through the scriptures God's Abiding Love in Cycles redeeming his people always the same way recently I was preaching in my church and I said I know I know I'm in the on the right track because we're exalting the Lamb of God we're lifting him up and people are coming to Christ Hallelujah the message is intended to do that very thing to bring us into a revelation of the love of God 's love to The Sinner who hated God I hated God but God loved me and all my ignorance God loved me and he sent that eighth messenger into my life through a work called Calvary not only Jesus dying on the cross but we're coming to a place of surrender I'm gonna I'm gonna give this little testimony for the young people in the church we we have your people in this struggle in their life the raising the message and and they're taught to give all the right answers I was speaking to a young man recently and he's being very respectful I took him out for a steak dinner and he was being very respectful and I said brother you're in the most dangerous part of your life and he said why I said because you got all the right answers your mother and father have had devotions with you every night all your life and and you've heard the message of the hour you've heard brother brother Yvonne preaching to you all your life and you know just what to say every time I ask you a question you give me the right answer I said but see brother it takes more than that it takes a surrender and I said listen brother I I came to a place in my life where I heard a man preaching about a life i hidden live with Christ and I and I had decided after that sermon that I just couldn't live that kind of life so I got on my knees and I said Lord I'm going to leave this church and I'm never coming back I can't live that kind of life I just can't I got to the door to leave and something just spoke to me and said the bridges are all burnt where are you going to go you know the message of the hour is the last stop it's the last bus stop there are no more of the stops when I come to this message I realize there's no place else for me to go I can't escape it I'm responsible for what I've come to so I went home that night and I told my wife I'm gonna go in my room and settle this with God and I went in my bedroom and locked the door and I got on my knees and started praying that once again don't go home and think you have to do the same thing to come to the same conclusion but don't do the same thing and I got rolled around in a carpet and beating on the carpet and you know and every time God God asked me for something more in my life I struggled to give it up give up your job I was I was I had a great job working for General Motors I was a skilled Tradesman I made lots of money and I was very comfortable and the Lord this was 1988 I was just a young man and he said are you willing to give up your job well I struggled for an hour before I said yes are you willing to give up your family I struggled for another hour wrestling with myself you know what it is is a death you give up your Ambitions for the future give up your children and I struggled and I prayed and I got to a place where the Ron I started beating my head on the wall fighting with myself fighting with my flesh but thank the Lord I come to a place where I surrendered everything to the Lord I was drenched in sweating my wife was worried because I was screaming and yelling at the Devil again in my life and you know yeah yeah you can call me Pentecostal if you want to but he got me someplace you don't have to do it that way you don't have to do it the way I I didn't know any other way to do it but I knew I wanted Christ I wanted to hit life with Christ see I come out of the Catholic church but I wanted to get into Christ I wanted to have that relationship that the prophet had I wanted to hear the voice of God and it took a labor prayer until I finally pushed past all my desires of life and I broke through into the presence of God and my life began to change I stopped being just a church member God began to give me open Visions I had open Visions God began to speak in my ear and I began to have Supernatural experiences with the Lord in a month or two after I had that experience the Lord revealed to me I was going to New York City a year and a half before I actually moved there before I actually went there to start the church and so my life changed because I surrendered everything to Christ so you know what happened the eighth messenger came into my life I had this seventh messenger but the eighth messenger came the seventh Mentor messenger took me out of Egypt but the eighth messenger took me into the Promised Land so I challenge you young people don't just sit on your on your chair or do nothing God wants to use you last month I was giving this testimony in my church I said there's there's a young man here that God wants to use I said I don't know who he is but I feel the pool to say that you if God wants more out of your life you know a month later a man approached me he actually holds an office remember you mentioned this last month I said yes sir he said that was me brother God wants more on me and he just started to weeping I said well what what is it God's asking he said I don't know I said well brother make it your life mission to find out do you know that the only people that will go on the Rapture are those that are found in Christ you know what Christ represents the perfect will of God if you live in the permissive will of God being a message believer you'll stay behind only those that are found in the perfect will of God will go into rapture that is the magnet that's what God uses a man that surrenders himself to walk in the perfect will of God that's what's going to be magnetized nothing else there's more and more to this life to be offered God wants us to come into Christ completely so we see that the cycle of redemption and every dispensation was always the same it always ended with a restoration Prophet revealing the original way which was the the blood of an innocent one and the the eighth messenger of the Holy Spirit coming to confirm it and reveal it to the individual can I ask you to stand we'll have a word of Prayer we'd like to pray for the young people especially really have a burden for you in my heart this age we're living in father you know the things I've said are true Lord I had to fight Lord I had to struggle against myself what the prophet said his true Lord that his worst enemies was William Branham and Lord we find that our worst enemy is this flesh Lord full of ambition and worldly desire Lord the lust of the eye and the lust of the flesh Lord the pride of life Lord that's what we struggle against father the seventh Angels come and we see he said the same thing John the Baptist said he said Behold the Lamb of God and all he did was repeat what Samuel said father the first messenger in his dispensation Samuel also said Behold the Lamb of God the Lord it takes the pillar of fire to take us into Christ Lord I pray for these young people Lord right now Lord perhaps you're speaking to some young man some little sister Lord perhaps you're asking a little more from them Lord a complete surrender so that Pentecost could come into their life so that they could actually have a relationship with that eighth messenger Lord would you do it right now Lord speak to their heart confirm it to them Lord let them not be afraid oh God because you're a good God you promise to take us into a land full of milk and milk enough you promised to give us the victory over all the enemies we committed to you we thank you for this opportunity to share oh God what we see oh God will we believe concerning this message Lord bless your people father we pray the Holy Spirit have his way let the adults oh God be an encouragement to the young people father let them make that phone call extend that hand show the love of God to them Lord they need that father O Lord and let love control everything that's done here father we pray may the Lord [Music] I should probably [Music] amen [Music] brother Branham said if I'm not the one [Music] perhaps I have not done what I was supposed to do there'll be another one come after me he said you know there'll not be two of us here at the same time do you see the diving board I've always told you the platform that he laid he said I'm a son of man revealing to you the son of man there is another messenger we're not looking for another man we're looking for the son of man son of man is now having a Ministry but is the holy spirit speaking to each and every one of you the seventh messenger brought you out of Egypt the eighth messenger the holy spirit is taking you now into every promise can you say Amen to that that's why there's been so many that said I'm the one I'm that one I'm the eighth messenger they're missing the real messenger that comes after John the Baptist said look I I come I'm laying up a platform but the baptism I give you is under repentance there's one coming after me that is so much greater for he'll baptize you with the Holy Spirit and Fire many people miss it and I like what he said how that you wrestle with God you yourself in your prayer closet Lord I'm where I'm supposed to be if not father deal with me amen amen thank you brother Yvonne I appreciate that the cycle of redemption begin to see that God does exactly the same thing repeats it over and over amen I Surrender another cycle is going on right now oh I Surrender Lord I Surrender my life and all to you surrender [Music] surrender foreign Lord I Surrender my life we give it all to you let's sing it as our prayer right now oh I surrender how many of you say I do I Surrender maybe there's a
