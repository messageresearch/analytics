passed away yesterday I believe it was so let's remember the McGary family the entire family in prayer pray the Lord just be their strength and their comfort at this time and if you have a need this morning if you want to lift that before the Lord but ask brother Russell to come and take us to the Lord and share his testimony this morning brother good morning Saints morning thank you for giving me a minute just to give share a testimony with you that's really fresh for us a couple of them my wife just got back from Back East she's been back there caring for mother I wanted to thank you Saints for your prayers for which is my mother-in-law my wife's mother sister Donna Phillips so it's tomorrow will be a month that she fell down the stairs there and and broke five ribs but the medical people said 100 the odds of pneumonia are 100% when you're 87 years old and You' broken five ribs and and it's because I've had broken ribs too it's really you don't want to breathe deep you just breathe shallow you don't want to move you and so at that age if you're not breathing deep and you're not moving they say 100% so that's pretty scary odds but thank God for the power of prayer and we thank you for your prayers and she Elizabeth was kind of the drill sergeant for her she had her doing laps around the living room every day she wasn't allowed to sit in the rocking chair she did 50 or 60 laps a day she had a little chart she had to check them off as she went and uh and she's her lungs are clear it's a month now she's she'll be out of danger and so we're thankful for [Applause] that I saw brother Amos when I came in I know he's been under quite a strain with his business there and and I've been remembering him in prayer all so daily and uh I saw him this morning he thumbs up he said it's going excellent the Lord's on the scene so thankful for that too but let me give you this testimony from just yesterday oh let me read you this brother R says oh if you only knew that in your hand Christ gave us the authority with his name by being Christians the most powerful weapon the world has ever known prayer it changes everything so we if you live in Arizona you know that our water table has been dropping for 20 years uh um we drilled well almost 30 years ago there at the ranch it was 35 gallons a minute and excellent well but for years and years I noticed 20 years ago we were diminishing 12 years ago we were at 3 gallons a minute from 35 and it's continued to drop so we were at the point recently where we were making a little less than one qut a minute which is only 14 gallons an hour so very the well was basically dry so we redrilled this week and the new well was we don't have a pump in it so it couldn't say for sure but the well drillers said very low production well but I'm thankful for anything it wasn't dry um but let me give you I'll just read this cuz it'll make it more concise this is my little testimony I put on our family chat here last night at 10:30 last night so this is pretty fresh I have a testimony that is beyond any scientific explanation it is a miracle straight from the hand of God I'm ashamed to say that I can be a bit of a skeptic and my faith is often quite weak I remember eight years ago when the goodwi fire swept through here I'll always remember the morning that the fire reached our property line when Wesley and I got on the quad to take the back route out of here and my faith was very weak I said to Wesley everything we have is going to burn to the ground there will be nothing left so this is a precious memory that I'll have forever Wesley said dad even if it wasn't God's will to preserve our property he would change his mind because so many Saints are praying one week ago you were all gracious enough to ask the Lord's blessing on our new well we were drilling as you recall I told you 10 days ago that our well had been diminishing for years and was the worst ever currently at less than one Court per minute I know this well like an old friend for years now I have regularly tested the output and kept a chart in recent history I can tell you that in March of 2022 we were at 8/10 of a gallon per minute October of 2023 down to6 gallons per minute August of 24.5 55 Gall per minute and Jan this January 202 5.23 Gall per minute so this has been our worst month ever with the well only producing 14 gallons per hour so we couldn't even Seth and Jessica are there from Canada told they can't give the kids little short bass don't fill the tub up you know and and so here's the testimony this afternoon I went this is yesterday this afternoon I went down to the Wellhead to do another volume test for the test I bypass the safety switch and kick the pump on full-time in less than 10 minutes the water's all pumped out and the pump starts sucking air I then turn the pump off let the well recharge for 15 minutes done this for years turn it back on and check the volume today after 10 minutes it was not sucking air after an hour it had still not pumped dry it's been on this is 10:30 last night it's been on now for 8 hours and it's still not sucking air the Lord I checked our storage tanks and we have pumped 1,00 gallons in the last 8 hours this is an impossibility the impoverished well was only producing 112 gallons in 8 hours just a week ago it could be proposed that the new drilling activity affect affected the old well that's what the devil would like to tell you but there's no chance of that the new well is on the farthest northeast corner of our property 60 Acres away from this one wow hope was quite excited that's my little granddaughter hope she's 6 years old six or seven she was quite excited when went down with me all afternoon regularly to check the output she said to me we were all praying for the new well and the Lord healed the old one too hallelujah thank you Lord I'm so humbled and thankful to the Lord for a supernatural intervention and then this morning I put on our family chat this morning's update our 3,000 gallons of storage tanks are full in the water is overflowing onto the ground it's so surreal it's to me it's so surreal to be in the middle of a supernatural event that's right it really is your hand your head kind of it's real though it really is amen God answers prayer if you have a need once again hold it before the Lord as we bow this morning Heavenly Father you heard the needs that were spoken across the desk this morning Father and throughout the world what it must be Lord the needs of thy people but how we serve an almighty God we thankful Lord that you hear our cry we certainly have confidence in faith and know that you do and and Lord whatever comes our way we know it passes through thy hand first thank you Lord that the enemy has no power over a child of God except what you would allow him so we rest in this Lord and we're thankful for answered prayers Lord Lord and we're thankful for this great privilege we have to call on you our father so we bring these needs this morning that have been presented Lord ask that you would answer according to thy Divine will Lord we thank you for the opportunity to still gather together and honor the resurrection this day we invite your presence Lord to come and to visit with us this day we commit now this service Lord the remainder into thy care and we commit ourselves to thee in all things we want to say we love you Lord and we're thankful to belong to you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen you may be seated this morning God is good this

you um remember the rubley family brother Daniel rubble's wife has passed away and also I don't know if any of you knew that Richard Gage had passed away a couple weeks ago also so just remembering those families there in prayer sure there's always a tearing away but we know we have a hope not as others who have no hope but we have a hope knowing that soon and very soon we're going to see our loved ones that has crossed over okay why because we're being caught up together to meet them huh and we which are alive and remain so we're still here we're still fighting to fight but guess what one of these days brother Bram said we're going to be all caught up the reason I know I'm going to be caught up then as I'm already caught up amen amen this message has already caught you up it's already gathered you captivated you pressed you towards the mark of the High Calling amen amen brother Dave Maple God bless you good to have you here this morning also galatian chapter 2 if you'll turn in your Bibles please galatian 2: 18 verses 3 and9 for if I build again the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor for I through the law law am dead to the law that I might live unto God Amen I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me in the Life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me thank you Lord I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by by the law then Christ is dead in vain that's right oh my what a scripture for if righteousness come by the law then Christ died in vain Romans chapter 3 if you would Romans 3 verses 20- 28 therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin amen but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all that believe for there is no difference how many of you believe amen even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all verse 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God Amen being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are pass through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believe in believeth in Jesus where is boasting then it's excluded by what law or of Works nay but by the law of Faith somebody say the law of Faith the law of Faith it's a law amen therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law praise the Lord go to Ephesians now if you would for a moment Ephesians chap 4 that you put off concerning the former conversation of the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lust and be renewed by the spirit of your mind that you put on the new man yes which after God is created in the righteousness and true Holiness amen notice this creation put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness thank you Lord heavenly father as we have read your word there is such power there was such stimulation quickening power that transformed us from one glory to another I pray heavenly father have thy way this morning and Lord as I have waited upon you and sought what I should speak this morning these people are well taught they love you but I pray Heavenly Father come and just open another portion of your great Redemption give us the isev of Revelation give us the stimulation of the holy spirit that comes by way of re reation yes Lord Quicken Our Lives Lord that they might live a life according to Thy word we thank you we Praise You In Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can all be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord amen I would like to take my title I've got quite a bit here this morning um and so uh I don't wish to go quickly but I want to do it efficiently amen amen and so I'd like to title my sermon this morning created by God in his righteousness and true Holiness praise the Lord talk about the stature of a perfect man that's it created by God yes he's the author and the finisher of our faith that's right created by by God in his righteousness and true Holiness oh thank you Lord you talk about The Great Exchange he became me that I might become him how many believe that how many of you say that's me amen it's not by works of of righteousness thank you but by his grace alone hallelujah amen and I would like to take a subject this morning of the righteousness of God Amen I've been meditating on this thought for the past couple days and thinking about the righteousness of God and its effect upon the believer and and when we look through the scriptures we recognize that God is a holy God and he is a righteous God and Holiness and righteousness go together and no man shall be able to dwell in the presence of God without being holy and righteous in his sight icus 19: 1 and 2 the Bible says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel and saying unto them ye shall be holy for the Lord your God am Holy for I the Lord your God am Holy Amen in Hebrews 12:14 follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord Lord 2 Corinthians 7:1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from our from all our filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God how do we perfect our Holiness how is it that we get to where we can be perfect in the eyes of God because I'll tell you when we try to do this in our human flesh we fall miserably so I want to take you a little bit higher I want to I want to take a fear away from some of you about your walk with God and how that you see your faults and failures but I don't want to look at it from carnal perspective through human eyes through human efforts but but I want to look through Godly eyes and how the god perceives you amen us the Bible says that without Holiness no man shall see God so what is Holiness how do we get it Webster defines holy as being the result or attribute that belongs to and is derived from being associated with a divine power oh Hallelujah so what it's doing is it's creating a union between man and God and Holiness is derived from being associated with the divine power praise the Lord hallelujah amen it's regarded with or worthy of worship or veneration it also means living according to a strict or highly moral religious or spiritual system becoming saintly also means specified or set apart for a religious purpos amen all of these things are the definition of being holy amen holy in Greek actually comes from hagos which means sacred it means physically pure morally pure blameless it means consecrated before god wow how can we become only all of the above attributes all pertain to the Christian in his walk with God right it is his Union and association with God that makes him holy amen remember it's not you being holy it's him being holy God's not looking at you he's looking at your [Applause] lamb there is nothing within yourselves that you can do to make yourselves holy it's the association with the divine power praise the Lord that's what makes us holy it's not doing the things that God tells us to do that makes us holy that just shows we become obedient doesn't make you holy makes you obedient amen it is the Revelation that comes from God that makes the Christian holy Revelation is the divine power power from God that transforms The Believer from carnal to spiritual and yes brother Russell we are sometimes skeptical we can see what God does for others but a lot of times with ourselves ah yeah well it's just that way might as well drill another hole and this and that and everything instead of praying over the old one but you know what you have not because you ask not amen you know God has done Miracles around Wells from Genesis to Revelation that's right and then God just comes along and goes from 2 to so many gallons per minute until let things overflow am Hallelujah I think I'd have had a jubilee and run around that that water tank i' have been shouting and glory to God because he's super natural he's a supernatural God and your union with him has Associated you with a divine power and that power is what's going to deliver you it is that power that is changing you prise the Lord amen thank you Jesus man all or carnal knowledge only conforms you yeah I know what to do yeah I know yeah I should do this yes I know see that's carnal knowledge that doesn't keep you head knowledge produces self-righteous Works Revelation from God transforms you thank you it's not you doing it because someone told you to do it it's because it was revealed to you once it's revealed to you you don't have to tell a sister not to cut her hair once it's revealed to her case dismissed amen it's over it's done I got it let's go to the next one see what I'm saying once you catch one thing and God reveals it to you then what he does is he said are you ready for step two are you ready for the next thing because I want you to come up higher I want you to understand this message that has come from God yeah was sent by God so that you might know your position in Christ that you might ascend from this carnal life down here into the very heavenlies being caught up together Hallelujah do you understand this is not Creeds dogmas traditions of man it's not long dresses uncut hair uh washed faces that is all works but the reason that you do what you do is because God revealed to you Holiness he revealed to you those things and when you give it back to God God cannot deny his own word that's right praise the Lord hallelujah Hebrews 4 and 2 for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them remember them in the first Exodus but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it what we're lacking among the church within the messages today around the world is Holy Ghost Revelation that's the power that will transform the church many of the Believers have conformed to the message but it's not been physically or let me call it spiritually revealed to them in their soul you've been conformed you've been molded under pressure and take the pressure off how would you live if there was no one around to see the way you're living amen good question than you Lord would you still believe what you believe if you were the only one and there was no one else around or would you compromise because everyone else around you will hey you know their definition of what a Christian will do when they look at you with a long dress and you men trying to do what's right not going out there and drinking and partying with the rest of them cuz that's culture I I want you to understand we in America have a culture yeah it's it's our culture eat drink and be merried for tomorrow we die Africa has a culture India has a culture Philippines has a culture but I want you to realize that when you come to Christ you have something greater than culture it's not your culture that rules you it's not your C culture that that rules the way you have a wedding amen well it's our culture come on since when does our culture come in here and keep us from having a wedding that is Holy before God it's our American culture here in America that hey without uh without being a Christian and Holy Ghost filled and trying to do what's right go to a worldly wedding they have open bar have dancing and music and it's just a big freefor all that's culture I want more than culture I want relationship with him now let's look at another scripture in 1 Peter chap 1: 13- 16 wherefore G up the loin of your mind amen and be sober and and hope to the end for the grace that is be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust and your ignorance but as he which called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy amen amen now Paul admonishes the Roman Church let me show you in Romans 10 1-4 Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved it's talking about all of Israel amen for I bear them record that they they have a Zeal for God but not according to knowledge wouldn't it be some to have all this Zeal and no knowledge of why you're doing what you're doing right so they had all the the Zeal about keeping the law and washing the cups and washing your hands and saying prayers and all of this stuff and it became a ritual that's right so he says verse three for they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness having not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God amen for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth amen Christ is the end of the law for righteousness in other words it's none of your works of righteousness that you can do but it's what Christ has done for you oh Hallelujah man's always tried to earn his way to heaven always uh thought about how perhaps he can make a way for eternal life keeping the laws and Commandments tends to produce self-righteous people yeah this message unfortunately unfortunately is filled with many self-righteous Believers true I'm glad I'm not like that guy come on looking down at everybody else instead of looking down let's look up am I spoke to Harold Becket the other day about visiting him in South Africa which I'm not going to be able to have the opportunity when I go this Easter to go visit him but he's always got cliches stick with your pastor you'll grow faster you know uh leave your pastor nothing but disaster and he says you know brother Ron he says when I look down I get depressed but when I look up I get inspired amen so it just depends on which way you're looking let us not look down at somebody else or I'm glad measuring ourselves by ourselves we're not wise that's right some of your own children will come home with their report card and say I did better than uh 30% of the kids in the class or whatever and they you know I remember my daughter Rebecca uh every time she was bringing home her uh uh her test it was amazing cuz every every one of them was 100% 100% and Sandy asked Rebecca one time well do you ever make an error yeah but I don't bring those tests [Applause] home I just want you to know when I got 100% it was so different than Matthew Matthew said uh you know we he had a pretty low grade and I said Matt what's the deal well I I I've got a better grade than three other kids in my class see the his sights were not so high that's right because you're measuring yourselves by yourselves you don't become wise instead of looking at one another let us look to Christ he is the measuring post by which all of us should be measuring ourselves not looking at others but looking to him right as I read to you there in Romans 10 he said I want all of Israel to see but he says for being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about establishing their own righteousness how sad having not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believes I want I want to hand you something this morning spiritually speaking I want you to understand that what Christ has done for you and the price he has paid yeah and what he has given to you makes you into his righteousness amen wow amen right how can he do it so we'll look into this if your works could gain you the right to eternal life life then Jesus Christ died in vain we're not here to try to build another Tower of Babel that we might earn our way or make our way unto heaven but God has provided to you an access into the heavenlies that you might attain to a higher place than where you're at now thank you Lord hallelujah you have an access that access is through Christ Christ amen he said I am the way and the truth and the life and no man comes to the father but by me but through him and in him is the access because he said I am the door Hallelujah keeping the law and Commandments of God many times makes us self-righteous people if we're not careful we'll turn this message into Creeds and dogmas we will we just become religious we'll become a modern-day menonite okay because we all dress the same way we all act the same way we all go to church etc etc but just as the Pharisees and the sades the religious leaders of the world of that in that day took the word of God and turned it into Traditions oh God help us especially we ministers that we never bring it down to traditions and Creeds and dogmas amen Isaiah picks this up in Isaiah 64: 4-6 for since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by ear neither hath the eye seen oh God beside thee what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him thou meet us him that rejoices and worketh righteousness those that re remember thee in thy ways behold thou art wroth for we have sinned in those is continuance and we shall be saved for we are all as an unclean thing and all out our righteousness are as filthy rags am and we all do fate as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind ha taken us away God does not impute his righteousness to to us through the lawkeeper that's right if you have broken any of his laws if you say well I live by the Ten Commandments I have kept ke the law since my youth if you have broken any laws or any Commandments then you become the breaker of all of his laws that's right because the Bible says in James 2 and 10 for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all amen wow now I want to ask you which one of you is without guilt yeah I never murdered anybody yeah but did you talk about them I never committed adultery yeah but did you look with a lustful eye do you see what I'm saying pretty soon now if you're guilty in one part you're guilty of all so now we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ thank you Lord and for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God through Jesus Christ is eternal life hallelujah amen you talk about a great exchange amen huh I gave him my old tattered garment he gave me a robe of pure wire thank you Jesus that's what the father of the prodigal son did when he saw his son yet a far off and he turned and came to himself and while he was yet a far off the father saw him coming he said kill the fatted calf get the robe get the ring Hallelujah I wanted to have a feast but some self-righteous brother who had never done wrong said you never did it for me how many times do we have attitudes rise up within a church of people that don't rejoice when the prodigal comes home amen help us lord well I you never did that for me and I I've never gone well come on quit being self-righteous let us rejoice even as the Heaven and the angels do Rejoice at a sinner that comes to repentance hallelujah amen sir God help us to all have the right kind of attitude yes Paul is a Pharisee had kept the law but but when Grace was revealed to him concerning the keeping of the law he considered all he had done in keeping the law as D let's take a look at that in the scriptures if you don't mind well look at Philippians 3 did I give you that scripture to read brother Mark Philippians 3 verses 3-10 for we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh no confidence in what flesh that's right though I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I more if you think you're goody two shoes let me show you about me if anybody's going to brag says now let me just brag a moment go ahead circumcise The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin and Hebrew of the Hebrews a Hebrew of Hebrews as touching the law a Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless and touching righteousness according to the law nobody could talk against me go ahead but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ these things that I thought were I was embracing and oh my I had my little cloak of self-righteousness and I thought I'm doing pretty good yeah go ahead yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ amen and be found in him having not mine own not having mine own righteousness look at this which is of the law look at this but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith read that again the righteousness which is of god by faith start verse n all over again and be found in him go ahead and be found in him let me turn the page here oh yeah that's what it was that's what it was that's what it was oh that was a glitch a little something in your brain there like I get all the time when I'm talking to my wife and I go to walk into the other room and by the time I get there it's in cyberspace go ahead not having thine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith the the righteousness which is of god amen by faith amen not my own righteous that's right keep reading Hallelujah that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made con comfortable conformable conformable unto his death there is righteousness it comes by Revelation and that comes from God it's not your works and your own righteousness it's not you keeping the law La it's not how well you did it's how well he has done praise the lord it's not about your works it's not about your righteousness it's all about the blood that cleanses us from all sin thank you Jesus Jeremiah 23: 5 and 6 behold the days come sayith the Lord that I will raise unto David A righteous branch and a king that shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and Justice in the earth in his days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely and there his name whereby he shall be called The Lord of righteousness in Hebrew it is called Jehovah Sido one of the seven Redemptive names amen of God Jehovah Sido the Lord our righteousness Hallelujah not yours to take away all your Works let's go beyond your birth let's go back into the very mind of God when God slain the lamb before the foundation of the world and before you were born come on like that he showed between Jacob and Esau Jacob have I loved yes and before they were born and before Works were even done I put an elective love upon him and I gave him my righteousness Hall God wasn't looking at the failure of Jacob because Jacob was a Shyer and let me say this every one of you I'm going to take your Halo away from you this morning and say yeah you might be a good churchgoer but you know what that ain't good enough it's him thank the Lord our righteous am Jehovah s k Isaiah 61: 10-11 and I will greatly rejoice in the Lord and my soul shall be joyful in my God for Heath clothed me with the garments of Salvation he hath covered me oh my God what a work just as the the father of the prodigal son got the robe yeah look at this and he hath clothed me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom now he's he's liking this unto a a union between a bridegroom and a bride as he deth himself with ornaments and as a bride adorne herself with with her Jewels for as the Earth bringeth forth her bud in other words the Earth is going to bring forth the fruition of what I meant it to be because every seed will bring forth of its own kind if you're God's seed you can only produce God fruit praise the Lord so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to sing forth before all the nations amen praise the Lord the righteousness of God is his doing it's not yours right he will cause righteousness and praise to Spring forth somebody say he'll do it he'll do it that's it he's done it keeping the law without a revelation it just leans towards Creeds dogmas self-righteousness makes man-made standards regulations how long is long how short is short amen but when a revelation strikes your heart and it's revealed to you the believer then the Holiness is not self-manufactured amen it's god-given where'd you get it God [Music] a woman can wear a long dress does that make her holy because if a long dress makes a woman holy I remember one of the few countries that I'd ever gone into and we landed in in La next to Vietnam and all all of them had dresses all of the women walking down the streets were in dresses long dresses they had long hair and the only ones that you saw that were perhaps having a problem with it was the young youth coming up but what I'm saying now if you want to say that being covered up makes you holy then the Muslims have got you sisters beat hands down because they cover themselves head to toe and they wear uh uh a burka or whatever is over the top of their head and that just their eyes show and some of them don't even show eyes they got a little screen how would you like to have that religion here in Phoenix at 120° and walk down down the street what I'm saying if it is just the dress that makes you holy then others have got us beat amen so it's not the long dress it's not the uncut hair right it is a revelation of why you do that thank you Lord God does not recognize the works of man unless they've been energized by the revelation of God without faith it's impossible to please God then it's no longer viewed as self-righteous but as his righteousness the Apostle Paul understood what it meant to be holy Now understand what he's trying to tell us from the following scripture he's going to show there two different kinds of Holiness one is man-made according to the the law and the other is the law of faith in the Philippian Church age watch this they sought their righteousness after the law and failed miserably for by the law can no flesh be justified by the law can no man be made holy Holiness is of the Lord amen are we together on that so let's keep reading 1 Corinthians 1:30 but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption second Corinthians 521 that we might be the righteousness of God in him now here's a prophet rightly dividing the word of the the Lord and God is showing you through a prophetic voice yeah oh I'm so glad that my Holiness is not myself right I am glad that I am in Christ and with all his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed yay imparted unto me blessed be God forever amen amen yes there he stands the Lord Of Glory once says the father he was surrounded by Angels and Archangels cheram seraphim and the whole host of Heaven crying holy holy holy is the Lord God of hosts such was his Holiness that no man could approach un him but now we see him in the church sharing his own Holiness with us thank you Lord thank until in him wow Lord are you reading that until in him we become the very righteousness of God oh hallelujah thank you Lord yes there he stands Jesus perfect everything lily of the valley the bright and Morning Star fairest of 10,000 Alpha Omega root and offspring of David Father Son and Holy Ghost the all and all let me read this again but now we've seen him in the church sharing his own Holiness with us praise the Lord wow Lord I don't know about you but when I read this it shook me up I thought wow could this be true that God you love me and you love me enough to share your righteousness that you took upon yourself my sinful everything that I've ever done in thoughts and attributes and complexes and issues I've had in life and you nailed it to the cross and for by grace are we saved through faith and that not being of ourselves what faith it is a gift of God lest anybody should boast W thank you Lord so the Holiness and righteousness that the Believers have does not come by the keeping of the law but by the revelation of the Holy Ghost do all Christian women I'm going to ask a question do all Christian women wear dresses and modest apparel nope just the Holy Ghost LED ones you understand just those who are LED of the Holy Ghost because you can wear a long dress and it be immodest amen that's why even the Hollywood Jezebels at their reward Banquets or whatever they call these Emmys and all of this stuff most of them wear immoral dresses right long dresses yeah see when the spirit reveals it to the believer When Faith strikes her heart it's added to the foundation oh thank you Lord add unto your faith virtue and unto virtue knowledge and unto knowledge Temperance unto Temperance godliness until you come unto the stature of the Perfection of Christ I want you to understand that it's not the things that we do but the things that God has done for us and yet we are obedient because L we say okay well if that's it and I'm so predestinated I can live any way I want to never get that in your mind because if you are predestinated if you are ordained of God if you are elect you will be obedient Sons and Daughters of God God does not receive every sacrifice are we together on that amen because if just sincerity is all that God requires he would have received Cain's offering right but when God did not receive it what did he do he got mad what do people do today when you tell them that without Holiness no man shall see God they get mad well that's not the kind of God that I believe been I have a God that let me do anything and it's just by grace and it's all Grace and therefore I can do anything I want and that kind of creeps right down within the message oh God help us to be obedient Sons and Daughters of God 1954 brother Bren preaches a sermon called God perfecting his church so we give God praise tonight to know that the the holy spirit is in us last night I was teaching of the Perfection God perfecting his church bringing the church into Perfection through the Lord Jesus Christ where is it coming through the Lord Jesus Christ do you see this Union do you see this association with the divine power that how we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed our a according to the promise and we are perfected not in our own self not in our own Holiness my somebody said to me not long ago brother Brenham do you believe in Holiness I said yes sir without such no man shall see God I said but not my Holiness amen cuz I have not any I believe it's his Holiness something that he has done yes and that I rest my hopes upon not on my own merits I have not how many of you are with him I got no marriage the whole thing becomes a love affair oh Hallelujah Jesus said if you love me you keep my Commandments amen that's why we live obedient yes amen otherwise we can preach predestination and Grace to such a degree it becomes disgrace true true doesn't matter how how you dress doesn't matter what you do it's all Grace yeah brother Brenham said when you start thinking like that it's nothing but disgrace true now now brother Bram says in God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same so God hides himself then he reveals himself in what Simplicity he says now in a Highway of Holiness people try to make themselves holy and when you do it's just like I said like a it would be a buzzard trying to put in Dove feathers and himself make a dove out of it when his Nature's still a buzzard it would be like a crow trying to put in Pigeon feathers or a peacock saying you see I'm a beautiful bird see it's something manufactured but a peacock don't have to worry whether he's going to have a peacock feathers or not right the dove don't have to worry whether he's going to have Dove feathers or not as long as the nature is a dove he will have Dove feathers and the Hess people began to say the women must wear long hair and long sleeves and all these things and long skirts and not wear any wedding rings or jewelry of any type see it becomes self-righteous Holiness amen right that's what's manufactured Holiness that comes from the inside out that's automatically lived the Sheep don't have to manufacture wool right you don't see a sheep out in the field chewing the grass all worried about his wool it's just going to come that's right praise the Lord it ain't something he makes up he doesn't have to go to the Sheep clothing store right and buy some real fine wool no he just lives he eats and he lives what does a Christian do yes eat and live amen you don't manufacture it but I'll tell you what when he inside of you begins to show you the way you live it's not you manufacturing it's God showing you the type life you live and when you give it back to God God says that's righteousness amen praise the Lord I believe that the enemy is constantly attacking the message Believers concerning our Holiness true because if he can get you to compromise and get you to lower the standard he doesn't stop with just lowering the standard well how short short is short how long is long you see pretty soon it's a tape measure religion amen right okay we can't manufacture it now in Galatians 3: 1-9 oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been ly set forth crucified among you this only would I learn of you received ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith are you so foolish having begun in the spirit and Y and ye now made perfect by the flesh have he suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that ministereth to you in the spirit and work the Miracles among you do he do it by The Works of the law or but by the hearing of Faith even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scriptures foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preach before the gospel unto Abraham saying in these shall all the nations be blessed so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham amen we talk about Revelation being the power of transformation I found this quote and it's quite as astounding in Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church age book chapter 1 if Revelation is beyond you look up and seek God for it very good none of you are exempt from this true well it's too hard I can't attain it no if it seems to be Beyond you look up and seek God for it amen that is the only way you're ever going to get it a revelation has to come from God it never comes by human or natural endowment but by spiritual enduement in other words it's God that's doing it you can even memorize the scripture and though that's wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from God it says in the word that no man can say that Jesus is the Christ except by the Holy Ghost you have to receive the Holy Ghost and then and only then can the spirit give you revelation that Jesus is the Christ God the anointed one amen remember now the words of Jesus seeking first yeah the kingdom of God look at this in Matthew 6 therefore take no thought saying what you shall eat what you shall drink or wherewith All Shall you be clothed for all all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you so seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things you want to know how to get ahead die to sell amen it's not our righteousness it's not our keeping the Commandments it's not how good and moral we can live but it's God giving us his own righteousness see I want you to understand what's happening when you hear the word of God there's a supernatural transformation taking place it's a metamorphosis it is God is changing changing you yes we're being changed from Glory into Glory because there is the glory of this terrestrial but the glory that is greater is Celestial that's right are you understanding God says yes there's a glory of one and there's a glory of another God by the Revelation that he is giving you is changing you he's metamorphing you into a whole new creation in Christ oh Hallelujah changing us from Earthly to Heavenly from terrestrial to Celestial Revelation is the power of transformation God's looking at the Eternal seed that lies in you God cannot break his Covenant and brother Mario you did a tremendous job the other day you began to take that that unconditional Covenant God gave to Abraham didn't matter what Abraham did amen thank you Lord lying to save his own skin give his wife away tell tell tell that guy you're my sister otherwise he's going to kill me so she lies because he wanted her to yet you know what God intervened thank you Lord brother renham illustrates it and I think it's one of the funniest ones ever he says there was that King his hands behind his head he just taken a bath and there he is on his kingly bed king-sized bed his little toes Wiggly oh tomorrow I'm going to take this 90-year-old woman he says do you know only this message and brother meno you know this this is the only time that a prophetic understanding of the scripture that Abraham and Sarah were changed before the coming of the promised son they had to be changed just like you and I have to be changed these mortal bodies Hallelujah shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Hallelujah and brother renov said he changed him back to being young again Hallelujah brother Brenham even reenacts he says Sarah oh your wrinkles are going away yeah well Abraham that hump in your back and the way you were walking you're now walking over yeah only the prophet there was no one else that came through the scriptures to show us why that this king would want to take Sarah it doesn't fathom he's he can have any woman in the Kingdom any young virgin I can have her he wants Sarah you can you just in your mind wrinkled up old no life yeah I want her man something wrong with you boy you better get some new glasses yet the prophet of God said there it is there's a mystery showing that this bride before they come and meet the promised son they're going to be changed Hallelujah let me tell you this Chang is a whole lot closer than you think this whole Rapture this being caught up is well listen we are in the phases of the shout The Voice the trumpet we are in the time of the coming of the Messiah and he's ready to take his bride away I tell you none of you dilly dally if you're not in get in flashing red lights of his signs of his coming amen 2 Corinthians 5:21 for he hath been made sin for us who knew no sin that we might be the righteousness of God in him oh thank you Lord United together with the spirit of God your soul quickened by Revelation predestinated seed Gene it was placed inside of you takes life the quickening power of the Holy Ghost energizes that seed brings it to life brother brandom says it's a deep calling to the Deep your theop has been calling you am come up a little higher into the revealed word the Bible says in Matthew 5 and6 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed comes from the Greek word Macos which means blessed or happy righteousness comes from the Greek word dios Sunni it means righteousness used 92 times within the scripture the state of him who is as he ought to be yeah the state of him who is as he ought to be Hallelujah righteousness the condition that is acceptable to God th this is the Greek definition amen of righteousness the doctrine concerning the way in which man May attend the state approved of God everything in order to go to markets got to be approved got to get the stamp of approval certificate or whatever huh imagine you know what God did before the foundation of the world put a stamp on you approve Hallelujah God before you were born before you did anything before you accepted Christ before all this approved thank you Lord it means Integrity virtue purity of Life correctness of thinking correctness of thinking and of acting and of feeling wow you want to be correct in all that that's what righteousness does changes your thinking changes the way you act listen and all of you it doesn't matter how old and we've got some that are older than I here in this building but I want you to all understand that life is but a vapor just goes like it I'm 72 it seems like just yesterday I got I got married 52 years later where'd that go it's just life is but a vapor short time of ago you were born you came into this world and guess what somebody grabbed a hold of you cut your umbilical cord slapped you on the back side you've been getting slapped around ever since your birth and you wondered what in the world all of this I was happy I was comfortable what in the world are you doing right and you begin to experience a sensation you ain't never fell before right I'm getting hungry never felt it in the womb on temperature was even not hot or cold I was happy life was good I never felt hunger didn't have to order a Coke or a Big Mac I was being fed umbilical cord but guess what somebody cut it all of a sudden you're a little lifeline man I'm feeling something like I do three times a day or more you're feeling some I'm hungry I'm thirsty and all of you began to have a hunger and a thirst Jesus said but they that hunger and thirst after yeah his righteousness and yet I want to take the natural and type it to the spiritual every one of you sometime during the day even today you will satisfy unless you're on intermittent fasting I'm on intermittent fasting I eat at 7 in the morning and then I fast until noon yeah well you can fast how you want to that's how I do it my wife tells me you know honey I said what's for breakfast I'm fasting well what am I having for breast don't make me anyway it's a it's amazing how that you hunger and thirst and no matter how much that you have satisfied that flesh and you eat a big old meal I can be taking my meal and saying candy is such a good cook and I'm taking and a lot of times I take that little piece of bread or whatever and I soop up the last little bit there's an artwork to eating and I soop it up throw it in there then I ask Sandy what's for lunch she always says how can you think of food you know I just let my belt out un but in my pants got comfortable but I'm it's a hunger and thirst they say that a person can go for an extended period of time not eating but you can go for just a few days without water so hungering and thirsting the Bible says blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness the hunger of the natural Man versus the spiritual man I want to make make a comparison there are two hungering within a human being break it down in a simple manner the hunger of the physical man and that of the spiritual man there is a food that the body and there is a food for the soul are we together on that yes sir each one has a painful craving for the desire to be filled each one of you have got to come to Christ and you all bear witness within your own life that there was a desire in your heart to learn more about God that's why all of you are here this morning because you have a desire you have a longing you have a thirsting a hungering and I pray that that's each one of you otherwise you're here because you were drug here right but when you get old enough and you're able to Spring off and go on your own then I will no longer go to church that's your choice but those that hunger and thirst for his righteousness how many of you say amen that's why I'm here that's what is causing me to come back it's because I'm hungry I've got a thirsting inside of me that cannot be quenched by sparkling Water by pepsicola or even by a glass of water although I will tell you there's nothing like good old water amen amen when you're thirsty amen remember that old song cool clear water water right he spreads a burning sand oh you yeah Steve knows it you want to sing it Steve meno probably knows it too okay the psalmist David said my soul thirsteth for thee oh God it's not just thirsting with your mouth that's right come on or your physical body that David was talking about my soul his soul was longing for something that was satisfy The Thirst within him when the soul of man starts getting thirsty there's only one thing that can quench it yes and that's God that's right it's not life itself that quenches you because alas all of you are alive all of you have a heartbeat all of you are breathing but he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son hath not life amen there's something within a man's soul that cannot be satisfied with anything but God himself you see when you start looking for this something to satisfy I want you to to understand poets write about it songwriters sing about it philosophers philos philosopy about it playwrights make plays about it teachers teach about it and preachers preach about it there was an Explorer by the name of Pon Deon right you remember that in your history class in school Pon de Leon what was he looking for Fountain of you because he had heard that there was a fountain somewhere that when you drank from it come on it had magical properties you would be youthful yes forever he circumnavigated the globe looking for the Fountain of Youth the Jews when they make a toast they say layam to life blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness amen for they shall be filled brother Bram says in the church A's book and please just give me a few more minutes if you don't mind amen no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit of God reveals them we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else is in the world Amen we' have accepted the Bible we accepted the great truths of it but still it's not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened the Bible says 2 Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the righteousness of God by our Union with Jesus Christ did you get it it says now brother random capitalize this we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ am praise the Lord it says that he Jesus became sin for us amen it does not say he became sinful but he became sin for us that by our Union with him we might become the righteousness of God hallelujah if we accept that fact and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must accept the fact that we by our Union with him yeah have become the very righteousness of God hallelujah praise the Lord to reject one is to reject the other to accept one is to accept the other it cannot be denied but the revelation of it is missing is not real to the majority of God's children it's just a good verse in the Bible what we need to have it made alive to us that will take Revelation do you see that to the majority of God's children it's not real just the nice verse oh I would to God that every one of us would have that Union with Christ [Music] amen you go beyond all of the teachings of this prophet and the teachings of this message and comeing into the Union this invisible Union whereby the spirit of God energizes you quickens that seed and you come to life because until then guess what to you without that life it's just rules amen it's just rules it's well the prophet said we can't do this and we can't do that and the Bible says this and you can't you can't you can't do you know that there are more Commandments of God that thou shalt than there is Thou shalt not why do we do dwell on the negative get into Christ and the rest of these things don't matter praise the Lord when the soul is awakened within a man he will begin to hunger and thirst after those things to satisfy his soul amen the soul of man desires to be fed spiritually amen your spiritual appetite will never be satisfied by worldly entertainment you'll never be satisfied with religious Seminary teachings your soul man on the inside can only be fed by spiritual food in due season the devil try to give you all kinds of pacifiers and they only pacify you temporarily these little pacifiers that mothers give their kids you know little suckers they're phony nothing comes out of them they're not real the mothers they bring their little children up here they have me dedicate soon as the kid gets in my arms you know kid starts fting like that well some of these mothers they've got a chained to them a little Tethered to them and every one of you mothers know when your child is telling you the pacifier don't work I need the real thing every mother knows that and you can for a while pacify them temporarily hey hey little baby hang on just yeah suck on like this and then pretty soon and then you give them a little toy and a sucker and you try to entertain him hey hey yes yes no I'm I'm doing something I'm busy right now I don't have time like and you can tell when they're throwing a little fit that I'm ringing the bell Mom I'm letting you know it's supper time you understand amen so these little pacifiers that we have in our life are only temporary satisfactory that's right the things of the world the ball game riding the perfect wave playing the perfect game all of that stuff you know as soon as you do it it's not good enough I wow it doesn't satisfy it's only temporarily amen toys don't do it pacifiers don't do it right entertainment won't do it music won't do it Starbucks won't do it baby won't quit yelling till he gets it right the natural man will seek how he might satisfy that thirst but he'll never be able to satisfy that Thirst by the things of the world world every human being has a desire for Life they're looking for some kind of satisfaction for their souls Satan knows that also so he tells them go for it man go for the Gusto if it feels good do it go for it you've come a long way baby you know like all these billboards with all the Flash and the Pomp and the Beautiful Girl on there with her cigarette and her a glass of champagne or whatever they never show you the backside of the billboard right you ever seen somebody that has got a smoking habit that they can't quit you ever seen where they take away the lower jaw or the esophagus here has been eaten away with cancer and they still want to smoke and through the little air hole that has been provided to them by way of an operation that they sit there and they take that little cigarette butt and they go imagine trying to satisfy an alcoholic you know what he's trying to do satisfy the hurt of his life and he's trying it's a it's an escapism people that do drugs it's an escapism it only gives you for a moment amen but then you come down you ever seen a drug addict that's needing to fix amen get all they'll do anything see the devil would like to give you any kind of a pacifier to try to satisfy that which you are longing for in your soul it's all these escapism the drug addict looking for the ultimate High the Sports Addict looking for that perfect game the movie addict looking for that ultimate film of his dreams the car addict looking for that ultimate car if I could just get that car I'll be all right let's talk about about the natural appetite for just a moment when these desires are filled it gives you an ease of the feeling or the sensation for a limited period of time in other words it's only temporary satisfaction after you eat a big meal yeah hey you're like the lion I've been there in Africa where you have a pride of lion and they just killed a a buffalo or they just killed some big antalope or some animal the whole pride of lying have eaten and and guess what they're all laying and their bellies are are bulging and it can be Impala can walk by and all of them look up they're laying and they look up oh and PA yeah because they're full they don't get up and Chade it why I'm too full do you know what sheep will do if they have overg grazed in their in their little Paddock or their little field you ever seen sheep grazing in a field and they've grazed it down to nothing you know what they do they go to the fence and they kneel and they put their head through the fence and that little tongue reaches out tries it it's amazing they get into the position of prayer oh I just need a little something watch it Christian trying to satisfy this Thirst by things that will not satisfy amen So True Religion tries to pacify the People by giving them entertainment Egypt could not hold the children of Israel from the promised land mother England could not stop the pilgrim fathers amen from seeking religious freedom and neither can mystery Babylon hold the bride of Christ back am from coming to The Living Waters of the message musicians have you come blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness there's something too let me do let me compare the natural type of the spiritual there's something about when you satisfy the natural man he gets hunger hungry again and again and again it's just a habitual thing but they that eat less and less of spiritual food have less and less appetite true and they which eat a great greater appetite in other words they start getting into that revealed word and they start eating it and they start eating the open book Revelation and everything guess what it increases your appetite amen thank you Lord it increases your prayer it increases you wanting to hear the word of God it increases your desire I want more if you don't feed the spiritual man guess what yeah seven days without prayer makes one week that's right you understand that a little Parable you quit praying you quit reading you got no appetite anymore amen true but the more that you read and the more you get into it I can't get enough Amen in thirsting for Life brother brm says this what makes you try to have a big time like that is because God has made you to Crave life God Made You Yeah up your makeup there isn't a man or woman on Earth tonight ever was a man or woman on Earth tonight on Earth at any time but has a craving for something are thirsting for pleasure and God made that thirst in in you he made that thirst so you would thirst after him thank you Lord how dare you try to quench that blessed holy thirst that God has put in your heart to thirst after him and try to satisfy it with sin how dare you try to quench that Holy thirst for something by some vulgarity program on television instead of going to Church of the Living God how dare you poor whiskey cigarettes and dope into your body use your eyes for lust to try to satisfy that blessed holy thirst that God put in you to thirst for him God will hold you responsible my friend at the day of judgment if you don't satisfy that thirst with the drinking of the Fountain of inexhaustible Fountain of Life see let him that's a thirst come whosoever will let him come and drink from the Waters of Life freely yes that's what you're thirsting for Amen in closing I want you to understand that Revelation comes from God and that is what feeds your hungry soul and quenches your holy thirst theology won't do it entertainment won't do it and religion won't do it John 6:35 Jesus said I am the bread of life and he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on on me shall never thirst the Lord John 7:37 and the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst amen yes amen amen If any man thirst let him come to me yes amen and drink and he that believeth on me as the scriptures said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water even as brother Russell testified of a well that got dried up it was depending upon natural rain natural sources but guess what there's a supernatural God Hallelujah for the believer that can give water where there is no water he can bring water out of a rock that's right yes praise the Lord that's the kind of God we are why he's God our refuge amen Jehovah saidu our righteousness amen thank you Lord blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled prise the Lord the Bible predicts in the end time there'll come a famine Bible says Amos 8 verse 11 behold the days come sayth the Lord God I'll send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but for hearing the words of the Lord yes they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from North even to the East and they shall run to and fro seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it on that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst we're in the midst of this prophecy my brother and sister the day will come and there'll be a famine in the land because too many of the people have been eaten off of the wrong thing amen God has sent to us a prophet see everything every one of our sermons all rev revolve around what God has done in this hour the revealing of the son of man who do you say this is right and you see all these scoffers let me take just a moment I may preach on this but all of these scoffers that are coming up well he this and that and they all got their own little thing and well if he was a real prophet he would have known about you know who this was and I'll tell you what these scoffers are coming up more and more it did it with every Prophet it did it with every move of God it did it with Moses you see jamus and jam was back when they were in Egypt but daythan and Kora was in the message and they were on the journey and they came to the place that Moses takes too much authority to himself are we not all holy and guess what God did you know what God said separate you but you know what Moses Christ in Moses stood in the Gap take me first then finally after that was all said and done God said separate yourself Moses because everything that appertaineth or believeth like Dayan and Kora I'm going to swallow him up I want you to understand that's what's happening now these daythan and koras these scoffers these mockers guess what the world is just opening it up just swallowing and because had they had true Revelation they'd have never listened all this stuff I was talking to the brothers in the back room what was brother wrong was brother Brenham wrong on the [Music] godhead was was he wrong on the opening of the seals was he wrong on water baptism was he wrong on his doctrinal teachings they don't touch the doctrinal teachings they just come after well uh you know if if he'd have been a prophet in fact the disciples even said that about Jesus if he didn't know what kind of woman he's talking to on so these scoffers and these mockers of the end time I talked to a brother a pastor here about a week or 10 days ago I told him I said stay away from that nonsense you get into this little YouTube and this little this and that and everything raising up and everything ah they're a bunch of scoffers Amen mockers they are the shimmy eyes within the message you want to throw dirt on it I tell you what they'd have never done it when he was here and he was alive amen he just said oh you you preachers oh all of you that are against me said you come up here and stand right here in this huh praise the Lord and he said ah you're smarter than I thought so all of this stuff let them Yak let them talk just stay away from it but some of you are going to be disobedient kids you tell them it's like a mother told his little child hey Johnny don't put the you know got some kidney beans was out and they were separ whatever you do Johnny don't put that kidney bean up your nose Mama leaves the kitchen next thing you know Johnny stuck it way up there well guess what got to go to the hospital for what get the kidney bean out some of you I'm going to tell you stay away from those things so you know what you're going to do today you're kidney bean up the nose you wonder why you got problems you wonder why you're suffering like you do you wonder why you're not getting anything out of the word of God it's cuz you're feeding on the wrong thing God help us amen amen to most people within the message as Believers that we have been made the very righteousness of God is just a good [Music] verse so if I were to tell you that God looking at you right now in your flesh he doesn't see you right hallelujah thank you Lord wow he doesn't see you anymore thank you Jesus he sees himself amen because what he did he laid inside of you a seed it's his seed amen and because you're his seed he's got a covenant huh brother Mario unconditional I don't care what you've done I'm going to watch over the seed amen and I being the author and finisher of your faith I'm going to bring it to where it should be [Music] Hallelujah all of you have [Music] GPS I think I rely on it more and more the older I get especially when Sand's not with me if because she'll always turn right turn left but if she's not with me I got to have you know another woman tells me it ain't even a man I hear you can get John Wayne as the voice on there hey buddy turn right here what's the matter little you put in the GPS of where you're going to go now if you make the wrong turn what does it do Elias what does it do when you make the wrong turn it recalculates never change the destiny it's said well you made a wrong turn so it says I'm rerouting Jonah arise and go to Nineveh I don't want to well go ahead and go to tarus right I'm going to use it for my glory and you're going to suffer for it let me tell you all of you God lets you make a choice yeah he does he's letting you make a choice right now right here and now yeah he's letting all of you say well I don't know that seems a little strong for me to go and arise and go to tares or to Nineveh I should say and you choose to take the permissive will and God says okay it doesn't change the GPS amen it just recalculates Hallelujah that's right thank you Lord and you're going to suffer [Music] I literally can't think of a worse situation in Old Testament than [Music] Jonah listen this is not Walt Disney where he's floating on a little something and there's a candle lit and you can see and there's this big cavern inside he's in the gastronomical intestines of a the whale there's no there's no light there's no nothing the acids are starting to eat his body all of the and my imagine three days and there you know all of a sudden this big old whale takes him down and goes and guess right where he takes him Nineveh what was the what was the animal that or the sea creature they worshiped Nineveh the god of the ocean was the whale so they worshiped the whale so I can just see the high priest out there that morning hey let's all have service hey oh whale God how that we love you you the provideth and everything here comes a whale oh look everybody let's all worship the whale look here he is oh praise God whale beaches himself opens his mouth and out rolls Jonah with seaweed around him where am I Nineveh repent
