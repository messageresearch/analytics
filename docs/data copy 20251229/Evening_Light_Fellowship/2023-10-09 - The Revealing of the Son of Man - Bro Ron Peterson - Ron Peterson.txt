in God the verse to that is if I never had a problem I'd never know that he could solve him and I thank him now for the mountains I thank him for The Valleys I thank him for the storms that he's brought us through and I opened up the Psalms and David was one of the best examples we have of worshiping and regardless of whether he was on the mountain or he was hiding in a cave or he was not even didn't have a home didn't have his family around him but he encouraged himself in the Lord in those times and he said let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let such as love thy salvation say continually the Lord be magnified so it's not just when we feel like it it's not just when we're up on the Mountaintop it's not just when we're down in the valley but continually We Want To Praise Him and so that's the song I want to sing for you this morning Satan's a liar he wants to make us think that we're poppers he knows himself we're Children of the king so let's just praise the Lord together this morning he can work through those who Praise Him Hallelujah when you're up again a struggle that shatters all your dreams your hopes have been cruy crushed by Satan's manifested schemes and you feel the urge within you to submit to Earthly fears well don't let the faith you're standing in seem to disappear but praise the Lord L he can work through those who praise him praise the Lord for our God and habits praise praise the Lord for the chains that seem to bind you serve only to remind you that they'll drop powerless behind you when you praise him now Satan is just a liar

the Jews in the second world war and millions of them were gassed starved shot murdered in every way that they could possibly do it and brother Brenham said there is is a preview of a hatred that is coming because we are ready to change Administration and we are going to the bride is going to go up the two witnesses come down three and A2 years of tribulation and this vment that you see against the Jews will come against the 144,000 and they will be martyred how many of you know that amen and he says and the foolish virgin that is left that did not have the oil guess what they will be martyred also oh God May there not be one of us that would miss that Rapture it behooves us to know that all of these signs around us are flashing red lights of his soon coming oh God I pray that you

Lord have thy way with us this morning and just speak to our hearts we ask God to bless his word this morning turn with me too uh and I I've got four scriptures here but Brethren that are in the back I want to just come up to Luke 17: 29-30 and then I'll read the others after I have everyone to be seated Luke 17: 29-30 you all know in the days of Noah in the days of lot so shall it be and the Bible reads but it shall not be so excuse me I'm sorry but in the days I'm sorry my my vision is a little blurry you forgive me I had eye surgery so it blurs together here Luke 17: 29 but the same day that lot went out of of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from Heaven destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated thank you to all of those that had those song specials brother John that was wonderful I love it I believe songs that are sung by Saints sing it by inspiration and hope wow what a voice don't hide it use it to all of you this morning I just want to say I want to be led of the holy spirit because I share with you from my my heart that the reason that I stand before you is because of what God has done in my life amen how that at 18 years of age in the beaches of California I came across a wonderful message people introduced to me a message that I did not know would change the course of my life and I want to title my sermon this morning and then I'm going to go back to my other scriptures but I want to title this the revealing of the son of man I want to take a subject of the change of ministry and the change of administration when you stand from scriptures and you see by types and shadows then you know and can predict the direction of where we're going you can see what happened as it was so shall it be and so we understand those things and I'd like you to turn with me to Luke 19 verses 5-10 then we'll go to Matthew 18 and to Matthew Matthew 20 now brother brandham elaborates on zakus many times and he said zakus was a small man of small stature probably about my size and it says he had heard about Jesus and he heard he was to pass a certain way and he climbs up a sycamore tree because there were so many people and he kind of thought well I'll just get up here and if he passes by I'll get a real good look at him and if you ever ask yourself may I get a real good look at Jesus you have an appointment amen with Destiny amen amen and so we find this scripture here and we cut in on verse five and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zakus make haste and come down for today I must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guested with a man that is a sinner amen God knows his and he knows their condition and God sees righteousness before cleansing let me say that again God sees righteousness he sees the end of the journey before cleansing we were born as Sinners and the people murmur and look at us and say look at these people they claim to be quote the bride of Christ look at them what a bunch of Misfits what a bunch of people that if it weren't for the grace of God we would be out here probably the worst of the people in the crowd amen we would have our tattoos and we would have our earrings and we would have our hair dos and we would doing all of that but God rich in Mercy placed an elect seed with inside of you and zakus just wanted to look at him told him make haste zakus stood and said unto the Lord behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken anything from any man by by false accusation I restore him fourfold you talk about restoration with compensation hey there just something zakus nobody told him what to do he just says oh God he's overwhelmed by God's grace the Bible says he that is forgiven much loveth much that's why I do what I do that's why I persevere through what I persevere through and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for so much as he is he also is the son of Abraham wow a son of Abraham for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which is lost thank you Lord so I want you to think about the mission of the son of man and I take that title of the revealing of the son of man and I want you to understand that that son of man has a mission and I want you all to understand that you are a part of that mission amen I have come to seek and to save that which was lost now I love the scripture how they are so detailed because you cannot seek and save something that was lost unless it was once your possession where were you it didn't come to us until it was given to a prophet of God and that prophet of God said if you are a son of God you always have been he said the reason that you can be born again is because you have seed he said the new birth doesn't change seed because you were seed you had the ability to be born again somebody say praise God because that's what God did with you Matthew 18: 11- 14 for those of you if I mess up the scriptures or my readings my right eye had a surgery here several days ago it is still dilated it's blood red but it's healing and this has been a little bit of a hard time for me the last several weeks because I I haven't felt good I went through two surgeries one on the nose one on the eyes and now I have hearing aids also so I see better I smell better and I hear better but at the moment it's quite blurry and it was very difficult me yesterday looking and reading my scriptures and on the computer because it was it was so blurry and if any of you have ever had a situation like that it's frustrating and I said okay Lord I I am giving the frustration to you otherwise you will just uh get a a bad attitude and uh everything so I had to humble myself and say okay Lord through it all you've got it all that's right in control amen Matthew 18 vers 11 the Bible says for the son of man is come to save that which was lost how think ye if a man have a hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray do he not leave the 90 and n and go into the mountains and seeketh which has gone astray and if so be that he find it verily I say unto you he rejoices more of that sheep than of the 9 and9 which went not a astray amen even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish somebody say Amen cuz that's God's will for you he came to seek and to save that which was lost prise the Lord Matthew 20 and verse 26- 28 but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many thank you Lord father God I do thank you for your word I thank you Father father for the plan that you have for our lives we did not seek you we did not go looking for a savior a messiah but that Messiah that savior came looking for us you went to the highways and the byways and you've compelled us to come in and here we are in the midst of this loud you see an age where everything is so such strife and Chaos everywhere but father in the midst of the storm we can see you walking on the water because the water is the type of the people so you're walking in our midst and we know that you're here father I pray that you will bless your word bless your ministry around the world father and I pray a special bless blessing upon Israel at this moment as their enemies are encompassed about them I pray you the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob the one who has watched over that Covenant seed all the days father since your Covenant was confirmed with Abraham I pray for Israel today in Jesus Christ's name amen how could I not mention today although my sermon is on the revealing of the son of man how could I not mention to all of you and maybe some of you don't know that Israel is at War they've been attacked an unprovoked attack and their prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared war and so I want you to be aware this morning because this is a Biblical prophecy and though the world is looking at this and you remember last Sunday when I told you it was the beginning of yam Kapur and did you know that 50 years ago to the day of even this attack was on the dates of the time of the yam Kapur War 50 years ago I told you that God does things to Israel on feast days because we know that the Bible says these feast days are appointed Times They Are to give you examp examples and things for you to look at and we realize Jesus was born on a feast day he was crucified on a feast day he rose again on a feast day his Spirit came back on a feast day excuse me so we understand that God is keeping all of his appointments but I didn't want to just take all of my focus this morning and go just on Israel but I do want to tie some things in and if you will let me have my Liberty this morning to show you a few things because the prophet of God ties Israel and the church together he preaches uh sermons like the 144,000 and the 10 virgins he goes and preaches about Israel and he says what you see God doing to Israel watch because he will also do that with the church so we see these things happening and it's happening even right now as we speak there are Rockets there are gunfights there are bombs going off and yet I believe that you're this is all for a purpose now remember that brother Brenham says that Israel is God's time piece and so I want to take this time piece for just a moment and share with you what brother Brenham says 1953 in questions and answers on Genesis do you believe that the Jews Jews returned to Palestine is a fulfillment of Bible prophecy we heard you going to Palestine is that true yes yes sir let me tell you something one of the greatest if you want to see what time of year it is look on the calendar if you want to see what time it is look at the clock if you want to see what day you're living in look where the Jews are that's God's time piece so there's how something about what's happening in Israel right now that is letting you know the time is here am amen the time piece and look the very night the very day that the angel of the Lord met me in 1946 on May the 7th at Greens Mill Indiana that same day the Treaty of Peace was signed for the Jews and they were established a nation for the first time in 25 100 years do you think this was coincidence I'll have you to know that it is a sign of the time because just as Paul who was sent first to the house of Israel they rejected the gospel and he says now you must turn and go to the Gentiles he says because they pushed it away but God blinded them oh you talk about the grace of God God blinded his own that he could take a gentile Nation a gentile people hallelujah we're talking about you and I right now and so at the closing of that dispensation of going to the Jews now there's a message and Paul says I turn and now go to the Gentiles so we see that at this timing that there was a a passing of the message from the Jew to the Gentile amen but that Gentile dispensation is for just a period of time that's right how many of you know that the Gentile dispensation is just for a few days and God is fixing to turn back to Israel Hal Hallelujah so we can see all of this is in God's timing amen you want to know what time it is God's time piece is Israel in the recognizing your day and its message 64 you we are dealing today on a Sunday school lesson but I want you to realize and recognize the time that we're living we're just about to run out and as you see and then by this you should know the very hour and time and sign the message that you are to receive brother Brenham was very much aware of current events in fact brother Brenan would take current events he would call them modern events he says are made known by prophecy therefore he could look at a modern event that was happen happening and say uh this is found in the scripture and he goes to the scripture how many of you know that the what the Bible uh foretells that is going to happen must come to pass it might take thousands of years hundreds of years it might look as though that God has forgotten but he did not forget he does not forget he is not like man he doesn't start something and then get distracted everything that is happening and may I say this to all of you today everything that is happening to you right now is for a purpose [Music] hallelujah amen in the 10 virgins and 144,000 Jews and now you can look and look magazine in life and them showing the pictures of them returning back didn't Jesus say it when you see the Fig Tree putting forth its buds how many of you know that the Fig Tree resembles or typifies Israel so now watch when Israel brother Braham said you think it's coincidence that the very same hour the very same moment that Israel is being declared as a nation God is meeting with me giving me a message now watch follow along Jews have always been the Fig Tree this generation should not pass until all these things be fulfilled continuing on the next quote in the 10 virgins the real Jews was gathering into Palestine again and just exactly what the prophet said Ishmael and Isaac were were at one another's throats always fighting predicted they'd be there in the last day and there they said ishmail right here and about a city block here and there is an Isaac both of them mohammadans and Jews fighting one another in a No Man's Land continuing on now to see whether the this message that we got is connected with it or not the very hour that Israel was signed to be a nation remember I read you the quote in 53 now he's seven years later and he's preaching this sermon we see whether this message we got is connected with it or not the very hour is signed to be a nation is the very same hour very same day very same month everything else I was at Greens Mill Indiana when that angel there appeared to me and sent me out on the field with this after he had met me down on the river and told me what would take place then commissioned me 11 years later at the same hour that Israel was signed in as a nation it's all connected together Hallelujah so what is happening in Israel is connecting understand we are now finishing up the ending of the Gentile dispensation we have men such as Jonathan KH who is uh a Messianic Jew and he's looking into the Old and New Testament and he's looking at times and signs and he's realizing wow look at what God is doing he's letting the world know but does it make them change will Israel will this war will it make people change no they will continue on in fact when God fulfills prophecy many of them sit there and scratch their head and wonder what has come to pass but there's others who are elect of God who are C Gene have got an ability they can see something others cannot they can hear a voice that others cannot they can see a picture that others do not see how many of you can bear witness of that amen amen again I have two more quotes on the 10 virgins the angel of the Lord is on earth now see he's moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord then he talks about how two Messengers go down to Sodom and brother Brenham happens to mention he said two Messengers such as our modern-day Billy Graham and Earl Roberts and he says but they were sent to Sodom but he said there'll be one that stays with Abraham I want all of you to understand here we are in the midst of fulfillment God has sent his two Messengers down to Sodom and they were great Messengers I tell you if I remember the the first time I was ever into the pr presence there of Billy Graham at a at a campaign a crusade of his in Anaheim California and it was a youth convention and I was about as far away from him as brother Michel and I are from one another and I saw him stand there and I knew I was in the presence of some one very special and he looked out across that great stadium and he says I want to talk to you today about the Jesus Revolution that is happening in America today and as he spoke these words and he was saying I want all of you to know that God is calling you to repentance and how that he wants you to come to him but now understand this let's not concentrate on The Messengers to Sodom let's concentrate on one that stayed with Abraham are you f are you spiritual enough to catch this correlation The Godly one MDC stayed with Abraham and the two angels went down there and preached to them and brought that little bitty group out sleeping virgin see all right but the one Angel stayed with Abraham this Angels preached down here a modern day Billy gaham and then pulled them out paragraph 102 same sermon and the angel that stood with Abraham had his back to the tent and said Abraham where is your wife Sarah how' he know he was married he was married how do he know he had a wife how do he know his name her name was Sarah and she's in the tent behind him and he says I see you see who Angel was I made you a promise I'm going to visit you according to the time of life may I stop there for a moment it was according to a time of life God spoke listen to me I'm going to just RAB it Trail here for a moment feeling LED of the spirit God spoke to Abraham and told him I'm going to give you seed I'm going to give you seed and you'll be the father of many nations the people will call you blessed and yet it took all these years later and you know what he did not mention her name he didn't say and it's going to be through Sarah do you understand that when you look at the Early times when God speaks to Abraham he tells him you're going to have seed now we it's all inferred it's all inferred that it's going to be through his wife but guess what she can't conceive she's she's Barren and they go all these years as husband and wife and after him getting the promise he keeps coming to Sarah every morning do you feel anything different she said no I don't he said keep knitting them booties I want all of you to understand that we have a father of Abraham who is the father of Assa and he didn't look at the conditions he looks at the promise and I want all of you to understand stand regardless of your conditions and regardless of the things you are going through God is going to have a bride God is going to deliver you he's going to bring you to where he promised and he that began a good work in you shall finish it thank you Lord so it was an appointed time they went through all these years years of trying to do this and that and he tried to bring the promise of God to pass but may I say this God doesn't need your help you can try to help God all you want well if I if I do this more and I do that more and everything maybe I'll find favor in the eyes of God there's one thing that God does require of you and that is for you to be more sincere amen that's what the prophet of God was told by the angel he said now this third pull he said watch it's something very secret it's something so Sovereign I must not say much about it because if I'm not careful I cause carnal impersonations I want all of you to understand that the third pole every time it was manifested it was not in church was not in a prayer line it was out there among everyday life it was out there when he was just doing this and fishing and hunting and taking his wife to the doctor Etc but when there was a need I want you to understand God is God he's a Healer he's a deliverer but there must be need and many times we don't call him on the scene because we don't have a need and your need is what makes him God I need a Healer all right I'm the god that heals all your diseases it is that need that calls him down do we understand with a full capacity of just what has happened in our day when he says just as there was a messiah sign given he says I'll turn my back as it was in the days of Abraham with Sarah in the tent now brother Brenham says it's thus sayith the Lord this is the last sign you'll not receive another sign after this oh many of us were not there there was probably just a few of you that were so blessed in your early youth to be able to go to a meeting to be there to see him walk to the platform to hear him take his text I remember there was a sister that went to our church Flagstaff and her husband left her because of this message she lived in Prescot and Sister Irene McCracken and she tried to raise her son up the best that she could and she'd been seeking God to make a way for her to get to God's prophet and hear him preach she'd heard about it giving her life to it but she wanted to go to a meeting and she got down on her knees as I best remember her testimony she began to pray and call upon God and said God make a way because I would like to be able to go to the meeting and I would like to hear that Prophet preach I'd like to be there in person she got done praying didn't feel anything special except that she had intercession with God and it wound up that just a few moments later the phone rang one of her Christian Associates said hey I've heard that William brandham is coming to Arizona said would you like to go with us to the meeting now watch God working on both ends she hung up the phone she got so excited that she cried out with a loud voice is there no bomb in Gilead didn't know why she said it went to the meeting sat in the congregation she watched The Prophet come out she watched the way he carried his Bible she watched how every movement and she said oh I will never forget he says he looked over the congregation he says I feel led today to preach and he looked right at her is there no bomb in Gilead excuse me God is a god of Supernatural I'll tell you the closer we get to God the more of the supernatural we we should be seeing Among Us that's right why because we are changing Ministry I want you to understand that the min Ministry of Jesus Christ you watch brother Brenham said he had three polls and he says that the first poll and he says what is it the sign in the hand right and he says watch the healings and all of the things but he says and then the second pull the Discerning of spirits behold an Israelite in whom there is no G he says because I told you your name you believe greater things shall you see because the ministry will change it'll go greater I want you to understand and I trust that each one of you understand this with me and I pray that the same thing is happening to you that's happening to me the message is becoming greater now than it's ever been amen it is unfolding in a way that I'll tell you there are times I cannot contain itall becoming so real messages that I have read over and over and underlined I read it again it's a whole new message that's though I'd never read it before my Bible's doing the same thing I'm reading out of my Bible I'm reading out of the message and everything I'm thinking oh my why haven't I read this before my wife and I having devotions the other morning and we were just finish finishing up the last couple Pages cuz we read from the SE Seven Seals and we're finishing the Sixth Seal and brother Brenan was talking about a dream that he had and as we read this my wife and I were very much aware because as a young man as a young man when I just came to the massage God gave me a dream and here that my dream and brother brenham's dream correlated one with another and I said Sandy as much as I've read all of this and I know I've read this before but now I said his dream and my dream they match I remember I we traveled with brother Billy Paul and Brother Joseph in Europe and taking them to visit ministers throughout Europe and I told Brother Billy Paul the dream he and Brother Joseph and I got so overcome and it's hard for me to tell the dreams because they're so personal and when I got done telling the dream brother Billy Paul very deeply moved he said brother Ron you saw my daddy you saw my daddy he wrote me not long ago I say not long ago brother Robert could have been five years ago seven years he said brother Ron I have taken your dream and shared it with people all over the world I hope you don't mind I said no brother Billy I don't mind and I'm not going to tell the dream but it was the dream of the wedding supper and we were there and every everyone's getting their rewards and I'll tell you the end of the dream if you don't mind is it okay can I everyone had gotten their rewards and one by one they called names whether it be your name or her name or whatever and everyone that came up from the least to the greatest and each one that came forward after their name we all said praise God if anyone deserves a reward that brother does oh God give him a great reward and everyone kept getting better and better and there was no time uh you know no issue on time why we were in eternity right it was it was God's time and I remember they called my name I came before the Lord and a crown was placed upon my head and the crown had velvet on the inside of it I felt the weight of the crown and the crown fit perfectly it didn't slide down and and be caught over my ears and I thought how does he know my hat size my hat size he knows the numbers of the hairs on my head that's right even though they're few to be numbered now but I felt the weight of the crown I sat back down every one of us we got our crowns we sat down and they finally called the name Willi you marry brandom they said it again William marry and brandham there was no movement there was where is he where is he we all began to look and the people across the table from me were looking Beyond me to commotion or something in my back so I turned in my chair to look and there he was Now understand we had crowns and we had robes we all looked the same and he was walking away and I could see through the texture of the robe the Contour of his muscles and I could see they were contorting and I could see that he was crying he had his head down although physically I didn't see the front of him and it took two brothers to go and one got his left arm and one got the right arm and turn him around and then I saw he was weeping tears streaming down his face and we're all going oh praise God praise God if anyone deserves a reward it's the seventh angel messenger if it weren't for him they came before the Lord Jesus the crown was placed upon his head and we all rejoice and all of a sudden he very quickly he put it at his feet and he said I'm not worthy he placed his crown at his feet and one by one and I thought why didn't I think of that as though I deserve a crown as though I get a reward for something that I've done it's all by grace for by grace are we saved through faith and the faith that you have is a gift of God lest any man should boast that's right and we all and I felt ashamed now to have my crown and we all one by one not hurriedly but very reverently and sovereignly we all came before the throne and now crowns are all around his throne his throne now has to elevate you understand the mountain of crowns are getting so great so great that they that that his crown actually elevates it keeps getting higher and higher until there's just a massive amount of crowns around him and I want you to understand that when Jesus was here he was lowly and simple he was not recognized he was humble but when he stood out of that crown and we began to worship Him He was Regal he was Royal he was King he was King theophany he was King Jesus he was King and he wanted to be recognized and worshiped as king amen he had his robe and he had the train here and he grabs the train as a bride will grab her Train sometimes and hold it up well he grabs the train of his robe and as he does he's looking out and we're all looking at him and we're worshiping him and we're giving him praise and we're giving God glory and he wanted to be glorified and he looks down at all of us and when he does he makes a big sweeping turn and when he does and he makes his final turn all of a sudden it became something nuclear something so powerful it was a blast of light whoa the women's hair blew back there was a power it was so a bright light brighter than the sun yet hurt not your eyes you felt the glory of God my brother my sister one day we will experience that amen and it wasn't until after I had even dream that dream did I read where brother Bram said one day we will lay our crowns at his feet that's praise God I told you that I would just kind of take and walk through a few things if you don't mind if I take my Liberty am brother renham said watch Russia King of the North you all remember that he talks about how to watch Russia King of the North and he says one day Russia will go down after the oil and we all know why they went after Ukraine because they wanted the physical resources in Ukraine and he said there'd be three isms naziism fascism and communism and they all three wind up in communism how many of you know he said that but he says Don't Fear communism he said communism is a hand in the tool of God and communism will never rule the world communism is what God is raising up to destroy Rome he said watch romanism of all the bamboo curtain Iron Curtain the one you better watch out and I'll tell you what he's hitting the news the pope is getting here and guess what he's doing ordaining women into the ministry he's accepting lgbtq why he is a perverter of and and his house is a house of unclean birds do you understand every filth every abominable thing is in him why so now romanism is bringing everything in why he's going to rule the world not communism don't fear communism restoration of the Bride tree brother Brenham 62 don't you never fear communism communism is a god Godless move but you hear some of these preachers stand in the Pulpit condemning communism communism I don't believe in it either that's exactly contrary to the to God's word there's no place in the Bible say says that it'll be that way the Bible says romanism the Catholic Church will swallow the world now hang on here for just a second I'm going to I'm going to Rabbit Trail again I just wonder if any kind of romanism Babylonian teachings or anything that has to do with the Catholic church or creepy now and being accepted among message churches because I wonder if the ministers within the message are reading the same message I'm reading I want to ask you what part of Babylon do you want a part of oh God we got all kinds of little isms and different things rising up up and one going over here and pretty soon next thing you know everything is Christmas and everything is Easter oh my goodness comes in subtle so easily that's right huh I'm a fanatic I always have been and if you don't know it by now I'm going to tell you right now I'm a fanatic for it I'm not here to try to find a new golfing partner I don't even like golf only only golfed I think four times to my life and guess what I don't like it hit a little ball when I hit it I hit it far enough I don't even see where it goes where' It Go that's way down yonder somewhere I found out you better use a colored ball so I know which one is mine otherwise I'll pick the one that's closest to the hole got to be my ball okay just thought I'd throw that in there romanism how about nanism how about bism how about a little bit of bism and nickan ISM I remember when we had our church on Maryland how many of you were there in Maryland do you remember that how many of you yeah raise your hand there you go yeah just a few of us so it wound up that I didn't have a place to park remember that didn't have no place to par i' come and if I come a little bit late guess what I I'd have to I'd have to pack a uh half a mile on the back 40 just to get there to come to church so one of the brothers said I think it was brother John if not I blame him anyway he said brother Ron you ought to have uh a pastor's parking spot oh yeah wow thanks brother John great so they went ahead and Pastor parking yeah I didn't have to hike I did yeah it was great then one of the Elder Brothers of the church that's Nicon yeah nickon I tell you when the pastor has preeminence and it's a nickan that you have a parking spot I told that brother I said show me a quote I said I tell you what I said brother you wouldn't know a nickan spirit if it looked you in the eye then he he backed down because I I can be a little bit of a bulldog and I want all of you to understand if I've ever gotten rough with any of you or ever been a bulldog on a certain situation because when I see it a certain way I see it that way okay I don't mean to be rough I don't mean my wife tells me all the time honey honey when you get like that in the pet don't narrow them eyes don't snarl your nose you know no say it with a smile and so if I have or if I ever do ever ever seem to be a little rough and everything I I I really don't mean it I would trust that each one of you would feel to come to me if there was an issue that I wouldn't be one that would just say who do you have a right uh to come against me well I'm the pastor I'm the ultimate and on hey I'm one of the few pastors that you have my phone number yeah rest of them unlisted man don't give it out to nobody right it's amazing I get email all the time brother Robert I get email and I get letters sent to my house and I'm talking scorching letters that I don't even show my wife I read it and I go oh my first thing I I look and see does it have a name of who sent it now most of these back boneless Namby pambi drive by [Music] Shooters don't give me even an email address to send back to him to tell him what I think well why why waste your time really why do you kick at a barking dog stop it so I get these letters I get them I'd like to have some of their address sometime or at least know their name but most of the time they even got the grit to put their name to it brother Ron I want to tell you here's where you're wrong and this and that said this the other day and anyway now can I get back to my subject one thing that I know and brother Tim when God got a hold of me in the beaches of San Diego of California and he opened my eyes of understanding I did not see brother Ezra William brandham I saw somebody greater I saw a son of man revealing the son of man I have never found discrep IES within the message in this sense listen to me because we're all human we all make mistakes brother Brenham said one time 700 and meant to say 7,000 in the Seven Seals they send him in questions and answers I think he gets four or five questions brother brand did you mean to say 7,000 instead of 700 Yeah Yeah well yeah we all do that we say than according to our understanding let me tell you I have had God give me such great Revelation I probably wouldn't fellowship with me the guy that got converted in California amen why because you don't know nothing man just hang on the unfolding of the word just just keep going just keep reading how many of you say Amen to that keep reading amen keep listening oh you might say well he he he said um Body Soul spirit and then with the opening of the seals he says Body Spirit Soul corrects it hey brother Brenham there's another quote where he says I can prove to you in the Bible that all of God's prophets made their mistakes he said but God makes no mistakes that's let me tell you this revealing of the son of man what we call the message of the hour is nothing else than Jesus Christ making himself known to his people this is the office this is the mission of the son of man I came to seek and to save that which was lost amen here I was long haired dope smoking hippie Surfer out of California just doing my thing and God I come to a door I went to go get a I had a fur Park I was having it relined and on the door it said Hebrews 13 and8 my twin brother was with me yeah just got done smoking some really strong weed yeah my halo just went went up to the door and I Hebrews 13 and8 oh man these people they might be Christians so we knock on the door yeah yeah we're we come to get our Park yeah yeah come on in come on in he goes hey Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever my brother goes are you guys Christians if we hadn't been in the house I would have kicked him I don't want to hear nothing about Christ because I had tried that I had done that I asked God to give me the Holy Ghost and I was sincere I was at Calvary Chapel with that man called Lonnie preaching long-haired beard I think one of my youth in a youth service here the other day said oh yeah Lonnie at Calvary Chapel yeah here it is come up and said you want the Holy Ghost come forward I didn't know what the Holy Ghost was I just know if it's for me I want it period I came forward and you all know the testimony and he said just Babble just speak in tongues just Babble well I I don't know I I'm one of these that if you speak French and say yeah I can get close to it I know a few words yeah I can say something if you say something in Spanish he I can get close to it huh so I don't know what to say but he says well see my tie tie my tie okay see my ties so I do well he says say it faster and louder and so he raises my hands and he said here's another one that got the Holy Ghost now I want you to understand I was sincere I was crying I wanted it and what happens to you when you don't get what you want and you're sincere I want all of you to understand that sometimes God Waits even though you're sincere sometimes God's weit and he doesn't give you what you want otherwise you'd be a spoiled brat but it took a while and so he he raised my hands just start praising God you got it you got it that's why they have to tell the people just confess you got it you come up here and you got to dance you got to speak in tongu you got to do something guess what you got it Hallelujah now just rejoice and so I did I said I got it I got it I ain't got it and I said okay that's it I ask God as sincere if God rejected me that's fine okay God I don't need you and here I was in these people's house and they wanted to witness to my brother and I about Christ I didn't want to hear it and the more that they began to ask questions excuse me my brother ask questions and I understand I don't want to I sat in the corner I got as far away from them as I could I sat in the corner they brought some herbal tea and I just tried to be cool and mellow and not let this stuff affect me but one of the things was and if any of you have ever done drugs and I pray to God that none of you do because nowadays even the drugs that we had 40 and 50 years ago is nothing Satan has refined his cocaine his crack his fent andol one little yeah yeah you Superman Man you big bad you are tough you hey yeah come on man and next thing you know okay Satan's got you one's too many and a thousand's not enough and here I was where Satan had a grip on me I don't know if any of you know what addiction is but it's a horrible thing these two were some of the largest drug dealers in Southern California that got converted so they could tell they looked at me they can smell it they see the influence they didn't condemn me and they began to say some things and I sat over there first thing that I realized when I walked into the house and this is God's truth when I walked into the house immediately I came down in drug terminology that means I came down I came out from under the influence of this drug and I said wow something is unusual here because I should be high for hours hours well it wound up that they began to my brother ask questions and they answer his questions and guess what it's going right over my brother and hitting me in the corner boom boom boom boom boom boom and I think one of them saw it and I'm sitting over there trying to shake all this stuff off and what do you what are you guys doing to me they said hey would you like us to pray for you no do you want us to lay hands on you no I was sincere no I don't know no I'm happy right where I'm at no and then they but they kept they kept persevering I don't know they just did well would you like us to pray for you to have the desire fresh to lay hands on you no and then one of them said this magical word do you believe it's a sickness yes the Bible says lay hands on the sick oh I was caught I was CAU I had nowhere to run I was sick my soul was sick and want wanted God but he rejected me I said father even if you re reject me I'll love you anyway amen I says I can't help it God I love you I said God I said you don't even have to give me the Holy Ghost I said best let me love you they came forward they said we're going to go get anointing oil and as they went to get the anointing oil Austin I dropped on my knees nobody told me John to repent nobody told me there was nobody coaxing me nobody up here at an altar Raymond there was a holy spirit wooing me amen amen I knew it I don't know how long I was on my knees with my hands up praising God telling him I love him I don't know how long and just about the time and I was was sobbing I was emotional I was a wreck and about that time I realized hey these people I don't know these people who are these people this is weird what's happening to me and about that time brother Robert had start coming to my own senses Holy Spirit Will sweep over me again I lose it again I asked these people wow where did did you guys come from these women they got long dresses and long hair and no makeup and in California that's weird I said where did you guys get this I said you guys are 20th century disciples they said we believe God sent a prophet and I said these words musicians have you come I've rabbit trailed around today again I want to speak from my heart amen I said I believe he's a prophet and I don't even have to hear his sermon because I saw the sermon lived let your life be a sermon let your life let the joy of god of what you believe don't walk around like a Sour Puss like you were baptized in lemon juice not loving what you believe I don't know about you but I love this amen I feel honored that God would open my eyes thank you Lord amen and let me see the Splendor of the mysteries of God all of the Loose Ends God bringing them together he said this seventh angel messenger he's gotten specific mystery but he says they probed it this here's the truth they probed at that here's the truth and this message excuse me has made like the great pieces to a great puzzle when it was all said and done there was a picture you know who it was Jonathan it was him it was him the Lord Jesus when I look at this message I see him oh yes God used the prophet messenger but get your eyes off of The Veil The Veil is what keeps many people from seeing the god behind the veil and when he opened my [Music] eyes I fell in love amen [Music] it wasn't Doctrine it was love I fell in love I'm in love with him now today more than I ever have been have I made mistakes sure will I make more most likely but I know this that he that's forgiven much loveth much amen that's why we love him I'm sorry I kind of bounced around a little bit this morning I thought should I preach all on Israel the sign Messianic sign should I talk about all of this and Greens Mill and angels and Seven Seals in the opening should I talk about the revealing of the son of man because the revealing of the son of man wow that's what it's all about even brother brandham on one tape he says one time this is no longer the voice of William brandham I'm using his Voice Hallelujah if I have ever been used behind this Pulpit or if there's ever been a minister in any days of his ministry that has ever been used of God it was because he got himself out of the [Music] way and he yielded to him and then he became God's voice amen that's why the Bible says no man takes this honor unto himself after the order of MDC amen so this morning I thank all of you for bearing with me this morning as I just kind of went from here and there gave a portion of my testimony and a dream all I want to do Saints is be I want to be real and I want to make the Rapture Rapture or bust amen I had a four-year scholarship San Diego State University underwater archaeology specializing in the field of marine biology I took a Latin because of most everything in science and in medical termin terminology is in Latin little did I know I would never get my degree little did I know that I would throw it all away if I could use that term that I might find Christ my parents beg me don't follow this [Music] I can't help it that's right I can't help it I Fell in Love Love Changes Things amen yeah Jesus said if you love me if you love me keep my Commandments amen but it's not the keeping of The Commandments because he who is guilty of the least is guilty of all Jesus said I don't come to destroy the law but to fulfill it I tell you that Moses said a man shall not commit adultery but I tell you if a man even looks at a woman oh God you didn't come to destroy it you came to fulfill it to magnify it Thou shalt not murder there shall not be a false witness wow how many of these Commandments have we broken God I'm guilty so I lay myself at your feet and say father it's just by your grace my brother my sister I want all of you to Rally yourself don't wait for a preacher don't wait for some Revival don't wait for something to get you all stirred up CU God is calling this bride right now to a higher calling this higher calling come up hither John and immediately I was in the spirit he that hath an ear he let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church when you hear he a tape don't just listen with a carnal ear listen with your heart let him reveal to you the revealing of the son of man amen love you thank you I appreciate you coming to the house of God today I got these other pages of notes that's okay to be continued do you know brother brandom actually said [Music] and I don't know exactly how he said it and sometimes I try to look for it and unless you type it in exactly he but he did say excuse me this morning my body will not allow me to rise to the level of the inspiration he said I haven't felt well he said I'm going to have to come back here and preach to you once again he says so that when I'm hitting on all cylinders CU right now my eight cylinders banging on about five of them I'm sweating I can't [Music] see but I have a greater eye Paul I have a greater eye because even though I can't see and read with this one real well I got a greater Vision greater understanding
