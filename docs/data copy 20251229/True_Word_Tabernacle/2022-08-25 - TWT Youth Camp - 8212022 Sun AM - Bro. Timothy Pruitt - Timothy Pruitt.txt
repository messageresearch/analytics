real it's real if that little voice of doubt's in your mind this morning i'm here to tell you someone who stood right there to witness last night the things that were taking place there was a real supernatural work of god going on amongst us lives change forever forever never be the same and so we're grateful for that what the lord has done we appreciate so much the ministry of brother andrew spencer brother timothy pruitt who we're going to invite to the pulpit in just a moment amen they're a real blessing to us amen but i i have on my heart this morning if you would just reverently take your bible and turn with me to hebrews the fourth chapter i just want to do this this morning something when i was a young person i've got out of the habit lately but when i was a young person i would turn to this scripture in prayer before a service hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12. [Music] and not as a superstition but just just uh just an honest gesture of the heart i'd like to put my finger on this scripture this hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 put your finger there it says for the word of god is quick and powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piece piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen it's not been the ministry of mortal men that we've been experiencing this weekend friday night brother brother timothy had left the platform brother ronnie was taking him back to his cabin all of a sudden the spirit of god came back on him he said i gotta go back out there there's one more chain to break amen there was a young lady sitting in the congregation just so struggling so much with those complexes of appearance you know the fashions of this world are really tough on some of our sisters she was just sitting there praying saying lord lord i i just need you to send brother timothy back to speak a word to me here he's already left the platform on his way out of the building the holy spirit turned him around came out to the platform spoke a word directly to our sisters you're beautifully and wonderfully made that's a supernatural that's a supernatural word amen that's not the thoughts of brother timothy pruitt that's the voice of god to you [Music] amen you hold on to that young people amen that's what we're looking for today it's the same god here today you believe that god you're still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart god you can so lead brother timothy this morning to speak directly to my heart right where i'm at a word amen specifically and specially designed just for me because you care for me amen whatever needs you have in your life i know god has has met our needs this weekend amen but i believe there's still a work to be accomplished this morning amen so those needs that are in your life just lift them to him with your hand amen as uh as we maybe just sing an old campground song as we invite brother timothy speak my lord speak my lord is that your desire speak a word to me speak my lord [Music] speak my lord [Music] speak and i'll be quick to answer thee speak my lord speak my lord speak and i will answer lord send me once again oh speak my lord yes lord we're in expectation we're anticipating a word from you and then we'll answer i'll be quick to answer thee [Music] speak my lord speak my lord speak my lord speak and eyes [Music] speak i will answer the case [Music] hallelujah let's just buy our hearts to him today if you have a need just say lord speak to me speak to me give me some encouragement for the journey ahead lord father we bow our heads to you lord today so thankful lord that you are mindful of our needs and our hearts cry lord sometimes we seem you seem so far away and we don't know lord if you do hear if you do understand but lord our our thoughts can be turned back to the scripture that says you'll never leave us or forsake us but you'll be with us lord to the end of the world lord you're always near and lord i can truly say you never left me lord god i asked father the day that you would just come and speak lord may you take the tiredness of our bodies lord let us set that aside for a moment just to to take a few moments with you lord that you would just speak from the throne of almighty god bless each hand that was raised lord you know the needs you know the situations in their lives lord we just thank you for this opportunity once again lord we take it very seriously and it's a very serious hour hour that we're living in lord right at the closing of time right right at the destruction of this world or just any moment lord right at the moment lord of the dead in christ is gonna rise what a day that's gonna be what a day lord we ask father you'll be with each one lord as we would go from this place today and give them traveling mercies home and lord may they go home in order fight with everything that's within them we pray we love you now with all of our hearts in jesus name amen amen you can turn your bibles to first timothy six and also first corinthians 16. i like to just take this opportunity to say once again it's been such a privilege to speak to you and to amen to stand here shoulder-to-shoulder with these men of god and these men of faith and and um amen i i believe with all my heart we're right at the closing of time and um you know uh just from the last few meetings some of the last few struggles some of the last few times some of the last few battles amen we're just right at the last moments and i i believe we ought to give everything that we got amen not hold anything back i don't i don't really want to go and get the on the other side and realize my shield is still shiny and my sword doesn't have a dent in it you know i've never fought a battle but i i want to go over there and stand with those that i know fought a good fight amen so let's look at this scripture amen today first timothy 6 and verse 16 fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses also first corinthians 16 and 13 watch ye stand fast in the faith or stand firm in the faith quit you like men be strong amen we let you be seated i'd like to read you a quote let me start off this thought and where actually bring my my title from the brandon will say someday i'm going to go to a dinner with all of you won't that be wonderful just think after the battle's all over and the smokes died down and we come up and we meet our loved ones and then we meet him and we sit down at the table across from each other won't that be wonderful there'll never be a crutch there there won't be a wheelchair there amen there won't be nervousness there there won't be depression there amen there won't be any of these things that you've been dealing with around that table oh won't that be marvelous and then we'll all be sitting there along the table and i'll look across the table and i'll say well god bless you brother and we'll just have a little cry i'm sure don't you believe so we'll just cry a little bit of joy but then at the head of the table we'll come out our king and his majesty and he'll walk down along all of us and he'll put his arms around us and he'll say you've suffered much but you went through much for me and he'll wipe all the tears away from our eyes and he'll say now don't cry anymore it's all over oh that'll be a great time that's why we're here isn't it amen won't it be wonderful to feel his arms around you and say now don't cry enter into the joys of the lord you fought a good fight so while we're here and we got this opportunity let's make it a good fight a real fight amen i want to speak to you on that let's make it a good fight a real fight now as i want you to remember that we are not on a picnic we are in a battlefield now every day that you live is not in an atmosphere that you have been experiencing as we have been experiencing but you're going to go back to your homes and you're going to face some hard times and you're going to face some hard battles we are in a battlefield many people think you know when they become a christian that's all they need to do and it's settled forever that they're a christian everything's going to be easy don't ever get that in your head amen for i become a christian to fight amen to fight the good fight of faith i become a christian to get in the battle lines we are christian soldiers and we got to be trained we got to be brought up to know all the techniques of the enemy to know how to fortify ourselves to know how to fight the fight we can only do that as a holy spirit will reveal it to us we cannot take what some of the nation tells us when we go to war some of their ideas but we got to take the way the holy spirit will direct us and the ideas he has given us because he is the commanding chief of the army of christians now in a battlefield you don't want to go into battle with a bunch of sissies you don't want to go into battle with a bunch of by spineless people hey man you want to go in a battle with somebody that's got some grit about them somebody you know brother brandon said i hate to see a spineless person called himself a christian amen god wants somebody with grit and with backbone he said like old buddy robinson lord give me the backbone of the size of a saw log and put plenty of knowledge in the gable into my soul and let me fight the devil as long as i got a tooth and then when all my teeth are gone let me gum him till i die amen you've got to get so determined that's right get ready and take over amen i think that's some good advice today i i believe if i can give you some some advice as you leave this campground that you go to your homes and you take over you take over your bedrooms you take over your cars you take over your private life you take over the secrets of your life you take it over amen god doesn't want you to be a spineless christian and you go back and say well i'm here all alone and nobody cares no you get some something about you some grit that can hold on to the promises of god when a preacher ain't there i can still hold on amen when god ain't moving i can still hold on when i'm not in this atmosphere i can still hold on i can still fight i can still give everything that i got i'm not backing up i'm not turning around god has called me hallelujah i'm here to tell you god didn't call just a bunch of preachers to this message he called daughters of god that'll stand toe to the toe with the devil and tell him shut your mouth i'm not listening to you no longer i'm not taking no more of your lies i am here to fight a fight and i got something worth fighting for now if you ain't got nothing worth fighting for maybe i understand you don't want to fight but if you've got something that's worth fighting for i'll tell you tonight amen this morning you have something that's worth fighting more than than something that of a a temporary value but you have an eternal value it's an eternal kingdom it's an eternal place you are fighting for a seat at the table with the king you are fighting to sit there with moses and sit there with elijah and sit there amen with the ones the men of faith that went on you were fighting for that moment you have something worth fighting for so go home and take over amen you're not just taking over in a youth camp god wants you to take over in every detail of your life amen god said so if god said it let's go take over that's god what god wants you to do god's always willing to give it to you to you if you receive it god made a promise so it's yours the promise is unto you and to your children to them that are far off as many as the lord our god so called so the promise is here hey remember there was a couple people i plan on talking to in a few moments joshua and caleb when they went over they thought they'd come back and they said others were saying well there's grasshoppers amen we look like grasshoppers on their side joshua caleb said no we can take it amen brother ben said another way he said caleb said we'll take her amen if you don't want the presence of god i'll take her if you don't want what's in that promised land i'll take it if you don't want the holy ghost atmosphere i'll take it if you don't want overcoming life i'll take it if you don't want the power of god working in your life and working in your church and working in your home i'll take it it's been given to me we can do it is there some young people that are put those words in your mouth i can't do it [Applause] god promised you you could god promises our fathers he said joshua said look it's been promised to us it's our land it belongs to us no matter how wild the cities are how big the giants are what happened he quit looking at the giants and he started looking at the word of god there's a good that's a good tactic right there on the devil quit looking at him and look at the word quit looking at what he's saying about you and start looking at what god said about you quit listening to his thoughts we don't get there amen when men or women quit looking at their sicknesses and their diseases and start looking at what god said about it you will take over all things are subject to jesus christ all things are subject to you in prayer when you ask in the name he said ask what you will in my name and it will be done whatsoever things you desire when you play pray believe you receive them and you shall have them god said so so don't let nothing stand in your way stop looking at the things you can see here and start looking to the unseen god said we can do it hey listen i i can understand not being a fight when you got chains on you you're chained up and you can't be but we heard that those chains have been broken now what you got to do is never go back and pick those chains up again never go back and accept those things again quit listening to the lie of the devil well the devil tells me i can't make it the devil tells me i'm not any good the devil tells me that's no the rapture is not for me the devil tells me i'm next i'm going to be the next one that falls away the devil tells me there's no hope for me you understand what you're listening to you're listening to his thoughts that's exactly what he's thinking he's thinking i'll never make it the rapture is never for me i'll never have a body change i'll never go there i'll never resurrect that is his thoughts start thinking what god said about you i am the rapture i will have a party change [Applause] the promise is mine not just my mamas not just my daddies not just my pastors it's mine [Applause] he said any man in the bible any man through any age that's had any get up about him but see that's the spirit of the age he's trying to take our men and make sissies out of them you ain't called to be a you're called to be a man a man of god that'll stand toe-to-toe the devil called black black and white white he didn't call no sissies to a pulpit what you want is a real man of god that'll stand right in front of you no matter what your face looks like and call black black and white white still preach a clothesline religion still preach the power of god amen still hold on to the promises of god that's who you walked amen i could he said i think about one time there was these israelites gathered up one day on the hillside and this great big old giant came down by the name of goliath he says the devil's like that when he's got the edge on you he'd think he's got you then walked out there about 10 foot tall armored spear i'll tell you what i'll do i'll make an agreement with you israelites let's not shed no blood in other words let your best man come fight with me what did he do brother why he changed who they were amen goliath what did he say won't you say why don't you want to use servants of saul come out here they weren't servants of saul they were the armies of the living god why are you servants of depression why don't you try to fight me you're servants of unbelief why don't you try to fight me you servants of soul of some theology of some psychology why don't you try to fight me amen but he kept coming out there and making that challenge day after day but one day brother brandon said he said it one day too many times because there happened to be a little boy with some grit about him he wasn't no big man he wasn't no big shoulder man he wasn't no seven foot tall fella like like that like saul was he wasn't no ice cube preacher amen he had some grit about him [Applause] he had something that would say and when he heard that voice he said hey what's he talking about servants of saul we're not servants of saul we are the armies of the living god that's what you need to tell that goliath when he tries to come back and he said you servant of depression i ain't a servant of depression i'm a son and daughter of the living god his royal blood is flowing through my veins see david go up to the battlefront she said old glide came out made a great big haha it was his last ha ha it's time to get the haha where it belongs you get the last ha-ha amen think about think about abraham and sarah when he was given the promised son amen they named him isaac which means laughter god gave them the last laugh that devil's been amen it's turned on him now amen god has given you the last life [Music] amen where you can turn to your enemy and say you ain't as big as i thought you was oh boy standing up you looked so big but now you look so little david got him a rock and he went down there and he slew that goliath what the bible said david ran he grabbed that flisting sword and he cut his head off and he grabbed that head up before all of israel he's dead [Laughter] he's dead he said what did that do that gave a bunch of more israelites courage they saw that john was dead so they grabbed their swords and they begin to go after those philistines amen what have you seen in this campaign you've seen depression lifted up you've seen anxiety lifted up you've seen sicknesses of every kind lift it up it ought to give you enough courage [Applause] the bible says that they they went and pursued the philistines to ekron you ever looked at ekron it's the ekron means plucked up by the roots let's pull the root out you need to go home to your closet and pull the root out you need to go home to your situation and pull the root out i'm not listening to that voice no more i'm not listening to that nonsense no more you might need to go to your phone and pull the route out [Applause] hey listen we had a david amen 2 000 years ago that went all the way up to calvary you know i got to go to that same place and i was sitting there and i didn't even know this to that moment but the the brother told us as he began studying about those sayings he said david came to the crossroads and he put that giant's head right well you know it's called the mount of the skull there's a reason because david put it right there so everybody in israel when they pass by they could be reminded this enemy is dead and here our david came carrying that old rocket cross and he brought it right to the same place and he planted it in the same ground and he lifted it up and said your enemy is dead i broke his back you don't have to fear him no more it's over is there some young people this morning they can say yes sir it's over i ain't going back i'm not turning around it's finished and if i come to another youth camp i'm not coming with change i'm coming with praise i'm coming with glory i'm coming with honor i'm coming to thank my god for the victory he's wrought in my life [Applause] that's what we need today he said is the holy spirit spunk well i just like to make peace you spineless i'm a peaceful kind of person meanwhile the devil's making raids on your territory he's taking your children he's taking your promises i'm just p we ain't here to make peace with the enemy we're here to fight so let's make it a good fight let's knock that sucker out he said well that's what we need today is some holy spirit spunk some spunk and some young ladies said i'm not wearing that so i'm sponsoring some young men that said i ain't wearing that it ain't all on the sisters it's on you brothers too i ain't wearing that we need some holy spirit sponsor i ain't looking at that i'm not reading about that i'm not watching that i'm not listening to that voice get some grit about you rise up [Applause] hey you better go back home you ain't got no experience what are you talking about you lying the theological devil i got experiences with god i met him back there i saw what a rock would do to a lion i saw what it'd do to a bear i've seen what it'll do to depression right here i've seen what it'll do to anxiety right here i've seen what it'll do to lust right here i've seen what it do to pornography right here i have had an experience so i know the same god that did that can kill this goliath [Applause] he is as good as a dead man mercy jesus saul found out what it was like for somebody to have some holy ghost spunk he had never felt it for himself apparently or if he did it was a long 20 years ago hey while we're here i don't care where you are you can be 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 maybe 100 years in this message you always need more of god if you get to the place you say i've got enough i don't need no more i'm satisfied you are dead people get the wrong ideas about an altar an altar sure is a place of repentance but it's also a place of worship it's also a place that you can be washed of some things it doesn't always mean you don't lost your religion and you backslid no i need more of god that's why we can't ever take the altars out of our churches cause we always gonna need more of god and if you got to that place you must be somewhere else i ain't got there i want more of him every day of my life so change your attitude about those at the altar it ain't always i'm sorry sinners they need more god amen they might be getting more of god but you need more yourself [Applause] truly then we find out who the sorry sinner really is he said there was a man one time had a dream or a moment and the devil was standing before him and that devil would go boo and he said he'd jump back he'd get smaller and the devil would get bigger and he kept he said he just kept hitting at him boo you don't think he still does that took me about three o'clock in the morning last night to go to sleep because the devil howling and carrying on listen he's always there he came to the prophet of god he stood in the corner when he woke up one morning said what did he say to the prophet of god who had defeated him service after service after service you have no power with god what he said i was looking at that and thought what in the world he said but all of a sudden he said i rebuke you and he said when he did he just fell back and he said all of a sudden the presence of god fell into the room and a voice said the never failing presence of god will go with you wherever you are and wherever you go he's there with you but you got to resist the devil have you ever noticed amen sometimes i i guess it don't happen maybe all the time maybe it does i guess i don't i can't say a hundred percent but i've watched amen when a girl comes to the moment and she's getting ready for marriage the wrong one will try to come first if she took that road her life would have been ruined and wrecked amen the devil is always there to try to get to you first just like he did eve he tried he got to her first amen but brother he said all of a sudden i fell against something and it was the word of god and he said i looked at that and i grabbed it and i made a hit at him and i as i may begin to hit back at him and say boo he jumped back and he got smaller and i got bigger he said he knew then he had some fight in him he said brother every time he hollers boo and you jump back he'll just keep get be getting getting bigger but when you take god's word and you stand there and say thus saith the lord it is written [Applause] he will take his flight resist the devil and he will flee from you he said brother timothy i i don't want no more trial well who does i i've been through a lot who hasn't i promise you as bad as you can get it you can always find somebody that's getting it worse the devil don't want to show you that he wants you to think you're having the worst day and you got the worst life and you got the worst family and you got the worst this and you got the words of that nonsense but the bible says resist the devil now you know when you go into strength training to build muscle it takes resistance the dumbo devil he don't understand every attack that's coming against you and you're resisting him you're getting stronger you ever seen some of them guys they got some big old muscles piled up to here and you you know what happened they resisted a lot longer than you have and they kept resisting that weight that was trying to crush them and they kept pushing it up and pushing it up and pushing it up and pushing up and pushing back and pushing back listen depression's going to try to come back just keep pushing it back spirits of hell is going to try to come against you again just keep pushing him back and pushing him back and faith begins to rise and faith begins to rise and faith begins to rise and faith begins to rise and the devil bring another one on he'll try to put it up just keep pushing just keep pushing and one day you're going to push yourself right into a body change you know i was believe it or not one day i like to ride a bike them days are fleeting i was riding a bike around our place and we we're a little bit more hilly than this place not a whole lot of there's some place you can find a little bit of flat ground but there's more hills and bicycles in me don't like hills i was taking this five miles by the way and i think it's done it went around that loop that's some for real hills down through there and that last hill you go up is a hard one it's the worst one it hurts it's burning it's killing you you're pretty sure when you get up you're dead if you make it up there and there's all kinds of temptations to just stop and quit but if you stop and quit you're never going to make to the top if you stop and turn just you know you ride it back you're going the wrong way you're going further away from home amen you might be going downhill but you're going further away from home amen but we had me and brother tim winters one time we're riding together we're pushing we're huffing we're kicking and i said i'm not quitting i'm not stopping i said cause you know why brother tim this is the last hill because right over that hill is my home right over that hill is my place right over that hill is my family right over that hill oh hallelujah the last hill is tough it's the toughest ages ever been to live in but keep pushing don't get off keep going it's the last hill it's the last fight it's the last battle one day you're gonna face your last enemy [Applause] but if you get off too soon you're never going to win you're not going to make it home might make it into a tribulation what happens there i don't know but you're not going to make it home i said you might make it into a tribulation i don't know if you'll make it through a tribulation brother branham said in satan's eden as he would begin the sermon he said i'd like to speak to you something bring you something to enlighten you to the promises of god for this age not somebody else's or some other day but them things are all right but we can refer to them things sometime but i thought i'd try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures i've got written here that would enlighten you to know to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy so you can block everything before it gets to you that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can amen to keep the point that shows you the devil's got a punch you're not going to go back home and not face one he's not going to quit he does have his last day and i'm very much looking forward to it but right now he he has the ability to still swing and still land punches and sometimes they seem to come out of nowhere coming to places you wouldn't think it was going to happen and he he swings and it punches you and in that punch he tries to attach something to it but see god knew in this great warfare that was coming on between right and wrong he knew what the enemy was going to do he knew exactly so if he knew exactly what the enemy was going to do he knows exactly how to equip his people so he noticed the very first thing that god equipped his children with was being infinite he knew what would take what it would take to defeat satan any time any place anywhere in any conditions i'm sure that he didn't say he knew what it would take that would defeat satan only in a youth camp he said anywhere any time any place any condition he wouldn't say i'll give them something here and then a few laters i'll study years later i'll study out and try to find them something better like we in a military force you know first we started with an old bow and arrow and then we moved to a rock hammer or something and then to a musket and then the springfield rifle and automatic now we got atomic weapons we kept growing but god at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon oh jesus you're not walking away from here with just a little slingshot or you know what i'm trying to say not just something very little and insignificant as it may say god equipped you with a nuclear bomb that's right brother way and you got the codes to it in the world we live supposedly it takes several people to know the codes where they can shoot one but you have the code to it you have the ability anytime you want to push it and release it upon the devil it's an atomic weapon god equipped you with the right kind of uh ammunition for the for the attack right kind of everything that we'd ever have need of and would take you all the way from eden to a rapture what is it it's the word of god that's what defeats satan is the word it'll defeat him anywhere anyplace anytime any conditions we find jesus on earth proved it was the best equipment satan come in hand-to-hand combat with jesus he never reached over with all of his great power he could have tied his hands but he took the same weapon that he gave in the garden of eden his word and said it is written it is written and he punched him right out of the ring with it glory to god he punched him right out of the ring with it so if you'll use the saying it is written it is written it is written it'll punch him right out of your bedroom it'll punch him right out of your private life it'll punch him right out of your family it'll punch him right out of your situation it'll punch him out of your church [Applause] he said look it's not just one or two of us in the church has got this ability it's every one of us it's every one of us that all right have a little equipment failure here let god's equipment don't fail jesus proved it when he come he equipped his children with the word for their protection against the enemy so when all all-out warfare comes and battles are set in array there's only one thing for the soldier to use a real christian soldier that's thus saith the lord well give me some examples okay i'm gonna give you even a really really good one that give you some courage to do something this morning this is brother branham while i've been listening a few days ago to a broadcast that seemed to want to tell that the creation just come from some ashes blowing together in some phosphate and a few chemicals of the earth and the warm sunshine created the germ of life and how ridiculous that was but satan was trying to punch that at me he was trying to punch that to me he said after uh taking my little rebecca to school this morning on the road back i started to turn the radio now he didn't have internet i started to turn the radio on again i thought i'll get into that stuff again so i just turned it back off oh oh that's somewhere some of y'all need to start turn it off that voice has been telling you you're ugly turn it off because i know this voice didn't that voice has been telling you you don't you don't come to the same beauty and the same desires and the same things turn it off whether it be tick-tock facebook instagram and whatever in the world the rest of the things are whatever else the devil had come up with turn it off listen we're not here to get men's approval and i ain't talking about me as a preacher i'm talking about you and you and you the world is always trying to show you what's approved what's right you know what's the right thing to wear and how you ought to be and what you should look like and therefore our sisters start getting all these fake things on them the fake hairs and the fake this and the fake that listen i remember brother branham said there ain't nothing artificial going into rapture and our boys get fake hairstyles and they get fake this and they get fake there and they get off why because they haven't turned the wrong voice off listen sisters you're not here for men's approval you're here for god's approval we're living here for god's approval amen i like how it said one time the girl said i want to get so lost in christ that if a boy tries to find me he's got to find him first and that can go the other way boys you need to get so lost in christ amen to where you're looking for the right thing you're looking at you're pursuing after the right one so i turned it off but satan didn't stop he kept trying to punch satan said to me said you know that man that you call jesus was just a man like like billy graham or war roberts he was just a man that began to have a few people to gather around him and say he's a great man and after a while he became greater to where they made him a god to them now scattered off the wall all over the world since he's dead and that's all there is to it and i thought satan how a liar you are i turned just as i was crossing graham street i said satan you're you that's talking to my conscience i'd like to ask you a few things who was it that the hebrew prophet spoke that would come who was the anointed messiah what was upon those men who foresaw him and told him his life thousands of years before he got here who was it that foretold it was just a letter to the letter four told it to a letter and when he come he was numbered with his transgression and he was he was wounded for our transgressions he was he made his grave with the rich but he would rise on the third day and he did and he promised the holy ghost and i've got it so you might as well get out of my way because it's written in the word and every word is true and then he left that does it he cannot stand that word [Applause] amen some of y'all need to pin that on your door satan how a liar you are proverbs 18 and verse 21 says death and life is in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof what the scripture is literally saying is the words that you speak have the ability to give life or to bring death they can they can bring life to a situation or kill or destroy a situation a proverb the proverb is a simple reminder of how much your words matter out of your mouth you have the ability to build up and the ability to tear down you have the ability to motivate or discourage you have the ability to lift people higher or drag them lower do you have the ability to inspire the greatness or push to mediocracy all because of the words that comes out of your mouth this is the life and death that are in the power of your tongue now i want to ask this question and i how many in here has got a tongue just to wake you up why don't you stick your tongue out and just blow a good old raspberry at the devil come on now he was given high fives last night just stick it up they go that's right you got to talk use it for the right thing you've been doing that at your brother your sister your mom and dad it's time for you to do that at the devil hallelujah [Applause] mama says something you don't like and you should wait till the door closing it's time you start doing that at the devil you ought to be driving down your car and going you stupid devil how liar you are i might have listened to you before thursday night but i'm not listening to you no more i might have been bound then but i'm not bound now you're fighting a different fight you're not fighting with somebody bound no more you're fighting with somebody that's free in the holy ghost that's got an ability to pull the sword and cut your head off hallelujah matthew 12 37 says for by thy words thou art justified and by thy words thou art condemned wow so it's very important that you never let these words come out of your mouth i'll never make it because it won't be god condemning you you'll be condemning yourself but what needs to come out of your mouth i've already made it hallelujah hebrews 4 14 saying that we have a high priest a great high priest that is pastor of the heaven son of god let us hold fast our profession firm in our profession our profession don't end when we leave this service our profession don't change when we get in the middle of a battle amen hebrews 10 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised you're not serving an unfaithful god you're serving a god who will back up his word psalms 19 14 said let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer 14 141-3 set a watch o lord before my mouth i tell you what if somebody would take that to heart and say god put a watch you wouldn't hardly ever talk brother wayne i think i might have dipped into some of that gunpowder somewhere i promise you you would talk a lot less about how things are at church and how you don't agree with this and how you don't agree with that huh parents let me give you some instruction you can go home and kill what you pray what your kids got or you can go home and you can feed it you can build it up you can fan the fire with your words i've seen more sermons tore apart and tore down over a bowl of mashed potatoes and gravy and fried chicken because somebody didn't agree with how the pastor did this or what he said here you need to set a guard over your mouth [Applause] and you wonder why your kids don't want to serve god because they see the god you serve no wonder they don't want to serve that god i don't want to serve him either a god that's bitter and a god that don't they don't care and just tears apart this and tears apart that you need to say god i need a change i need my life hard my heart changed so that my tongue will speak the righteousness of god and the glory of god [Applause] proverbs 6 and verse 2 says thou art snared with the words of thy mouth and are taken with the words of thy mouth proverbs 13 3 says he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life wow well i didn't know them scriptures was in there where they are but he that opened and wide his lips shall have destruction he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction 15 and verse 4 proverbs a wholesome tongue or a healing tongue or a healthy tongue is a tree of life i want to have a healing tongue amen but a perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit well brother timothy that's words what about thoughts okay well words are thoughts expressed brother adam please explain how a person knows if he's thinking his own thoughts or if the devil is placing thoughts in his mind to make him think wrong especially if you know you don't want to thank them now that don't get ready for no algebra get ready for one plus one equals two then if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking so what you young people need to do is quit taking a beating for the devil's thoughts it's not your thoughts it's the devil's thoughts but if it's the word it's god's thinking hallelujah if it's the wrong thoughts it's the devil but if it's the good thoughts of the word and of god it's god's thinking i thought it was mine no it's the devil doing that to you well if i didn't answer it okay if the case may be that the devil is placing thoughts in your mind about a certain thing how may i it be i overcome it or get rid of it take the very vice versa from it if you know you're a christian and he tries to make you think you're not a christian just say i'm a christian as long as your experience matches god's word i'm a christian everything else the same way he says when you answer this please pray for me to overcome this as i'm not i'm not by myself he said god grant you're overcoming whoever you are may your thoughts always go back to the other side and say i'm a christian i'm a believer satan you have no hold on me can we change our thinking this morning i'm a christian i'm a believer satan you have no hold on me now you say i'm just a young person he says frankly i'm standing right here saying the same thing keep from to keep from fainting right here in the pulpit four or five times i've almost pitched over on the pulpit that's the truth god knows that's right the prophet had mind battles jesus had mind battles you're not in a boat by yourself so philippians 4 says finally brother whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things you have to change your thoughts you have the right to take dominion over it's the greatest battle ever fought it's right here amen go listen to it after this go listen to the greatest battle over fall it's right here the devil warned against the mind and in the time we're living in it's worse than it ever been he said a man could come to an altar he could pray all night he could cry he could beg he completed walk them down the floors he'd make restitution but until he believes and accepted he's still a sinner jesus christ is the high priest of our confession profession the same as confession he's a high priest of our confession therefore he can't do nothing for us until we confess he's already done it then that's when he goes to work as a high priest to make good what you profess he will make anything good that's included in the atonement wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes i'm healed not we will be not what we ought to be in but what we are past tense already healed so you got to be careful with your testimony from here on out don't ever have a negative one giving you some ammunition this morning to go fight the devil and i want you to fight a good fight i want him to know that he been fighting somebody when he gets a hold of you i don't want him to go back to hell and say that was so easy oh wimp i want them to go back dragging a leg hey boys that girl that i fought before she went to camp she ain't the same girl no more that was that boy that i had found before camp let me tell you something he's loose he's loose where'd you get all those scars that boy he i thought he was bound still but he's free and he grabbed a sword and that's why i got all these scars that's why blood's flowing because he is fighting don't go back home a wimp go home in the strength of almighty god and fight your fight hey listen this he said if your number is called in a prayer line and if god reveals your heart and speaks to you and gives you deliverance don't you ever have no other kind of testimony only that he healed me only that he delivered me only that he set me free because if you do if you one time testify to the negative side it'll come back worse than it ever was let him that's weak say oh those words work they're more than just words i witnessed them words work and my mama was in a hospital there with a brain bleed and the doctors were standing there telling my dad all the bad news and how it wasn't going to be no good and this that and the other and she's laying it almost in a comatose she ain't spoke in a while hadn't opened her eyes in a while and he's looking at the doctor and he's talking to the doctor and he turns around and said can let the wig say she goes i'm strong her testimony was never a negative testimony listen you ain't gonna die in bed this morning you ain't in that kind of condition you want to build it with all your heart let the weak say i'm strong what you need to deal with too is tell that devil this means war this means war i'm coming back to fight i'm gonna pick up every rock i can get every rock of testimony and i'm gonna stop up your wells i'm gonna stop up your thing i'm gonna destroy your kingdom i found out it ain't just for a preacher i got the ability to fight this means war i remember a young man i may not have all the details exactly right but this young man's a preacher in the message and a powerful preaching the message before he gave his heart to the lord he was doing some things that wasn't right and his brothers was getting saved and the devil was telling him you'll never be saved you'll never be saved it ain't for you you can't make it you can forget about it it's not you're never going to make it in he's coming down the stairs from his bedroom and next thing you know devil i'm tired of you i'm sick of you and he begins to scream and holler now his mom thought he was going to go kill one of his brothers he runs out in the garage and he's shuffling around he finally finds it in a crowbar and he runs up that highway and he runs up them stairs devil you're not going to tell me that no more you're not going to tell me that one more time and he grabs that crowbar and in his room with this tv [Applause] and he hauls it out and he throws it in the trash whoa i pray there's some trash cans that's filled up when you get home devil you're not telling me that no more i'm not going that direction no more we are through this means war let the wheat say ah hamstraw he says healer's not something you can say yeah i believe it i believe it that's all right best you can do just mentally just say it well i believe it i accept it and if you accept it upon those bases keep saying it over and over say it out loud say it over and over just keep saying it i'm healed i'm healed i'm healed i'm i'm healed i'm delivered i'm delivered i'm delivered yes i'm delivered i'm saved i'm saying oh i'm saved i'm saved when you believe it something's going to take place but don't have a negative testimony every time when you confess well i still feel bad i still feel this there's not a man or woman here that's been baptized with the holy spirit but would start your confession and believe i lost it and you'll go right down don't ever have no negative testimony testify positive i'm well jesus has healed me no matter how you're feeling if you go to your feelings you're certainly going to go off the wrong way but if you go back to that every time that you have a negative testimony every time you look at your symptoms you have fallen right there there's not a christian in here no matter how solid you are in the faith if right now something happened to get ahold of you and tell you you're not a christian you start out testifying i'm not a christian as soon as you testify that you've dropped from grace right then amen don't ever let your testimony be negative and don't let your testimony be a negative testimony about other people never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it but when it starts don't entertain it nope not my fault nope not me yep that's me i am an overcomer that's right that's me i am a saved son of god kind of like though you can't sometimes you can't help you can't you can't you're human you can't help thoughts from coming they're going to come but you can kept keep them from stopping and staying there you got to turn

time you become the overcomer instead of the overcome it's time you use the weapon god hath give you you need to quit like a man yeah it's time to use your weapon it ain't just for a preacher to study his guts out and get up there and preach it but you ought to be using it this message was not just given to preachers or grown-ups i promise you if you'd spend more time in the tapes instead of facebook and instagram and all that other nonsense you'd spend more time in that you'd come back to camp a whole lot different that goes for all of us god will only bless you as you confess he's already done it philemon 1 6 says that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every rotten thing somebody's done to you no wrong answer by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in christ jesus i'm fixing to give you some bullets for your gun you ready brother being said this battery lasts seven hours i'm not taking that long lord have mercy

jesus thank you thank you lord we've uh we witnessed two men of god anointed that preach this gospel [Music] not just the mechanics but the dynamics which is christ himself brother andrew last night used joel chapter 2 i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh peter used it in the book of acts [Music] when the holy ghost was poured out he said this is that that was prophesied by the prophet joel i want to say today that we are witnessing that this is that what malachi 4 said would be in our midst when we see people filled with the holy ghost great deliverances healing in their bodies healing in their minds [Music] we serve a risen christ [Music] even as a grandfather witnessing my some of my family getting the holy ghost last night [Music] real genuine holy ghost we've seen the word in action but like brother timothy was saying has to be some overcomers now i think of what brother branham said in the marriage of the lamb said he can't expect god on one side of the tube and you on the other and just he keeps on pulling you through you got something to do he said you got to be an overcomer [Music] and i think he also said it's you know it's it's easy right now when the anointing is here and the power of god is moving but now you'll see the test and when he's tabernacled there don't worry it'll hold [Music] it'll hold i've been a christian since 1967. and i can testify it holds [Music] it holds people [Applause] i appreciate brother nathan brother ronnie and their wives having the burden for the youth and for this camp meeting and i appreciate these two families but not only that but the team that volunteered to get behind them and put this camp on i think we ought to give them a handclap today [Music] praise god praise god so last year when nathan asked me grandpa so right if we have a camp meeting i didn't even think about you know if he got to help to do it so i said yeah i'm gonna go ahead and have a campaign so right away the people gathered around it and made it possible so i appreciate it and not only are there volunteers in our church i believe there's other churches that have put their hearts together and moved into this meeting and helped out and we appreciate you folks very much i say god bless you you know i'm just i'm just a pastor so i stood back and let it all happen i'm the lazy one but thank god for the fruit that'll come from these meetings do you believe that the fruit that will come from these meetings i say praise the lord i say praise [Applause] praise the lord amen amen i want to give you a chance to testify with a lifted hand and say this year i had a real experience with god glory amen hallelujah just one change life would be worth it all those that have come and pour in their efforts and pour in their labors the ones that god has provided to meet every need amen amen just just one true experience with god would be worth it amen but he's poured it out this weekend we're so grateful brother timothy has given you the keys to keep your victory amen change your confession to match your experience amen go home and feed that experience on the word of god it'll last it'll last it's not a temporary blessing god has done something of eternal value in your life you believe that amen we just so appreciate the ministry that we've enjoyed this weekend amen brother andrew and brother timothy amen we thank god for these worship warriors amen amen not afraid to lead the young people into worship into an expression of the faith and the joy and the passion that we feel in our hearts for the word of god glory be to god you know there's a lot of young people that had a real experience with god this weekend broke out in a dance and shoutings and emotional exuberance and you know what the way that the enemy is he comes right behind that coming in your mind with accusations criticisms it's always there it's scriptural amen i feel a little bold this afternoon amen it's scriptural david dance in the bible david's worship and the one that was supposed to be his bride amen she stood she sat in the seat of the scornful amen she was supposed to be his bride but she was criticizing his worship amen and it's really unfortunate that a lot of young people you know they'll they'll have an experience with god they break into a dance and get real liberty and the voice that they they're here in their head is the voice of some so-called message preacher or so-called message pastor or so-called teacher amen but i give thanks to god for his grace this weekend amen if you heard the voice of the accuser in your ear you didn't hear it from this pulpit but we have men of god that are bold and free to worship god is scriptural amen but there's another dance in the bible it's the dance of miriam and when miriam danced there was no scornful ones there there was no accuser there amen there was there was no abuser there was no taskmaster there was no afflictor because they'd all been cast into the sea amen and some people may be mystified this weekend why is it these young people are so free to dance aren't they worried what somebody might think aren't they worried about getting a little too emotional no you know what happened heaven came down the light pierced the darkness and somebody got into heavenly places in christ where they could worship god with freedom and with liberty [Music] we give thanks to god for it heaven came down let's praise the lord one more time lift up your praises unto him lift up your voice he's worthy of all of our praise how could we ever praise him enough amen but it's in order to praise the lord it's the bride's worship blessing and honor and glory and power be to the lamb of god for we know who we are we know what we're shouting about [Music] glory blessed be the name of jesus amen go forth in the word that you heard this morning you get down in the dumps next week next month come back and listen to this service today go feed on the message of the hour brother brandon tell you yeah you're going to make mistakes but you must not look at that stumbling and falling don't have one thing to do with it but a real son of god if he falls down he gets back up his confession doesn't change god knows you're just a man and a woman but he's obligated to if you'll stay in the path of duty hold that confession we need some warriors of worship we need some men we need some women glory be to god god's spoken to us god's spoken to us it's the work of the lord it's a reality we're so thankful for the for the people that god has provided and uh if you'll be all right we we may not take the time to try to call every name but you know who's blessed you this weekend i think it'd mean a lot more if you go find that person don't leave this grounds until you've gone around and said your things find that unsung hero that one working off the scene not the one in the spotlight and express your appreciation amen and we just thank god for the workers for the singers for the musicians for the servers for the leaders for the night guards for the sports facilitator for the we thank god for the coffee brewers we thank god for the ministry amen we thank god for brother samuel browning speaking to our older youth brother jonathan martin bringing him a wonderful word ministering to us on friendship we thank we thank god for the friendship of brother jonathan bible believers we thank you for your friendship for being a friend of this youth camp amen we give thanks to god hallelujah [Music] amen there's not a single person on this campground that's here working and laboring that's doing it to get their time in the spotlight [Music] amen these people are not they're not the type of people trying to get the book of their life to be written i don't want the book of my life to be written i'd like to be a chapter in yours we'd like this youth camp to be a chapter in the book of your experience with god so we're thankful for what he's done amen before we leave i want to let you to know to there was a lot of valuables and things left in the dorms make sure to check you have all your belongings lost and found back here if you haven't got a sticker yet this year see sister felice take a little keepsake home with you next year youth camp is moving up a week because there's a lot that would like to be here but their school starts just a week too early so next year it'll be august 10th to the 13th write that down lord willing if we're here if not there'll be a meeting in the air and you talk about heavenly places there there the doubters will be absent all together there'll be no critics there there'll be a new accuser there there'll be nobody trying to trying to press it down there there'll be no fear of a little emotion there it'll be perfect liberty amen amen so next year august 10th to the 13th amen and uh from here i know you want to visit and fellowship out front but as was announced the the mcnulty's have opened their home for for a camp after party so what we really want to do is keep you up here get your luggage loaded up and then get you over there where you can fellowship so you're
