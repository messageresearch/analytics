season food for the Youth and for all of us uh this meeting came about uh when uh we were sitting in the about four years ago we were sitting in the church office Nathan was sitting there and he said say grandpa there's an opening at St Mary's Camp he said uh do you think we could have a youth camp and I had to ponder for a while because I know it's more than just having a youth camp takes a lot of workers but you know brother Ronnie long and I I don't want to just say about brother Nathan and brother Ronnie but their wives they put their heart and let's give them but I saw the vision just come to pass in Nathan's heart and brother Ronnie's heart it just and and and all the saints just got right behind it because I knew as I was sitting there pondering about whether should we have it or what but I knew that it was going to take a lot of work and you know not only the local church but you saints that have come and put your heart and soul into it to help help make this a success God bless you all for that amen we're living in a very crucial time amen and everything that God has for you should open your heart because this is the moment that the Bible was speaking about that to be an end time bride and there's never been a day like this day and you know the brothers for those that don't understand it you know they're saying you know talking about the message the message the message maybe some youth even don't even know what it is it's actually Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen and that's why you see what you see glory to God that's why you're see and as an elder I just standing here last night the last three years four years just seeing what God does the Lord came into my life in 1967 my wife and I I want to tell you young people it don't hold

uh certainly a great honor and a privilege to be here with you amen maybe you could just be seated just for a a minute and I just want to take this opportunity to just uh thank uh brother Nathan and brother Wayne brother brother Erikson for uh the invitation to be here and just be a part of these meetings and I I believe that we can say we've truly been blessed and amen we uh appreciate um brother Andrew Glover amen how many how many just appreciates brother Andrew's Ministry and I uh so thankful then you know I believe that God just give a brother Andrew just a special connection with the with the young people and uh we just thank God for that and and so um we're just happy to be here this morning and um I I believe that um brother Joe yeski is are they here this morning um maybe somewhere and uh we um brother Joel and sister Robin amen they um I understand that they've um God us put a child in their life and and um we um you know sometimes the circumstances um of um that um that surrounds things you know sometimes uh those circumstances can be uh you know so difficult and and there many problems that that that you know but I think about the the circumstances you know that um uh that brought the woman to the well that day and it was because of the circumstances of her life and why she was there at that time was brother R says she couldn't come to the well with all the other uh women women you know but it was because of those circumstances it brought her to the well at that time and and you know sometimes you think well things just happen by chance but not with God friends nothing happens by chance and somebody say well you know that was a mistake or you know maybe you know uh somebody have a child and they said that was a mistake but see God don't make no mistakes amen I believe that this morning and so they had a desire that we would just have prayer with him and over this uh young man that God has placed in their in their life and I believe they're in the process of maybe uh adopting him and so I I tell you um I thought about that uh my my wife was sharing with me some of the testimony of how God brought this to past and uh as I thought about it I thought about all the children all the little children in the world that would maybe be um you know under these circumstances but God would take one and bring him in a home like this and um listen friends God God he knows what he's doing this morning amen so maybe we just uh join together maybe some of the brothers would like to come this morning and just join with us amen what's his name Josiah amen amen we're just going to pray you know sometimes um with the with the circumstances um that these children are born in it has lasting effects uh on on them but we're just going to pray that that every every effect of the circumstances that he was born in would just be be washed away by the blood of Jesus Christ and amen this just again Lord Jesus Lord we thank you Lord for this family Lord as we look at this couple God lord and how that you have now blessed them and we know Lord that no matter how you give our children to us Lord whatever Channel or however you decide to do it Lord Lord our children are a gift from you and they're Our Heritage and Lord God I pray Lord you see the circumstances Lord and Lord All the Troubles and Lord and this young man has his birth Lord and the circumstances that surrounded but God lord I pray Lord that the power of God would just come and may the cleansing of the blood of Jesus Christ just wash away every Lord every impact of that out of his life and Lord I pray God as he brought him into this family now and as they begin to raise him in the fear and amination of God Lord that you would follow him all the days of his life oh god build a heds round about him like he did job that even Satan couldn't get to him Lord Lord I pray that at the appointed time when he comes to an age Lord that that you would begin to speak to him and that you would draw him by your voice and I pray oh God that you would put something in his heart Lord to respond to that call Lord bless uh brother Joel and sister Robin this morning I pray God that you would give them strength and Grace Lord may you be with them in every step of this process God and Lord I pray God that you would give them Lord Lord the wisdom and the understanding Lord and Lord the grace that they would need Lord as they have taken on this great responsibility and Lord Jesus we ask these things this morning
