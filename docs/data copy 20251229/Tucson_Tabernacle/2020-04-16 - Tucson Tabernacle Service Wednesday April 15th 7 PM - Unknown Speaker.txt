[Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh [Music] Cinci [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh bless [Applause] [Music] [Music] a merely yield to him completely thank you musicians god bless you thought that was the right song to to Kim to come out with gesture kind of along the thought of this this evening but to yield and surrender and and say Lord whatever you would and and not to fight against it but to yield answer surrender against insu heard the testimony him brother Jeremy and sister Angela healthy the lost wallet in a couple of days ago myself and Rachel and Naomi went to the park we were tossing some frisbees around out there and Naomi said down her backpack there her debit card fell out or somehow fell out didn't know till we got home and she was checking and there were other folks around that area so her and Rachel went back and walked right across and as they were walking straight across to where we had sat down there in the field was a debit card Lane they're so grateful for the help that God takes care of every one of our needs and and he knows how how to do that and then our son-in-law Steven back in Wichita they had they had gave them some time off paid and things and then they got a note or they were heard this morning that they had been furloughed and so later on that morning Steven got a call from his boss and said this affects everybody but you he says we want to keep you we want you two to stay on with us so God keeps to takes care of us and I appreciate that so he's been good to us and he's made our every need and never fails so that's let's go to the first scripture there brother Jeremy maybe seem a little a little different a little odd and how to start this but asking the Lord to allow me to deliver the thought that's in my heart it's proverbs chapter 16 verse 25 and it said there's a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death so it's well maybe as we go along you'll see how that fits well let's just bow our heads Lord we we've come this evening and we've gathered here Lord those of us that that can be gathered and wherever your children are Lord and it would be and would be wonderful to have everybody here if we could but you know the reasons why and Lord let us take been the the get a benefit from it Lord in this time and wherever your children are today Lord and maybe some are working somewhere driving some at home wherever they might be Lord it they would set this time and and let you minister to them speak to them Lord I'm sure there's questions and and concerns Lord but you're you're mindful of us Lord so we ask you to minister to each one wherever they might be Lord and lord let us speak words Lord that that you would put in our mouth or not our thoughts Lord but what you would have because you know what we have need of Lord because our ways will get us in trouble Lord but through us salvation in your ways Lord we ask it in Jesus Christ's name Amen so there's a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death way back in the beginning a recorded history if I could say was written down in the Bible when man started his own way he introduced death and they thought everything was okay everything was right and everything would be fine but now we see the the prolonged process of that to where man has gone today but God is still in charge God is still in control and sometimes as brother Matt ministered Sunday morning and it may seem to you that I'm copying him today but that's not how it happened when Sunday morning I was talking to my wife reading some scriptures and I began to say look at this look at this having no idea what brother Matt would be ministering but it tied right into into that so see how the Lord will lead us to do that but God has never failed us he's never left us and never will God keeps his word brother Branham taught us he's only as good as his word and we are only as good as our word because you know when you fail somebody or somebody fails you once it's hard to build that confidence back up you know it's it's it seems like when when you get hurt or you fail somebody or somebody fails you it it takes some time to reestablish but God has never failed and you know we appreciate that soon I'd like to read something through the daily strength that came in I believe this was maybe Monday night or Tuesday and I'd like to read this to you it just fit right in with the thought here says did you know that your body has to have protein and that proteins contain nitrogen but in order for our body to get this nitrogen from the proteins it it has to come from the plants and animals that we eat we can't get nitrogen in our lungs through the air we breathe our body chemistry can't just absorb nitrogen molecules as this so molecules in the air has to be broken down the nitrogen in the air consists of two atoms which are bonded very tightly in order for us to absorb this nitrogen the two atoms have to be separated a little science lesson that here but this is the part the way these molecules are broken down is during a thunderstorm when a storm is raging there's enough electrical energy in the clouds and lightning that they separate the nitrogen atoms in the air the storm then brings a broken molecules down to the ground in the form of rain so the nitrates that the soil needs a type of fertilizer gets a nitrogen by the storms obvious lend this obviously then the cycle takes place the nitrogen now is in the soil in the soil is absorbed by the plants growing up then when we eat the plants our bodies get the nitrogen so without the storms we wouldn't have nitrates without the storms of life you won't spiritually grow properly God allows even the storms to benefit us and grow us and strengthen us in the myths of the storm he teaches us just how much of a shelter he is for us when the storms are raging take peace in the fact that God is doing something marvelous although you may not see it he is piece from your storm and I thought I was appreciated that because he knew the thoughts in my heart and thing and I read that and that was I believe it was Monday evening and I said thank you Lord that you would confirm that so a couple of quotes here the first one from the message of greater than Solomon is here preached in 62 and just just to establish this and it's not that we don't know these things but sometimes just to read them and remind ourselves this now we've got to have the faith that Abram had in the Word of God that's right that's that's what brings the things to pass is faith in what he said you'll never move it no other way but have faith in what God said you must take his word above everything else let every man's word be a lie in God's be true what God said just believe it if you can't believe it that way you'll never get nowhere with God you might be able to join a church somewhere but I mean get somewhere with God see that's a whole lot different you know there's a lot of people in right now with all the streaming that's going on and you open up your maybe Facebook or YouTube and you see every church is if having to operate this way and not being critical or anything of they're doing what they have what they know and everybody's doing that and and it's you know you look at some of it and and you would say my goodness you know I and that wouldn't satisfy me you know I need I need more than that or my my my desire is more of God than that you know and but to whatever God allows them to do I'm not being critical of that but I just know my desire is more of you Lord more of you know not not just a little bit I'll take that a little bit but I want more of you and then I thought that with I surrender all I surrender my will I surrender my ideas especially when my ideas put me in a place that it might be contrary to what God is doing not that I want to be contrary not that I want to go against his will in any way but looking out on my way sometimes it's actually not the right way or the best way and that's what what Solomon said in Proverbs is that a man if he thinks he's doing right and he's actually leading himself to death and so he's you know he tells it and then he tells us in proverbs 16 we'll read some verses here 1 2 3 and the 9 and 17 we could read the whole chapter but just as the preparations of the heart in man it the preparations in the heart we make we make plans we do this he said but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord he will allow if we let him he'll speak what is right there's times that we've had we've pulled this way where we're filling this way and I say Lord you help me in this situation you you you direct me in this situation if I can yield to it then the right answer comes out and and that's how we want all the ways of man are clean in his own eyes and and and I you know I can honestly say and I would say of all of us we don't have an intention to do wrong we don't have an intention to fail we don't want to be wrong but we can be there's only one perfect one and that's God but the Lord with the spirits he looks to see what is the mode of what is the driving force behind that what's causing us to act the way we're doing and then he says commit thy works unto the Lord and I thoughts shall be established as we kneel down we pray Lord I know that my heart's desires but I'm yielding to you I'm surrendering to you I'm saying Lord what is it that you want and let him set then then we'll go to verses 9 and 17 a man's heart devises his way but the Lord directs his steps and I'm grateful to her that very much so because who knows where I might have been had I had I followed all the devices of my heart the highway of the upright is to depart from evil and he that keepeth his away preserver save his soul so brother Matt had talked about that beaten path and it's it wouldn't when he was talking there he says you know you go he said it you've been there so many times you've gone that way so many times there's actually away a marked way and when he was saying that it made me think being out on the open the mountains hunting or especially here in Arizona where there's not so much thick brush and trees that you can actually see and you can see the game trails there well used trails through the hills that the game use and it's it's a marked way and if you sit on the side of the hill and you'll spend some time you watch them moving they find the easiest way to go now if you startle a deer maybe he might go straight up the side of the mountain but if he has his choice he's going to use a game trail and and I found we financed brother Matt was saying because you've been there because you've gone down that way if you you've sought the Lord that way you can go back there and say I sought the Lord I'm going back to that spot where he met me and so this is just a culmination of those of those thoughts today and and then will will read from the evening messenger will read some more quotes here so sometimes these things happen for good you know the Bible said they were together for good now remembered job all of his trials now that wasn't God chastening job but a chaste I'm sorry chastening job that's pretty close to job but it was God approving his servant now you and I might look at it and say boy I I'm I'm getting chastised I'm really in trouble but God is doing something with that he wants it wants to to show something out of that so it all worked for good you see and then the book of Job was wrote for all generations for a testimony so if it was written of Job that way then it's written of me and you that way for a testimony now God's working is for good so that's an established thought God's working is for good the supernatural we realize that this is like experiences of a Christian sometimes we have to go through terrible chastisement chastising of the Lord many things to correct us that will be fruit bearing Christians sometimes has to prune us cut off take away take out of our hands we think sometimes oh god what are you doing to us but he knows what he's doing so we pray father that today that you'll prune every one of us from the least to the greatest the pastor God we pray that you'll prune every one of us take away all that's unlike you Father take away the thing that's hindering us from being fruit bearing Christians the day is coming when it go when it's going to get dark and we want to go into the sheepfold we want to be sheep today father we want to follow exactly in the footsteps of the shepherd he gave us as an example I come not to do my will but the will of him that sent me may that be our motive today God to do the will of God who saved us and again sometimes we have to check ourselves closely is it something I want and you know is it is it really I'm saying Lord I want this because I want it or are we saying Lord well you know I surrender all whatever you desire from three kinds of believers job went through the trials and the tests his children taken everything else taken the church members come accused him of being a secret sinner and tried to say everything against but yet he wouldn't listen to any of it he knowed he had met God's requirement and that's the key he had met God's requirement that's all you and I can do is to meet God's requirement but you know the Bible teaches us the things that God asks us to do and we do them that's what he asked us to do he says he know that there's no need of Satan trying to tempt him he know that it was a devil as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had Joe whipped but once what when Joe but once struck the revelation that it was not God he was only going through his trials to make him something it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it and remember Satan had to get permission to do it and same thing today he'll try to tell you that these trials is things your God trying to his things has got your God trying to put punishment on you it isn't so no sir it's Satan doing that and God permitting it to temper you to make you to see if you're tied to this earth by the earth cares or whether your treasure is in heaven for wherever your treasure is there you you also and and again sometimes we're looking at and saying Lord what are you doing to me why but God is in there and he's again he's going to show that his children are gonna be overcomers they're gonna they're going to be exactly what he said and this one I didn't give to brother Jeremy and I told him about it I said because I got it this afternoon and so I'll read this one here and I just it just fit so perfectly and can anything happen to a Christian without it for the best and he says no no no so what God so what did God get him out there alone on the island for and he's speaking of John when he's taken to the island of Patmos he says gives us the book of Revelation see God just can pull the wool over the devil's eyes anytime he wants to can't he he simply can't I just love him because I don't have to be smart see now if I was smart I try to forget all about it because I know no one could care be so smart like him and so he's telling me he pulls the wool over Satan he allows Satan to do these things and Satan told we know when he approached Jehovah their God he's there and he's saying have you considered my servant job and saying goes yeah but I'll get him to turn against you and God says go ahead I think Satan might have been a little wow that was easy he didn't even fight me for it yeah I didn't have to battle but he didn't know he's a tool in God's hands and and I we know that you know well sometimes we forget it sometimes we struggle through it so let's look a little bit at that there you know and then just just one more scripture here before we get into jobs I'm here in the book of James chapter 1 and 12 verse 12 blessed is a man okay blessed is the man or blessed that endureth temptation what a way - what a way to get a blessing huh you know hey you're gonna get a blessing today brother Jordan you're just going to be blessed you're gonna be tried from the moment you get up to the midnight moment you go to bed and brother jobs brother Jordan's gonna say I don't know if I'm will get out of bed then but here James house blesses a man that endureth temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord have promised to them that love him and I read this and I looked at at what one of the other messengers how they approach is it happy is a man that endureth temptation trials of various kinds he shall receive a crown that fadeth not away which the Lord has promised to them that love him and his enduring proves his love for it is love only than endureth all things as scripture tells us that love all things so it tells you when you endure that you have the love of God in you so again it's it's a blessing even though at times we're questioning as to why but God has a purpose in all of this in in he's going to bring to pass everything that he has seen on it everything that he has said there will be a bride without spot without wrinkle without blemish there will be like he said I'd Eve that would not fall the second Eve Satan has done everything he can to try to stop that but God said there will be those that overcome selves we look in it in a little bit here with job and it was it was a scripture that I opened up with in the morning so let's go to job 22 we'll read verses 1 through 5 to start and then 21 and 22 just to save a little bit of time and we know we read enough and heard enough of job that his three friends come as three brothers however you want to later I'm sure they came with every intention to help job I don't think the three of them got together and said you know this is our opportunity to finally get even with Joe week and terram you know I think they they felt in their heart that they were coming to help job you know but they were gonna have to show him where he was wrong you know I said then Elif as the ten of my Tim up temanite answered and said and it just says here in it and it says that Elif as in in the notes that he was the son of esau or i descended of esau he says and it was given to him and this argument to try to prove to job where job he was trying to prove it look there has to be sin in your life it fell upon or his portion of the argument was that part and the so he says can a man be profitable unto God as he that his wise may be profitable unto himself he could are you at a place job where God would profit from you in the sense could you could you could he say well you know what you're right job I hadn't thought of that you're right I'll have to take that into consideration he said is there any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous or is it gain to him that thou make us thy ways perfect no he's telling Joe business you are nothing to God you're not helping him you're not building him he's not looking to you this is Aleph s speaking to job will he reprove thee for fear of thee will he enter into thee with into judgment job did he is he gonna sit down I said man I need to come down and talk to job because if I don't get his opinion I may not get this right he says or if I don't do it I he may have it right in and I'll be wrong this is what L offense is speaking to job it's not thy wickedness great and thine iniquities infinite and if he finally comes down to come on job you've messed up you failed you've done wrong you've sinned you there's no other reason for this happening in your life but yes so as you know and he lays out quite a bit but let's jump to over to 21 and 22 and this was the scripture that caught my attention a quaint now myself with him and I looked up the word acquaint and it says to cause to know personally to make familiar to cause to know firsthand not by over somebody else's opinion not by all somebody else's suggestion and it's good to hear what others have how they have met the Lord it's good to hear a testimony but you have to have your own testimony you have to acquaint yourself with him personally because you cannot live on somebody else's a revelation experience you have to meet God for yourself you know I I can't eat for you and you can't eat for me I've got to eat for myself if I want to live you know it doesn't work that way so he says a quaint ice now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good shall come unto thee receive I pray thee the law from his mouth and lay up his words in thine heart and there is nothing wrong with that that's that is a good suggestion acquaint yourself make him become a personal acquaintance of somebody who spend time with and again this was as brother man was speaking and this was in my heart and he talked about that pathway you know him so well you've acquainted himself you know his ways you know what pleases him because you've been there so many times there's a path trod there's there's a way there's not a not a going and searching and trying to find but I know that if I'll go like brother Branham used to go to the cave when he would go to the cave because he needed to hear from God and it was a place set aside he had made that acquaintance with him he had met with him it had become personal to him and he could go to that place he says and then he says receive I pray thee the law from his mouth and lay up his words from thine heart now we know the spirit that Aleph as was aimed at him in accusation but I can look at that in the right spirit said yes Lord I want to be a personal friend I want a relationship with you that's personal and I want to receive the law from thy mouth and lay up your words in my heart so that part was good with just what spirit wasn't given in so we go to the next chapter in Jobe answers and Jobe answered and said even today is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning he says I'm a bitter I'm hurting I'm wandering I'm under striding to figure this out and he says my complaint is bitter the stroke that I've received is even heavier than my groaning if you think my groaning is hard to hear the stroke that I've borne is even harder to bear sometimes you see somebody walking and they may have a smile they may look happy but they've received a stroke if you could say they've received something and this can be hard to bear and and we're all different in how we express how we show how we manifest some people you can almost read them their face their expression everything you know you know when they're not having a good day that pretty well everything about them tells you and there's others that you wouldn't know because but everybody's different we were talking about the other day and then I said to my wife or my wife said to me is just she said it's like you when you're when you're really serious everybody's wondering what's wrong with you they kind of look at you because my face get serious and everybody's like are you ok is everything and I and I said cuz most of the time I'm not it's not how I show myself but they think something is wrong and and then sometimes she would tell me be serious and I say yeah but when I'm serious you think something's wrong with me you know I said but but that's the way everybody expresses themselves differently you know so he says and then he says oh that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat I would say the same thing oh that I could find him I would know how to get there and again there's that pathway where he is brother branham said it this way go to where you left him he'll still be there if there's that place that God meets you you know getting to a point as we saw on brother branham's life going through the troubles and the trials and the heartaches not because because he surprised God and God headed God knew exactly where he was gonna be but had to put him through those things to get to that point to hear speak to that storm speak it away so it doesn't break this fellowship that I'm having with you I'd love to be to that place when God would say just speak those circumstance those situations out so you and I could continue to have this fellowship we're having you know sometimes and something comes up and you know you have the intentions to pray to read your Bible and something comes up a situation comes up and you have to go deal with it someone that was someone is sick someone gets hurt you have to and you got to do it and you know and those things do happen but I would want God to say just speak to it it'll resolve itself because I want to have fellowship and this is job saying that I was old that I could go to that place that I might find him that I might come to a seat I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments you know Lord I don't deserve this really I've done everything you've said I'll Drive it I don't deserve this again we can read the book of Job and know why but job was going through it living it and he's able to write the book after until Hawaii is this I would order my cause before him fill my mouth with arguments let's go on I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me if I could get to him he could explain to me why this is happening what did I do Lord to deserve such treatment will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me and sometimes we get before God and we say we surrender we yield and we say Lord I need you I'm down to nothing and I need you but in your meeting with me will give me the strength that I need there the righteous might dispute with him so should I deliver forever be delivered forever from my judge job stood on the fact that he had laid a sacrifice down every morning that's all that job had the first book written in the Bible the oldest book they say job knew that he laid a sacrifice he had taken the life of an innocent animal and sacrificed it in his stead to meet the requirement of God and he says so he says I've done that I the righteous I can only stand on that that's all I can stand but if you can stand on that and go to God and said I've met your requirements I've come under the shed blood of the Lamb and you're permitted an entrance with him talk with him let's go on behold I'd go forward I go forward but he's out there and backwards and I cannot perceive him now here's Jobe saying I'm trying them doing this and I can't find him seems like he doesn't answer he seems like he's not there brother branham said the ceiling was brass while he was praying it just seemed like the prayers would rebound off him and come back down on the left hand where does he work but I cannot behold him he hided himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but then this is what Jobe speaks but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold and that's where you and I have to come to that same place Lord though you slay me yet I'll trust you though you try me though I go through these hard times I know that for a reason you're doing it there there's a purpose in it and that purpose is to be gold before you to bear the fruit as brother Bram said a fruit bearing tree that's the purpose for the pruning the-the-the-the what we would say sometimes I'll that hurts man why did you do that but there's a reason for it I shall come forth as gold and I've said this because you are gold the testing and the trials don't make you into gold but rather God knows his children and what's in them and therefore he's bringing it out of them he is showing what you are and who you are he says I shall come forth as gold pure refined tried into fire now you and I again get to read the story and get to know but job didn't job again is wandering and his accusers are really helping them feel that way about it you've sinned you've done you've grieved God if something you did Jove you need to confess it to us you need to tell us what you're done what have you done Joe go back recount all your steps go back in your life look where did I make a mistake where did I fail because that's why God is trying you that's human reasoning that's a human logic now there's no question about it we should just take a look at our steps sometimes look and see what is there something I need to clear up is there something I need to take care of if there's something that's troubling you is it something that you need to resolve but but if you're not careful you'll live your life in that God doesn't love me God doesn't I've made a mess God oh no no you've made it right you put it under the blood then move on go with God but this is a job says I go forward he said but I know that when he is when this is all said and done I shall come forth as gold I will be exactly what he has tried me too made me to be some maybe I could say it this way some get there faster and some get there slower some of us take a little bit more shaping beating banging tough to come out the way maybe some it just are able to yield better learn faster I don't know but God knows that and then in Hebrews chapter 12 and we'll read verses 5 through 11 we know the end of the story of job you know in order to get to if I've said it this many times in order to get to a chapter 38 in the book of Job where God comes down and speaks to him face to face there had to be a testing and a trying and a going through now God is remember we go back to that first chapter and Satan had gone before God and said and God asked him what are you been doing he says I'm just going to and fro looking around seen see what mischief I can cause looking at you I can trip over see who I can cause to fail that's that's what I do and he's good at it yeah and he says have you considered my job you know I would say Lord hey you know don't do that to me but that's how you find out where you stand and he says yeah I've considered him I walked around but I really can't get to him because there's a hedge all the way around there's a fence all the way you've got him well-protected he says so you know and so we know that part of the story he allowed Satan to come down nothing happens that God is not aware of that God doesn't have his hand but there's a testing of trying and approving of his children you know when the teacher says let's take a test it's let's find out if you've learned what we've been working on what we've been studying what we've been what we've been taught on that that's what he tells us so we get to Hebrews chapter 12 verses 5 through 11 and have you forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto us as unto children my son despise not the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him you know it's one of those things you know and I'll just say this and I have to say because it was units in my family and we'd tell the girls you know I need to talk to y'all and you know sit him down and sometimes there's a whole family sometimes individually and then later on in life as he got older and they would tell us we'd say or my wife would say dad says he wants to talk to us all let's see let's go to the living room and they I would hear them among themselves laughing okay is this is this lesson number 11 or is this lesson number 13 and it would kind of laugh about it but it was something we would sit down and he goes you know it is something we would sit down what we need to address this thing we need to deal with this whatever it might be sometimes discipline sometimes good news whatever it was you know he says and don't be faint don't don't don't how would I say in faint don't get so weak either one way Lord how come you're always after me or Oh Lord I'm just no good yes Lee he says don't be fake because then he answers it let's go into six for whom the Lord loveth he chasing it and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chased myth not brother branham taught taught adoption under this a son was tested was tried he was going through and and if he didn't come through and he showed he was still a son but he was not adopted the business was not handed over to him it was never given the checkbook with the authority to use it let's go on so put it if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then you're bastards and not sons you are not born a child a clod it's pretty simple so if you are a child of God if you are being test and tried that's a good sign that God loves you that God's thinking about you that God once he knows what's in you and he's going to bring it out it says furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much more rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live let's go on finish them for they verily for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure but he for our profit he said that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby you say Wow Lord I need some more exercise I need to work with this some more I'm willing Lord I surrender I yield to that Lord there are some things in my life some ways that there's still trouble me some some reactions that I have sometimes so Lord if it pleases a father there's some more you know what you're what you're saying you're saying Lord chastised me where I need chastisement but I Joe I'll say I shall then come forth ice cold and I didn't put the scripture and but Peter says think it not strange when fiery fiery trials when you go through some hard times when these things see me don't think it's strange it's part of the life it's part of the process when a seed is planted into the granite ground it has to die we wouldn't think life is going to come out of death but if we can kill this old nature the shell around us so that life can be born the life of God and then fruit can be born no it won't be too much too much longer here but Psalms 139 David we know the life of David and it's well written through through the Old Testament a man after God's own heart but I found David I find David to be a man also human flesh subject to temptations subject to failures numbers the people when he was told not to number why not number the people because then you look at it and say hey we did this in our strength and God doesn't get the glory and when you don't give God the glory you're in trouble you gonna pay for that but when you say it's not not by might not my power but by this spirit saith the Lord you know and David had learned that as a young man as he's growing up and he's a sheepherder he's taking care of the sheep of his father as a young man and you know and he realizes and and he sees that bear has that encounter with the bear and the and the lion and and he just knows hey these are my father's sheep it's my responsibility to take care of them we know that he wrote these Psalms and he sings them and the different things you know at what age he started I don't know maybe that's what he was doing well washing watching the sheep but somewhere someplace in that he realized these are my father's sheep I got to protect him and he went after the lion and he went after the bear something inspired him to do that so now when he comes to Goliath his father sends him go see how your brothers are doing and take them this a little bit of bread and cheese there's there's you know and it's you know give them a get out there and see how they're doing and he walks onto the scene of Goliath there's this big giant standing there threatening the armies of the Living God and David goes back to what he had just gone through and he looks and he says you know there was a lion and there was a bear and God met me there he gave me the strength the ability to take care of the Sheep this man is no different why is it no different then because God is still the same yesterday today and forever it wasn't just God on the back over there he's still here today you know I was listening to a man and and the tie his thought was what was the secret to brother branham's ministry and he was not a con quote a believer but he talked about the sacrifice the humility the the the willingness to surrender all to have that ability to have God moved that way which is the truth and took a lot it takes a lot out of us you know let me maybe that's not the way it said but for to get it all out of us shall I say it that way we have to be willing to say yes Lord because we are we as humans we find our own ways there so is we know of the life of David there were some great victories and there was some pretty low times too there was some times where David like you said I could I could run through a troop and leap over a wall and there was another time when he had a man put to death so he could take his wife you and I would have never forgiven him of that but God it was happening tip god call said a man after my own heart sometimes we won't even let our brother and our sister sit close to us yet God said of David a man after my own heart as through the trial sister though things God orchestrates them to bring that character in us so here's David O Lord thou has searched me and known me thou know'st us my down City and mine uprising when I when I sit down when I get out of bed when we you know every part of my life there's nothing that the catch is used for thou understand this my thoughts are far off you know it's it's one of those things that I thank God that the blood of Jesus Christ is there for us how the Lord showed that to brother Branham and he said look when you're trying to condemn this this these people in this this place watch what's happening with your and brother and says those are my senses yes they're yours he says you know those things from afar off and he puts a blood barrier there that's why it's so important for us to have the token it's a matter of life and death really without the token there is no life it's a serious thing he says he says thou compassing my path and my lying down and are acquainted with my ways ah there's that same word he's telling McWane ty self job with him and and David says to him you're acquainted with my ways there there's a personal relationship you're familiar with you know in in it's the same way in a working relationship at your job in a family relationship what it was you you become acquainted with one another you know you're around each other you see each other and and if time if you spend enough time on you get to see both sides when somebody gets angry somebody gets upset something doesn't go right what's their reaction and then you get to see the good side also or maybe when someone receives honor or thing how do they how do they take you to see all parts of in that acquaintance in that fellowship in relationship you know and in sometimes we you go back and and you look in a relationship that's lasted a long time that over the years everything and you see if you'll be honest with him hey there were some hard times there were some good times but by the grace of God we're still we're still here you know you look back at Tucson tabernacle and first time for us was in 1975 yeah 75 we came to the meetings of December here and then we moved here in 76 when we came to the meetings for a few years there's been many years of history now there was a period of time that we did we weren't here at all but then from 1988 this way so there is a lot of could I say a relationship built some good a lot of good and some hard times too but you know and in the hard times when we really show our nature and our character wherever it is and that's when you can say oh Lord I need some help I need some more work this is the l word acquainted with all my ways there's nothing hid before you for there is not a word in my tongue but Lord O Lord that thou knowest it all together thou has beset me behind and before and laid nine hand upon me you're in front of me you're behind me you're all around me I cannot hide him and then he says such one knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I can attain unto it sometimes I've stopped for a minute just try to God see this how'd it but it's not me to figure it out but to accept it and thank them for it Lord you're in command you're in control I don't need to be in in fear and worry about your knowledge no one has ever come to you and you had to ask them help me on this but I've had to come to you many a times Lord say help me on this you know and this is David understanding I can't even come close to it let's go on weather shall I go from thy spirit or whether shall I free from thy presence if I send up into heaven thou art there if I make my bed in hell behold thou art there also he says you've got that every situation every places is in your hands you control it it doesn't control you you control it he says if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost part of the sea that's continuing even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me and brother Matt talked about the storms out in the middle of the sea he says even if I flee out there you still have it under your control I'm not going to hide I'm not gonna be all there by a moth neither am I gonna hide and either no I need to be afraid that I'm alone you're still there if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yea the darkness hide us not from thee but the night shine is after the day the darkness and the light are both alight to thee to God is no different he's not affected by dark moods and happy moods he's not our good times and our bad times in the sense that oh what do I do now no he loves his children he doesn't want to see them broken but he also needs knows then there are some times that we need to be broken we need our heart how can I be touched by the feeling of my brother my sister my loved one if I haven't gone through some of the similar situations if my life has been so high and better than everybody else that I could look down know but if I walk in that same place I guess a yes brother yes sister you know yes honey yes child is yes daughter yes son I can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities also I've been there he says it's all light unto thee he says let's go on for thou has possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb Jeremiah he told him even before you were in your when you and your mother you were ordained a prophet God wasn't there oh my goodness I need a prophet where is there one around here I'll shoot that guy he lets know it was already setting car mine's in God's plan he says I won't praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well he says I am fearfully and wonderfully made everything that God does he does it right and for a purpose 17 and 18 how precious also are they thought son to me O God how great is the sum of them everything that God has planned for you everything that he has thought of you that he has seen you in already he said they are precious how great is this some of them it's just not a moment or something there but it's an eternal brother ran touches out he said you were in the back part of his mind from eternity so how long has this relationship between you and God been it's eternal it's not new to him it's he's realizing hey these thoughts that I had and and and he knew what name you that you would have you know it's already he said they're written in the palms of my hand every one of them he said how great if I should count them they are more in number than the sand and when I awake I am still with you in the morning when I rise give me Jesus you know why because he's there that's not like Lord where are you you know I need you to show up about right now he says I am here I've never left you I've never left you after you he said if I could count them he said they're more in number than the sand and when I am awake I am with thee show for it like I said I wouldn't be long today if I could sum it up this way those trials those things that you're going through in life the hard times and you know I look at here and I see the age variance from a sister Lily probably being the youngest one here and brother Arnie I think is the senior here but you know in in life over time each one of us have gone through our things parts that we've gone through in life and each one has had its purpose well now sister Lily she might you know think well you know I've gone through this at the other and she has you know and maybe my wife would say yeah but you know you haven't gone through this this and this yet she has but we can help one another we can encouragement I've been there where you been that's what David is saying he says you know all of this you've seen it it's not a surprise to you you have an answer you've made a provision for it and the scripture even tells you older sisters teach the younger ones why because you've been there you've had those experiences you've known it you know let the elder teach the younger you know you that are that are further along in your experience further along with God because you've been here longer and if you travel this year turn around and encourage the one say I've been there before but God helped me through it this way God encouraged me this way God gave me strength like this it's not the end of the world for you right now you're going through a hard time you're going through a battle things don't seem the way but there is light at the end of the tunnel I've been there where you're at when it seemed that I opened my wallet and there just wasn't anything in there open the cupboard and there was nothing there but God still met our need God still provided how many times have you read in the testimonies through history where I don't remember who it was but it was one of the you know back in a few centuries ago where they would be praying there maybe one of the missionaries in the books that we had there they would be praying because there's no food to feed the children and a milk truck breaks down right in front of the house and the guy comes to knocks on the door he says I'm my milk truck is broken down here or the the wagon that I'm taking and I can't go so would you take this milk before it goes bad God meets the needs of his children and he has a purpose for it but every part is to test us to try us to bring us to a place like Joe said I shall then come forth as gold because it's gold in me now there's a question and my wife posted it I think it was I think it was her that she said or maybe I read it somewhere how many apples are in the apple tree all of them it's not a trick question how much of God is in each one him all of him not this much for you and you just get this little board its Christ in you you know on in acts 2:38 he broke himself apart into the into licks of fire and he himself dwelled in each one filled him with the Holy Spirit this one didn't have 5% in that one God no it was Christ in each one of them that which God has purpose for your life will come forth so when you're going through the hard times it's not God's punishment it's God bringing and showing that through these storms through these hard times you shall come forth as gold the musicians would would make their way up sometimes we get to filling in Lord I must I must just be a failure it seems like nothing goes right in my life everything goes backwards is it you nothing but God says no I have a purpose and all of that I have there's some training for you to go through some sometimes we just need to sit down and be quiet for a little bit and say Lord that my spirit settle and then you can minister to me God leads his dear children along some through the water some through the flood and God leads history let's pray Lord we we spoken we feel what you had for us today sometimes Lord we we wonder Lord why why me it seems like my brother and sister are having a much easier time about it seems like I'm struggling so hard but if we were in their shoes they'd be looking at us the same way saying it seems like my brother my sister's just doing fine and I'm struggling but God you lead every one of your children in a way some through the water some through the flood and there's a purpose for all ordinates brother Matt lettuce and that song I surrender all Lord maybe just be willing to say that Lord I yield I surrender my motives I surrender my attitude I surrender my heart I surrender my all to you Lord and let you have preeminence Lord maybe somebody has a question was wondering about why they were going through these things in their life may they realize it because they are your children and you're bringing that gold that's in them which is full manifestation we thank you for in Jesus Christ's name Amen that first verse in shady green pastures in shady green pasture so bad chance god the water [Music] some the but [Music] so rates are [Music] times are the sons god from [Music] in dark [Music] sing the next verse those are me fall

he's still guarded it doesn't affect him it doesn't change himself trusting that the Lord has spoken something encourage you some ways to realize the things that you're going through the storms in life for the hard times the days that sometimes are seems like there is no answer it's God's just proving that your is it's going to bring that character is going to bring them and just being grateful for that - learning to say Lord you know what you're doing and I'm gonna praise you anyways I'm going to worship you in this as I'm walking up that pathway and and and I'm still gonna worship God my
