There Brother J there's a country far beyond the star Sky there's a country far beyond the Starry Sky there's a city where there never comes a night if we're faithful we shall go there by and by in that city where the lamb is alive in that city where the lamb is alive oh that City where there cometh no n i Mansion over there and went free from toss and care I am going where the lamb is alive here we have our days of sunshine but we know that the sun which shines upon us now so bright will be changed to CL and rain until we go to that city where the L lamb is alive in that city where the lamb is alive in that City where there cometh no night I a mansion over there and free from toss and that's throwing to the lamb in that city where the lamb is alive oh that City where there cometh no n i a mansion over there and when free from toil and care I am going where the lamb is [Music] alive amen that's where we're going in the meantime we we we're wear a smile because we know where we're going so we'll have brother Daniel open in prayer if he would do that now let's bow our heads our great Heavenly Father Lord it is written in your word that the day of a man's death is greater than the day of his birth father it's hard sometimes for us to really understand that Lord we pray that that the meaning of your word and and the greatness of what you have for us over on the other side father would anchor deep in our hearts and that you would help us to understand the glory that our brother is beholding now and Lord we long to be there father bless each one here I pray that father as always if there would be one in this congregation that would need a touch from you or has father a need for a conversation with you father that that it would be granted and you would take care of that person father we love you we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be seated first to all the visitors I want to say welcome on behalf of all the members here at the Tucson Tabernacle we're honored that you would join us here in a memorial of um what who we man that we love very dearly a man that has done uh mighty things while he was here on Earth and uh he has left a wonderful Legacy with us all I um I want to say a few words just uh just in welcoming welcoming the people and in uh talking about our brother that um and then and then we'll get into the service brother Larry I didn't know him very well I had obviously I've met him and and I've talked with him talked with him really only well here was at church here and he used to sit there in the back and I always made it a point to go and shake his hand before service and and um just get a little uh get a little bit of that love that that was on brother Larry and and maybe a little bit would rub off some of that anointing would rub off on me he um I don't as I said I didn't know brother Larry very well in person but I feel like I know brother Lara and I feel like I know it know him through these people here his family we um he was a man that I always know that he really believed what he preached and he he laid a foundation for his family that is carrying on today and I I'd like to read a scripture that I believe really says something special about our brother and it's Proverbs Chapter 13 Verse 22 I know we think about this a lot of times in in monetary speaking but there is a monetary application to this scripture and then there is a spiritual application to the scripture as is most of the things in this Bible it says here that Proverbs 13:22 it says a good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children and I believe that the the one that wrote the Proverbs here believe it was Solomon that wrote that that he was saying that yes that that we should leave our our grandchildren some sort of a of an inheritance as far as money but more important we should leave them a an inheritance that will stay with them that's worth far more than any money that you could ever give someone and that's what I see in this Gara family as I said I didn't have the opportunity as many of you have to really get to know this man Larry Gara but I know him through his Legacy and through the inheritance that he has given to his children and not only his children in brother Aron and the and the family here but also as the proverb said into his children's children his grandchild and there is if anybody knows the Gara family what a kind-hearted family what a sweet family a family that you don't hear many things negative about you hear a lot of a lot of love for the G family and those things don't just they don't just come they don't just show up they come and they're passed down from generation to generation and that love for the Lord and one thing i' I've seen about the G family and I believe this comes from brother Larry Gara is they are always willing to give a testimony to how good God is I love that about the G family we'll pass the microphone around the congregation sometime and the g family is never fails to be represented to tell how good God is to see those Generations coming down this Foundation that brother Larry has laid it won't die because it's in the grandchildren it's in the great grandchildren and how they represent this Holy Spirit that was represented through Grandpa through dad through brother Larry and I have the utmost respect for the Gara family and how much of a blessing brother Aaron and the family has been to me as a new pastor and how he showed his loyalty and his right hand of fellowship and he's held me up when I needed somebody to hold me up and I believe it comes because this man right here has character and he was taught character by his dad this scripture that we leave an inheritance to our children's children it reminds me of Acts chapter 2 when that Holy Spirit fell and Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost here's the inheritance that you get for This Promise is to you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and you all have this inheritance from Great Grandpa from Grandpa from Dad from husband from brother and brothers and sisters don't take it for granted and as you go through the next few days think about what Grandpa left you think about the testimonies think about the stories think about the strength that he left your family and your family because you have that strength from Grandpa all of us have also benefited from it so the the generations that go that have come down they are a blessing to other people because of the parents the grandparents the great-grandparents brothers and sisters we here at the Tucson Tabernacle are testimonies we can all give testimony of the man that the Lord took from us but he did not take that inheritance that brother Larry left so as I said I don't didn't know brother Larry very well but I feel like I know him very well because of the Legacy that he left and how this family is very very special to so many people God bless you and again welcome to the Tucson Tabernacle and um as I said on behalf of everyone here we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and hope that you feel comfortable here and uh look forward to what our brother Aaron has to say and and what brother Figaroa has to say God bless you all if Ava would make her way up this is one of the great granddaughters of dad and she's been taking piano lessons and she said I'd like to pray for play something for Great Grandpa [Music] [Applause] we um we had a tradition that the kids all the grandchildren in the front of the entry of the house there's a lion head mounted to the columns there and all of them would take little leaves from the the plants around and they would feed the lion and every one of these grandchildren had pictures of them feeding that Lion and the other day I think it was Ava not Ava but um Khloe and Asher one more time feeding the little lion so I I want to read chapter of the chapter of Psalms 121 and I'm going to read it in English but it was one of my dad's favorite verses and little have it up there I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from when cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved and he that keepeth thee will not Slumber behold he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right hand the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the Moon by Night the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even forever more what a what a promise we have what a scripture we have it's also a song that they sang in Spanish and my dad would sing sing these songs as as children growing up it was mostly songs in Spanish that we listen to now my niece Eunice is going to come up and and do the eulogy for my father and uh she'll do that now well we're going to do our best not to keep you here too late tonight so uh we'll just like to go through get that done Grandma can you hear me Grandma can you hear me Grandma can you hear me grandma okay this evening We Gather to celebrate a legacy of the love and faithfulness of Lorenzo lro Gera and his his life spaning 88 vibrant years Leno was born on August 10th 1936 in Los Angeles California into a family of eight children like many young children the innocence and wonder of childhood was interrupted by hard work and although not the oldest he took charge of his siblings and cared for them as they worked the fields picking cotton peaches and grapes while raised in the apostolic church he gave his heart to the Lord and at 16 years old he was baptized in a little church in Needles Arizona on April 11th 1953 by the age of 18 the young man with jet black hair sharp eyes and a prankster's grin was working construction and concrete supervising several men and projects and still traveling picking fruit at the Harvest time during the grap season in Selma California 1954 romance blossomed with his beloved meline after lenel gathered the courage to ask her hun on a date one evening after a Charming encounter by the mailbox outside her home they married just 6 months later a beautiful partnership lasting 69 years lento was energetic always tinkering around the house building something here fixing something there he worked hard so he could spend the summer months taking his family on State Side vacations to the mountains and the beaches as a devoted Christian lencho and his wife raised the family of four to seek the Lord and live Faithfully in 1975 he was introduced to the message preached by the prophet William brandham by two of mine's Brothers shortly after lenel moved his family to Tucson where they would stay permanently eventually making Tucson Tabernacle his home church under brother Perry green where his missionary work would begin in the late 1970s lencha was declared disabled after a series of injuries took over his life of construction in concrete he embarked on his missionary journey traveling through Brazil Costa Rica Honduras Mexico and vuela spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ often taking meline with him when he wasn't on the road he was a Spanish interpreter for the Tabernacle the work carried on until the early 2000s when his health slowed him lenell's Ministry adapted through prayer and counsel for God's people even to giv candy to the children's to the church's children after service from his post in the corner chair in the back of the church lenro had an unwavering Zeal for sharing the good news with anyone willing to listen and even to those who were unwilling painting a portrait of a man whose devotion defined him pouring over the scriptures was an integral part of his daily life he maintained endless handwritten notes of prayer accounts of Miracles and healing verses and words from the prophet the devotions alongside his wife alone took them through the entire Bible at least seven times on the night of October 13th 2024 lencho lay peacefully in a hospital bed in the house he lived in for most of his life his wife meline and granddaughters Naomi and Sarah sang hymns to him many of his favorites a quiet moment overtook the house only the sounds of the old kitchen clock ticking away and lent's intermittent exhales filled the room at 11:07 p.m. he took his final breath on this Earth and stepped into eternity still quiet in the house a nightly train passing by blew its horn a signal time time to go Let Us carry on lal's Legacy by emulating the virtues he personified I conclude with the verse fitting his life and thou shalt love the Lord God the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and now just read a few personal notes I have with my grandpa when Grandpa realized his Olive Tree was causing my allergies he chopped it down in the Summers he rounded up the grandchildren and drove us to the mountains to Camp it's where he taught us to fish and he'd load us up in the car and take us to McDonald's to buy cheeseburgers but no soda because we had ginger ale at home and no fries because we had chips at home when the trees yielded fruit he stuffed grocery bags pool and sent them home with us over the years I enjoyed watching great grandpa cooked chiso for Bianca and Ava whenever we visited it's something the girls grew to love but were too young to see these days would come to an end and become memories at first he could stand on his own later he would need a cane the days when he would get up only when necessary came far too quickly he was so much more to me than the things he did for us if I ever knew a Man Who Loved the Lord it was my grandpa his whole identity was in Christ and the cost was high yet he never wandered from the way and though he could be a hard man I saw the Lord moved when he prayed two days before his eternal glory I saw his arm outstretched while lying in his hospital bed I got up thinking he needed something and I asked if he was okay he didn't move so I stayed silent just waiting when he opened his eyes I asked were you pray Grandpa he looked at me and nodded yes in the final hours I watched him hoping he would open his eyes and say something profound but I realized now that he he had been telling me a profound truth all of my life just believe we'll take care of grandma and we'll make sure the lion is fed I love you Grandy there's a McDonald's on palie down towards Benson Highway and it was called Grandpa's McDonald CU he took the kids there and one of the managers loved it when my dad would go because my dad would take some tamales with him and the manager would sit down and eat with him so [Music] soon we'll come to the end of life's journey and perhaps we'll never meet anymore till we get in heaven right City far away on that beautiful Shore if we never meet again this side of Heaven as we struggle through this world and it TR there's another meeting place somewhere in Heaven by the side of the River of Life where the Charming roses blo forever and where separations come no more if we never meet again this side of Heaven I will meet you on that beautiful Shore oh they say we shall meet by the river where no storm clowns ever dark in the sky and they say we'll be happy forever in the wonderful Sweet By and By if we never meet again this side of Heaven as we struggle through this world and it's dve there's another meeting place somewhere in Heaven by the side of the River of Life where the Charming roses bloom forever and where separations come no more if we never meet again this side of Heaven I will meet you all that beautiful sure I will meet you I will meet you on that beautiful [Music] [Applause] show thank you for bringing joining my family to honor and celebrate the life of my grandfather for anybody that doesn't know I'm one of the granddaughters one of Aaron's daughters um in honor of his memory I'd like to share a few memories with you about his prayers um I grew up in my grandfather's home and Grandpa was like a father to me grandpa's life was marked by faith the Supernatural and by prayer after spending many years with him I can assure you he believed and lived what he preached he had strong faith to believe that God would hear his prayers so I'd like to give some of those memories so sometimes one can experience something in life that makes you wonder why you had that experience yet as time and years go by the reason becomes very clear when I was a child I would often go visit Grandma and Grandpa between services on Sundays one such day I was playing outside in their backyard when I came across a dead bird it was a dove that had become Tangled Up In some string and had strangled I ran to show my grandfather we then used some scissors to cut the Bird Free and I watched as he gently untangled the bird its wings broken and lifeless is it dead I remember asking my grandfather he said yes M it's dead and I remember looking up in his face and he seemed really sad he didn't say anything and then as as if it was the most natural thing in the world he spoke and he said little birdie in the name of Jesus Christ I give you back your life and I watched that dead bird come alive and fly from his hand to perch on power lines above as a six-year-old child I saw a clear demonstration of the power the truth and and the life of God I understood that the God my grandfather served truly was the resurrection and the life it is with this faith and confidence that I live today as many of you know I was diagnosed with an incurable disease and was told I would not survive when we had gotten the news my grandpa was very troubled and he went home he sat in his chair in the middle of the night praying he asked God to speak concerning me some confirmation some encouragement he took his Bible letting it fall open and he simply pointed with his finger and says wherever it lands on that's for Sarah so the scripture was Matthew 21 verse 21 and 22 where Jesus instructs that wherever we ask in his name believing in faith we can have have the thing that we ask for even for mountains to move so Grandpa came to the hospital he shared this with me he told me the most important thing was to believe in God with faith so he spoke words of life and healing over me and then he said I'm going to pray that God gives you that Faith so that you can live to believe for a miracle I'm here today I'm living I'm standing I'm moving and breathing freely because of those prayers the final memory I'd like to share is a little bit humorous I always knew Grandpa to be very humble and reverent a lot of reverence towards God and the things of God he was never sacriligious he never mocking and never irreverent in fact if we said anything remotely sacriligious or ever irreverent around him we got severely reprimanded you just did not do that um so he was very sincere very respectful and when he prayed he would use what I called holy speech he had a lot of these and THS and so on he was very reverent and he never was presuming so I was very surprised when I heard this prayer I had been suffering from terrible migraines we had prayed over this many times and one day I was in his home he was actually having to take care of me for a little while and I was in tears because of the pain of these migraines and I said Grandpa would you please please pray and he looked at me he sighed very deeply and he said yes M we will pray then in the most aggrieved tone he said Heavenly Father you know we have asked you many times to heal my granddaughter of these migraines would you please heal my granddaughter and then he never said in the name of Jesus Christ we pray he never said amen no he said thank you Father for hearing us I'm glad we had this little talk I sat there a little shocked but you know the migraine left and I've never suffered with one since God answered that prayer and I believe that from one father to another God saw my grandfather's upset at seeing me in pain he hated to see us in pain and struggling but God had compassion on me and heard that prayer I am grateful and privileged to have been taught on my grandfather's knee about the Living God and faith faith and prayer the knowledge of Truth is what keeps me today I like so many of our loved ones we're going to miss our grandfather on this side of Heaven yet I know some morning I'll see him again beside that Great River of Life and I'll hear his voice once more saying God works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform [Applause] as Sarah was spent a lot of her her time with Grandpa and Grandma she's always it's always been dear and it's something that um brother Robert would make his way up it it's amazing to see when Sarah was in the hospital and um and they've been diagnosed with the disease and so forth and we just gotten that report and it's it's a shock one of the doctors told her if you don't do what we tell you within two weeks you'll be dead we had a prayer meeting in the hospital and it was a wonderful prayer meeting and she went home we're sitting in a restaurant Resturant and she goes Dad Dad and she goes what there's that doctor that said in two weeks I would be dead and he's looking at me like what are you doing alive we serve a living God if if he'll stand with me brother Robert Figaro was a good friend of my father's they traveled um he traveled with on any of the trips with my dad and uh I've asked him if he would share some of those t testimonies with you today and there are many many of them but some that maybe would that he would remember out standing and also just to encourage us because God's word is encouraging amen and so if if for brother Robert if you would come thank you God bless you God bless you tonight you may be seated you know the Bible says in Psalms 116 precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints and when you know a man like brother Larry that that was the true man of God every time I met him I would tell him in Spanish there a there's a little cliche and I would Shake shake his hand man of God and shake his hand he just smiled at me I look at that chair back there and I expect to see brother Larry is sitting back there right now but we did a lot of traveling together yes we did and uh and uh we uh one one trip we spent 28 days in Mexico and another trip we we went to Brazil and we were 19 days preaching many places places we don't even I couldn't remember the name of the towns we were in but we spent many hours in his car in that little old Toyota truck he used to have he kept that thing running like a little clock I'll tell you and he was he had his ways brother Larry did and uh he was a Godly Man uh you know uh when I first came here well uh in ' 89 we were actually with brother green back in 1965 when he first came to the little synagogue over there we were there from the from the very beginning with brother green and uh but we left when U it was a brother that was preaching in Spanish and brother green thought it'd be a good idea for the Hispanic people to start a Spanish speaking church so with his Blessing we all left and it didn't work out we wound up with a brother had come in from California and we stayed with him for 15 years and after 15 years we decided to come back to S Tabernacle so about 89 we came back and it was around probably about 91 92 93 I I don't remember the year exactly but they were starting to interpret back there on the balcony and brother Larry asked me one day he says uh I was not preaching back then I was in my 40s and he said um could you uh help us out with the interpretation I'll try it see see if I can and I did he must have liked it because uh the next service next Sunday I was down here he came down here and he tapped me on the shoulder he says can you come up here and help us sure so from the services that would later I'd be sitting here and he'd come tap me on the shoulder again after about two or three times you tap you said brother why don't you just come up here and stay up here with us so for about I think from about 93 to about 2010 when I left to go Pastor a church about 17 years we worked up there interpreting and and he was always he uh people people would call I know but people would depend and call and had confidence in this prayers he was a he was a praying man he was a he was a he was a prayer Warrior and I think his name was just right G which means in English War he was a warrior for Christ we did some uh traveling and uh one one trip we did 28 days we went to a city called saltio Gua Mexico and it's a it's a hub of a lot of colleges and a lot of universities and a lot of well educated people in that area and they were just Building a Church there about 100 120 people with a pastor brother Isel Moran was a pastor there and they had already built the the the uh the basement so they were having services in the basement they hadn't finished the church above so we brother Larry and I ended up preaching in the basement to them after that brother Larry you just looked at me you know that these people are so well educated you know he and I with no education especially in Spanish our Spanish is just you know more or less we get by and uh he says these people were the the pre the pastor was an engineer and his wife uh the deacons were doctors lawyers uh professors of music and and brother Larry said you know if I would have known that I would have been really intimidated to preached before them and I said not only you me also brother but we had a lot of good times together um brother Brandon says on the message down on Calvary he says this you don't have to be lost there is a Highway and a way and is called the way of Holiness the unclean don't pass over it for he comes through the fountain first and then he enters the highway he broke the powers of Satan he open the prison doors of Hell to every man that was shut up in this earth and in the prison fearing that when he died what death would be to him on Calvary he opened those cell doors and let every captive Go free you don't have to no longer be torn down by sin you don't have to no longer yield your members to sin and drinking and smoking and gambling and telling lies you can be honest just and upright and Satan can do nothing about it I like that you know our the life that God has given given us in this this gospel Satan can't do and he he tries and he'll keep on trying but we are more than conquerors through him that loved us he says he says you can be honest just and upright and sat Satan can't do nothing about it because you got a hold of a line a Lifeline that's anchored in the Rock of Ages nothing can shake you from it no winds can shake you from it no nothing not even death itself can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus that's what Calvary meant men that were in bondage were set free men that were once under fear of death can no long no have no have no fear of death a man who Longs for a city whose Builder and maker is God he can step on that Highway and set his face towards heaven I I believe brother Larry as a young man when he gave his heart to God he set his face towards heaven and he never changed from that direction brother Brandon says he don't need to wander no more for there is a way of knowing whether you're right or not God gives us life our sins are gone that dead Calvary paid the price when we see all that no wonder the poet wrote mid rendering rocks and darkening Skies my savior bowed his head and died the opening Veil revealed the way to Heaven's Joys an endless day Jesus you know when had The Story of Lazarus when when he was a good friend of Jesus and uh he'd gone on he'd gone to go preach and Lazarus got sick and they sent word to him to come pray for him and jesus carried he didn't come right away and in John 11 11-4 says these things said he after that and after that he saith unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples Lord if he sleep he shall do well how be it Jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking a rest and sleep then Jesus uh unto said unto them Jesus said unto them plainly Lazarus is dead I believe that in the language of Jesus he didn't say he he died or he's dead he didn't want to say that but to make them understand he had to speak in their language I don't believe the language of of God and of Jesus was he de he's dead or he died because I don't believe his he does he doesn't he doesn't his children do not die I want want you to realize that that his children do not die There Is No Death how can we die when we're full of life whether we're 90 years old or it doesn't matter there's a life living inside of us that's Eternal and brother Brandon said that's that's God's own life that's Zoe and that was what's living in my brother Larry he cannot die he's not he's not dead He's Alive it's just a change of geographical position is all it is he's in a he's in another dimension he's probably looking over the banister right now I'm sure he is and watching all this right now in 2 Corinthians 51 Paul writes for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God an house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens what is that building it's a body that's awaiting us brother Brandon says in the message called life he says then that theophany talking about Jesus was made flesh in the person of Christ Jesus and then all the fullness of the trinity dwelt in him both father son holy spirit all all in that and that's the very way we go Plumb back to the original beginning of God there we are born again not of Flesh born again not of blood but Born Again by the spirit and then that eternal spirit of love and honesty comes down to make its place in us and then when we die from this life we go into a body which if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have a theophany to go into a body Celestial I remember many years ago brother Larry showed me a picture of a sister that was in a hospital bed she was in her 40s and she had a family she had a husband and children but she was dying of cancer and they had taken a picture of her her she's laying on that bed but when they developed a picture there appeared a young woman standing right next to her bed and brother Larry showed me that picture and the husband when he seen that he said that's my wife when I married her you see that the offering was already waiting right there for that Spirit of life and that soul to step right into it he said I've gone to prepare a place he says that where where I go you may be also that's his promise to us and Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15:51 to 58 he says you know it was a mystery death and to many is still a a mystery I mean it's to us really it's all an experience we've never experienced but it's no longer a mystery because Paul opened it up he unveiled that mystery he said behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep notice that's the language of Jesus cuz we're not we don't die we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed when he says all he's speaking to the ones that have gone on he's talking about brother Larry he's talking about my little Ruthie he's talking about my mom my dad the ones that you know those loved ones that have gone on he says but we shall all be changed you see they're going to have a change and we're going to have a change if we're here when when when the Rapture takes place there's going to be a translation take place he says in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall all those that have gone on and those that are waiting we shall all be changed amen the Bible says you know that Jesus when he came back he came back in a glorified body he walked through walls he he traveled as a thought and brother BR said we'll do the same thing we're going to be stepping into a glorified body he said we'll be here about 20 days or so he said we're going to get to meet each other here and then we're going to say where is our Lord and then we'll meet him up in the skies now he says it says in the Bible that John writes when we when we shall when he shall appear we shall be like him for we will see him as he is we're going to take on a glorified body just like him it says therefore this corruptible he says this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death amen Hal Hallelujah death is swallowed up in Victory think of it death is swallowed up in Victory he says oh death where is thy sting we as Believers could be able to stare death in the face and laugh and be unafraid because we know that God has opened the way for us brother B says it's just a door that brings us into the presence of God he says oh death where is I sting brother brand said that that like a bee when it goes around and it stings you it loses a stinger and brother Brandon says he W he put his stinger in Christ on that on that cross and he lost his stinger and Paul says here where's your sting grave oh oh oh grave where's your Victory oh death where's your Sting the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God who gives us of Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast we should look as our brother Larry as an example for the rest of us he was steadfast unmovable those of those of you that knew him can say that he was steadfast he was unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord that was brother Larry for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord Brother Brandon says in the in the message Easter Sunrise in 56 is th fear no evil for thou art with me how I love that oh death where is your sting grave where is your Victory I'm going from Victory on to Victory is death a victory absolutely death is a victory amen death is a victory now not a sadness it it's a victory praise be to God I had many experiences with brother brother Larry there was a sister from somewhere in Europe one time that she wanted to give some money to build a church and the money was brought here to Tucson and given to brother Larry and and he found a little little town called bakam and uh there was a need there for a church a a pastor an Indian brother very very very humble and he and he built a church there for them a beautiful church I know brother Aron has been there and even even with a Baptist tree behind the pull pit and uh very very well made church and they had their first Services there and the people went around knocking on doors and inviting people and there was a a certain family a little girl she must have been about 12 she was a young little girl about 12 years old maybe 11 she came by herself she came to church and that night the Lord touched her and she came out to be prayed for because she she was an epileptic and here in our our sister what she said about brother Larry when he said about that bird brother Larry had related that story to me about the bird and he had this thing that he would say sometimes as he prayed for people he would pray but sometimes he would pray in jesus' name and he'd say but I and I give you your life and he told the little girl I give you your life and she was healed of that epilepsy she went home full of joy and the next service of her her whole family was in church and a whole family got changed because of that just the things in the labor that that brother Larry did to build a church and practically by himself maybe a little help from the Brethren but he that that was the kind of man he was and when he did things he did them well if he if he was going to build something for you he did he did an excellent job because that's the way he was a quality person a quality man a quality Christian and a quality worker as well uh we uh as I said we spent 19 days in in Brazil preaching we'd be driving all day and stopping in town and it' be Message Church there and and we'd be preaching that night and so it was nice having two preachers because one would could could take a night off and the other one would work and and we worked together that way all through Mexico many places that we went uh there's a brother my church brother Ralph Bowers he's my he's been my my uh my song leader for 14 years he's 80 years old and still still on fire for God and he told me Wednesday night he said brother I can't go you know I can't drive at night he lives in SRA Vista he says but you you tell them that 50 years ago when I lived in California brother Larry took the tapes to me and introduced me to the message and that's why I'm here today 50 years he took the tapes all around and and many came to this word because of his efforts because he was convinced and then brother R says when you're convinced you're concerned amen uh there was other healings that took place that that we saw and it's all the power the the the faith that he had never wavering he was just he was an example and uh and I can say myself that uh going to starting to write go with him on these trips it wasn't long before I began to feel a pool to the ministry and uh and we began to preached the word and I was an evangelist for this church for 18 years with brother green working with brother Green in Tucson Tabernacle when I went and took the pastorship over in uh in Herford now we're in wuka city now we've been there 14 years but I believe that if I look looking back it all started with a tap on the shoulder a tap on the shoulder and here I am today I never thought that I would be where I am I sometimes I ask I said how did I get here I never desired it I never never gave it a second thought as some of you might be sitting there you you would never think you'd be standing behind a Pulpit preaching the word it' be the furthest thing from your mind that was me but it started with a tap on the shoulder and God began to lead me and guide me and and here I am today and I was and I I was influenced by brother Larry and brother green and I and I owe them that and I'm thankful to the Lord for the testimony that brother Larry uh had that that was an example to me as well as a younger man to be able to go with him and and for him to take me on these trips and and later on we visited Venezuela as well and and Brazil and we did a lot of traveling together and and I and I look back and I say thank you Lord for my brother I was sitting there when I came in and sat down and and it kind of just struck me at that moment I thought wow brother Lar is not here he's not here cuz he was always here when I was here he was always here I want to I want to finish with uh with this with scripture and I'd like for all of you if you stand with me tonight and if you could put Psalms 23 the whole chapter it's just six verses and I like the whole all of you all to to join me in this in this PSAL get it up there amen the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and listen and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever gave man one more little testimony uh this one that relate brother Larry related to me they were many years ago they were traveling on a train he and two other brothers and the train there in Mexico and it broke down in the middle of nowhere and so there they were broken down train and nowhere to go people starting getting out of the train because it was too hot to be inside and and around around the time of the the the sound started to go down they thought well we're wasting our time they might as well start preaching here so they found a little found there somewhere and and they started to preach to the crowd and pretty soon they all started to gather around they had nothing else to do so they began to preach to them and after they got done they made an altar call and the young man stepped forward and gave his heart to God he was a doctor a young man then and he gave his heart to the Lord and for many many years he believed this message he went to be with the Lord I believe was last year or it's been a few months ago it's been more not more than a year I think that he passed away himself but that by being by the side of a of a track right there nothing else to do but let preach let give them the word and they found a soul they found a seed there might have been others I don't know but you know this is what the labor of love is when you love the Lord you want to do something for him amen and now as as I turned it over to brother Larry I want to thank you all for for coming and my condolences for my for my family our church to sister mine and all the family here all those you all of you that going to miss him and love him cuz cuz he was he was he was a a true pillar in our in the lives of those that knew him and those that that grew up knowing him and may God Comfort your hearts and your souls as only the Holy Spirit can God bless you you may be seated sister Jessica comes up my dad it didn't take long if you sat down with him or around him that he would want to share a testimony something that would be encouraging and um I used to when he would come back from a trip we'd invite him over for dinner because I know he had a lot on his heart he wanted to share so we heard many many of the testimonies so [Music] in Las Ras r [Music] for Elan [Music] no me [Music] [Music] spe [Music] [Music] El [Music] for for [Music] [Music] I won't have to Cross Jordan Alone Jesus Di all my sins to atone when the darkness I see he'll be waiting for me I won't have to Cross Jordan [Music] Alone what a what a promise we have an unfailing promise as I listened to brother Robert and some of the the things that they went through and I said dad would come home and share them often with us he loved my wife's cooking too so it wasn't hard to get them to come over and I've always said I married my wife because she was a great cook I've never denied that that was true but she's not here this evening because um she got sick today and we had to take her to the hospital um she couldn't breathe she was choking and going through a hard time and I think just over all that we've gone through for the last month it just kind of built up on her and ran a series of tests and everything was good so she's home now but um seeing my dad and mom together um and dad would leave for for quite a few hour days if it was just here in the state of sonota it may be a shorter trip but when they would go down way into Mexico if he drove or all the way into South America sometimes they were close to a month and my my mom would stay take care of the house and when D dad came home mom was still there and like I said just shy of 70 years married dad was 18 mom was 19 when they got married and we lived in Southern California dad was um he knew his work well he did he did a good work but they were raised raised to speak Spanish and um so he would leave us um a message that he was going to go do something and he would leave it in his English which you had to discern his writing because he spelled it like it sounded to him he was going to go see a uh to buy a Dodge truck so he left the note by the phone that said I went to go see a dog track so so we would laugh about it but you know when Dad began to to work here at the Tabernacle and began to translate he did his best to learn the proper way to translate the message for the minister and if he didn't know the word that the minister would use or brother green would use he would go find it out and give the proper translation we were in Mexico together where they built the church in bakam and some of the young people they're not young people anymore at that time they donated a portion of the funds and at the entry of the church they did a a h tin roof and all those young people signed their name underneath there that church it was in farming Community um there was electricity and water in the area but not in the people's houses because the government hadn't didn't permit that at the time but Dad made for the church to have running water which meant flesh toilets and electric power and the whole thing so people would come to see the church there that had electricity and water in it and because of that they would get a good congregation that church that that he spent quite a bit of time and some of the brothers went down with him we went down for the dedication and the Sunday morning Minister was ministering and I was interpreting in into English and for the first time I heard my I saw my dad get stumped on translating the word the brother who used the word in Spanish that neither my father or my dad had heard before and it was a steamer trunk when the old ships would come across the big steamer trunk and the word he used was B and we had never heard it and I'm looking at my dad and my dad's looking at me and we are trying to figure out what he's saying so the brother kind of just danced around it and we gave them an idea but he went home and found out what the right word was and that's just how he was and uh we we we his English was not the best we still laughed we would laugh at him it's not mean but you know it's kids he thought it was funny um he could not say mountain peaks they were mountain pigs and we had one of the biggest laughs in the house Dad hadn't come home from work Mom would make dinner and if Dad hadn't gone some because he he work we worked in Southern California sometimes he'd be out in Los Angeles by the time he got home it'd be 7 8:00 at night and Mom started laughing and uh um Mom really was not that tight mom was if it was dinner time you sat you prayed you ate but mom had was started laugh and we didn't know why she was laughing and and she just kept laughing so we laughed cuz Mom's laughing but we had no idea why she was laughing and finally she was laughing so hard she literally fell on the ground and she was laughing so now we're laughing cuz mom is on the ground laughing so finally when she calmed down I said mom why are you laughing and she said you know how your dad says mountain pigs and we lived right under the samber darn Mount she goes I just heard all those pigs oinking like a pig it was it was fun at home it was good times at home but one thing about my father he loved the lord gave his heart to the Lord at 18 years old or was baptized the family had been originally Catholic and I'll I'll tell it as best as I remember one of somebody in the family had cancer and one of the relative of the family had be had heard the Pentecostal message back then and invited had had told him and he told and I don't remember for sure which one of the relatives it was grandma or great grandma it was Grandma okay I'll take you to a church where they pray for people and God heals them and he said and he'll heal you of that cancer so they took GR Grandma there and God healed her of cancer and with that she gave her heart to the Lord and they began to to serve the Lord in a in a Pentecostal church so that was the start of going from Catholicism to to a Pentecostal Church there and dad when he was about 15 years old grandma told him son you've got a you need to serve the Lord he didn't drink he didn't party but he did like to go to the dances and he gay said I w't do it I I won't go anymore I'll do this and he gave that promise to the Lord but he didn't get baptized and he went to a dance and on his way to a dance he felt a hand reach over and touch him on the shoulder and stop him and he said to him for a year I was sick sick sick until I made my made my heart right with God and he took that sickness away and he was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and from then on he served the Lord so in our home we had a Christian father and a Christian mother just share a few things one of my best friends lived up the street and they had a TV in the house it wasn't black and white but it was a TV and we wanted to go see cartoons and he wanted to be at our house and I convinced him him one day to let us go to to go to his house and we're sitting there watching cartoons and suddenly a commotion happened in the kitchen and his little brother comes running out and says let's get out of here Mom and Dad are fighting so we all ran we ran to my house and he goes this is why I would rather be at your house cuz this never happens at your house my mom and dad threaten each other with pans and knives and everything and until you see something like that you really don't know what God has done for you to live in a home that Christ you have Christian parents now there was times when it was rough I'm not saying that there wasn't there were times that you know Dad get upset with us and he loved to say how many spankings do you think you need I never volunteered more than one and he would say you need at least 10 and if I would have said 10 I would have got and then Mom would say that's enough either spank them or let them go but Dad had dad watched over us he prayed for us he talked to us and he told us what what to love God was to know him personally and um watching him as his last days as as as he was coming to the end of his days and the caretakers were kind of explaining to us these are it's probably in his last few hours the last time you've seen Dad here at the church you would have seen his head is was pretty well sideways the muscles and all from the injury that he had had many years earlier very stiff well we had gone home about 8:30 take somebody home and we were going to come back Sunday morning but my brother Jerry and Mom were there and my daughter Sarah Sarah the caretaker and around 10:00 or so Sarah and my mom began to sing to my dad singing songs together to him and um just just being with him and then as he got quiet my brother Jerry noticed that my father's head had straightened out and he went over and he touching and all the stiffness was gone and he took a few breaths and went home amen you know and I know it to be true I'm going to share a testimony here as as we're finishing up we um those of you from many years who have known brother Daniel Ramirez and um his father brother Jose had been an interpreter for brother brandom in the 40s brother Daniel then took the message to the Nora family which uh his brother Isaac Nora and them which then passed it on to our family family so we we had a connection with him man but when brother Jose was was sick and laying in bed used to live in the little house right down the street from the church here and his wife and his daughter were there talking to him and telling him daddy dad you need to eat you don't have any strength you need to eat and he says I'm not hungry I was just fed and they're watching him and there had been nobody there to feed him they said who fed you daddy and he began to talk of names of people had crossed over already and he called them by name they were just here with me feeding me and that's when sister Ramirez she said he's closer to that side than he is to this side so they said Daddy go ahead go home and greet Danny for us he crossed his arms took his breath and crossed over for a Christian there's no fear Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you know there was there was times dad I I love when Dad would come and just share the testimonies Sarah reminded me of one I'll tell you of a God that's more than able there was two young men that my dad and I don't know if it was these ministers or who they were ministered to and one of them was homosexual and my dad prayed for him always wondering what happened to this young man and one day in service he was telling that testimony at a church and the young man stood up and said that was me and I'm here today and I was changed God is more than able to meet and take care of whatever it is if you'll stand with me you know it is a battle but when the battle's over we shall wear a crown you know you and it doesn't take may I say it this way there was a thief on the cross who said Remember me when you come into your kingdom and Jesus turns around looks at him and says this day you'll be with me in Paradise I think he was the shortest one the one with the shortest amount of time in Paradise because when they came out oh I missed something on the notes Here you may s in I was a little bit worried because usually when he comes up there's something bro broke and needs to be fixed but I did miss it there is a slideshow sorry about that [Music] h [Music] ser sh [Music] so many memories so many things that God allowed us I just as we were watching the and I saw the picture of the church that they help bill in one of the Mee meetings that they had there when when Dad would go he would give the sisters some money to go buy the food because they know that the folks would come they would feed them and the sister went and bought and they had a big big pot for soup and more folks came and more folks came and just kept coming and about an hour hour and a half later she comes up crying to my dad and she said the soup the the big pot of soup is still full and we have served everybody and it's still full God is more than able to take care so let's [Music] stand we uh appreciate all of you coming out I know some of you I see some cousins here I see friends and all of us have good memories of of my dad like I said he like to make us laugh he like to make us cry sometimes too but he love he loved the mountains he loved the we've been all the way up into Canada all over the west and did things like that he did get the opportunity to go to Israel with brother Ken Raymond I know it was such a blessing to him but all the best the most the best memory you have will be nothing compared to what we get to that other side and it will be worth it all amen
