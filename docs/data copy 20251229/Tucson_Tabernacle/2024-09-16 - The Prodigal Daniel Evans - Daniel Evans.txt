there you are welcome good to have you back I'm going to be preaching on the prodigal this morning it's it's good for for you to return even for a little while um I uh I I saw where's Elizabeth G there you are I saw you coming in this morning and um bringing sister Sharon there and I thought as I I saw you both walking in I I thought the effort that you go go through and know I know the Lord appreciates it look at Mary over there and and the efforts that you go through to get here to church so many people have so many more means that you than you do and um they can't get out of bed or they they have something better to do but you put it as a priority Sister Mary and thank you and God bless you may the Lord return the blessings of the efforts that you make and Elizabeth that Sharon that all of you all make to get here there's people that should be here this morning that aren't here and um it's sad it's sad that there's more important things than coming to church I I heard uh um I think his brother Jordan mentioned John and an it's good to have you both back man what about a sickness yeah welcome you still kept the project moving though thank you my friend um this evening uh I don't have anything on the calendar but uh I would like to continue on with the sermon that I'm going to preach this morning this evening and I like for the the evening the Sunday evening services to be a little bit light more light-hearted um so uh and and I like to share testimonies on the Sunday evening service I think it's an encouragement to all of us so what I will be doing I'll mention this as I get into my sermon today but what I'll be doing tonight is um I'd like to have often we had brother Ed the other day come in and and give a personal testimony there's someone that's not here with us today but very much considers himself part of of our congregation um brother Adam Gonzalez sister Emilia's son and uh this this evening I'm going to read his testimony that he sent uh he sent me in in letter form so we can look forward to that I believe it'll be a blessing um Jacob I I heard your prayer request too God bless you young man he uh makes a way to get to church he um you just started coming here and you've been a real blessing to us and actually you're one of The Inspirations for my sermon this morning you you came with a with a t-shirt last week and it said the prodigal across it and I told him I was like yeah yeah we haven't seen you in a while it's good to have you back and that that shirt is is really fitting and uh felt it on my heart and I received this letter from Adam and uh and then seeing Jacob's um shirt I really I felt that it was the Lord leading and then many other other things and even a prayer request today from um that uh sister Martha put in uh about this young man in Florida even that I think the everything is lined up to where I believe it's the Lord's will that I preach on this prodigal son that uh we're all probably familiar with the story but I hope that the Lord will open it up to be able to apply it to our really to our own lives and I think all of us can see ourselves in uh in these Parables that I'm going to be talking about this morning or we should see ourselves we should see ourselves and we should also see others our loved ones all of us can take these scriptures and I'm going to read three different Parables this morning and I think that all of us can relate to these three in some way in some fashion um what uh what this Luke chapter 15 is is as I said it's it's story of three different par Parables now do you remember what a parable was a parable didn't necessarily happen a parable is a lesson that the Lord Jesus gives us to be applied to our lives and it can be applied in many many different ways that's what's so beautiful about the parable sister marily I didn't recognize you it's good to have you back to from being sick I'm sorry I just noticed you out there but these um these parables are meant to be applied to our lives and they can be applied in different ways and what does Luke chapter 15 is is is we see this this first Parable and it's a famous Parable that most of us are familiar with is this lost sheep and the shepherd goes and he finds this lost sheep and there's a famous painting where the shepherd puts the Sheep over his shoulders this lamb and he carries it back to the fold beautiful story and then there's a another story that's not as well known and I think it's not very well understood and it but it comes right after this Wayward sheep is with this woman and she loses a coin and she's distraught and she eventually finds the coin and then the third Parable is about this prodigal son that takes the money that that his his inheritance is and then he squanders it and he finds himself absolutely destitute and you'll see that all three go along perfectly with each other so let's get started Let's uh turn to the Book of Luke and we'll start with chapter 15 and we'll start with verse one and we will go through the whole chapter of the Lord's willing then Drew near unto him speaking of the Lord Jesus then Drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him so last week I talked about the Rich Young Ruler in a parable that's in a couple chapters later and and this week we're going to move back as I said a couple chapters and we have to remember who the audience is who Jesus is speaking to and it tells us who the audience is here in the first verse then Drew near to him publican and sinners remember what a Publican is it's a tax collector it's not a good person someone that cheated their own people for for gain and for money very thought of very lowly and then it says and sinners so this this audience is made up of all kinds of different people from as I said Tax Collectors to prostitutes to drunkards to all these things and it's really it's really made up of the common people and these common people we know that the Bible says that the Common People heard Jesus gladly but it was the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the rodians that really had problems with what he said but it was the common people what the Pharisees would have called the Sinners these are the people that just loved Jesus's Ministry they're the ones that came came and In This Crowd maybe it was a crowd of 150 people or so like here maybe this In This Crowd were worried parents worried about their children maybe there was there were young people that were there that were worried about their own testimony and how they had sinned and they had made mistakes many a a big crosssection of people maybe people that were questioning their own religion why is it even important there was a a big cross-section of people and they came and they were the ones that were listening to this teacher in the next verse and the Pharisees and the scribes murmured saying this man receives Sinners and eateth with them so they're immediately they're showing the dis the disrespect of this man Jesus just because of the crowd that was around him they were judging his message on the people that were listening to his message so they were they were all there and they were let me stop for a moment and talk about those Pharisees those Pharisees had children those Pharisees they had people that they were influential on I mentioned last week talking about taking the Lord's work and the Lord and and holding it lightly or making fun of it and it's strange because I said I talked about having a coming to Jesus moment it's something that people talk about a lot and it's like well that means that they got corrected or something and and and I said don't say that kind of stuff don't make fun of the Lord don't make fun of prayer don't make fun of church don't make fun of the Bible don't make fun of the things of God hold them in the highest regard I I was uh I had a contractor out the other day and and uh he was working on um something for me and uh I've been witnessing to him and I I think that they'll probably start coming to church but he said he was talking about something and he says yeah he had a coming to Jesus moment I was like oh I'm not going to say anything he didn't hear my sermon obviously so I was I was I was thinking about that but even he said it it's just so common that we say these type of things and I'm not saying that you're going to go to hell for for saying saying anything like that but you certainly are putting yourself open for it by making fun of God's word so always use caution always teach your children to respect one another to respect the church to respect God's word and teach them God's word and here's Jesus and and he's he's got all these people around him and he's must have looked out on the people and felt the need that they had and so he starts in these Parables as I said they were parents just like we are parents they were young people just like we are young people you are young people I am too compared to some people they were just like us and they had needs and Jesus is speaking to them and he he speaks these stories that literally everyone can relate to and he says and he spake this Parable unto them saying what man of you having a hundred sheep if he lose one of them does not leave the 9 and9 in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it and when Heath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and his neighbors and saith unto them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost I say unto you that likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over the 90 and9 just persons which need no repentance imagine how those Pharisees thought when he said that and this is so common this scenario right here and all of us understand this scenario it's it's when someone leaves and they fall into sin and they get in over their heads and this sheep is out and and you get away from the church or you get away from your family and you get in Among Wolves and all of a sudden you're sinning you're drinking you're partying you're doing drugs you're lying you you you're not working you're doing all these things and you find yourself out in the world afraid and sometimes we need to go get those people they don't want to be out there they have made a mistake and out they go and then they just need a kind word they need somebody to love them they need somebody to reach out a hand of fellowship and say I'll help you young man or young lady or brother or sister I'll help you let me let me do something for you and here's the shepherd and he goes out and he finds this sheep and he he he saves the thing and all of us can be that Shepherd reaching out to someone who may have fallen into sin or may have fallen into hard times and grab that person and lift them back back up and encourage them I was I love Wildlife videos and there's these this big animal up in Alaska called a musk ox you know what they are they they're these big cool looking ox and they they have all this hair and when the wolves or the or the polar bear when he attacks what happens is the herd will make a circle and the business end of the muscock is facing out the horns and Hooves and you don't want to try to get in that Circle if you're a wolf or or whatever you might be and but behind the circle inside the circle are the babies the more vulnerable and they're the ones and they're hiding in there they know don't go out there because they're going to be wolf food so here they form this circle and anything that tries to come in it would be a bad idea for any predator and that's how we are sometimes with our weaker members of the church stick the horns out and the Hooves out and protect those that need help watch over them they may be weak it's okay it's all right if they're not where they should be but there is a if there is a desire for them to be safe like these baby muscs protect them they're going to make mistakes watch over them take just protect and and nurture them Romans chapter 15 says this we who are strong the King James says we who are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of those that are weak the English Standard Version says that we who are strong have an obligation to bear with the fail ings of the weak and not to please ourselves so we should have patience with those that are weak we should bear their their weaknesses the Amplified version says this we who are strong in our convictions and of robust Faith ought to bear with the failings and the frailties and the tender Scruples of the weak we ought to help carry the doubts and qualms of others others and not to please ourselves we ought to help carry the doubts and the qualms I didn't really understand what the word qualm meant the dictionary says it's an uneasy feeling of Doubt or fear especially about one's own conduct so we should be carrying those people supporting those people so many people will come to service and they'll see maybe people that don't look like them or or or or they might be insecure about themselves and what they'll do is they'll come to service and then they'll leave and say those people judged me those people are just they look at me and they're judging me and and and I I don't want to be around them they think less of me and when really that's not happening what's happening is they're coming in they're feeling self-conscious about themselves and they leave and they're in their mind it's thinking these people are are down on me they're putting me down they think less of me when that's not even really happening and what this scripture is saying is that person that's feeling like they're being judged we need to go to that person make an extra effort for that person and lift that person up and show that person love is what Romans chapter 15 is saying if they're feeling insecure we who are strong should carry those insecurities we should help them not and not be defensive about our own faith brother and sisters I am very secure with my faith I don't have to worry about the way I believe I'm not I'm not g to compromise at all on Jesus Christ that's not part that's not part of it I'm am going to stand strong on that but in being so strong the Romans 15:1 is saying that if you are strong in what you believe then go ahead and help those that aren't So Strong Lift them up carry them don't get offended if they don't believe like you or if they put down the the something that you do raise up above that and help carry that person and do it in love that's the greatest thing that you can do and this she this Shepherd he's not worried about himself when he goes and gets the Sheep he wasn't wor he's what he's worried about is is worried about the the wolves attacking that Wayward sheep because it's alone so the shepherd goes out and he's willing to fight off these wolves he was willing to do whatever and then he gets this this baby sheep let's say it is let's say it's a lamb and he brings it back to the fold and there is rejoicing in the camp calls his friends up and says hey so and so came came back to the Lord Jesus and then we Rejoice together and then maybe the person gives a testimony in church and everything is just so happy and just just absolutely precious like like I gave the testimony of that young man I believe his name was Jacob from Ikea last week and it was just blessed me so much that this young man came to the Lord I was rejoicing with him praise God that he came to came to the Lord and then the 99 other sheep they're praising the Lord also they're saying thank God this is this is just wonderful that so and so came back to the Lord and then now in the second scenario we're going to see a parable that goes in perfect line with it but it seems so different and but the story is absolutely perfect like in everything that Jesus did he says this either what Woman verse number eight in uh Luke 15 either what woman having 10 pieces of silver and she lose one piece does not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it and when she had found it she calls her friends and her neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I have found the piece which I have lost so she's really she's really happy that that this coin which was probably a sign of either engagement or marriage and the women back then probably wore it either in a headdress around their head or they may have worn it in a necklace and they had these coins in there and they were very valuable so if you lose one it's like losing your diamond in your wedding ring it's devastating so what does she do she goes to the house and she starts digging around in the couch and and she starts looking and and she starts sweeping up and then you know she pulls the cushion up in the couch have you ever done that how in the world does so much stuff get in there I mean I would do I'd lose my wallet or something and I'd be digging in the couch it's like Cheerios we I don't remember ever even buying Cheerios and then popcorn it's always there's always popcorn in there there's popcorn in there it's like where in the world did this stuff come and you look in there it's like oh I just made a150 and and in coins and stuff you're smiling because it happens to you and you're going through and you're cleaning and and you're cleaning out those those creases in the couch when you when you lose your wallet or or your ring or whatever it is and you go through and you're you're sweeping the corners of the house and and and you're looking behind the the bed post and behind everything and finally you find it but what happened in the time that you lost it until the time that you found it you cleaned up your life you cleaned up your house on and you went through this thing and that thing remember my son where is he my son the little guy I liked apples and I'd always find these little shrivel up apple cores in between the couch and stuff man buddy don't leave that stuff there but if I wouldn't have lost my wallet I wouldn't have cleaned it up and here is this woman she's going through and she's cleaning everything and fi and then she finally finds the diamond or the coin that she lost and she's praising the Lord for it and that's what happens sometimes when we lose a son or when we lose a daughter or when we lose a friend or a brother or a sister they go out in the world what's the first thing that the parents do is they start I start looking at myself Lord what do I need to clean up in my life and then I start seeing these things and I start cleaning myself up and start making things right and doing things better because I got a child that's out there and I want to do everything that I can to clean this up because I want that child to come back I'm afraid it might be a lamb Out Among Wolves or might be what I'm going to say about this prodigal it it may be either of the two but Lord I got to clean up my life cuz I'm worried about my baby she was worried about this coin that was her marriage vow and she did everything she could to clean up that house and get everything in order and then she finally found it and again she rejoices she goes back and she calls her friends sends out a WhatsApp broadcast I found it thank you for praying for me praise God and and they give God the credit for finding this lost thing and that's with us that we should be looking in every crack and every crevice just like this woman did when we have someone go out a prodigal leave we're worried about our family we're worried about our children we're worried about whatever clean up your life first if fits perfect between the first one which is that lost sheep and the shepherd going and get it the Sheep didn't want to be lost this is very important that sheep in the first Parable did not want to be lost there was a desire in the Sheep to come back to the fold it may be fallen into sin it may have come upon hard times but there was a desire in it to come back home and then this woman she cleans up her life she cleans up her house and then Jesus continues on and he says likewise I say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth so Jesus brings it back he's talking about a coin this woman finding a coin and then he ties it back to someone that comes back to God and it's even Beyond us we might be praising the Lord but in heaven the angels are praising God because that soul that was lost is now found so our joy and you may think it's just limited to just the husband and the wife or or the brother or the sister or whatever it is you may think that it's just limited to that but when that that wavered Soul comes back to the Lord there is shouting and joy that we can't hear in heaven and you don't hear that type of statement very often in the Bible but you hear it here when that person comes back likewise I say to you there is joy in the presence of the angel of God over one sinner that repents now the third and the most famous of all three of these Parables is the story of The Prodigal Son and that's what I want to concentrate today it says this in verse number 11 and he said certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father forgi father give me the portion of goods that fth to me and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living so the younger of the two sons he makes his conscious decision to leave he wants his inheritance because he wants to experience what the world has to offer maybe he thinks he's been deprived a little bit maybe he thinks that well I lived in this type of household so I just I want to go experience I want to I want to live like everybody else lives I don't want to be weird like going to church and doing all that I don't want to be like that I want to be like everybody else is at the University or at work or whatever it is I want to be like them I want an experience I want that there's a desire in me to do it so this young man he makes the conscious decision I'm leaving I'm leaving you because I want this when I was a kid when I was growing up in high school there was this saying that uh sex drugs and rock and roll and I don't know if any of you remember that but it was that was like the rally cry partying cry way back whenn and that was that was the saying and that was kind of the the Party Anthem and everybody was going out and doing that type of thing and what they were doing is they were probably leaving the truth what they knew what was right and making the decision to go out from under that protection of the Lord and then go to their own devices and then be responsible for their own lives and when you walk out from under that protection of God you are on your own and let me tell you never in the history of the world has it ever worked out well that's right and yet most people still make that decision most do that today it may not be like it was in the 80s and '90s sex drugs and rock and roll but today it's do what makes you happy love yourself don't worry don't worry about making a living and providing you're entitled to a paycheck you're entitled to health care you're entitled to all these things don't worry about it just do what you want to do don't worry about getting married before having sex just do what do what makes you happy and if you get pregnant abort it because it's about you it's about what makes what it's about your life you're the most important thing and look at the world today if you don't look around and see that you see the politicians up there saying oh you need to protect this right and it's about you and it's about a woman's body what about the conceived child that's there that's right am it's wrong because it is I want to put myself first I don't want to waste a year of my life because of this thing that was conceived in sin I don't want to waste my I I I'll take a I take a pill or go to the the doctor and have it done or whatever it might be this stuff needs to be preached more by the way our people need to know that this is wrong and it is wrong but instead it's like you don't want to lose you don't want to lose a year of your life live your life to the fullest as I said do what makes you happy and this young man this prodigal son that was his attitude he didn't care about being responsible he didn't he certainly didn't care about serving God he wanted to serve himself and he left and it's a story so you don't hear much about his mom and dad but imagine how his mom felt imagine how it devastated her to see her son leave like that say I don't want your religion Mom I don't dad I don't I don't want your religion all of that that these that they tried to teach their their child and and tried to raise him upright I don't want it I don't want your religion I want to experience the world so he goes out and experiences the world as I said he was left to his own devices now it was his choice and notice and here is the point of this one notice what the father did when the son left he let him go he wasn't sending him money to help him with with his drinking and doing all that he said leave he didn't go out and try to find him like the shepherd went out and tried to find the lost lamb that lamb was scared he wanted to come home this young man doesn't want to come home he wants the world and it's the hardest thing in the world sometimes for a parent to do is let them go but sometimes we have to and don't enable them you're not going to give them more money so they can go drink more you're not going to give them more to to where that they're enabled no you leave them to their own devices so that God can handle it I I knew some um some friend of ours they children daughters just desire the world and and just just wanted it and the parents were so afraid of losing the daughter even though she was running towards the world the parents were so afraid of losing her that what did they do they go and they buy her new cars and feed that desire for the world and enable in it a convertible so she can cre around in their bikini top and guys can look in the top look in the car and see her the parents bought it for her bad move Let It Go and sometimes it is the best thing that you can do for a child for a young person or brother or sisters let them go but it's the hardest thing to do because you love them so much but trust in God let God take care of that person and then what's going to happen when when you do it the same thing that happened to this prodigal son verse number 14 and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in the land and he began to be in want he had needs the money had run out Life starts getting tough and there was so strange how there's a lot of times there's no God in our lives until times get hard and that'll go that that'll make us go to our knees and that's what God he loved this young man I believe and God let the young man make the wrong decisions until he was so weak and until he was s in such a bad place he had no one else to cry out to and he went and he joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed the swine so he went to work for this guy and the guy said well yeah you can you can feed my pigs and he would have Fain filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him he desired to eat the food that the pigs were eating he was so hungry that was his desire in his heart that if I could just get this job feeding these pigs and I can start eating what the pigs eat and I'll be able to survive look how low now this young man had become but it was all by the grace of God that he became that low God knows he knows the beginning from the end and God knows what's the most important thing is that people come to him and God will allow us to fall and fail and get as low as we can because he knows the most important thing is what's beyond the river he knows the most important thing is that eternal life and it's the most important thing for our children and sometimes we have to pull back as this father did and this mother and then this young man comes to himself I'm going to insert right here I um as I said I asked sister Amelia's son to uh to write down his testimony and I'm going to share a little bit with with the congregation this morning and then we'll get into it deeper tonight he says this he says 19 years old I would find myself in a hospital with a gunshot wound to my stomach I almost died then shortly after facing prison time time looking at three and a half years in prison then once in prison I would make more bad choices that would Place me in super max lockdown now here I am with no Escape God had me one-on-one calling to me all the while he was calling I just wasn't listening as this prodigal son was not listening but this was a sitdown and I think what he meant by sit down was he's saying I had no were to go and God sat me down as we would sit down sit our kids down and he gave me a talking to so I would call out and pray and begin to pick up my Bible I started to come back only not the way of obedience we all have a way and he quotes the scripture there is a way that seems right to a man in which we are going to respond but he has a provided way not our way when I got out of prison I would only Venture back to Old patterns for time sake again I'll skip down I'm just going to read some portions of it now out of prison in my early 30s I turn back to the life of sin almost like I graduated in sin and now I'm proving faithful to serve its desires but the line of serving sin's desires so with the risk comes reward and now I'm willing to risk more for a better life of luxury so for the next five five years to another seven went hard into this life almost like a man running from the presence of the Lord I drowned out the calling with the things the calling of God with the things of the world till one day yet again for a third time I was looking at going back to prison this time it would be for a very long time but God would make provisions and shine his grace upon me to give me another opportunity to heed his calling and I can tell you that all the in between situations and looking back at how God's hand was upon me during These Foolish times in my life he says this he says don't be don't be mistaken he says God I'm saying this not to bless me but to Save Me From Myself sin and Satan Save Me From Myself sin and Satan puts them all three together so the goal in this is this I say he says this he said finally and there he is in prison for a very long time and he says finally I came to my senses and then I made a deliberate choice I realized things were so severe even so even lifethreatening that I knew God meant business but I was blind see it started in Disobedience left me in delusion lies and deception it was God who delivered me and spared me now sitting in myself I dedicated my life to the Lord I submitted to full obedience so don't think to yourself that if God gave me and he says brother Adam if God saved me brother Adam I can play with fire too some leave and never to come back they never even look back just think of that man who went to hell speaking of the Rich Young Ruler who by the way we just talked about last week just think of that man who went to hell if he could have just had one chance to go back to his family to tell them how real hell was but he had his chance see he had had his chance see and then what was the response he says sin someone and the only response he gets where they had the prophets you know they had a church they had a pastor they had Parents they had these things they had them if I send you it's not going to do any good they've already had it they have a Bible all they have to do is read it brother Adam continues no if I can look you in the faith in the face with a serious stern look I have this to say I was better off never leaving my post in that church pew just holding my post right there I was better off never knowing the things the world introduced me to all the while still your brother lost but now I'm found so let me tell you and give you a little vision of that the end result is right here writing you this letter he's telling this congregation the Tucson Tabernacle he wrote this to us he said the end result is writing you right now where's he from from prison he says these words don't he says don't do it he's talking about Sin he says this my Disobedience hurt the body he says I left my post to be selfish and I was stubborn imagine if part of your body stops working it would affect the whole body he goes on he says I may never be able to join you as as my heart desires may never be able he's saying to come into this congregation that we take so lightly that we don't really it's like oh yeah I'll go to church today won't go to church tomorrow he says I desire here's brother Adam I want to be with you he says but I may never have that desire it hurts so bad but I look to the day that we will meet again we are promised that meeting in the sky and I'll be the guy screaming and hollering finally trust me friend I wish I never knew or have tasted I was better off never having known never having experienced or learned once you do something you can't undo it and that is exactly what this prodigal son does in Luke 15 15 let's go back to Luke 15 go back to verse 17 and when he came to himself how many hired Servants of my fathers have bread enough to spare and I perish with Hunger I will arise and go to my father and I will say unto him father I have sinned against Heaven I've sinned against God before you father and I've sinned against you and he's going over this in his mind and I am no more worthy to be called your son make me as one of thy hired servants so he's got all this stuff in his mind and he's saying okay I'm GNA come to my dad and I'm going to get there and I'm going to tell him daddy I'm sorry I messed up I shouldn't have done it but I just want to be a normal person now I just want to have a job I just want to work for you I don't have to be your son just make me like one of your servants I'd much rather be that than where I am right now I've ruined my life dad and he's thinking about all of these things here's the way I'm going to talk to my dad when when when I get there and here's the things and he starts on this journey back home he's walking and he's going over this in his mind Rose and came to his father and there's his dad remember what I had said the first two Parables how much they rejoice when a sinner repents how much that woman rejoiced when she found her coin how much that that Shepherd rejoiced when he found this lost lamb remember that and even when he was a great way off his dad was out there maybe in the front yard and he looked and he sees out there wow that man's walking like like my son gets a little closer put yourself in the dad's spot in the mom's Spot a little bit closer that is my son that's my boy that's my daughter that's my brother that's my sister wow they're coming down this aisle in church they're coming back home and how much it meant to that Dad and that Dad he runs out his father saw him and he had compassion and he ran and he fell on his neck and he kissed him and the son said to him father now remember he's going to recite what he had he had been thinking about this whole journey home and he doesn't get much of it out and the son said to him father I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son dad but the father said to his servants hold on son just a minute bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and he is alive again that Dad loved him it doesn't matter what he did the the boy left the dad backed off and let Satan have that child but but trusting that God was with him and that God would protect him and bring him back bring the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound and they began to be merry and we we learn about his Elder son and his Elder son was upset he's like Dad come on he's been gone and I've been with you the whole time remember what Adam said in the letter he's like Dad I've been with you the whole time and you're going to bring a fatted calf and you're going to have a big party you never had a party for me dad dad's like listen son you're not carrying the baggage that he's carrying you've been with me the whole time you're not fighting the battles that he's fighting that's right you're not going to suffer like he has suffered because you have lived right son everything I have is yours it's all right he's got it hard now so let's have this party let's honor my son coming home and that's what happens in this Parable it's beautiful our lord Jesus have have time to tell a little bit more light-hearted story so we can end on a little bit I know that's heavy it's a heavy Parable it's a heavy and all of us you don't have to raise your hand but think how many of us can relate to our Lord Jesus's Parables here it might be us might be me might be a child might be a brother or sister or a loved one we can all relate to these things right here and it might not be that that this man's that this this prodigal son's drunk on the street he may have just left the religion I don't want it I want to live my life man I want to be happy I don't be torn down which is the same as this prodigal son let him go don't enable them don't shun them always be there for them when they want to come back as this dad was was and how happy he was but you don't have to help them sin I told this story Daniel uh reminded me I said buddy did I I know I told it once did I tell this story about um this uh this guy from South Africa and uh Daniel told me he's like Dad I think you told it right before Camp last year it's like you know what it's a good time to tell it again if you haven't heard it it's a great story one of my favorite stories so um uh Keith Hearn who is uh he's one of the most precious people I've ever met and and this man has a calling in his life to lead people to Jesus Christ he lives in South Africa and uh he's not a pastor he's very much a minister but he's not like in the traditional Evangelistic scene he's not somebody that stands in the Pulpit very often and preaches but he is always preaching and he's always out on the street and he's always witnessing and the reason he is so successful let me tell you something about Keith the reason he is so successful is because he has love and whoever he is witnessing to they can tell he cares and he has led of anyone I have ever met I believe Keith has led more people to the Lord than anyone else that I've ever met and he told me this story he called and he says uh this is a couple few years ago he says he says uh he goes he goes brother Dan he says pray with me for this man that I just met and he so what happened was this man came into the office and uh he was really he was tattered and and beaten down and really just not in a good place in his life he was a Muslim man really he was just destitute and Keith as Keith is one of the kindest people he ever meet he brings him into the office and he feeds him he gets him cleaned up and he starts wh witnessing to this Muslim man about the Bible and about the Lord Jesus and the man really um he really took to it so Keith gives him a Bible small little Bible and he gives it he says here here read this so the man's cleaned up and he leaves a little while later he comes back to the office office couple weeks later I think it was maybe maybe a week later and he had just gotten out of the hospital and he was beaten and bruised and bloody and bandaged up and almost died and what had happened was he had read this Bible he had accepted this Jesus Christ came home told his family and his dad beat him almost to death he was able to get somehow to a hospital with they patched him up and he comes back to Keith Keith helps him out gives him gives him some help in and Keith cared for his wounds and um he asked um what Keith what his name is Imam imram imram what he was looking at in the Bible and imram said well I was I was curious about about the Lord Jesus Muslims teach that he was a prophet but not the Son of God and Keith gives him more of an understanding of this Jesus Christ so this this imram he's he's excited and he's learning about this and and it's just something something that's just blessing him so he takes his Bible and he leaves and doesn't call back he's gone months pass Keith say hey uh pray keep praying for that guy haven't seen him in a long time and a lot of times we witness to someone and and um then they just leave and we never hear back from them again and it's okay you did your part so he's out so one day this imram comes back I think it was a year later he comes back to the office and he looks good he's well dressed clean cut Keith almost didn't recognize him and he says he says wow he says he says look at You' and actually it was a few years I didn't know that if I have in my notes here it was a few years and Keith calls me he says you're not going to believe this imram has returned and he said so he says what had happened was is he read this Bible and he as as always all of us when we give our hearts to the Lord Jesus when we truly accept Jesus Christ then we want to tell others about it and we want to lead others to Christ and we others to have the same the the same joy that we have and that's why you don't see in the Bible brothers and sisters in the Old Testament you don't see evangelism because there was no Jesus you don't see conversions you don't see out people witnessing and doing all that that starts in the New Testament that starts when Jesus is here and now we have that Joy of our salvation and we want others to know about this so imram he has this joy and he felt a call to go to the prisons so he goes into the prisons and he starts witnessing and he gets these Gideon Bibles you know the little the little green Bibles he gets these Bibles and he's taking them to the um to the prisoners preaching in different places trying to introduce him to the Lord and uh he gives a Bible this man comes up kind of a belligerent man rude and says hey give me one of those Bibles and imram says why do you want it and the guy says he says really he says that that paper he says it's good for Rolling smokes he says uh that's what I want it for so what does imram do what would you do probably do the same thing I did I would do imram says okay remember it's a new testament Gideon Bible there's not the Old Testament they're just Psalms and Proverbs so he says here you go he says the deal is you can take this Bible he says do whatever you're going to do with it he says but if you're going to use it for smokes he said you read the page before you smoke it I says all right I wouldn't have done that he says okay so imram goes throughout his ministry and he's going he's doing the same thing and all these different these different prisons and leading people to the Lord and his ministry is just being blessed and and and he's leading all these people to Christ and then he comes back to that other prison months later he's got his Bibles again and here comes the same guy and he sees him he's like and he keeps preaching and the guy's like um uh and he's like and he keeps he keeps ministering and he keeps and and the guy's like hey I need a Bible I want another Bible him M looks at him and he says you're the same one that told me he says yeah I am I want another one he says why do you want another one he says well here's the deal he says I did what I told you he said I took the Bible I started tearing out the pages rolling the smokes and he said I smoke Matthew and then he says I smoked Mark and then he says and I smoked Luke he says then I got to John and he said John smoked me he said I fell in love with Jesus Christ he said but I read every page just like I told you I was going to do praise God and he said I read every page and I got to John and I saw that love in Jesus Christ and I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus and I need a Bible now that I can read and that man today that wasn't too long ago that man today imram is out preaching the gospel and I would bet that that man that gave his heart to the Lord Jesus in The Book of John I'll bet you that he is also serving the lord and leading others to Christ when these the musicians can come when these prodigals brothers and sisters when they leave have faith that they will come back and when these other when these Lambs when they go away and you still see that desire to serve God but they may fail have never ending patience with them love them and continue to bring them in don't en enable them to fail but bring them in sometimes brother Ary you got to go out and grab them out of the thicket and put them over your shoulders and bring them home but the thing that they will want to come home A friend of mine his son was out partying and drinking and everything and and he got he got drunk and uh he condemned him and you know who he called he said Dad come get me he says I can't drive I had too much to drink and the dad went and got him brought him in and now the young man I believe is serving the lord Jesus let me tell you when that salvation comes it may come through dad it may come through Mom it may come through a friend when that salvation comes you appreciate it you love it God bless you brother Josiah pass me not oh gentle [Music] saor hear my humble cry while on others Thou Art [Music] calling do not pass me [Music] by say saor savior here my humble [Music] cry while on others thou calling do not pass me by the course again savior saor saor here my humble [Music] cry why on others thou AR calling do not pass me by brothers and sisters I want to I want to say one more time at Romans chapter 15 and verse one we then that are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves we have an obligation for those that are weak for those that are weak in their faith for those that might not understand for those that might feel judged or that might be looking for a reason not to go to church we have an obligation to bear that up on our own shoulders and help them and encourage them come back and go get that little lamb and if the lamb doesn't want to be here as I said there's there are people that should be here today there are people that this Parable is directly applies to and they should be here in this room but what can you do you can't force them to come you know how many times have I invited people and they don't come [Music] sometimes you just have to say lord it's in your hands I'll be here no matter what it is I will be here for that person when they decide to come if they do if they haven't spurned the grace of God I will be here until the end of my days I will be here for those people that come in and I pray that they do come in every one of them man every single one of them let's all stand [Music] down at the cross where my savior died down wherefore cleansing from sin I cried there to my heart was the blood of [Music] glory to his name Oh Glory to his name glory to his name the there to my heart was the blood of Glory to his come to the [Music] Fountain come to this Fountain so rich sweet cast thy poor soul at the Savior

blessed we are that we have this strength in this Congregation of people that God has given us that if I get weak you can pick me up that if you get weak somebody else can pick you up I can pick you up why would we ever forfeit this why would we some want something else we have been blessed we have been blessed beyond measure to have what we have and it breaks my heart to see people that don't want it and there's nothing you can do to give it to them they refuse it God gives you a gift and you say I don't want your gifts and it happen so often the Pharisees they refused God's Gift the religious people refuse God gifts God's gift and also as we see in The Prodigal Son they receive God's gift but every single one of these Parables has a happy ending and imagine those people that were in that congregation when Jesus was preaching this and they found hope that they could return to God that he was there for them or that their children could come back let's bow our heads [Music] I hope that each one here could relate to these stories that our lord Jesus gave and you can say I'm a prodigal or you could say I'm praying for a prodigal or many of us can say I'm both just Place yourselves in these scriptures and remember God's hearing your prayers last week we talked about continue to knock even if you don't get an answer there is a bigger picture there is a perfect will of God and this person that you're praying for if it's yourself if it's someone else there's God's time put the trust in God and if it is yourself God's times now don't waste any more time come to God and don't forfeit that gift that he has given you our heavenly father Lord thank you for the ministry for the words of our Lord Jesus Christ Lord who could speak such things as he spoke father as as I read your word I almost can't contain myself about how wonderful it is how great is the word of God I can imagine how those people in that congregation as Jesus was preaching I can imagine how they felt Lord feel like I have a little taste of it father there's PE there's things on the people's hearts [Music] today whether it's a prodigal or whether they are are the prodigal father I pray I put
