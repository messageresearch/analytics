how much he loves you but he does it for us and as he was saying it reminded me of a song and brother Jordan found the words to the uh to the chorus in um I heard this song A long time ago and the only part of it that I remember is the chorus and I asked such Martha and sister Lily and they didn't know this song the only one was Sister Angela said they used to sing it back home but the words

heartache that caused me to pray will you make me a vessel the master can use make me willing the rest of my days I just kept ringing over and I'd say I remember that song as a young man and that

correct us where we need correcting and then Lord that you push us forward when we need to be pushed forward father be with us Lord we want to honor you in our service tonight Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all you can be seated I believe that Satan was not happy with our service this morning and I believe that God was happy I believe that he was pleased and um afterwards and reflecting about some things I am just grateful to God that that we have a Bible we have a message that we have a God that that can be touched a God that came down and dwelt Among Us God that loves us a God that knows us a God that cares about us I um I want to give a little testimony it just just thought about it I was I think I was 27 years old and uh Stephanie and I were just married and I had never taken communion before I was always afraid because I read in in this Bible I saw where if you take this unworthy that you are guilty of the blood of the Lord Jesus and I never wanted to be that as as a young man and it always it scared me all of those years because I would look on my life and I would see all of my sins and I would see all of my shortcomings and I would see how how many things that I would do wrong and all of those things would come to my mind especially before we take communion and I never take it and it was brother Heath it was Doug mccuse you all know brother mchughes I went fishing with him and we were forgot where we went um but we we went fishing in a he's talking with him the whole time and the subject of communion came up and Bill Doug was we were talking about it and and I he says well he says well do you believe in communion and I said yeah of course I do say it's in the word I said I've always believed in it and he said well why don't you take communion and I said brother Doug I said I am I'm not worthy to take communion I said I got all these sins in my life and brother Doug said he said well I can't remember his exact words but he told me that you will always do things wrong you always have sin in your life but if you're not checking up and if you're not doing your best to come up here before the Lord's table he said brother he says he says what are you here for and when we were we talked and I can't remember his exact words but brother Doug basically told me that I know that you're doing things wrong but you should still be coming to this communion table you don't want to do them and I think back now and me being 51 years old and being where I am now as a man of God and as somebody that that has dedicated my life to this word if I was living the life I was back when I was 25 26 years old 27 years old no I shouldn't take communion but it's different for me now as I have progressed in the Lord that I if I if I backslid then no I shouldn't be coming to this table but back then I should have absolutely been here and I feel bad that I went those years not taking communion and should have been taking communion even though there were things in my life that that needed to be changed I still should have been here because my heart was wanting to serve the Lord and I was not I wasn't living a life that was full of sin like like what I'm going to read tonight my life didn't line up with what the Apostle Paul was saying on people that shouldn't be coming to the table I was a sinner saved by grace I was doing my best I was failing but I was trying my heart was right and I look at today I look at myself today and that would be very easy for me to say I shouldn't be taking communion because maybe I said something wrong before and and I or or maybe I I did something wrong there the devil's always going to throw things at us to say don't come to this table that's what he does he's going to do it but when we check up and when we're thinking about this communion table when we're thinking about taking these these ordinances the bread and the wine that represent the body of Christ do we have a part with them or are we going to not take it and you say Lord I'm going to do better I'm going to keep trying and then guess what you're going to fail and then you get back up like I said this morning and you keep trying and you keep moving and I feel like even now as a minister of the Gospel I look at all the things that that I've done wrong and and but I look back wow when I was 27 years old I've come a long way the uh the story that brother Branham tells about the uh the black sister that she said well I ain't what I want to be and I ain't what ought to be but I ain't what I used to be and that's how we feel in coming to this table uh Lord I am doing my best I'm trying yes I can stand here with these saints of God and I can take these ordinances according to your word even though I I do things wrong and I fail but I'm trying and the Lord will give us Revelation and bring us along as time goes on like I said 27 years old if I was if I if today if I had slid all the way back to that time then I'd say you know what I I shouldn't I shouldn't even be there but the Lord will continue to bring us towards Holiness and continue to bring us closer to him I am have a short message today and it's tonight and it's um it's kind of coming along after this morning after this morning's service let's turn to First Corinthians I'm going to go through First Corinthians chapter 10. and I didn't know this was here I I was I was reading this for for this morning's service a couple days ago yesterday and as I was reading these these scriptures that wow this is talking about communion even says communion what a tremendous teaching the Apostle Paul is teaching in this first Corinthians chapter 10. so let's just go verse by verse and I pray that the Lord will reveal a little bit more of his word to us and prepare our hearts for what we're going to do tonight First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 1. moreover brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and passed through the sea you know what he's talking about he's talking about the Hebrews coming out of Egypt passing through the Red Sea and um and then going and then going into the into the wilderness and we're baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did he eat did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual walk that followed them and that rock was Christ can you imagine how those if a Pharisee or a sadducee heard this drinking of that spiritual Rock and here is Paul saying oh and by the way it's the one that you killed he was alive way back when what is that is a beautiful statement for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ Paul is doing nothing less than making Jesus God right here but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness you remember they were complaining all the problems that they had that popped up now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted very important the Apostle here is saying these things that that you know from the Torah these things are our example today neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and they rose up to play now what he's talking about here is he's talking about Exodus 32 when Moses went up on Mount Sinai you know the story Moses Moses went up there and he was gone for a long time so the people started thinking hey is Moses ever going to come back down so they started talking amongst themselves and the sin that was in them the desire to sin started to come out and they told Aaron Moses's brother they said hey make us a calf make us a cat make us a god so Aaron says okay he says everybody take off their earrings and give them to me so they they all took off their earrings and and they gave them to Aaron Aaron fashioned this calf and they offered offerings to this calf instead of offering to Jehovah God so they placed this object of worship up and then they they uh they started making these offerings and these burnt offerings what they should have been doing to Jehovah they started doing to this calf and then they had this big feast and exodus 32 6 says that and they rose up to play that's when the Lord tells Moses he says go back down from the mountain because the people have corrupted themselves and God tells Moses God's looking down and he sees he says they're just sinning what we would call immoral Behavior living unclean sexually and and and and drinking and partying and doing doing exactly what God just despised remember Paul here is getting to the communion table and he's saying use this as an example God tells Moses he says these are a stiff-neck people and I'm going to consume them all and Moses cries out to Jehovah and he says Lord why are you so angry with your people that you brought out of Egypt we know that that is sister Shirley that's that sweet Spirit of Christ that's operating in God's prophets standing in the breach before an Angry wrathful God and those that deserve the Wrath on the on the bottom there and then here we have that Spirit of Christ in Moses saying Lord wait Lord wait you called these people out you brought them out and now you brought them into this Wilderness with a mighty hand and now all the Egyptians are going to say that you brought them out just to kill him in the wilderness he said Lord he said the King James says Lord this is a strange thing or someone to say but the King James says Moses said Lord repent of what you're going to do to these people that word repent means to to um reverse to come back so God listened to his servant Prophet Moses and he said okay and it says in the Lord the Lord repented the Lord stepped back from what he was going to do from his intention to destroy the people verse number eight in First Corinthians so we're looking now at these people these revelers these people that wanted to sin like I said out partying and drinking and and living unclean living immorally Paul says this neither let us commit fornication as as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand he's talking about their sins over those 40 years in the wilderness neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents now he's talking about when they were in the wilderness that these these poisonous snakes were out there they started they started getting bitten by these snakes and and the people they started dying and then remember Moses raised up the brass serpent and he said look on this when you get bitten by one of these snakes and you'll live verse 10 neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer murmuring complaining right up there with fornication and adultery speaking of their complaining God brings them through the Red Sea and then they start complaining how they were going to die in the wilderness for star from starvation God starts raining down Manna From Heaven then they start complaining that they don't have enough water then God brings water out of the Rock which was Christ then God brings water out of the rock they drink oh and we don't like Manna anymore we want some meat so then he sends them quail continues to give them what they what they asked for and yet they continued to complain and the whole time fighting amongst themselves having to go to Moses so where Moses had to set um I think it was 70. underneath them to take care of all the problems and all the conflicts that they had verse number 11 now all these things happened unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come again Paul is saying here these things are examples to us look before you take this communion look at what they did in the wilderness look at all the sin so we don't fall into the same Temptations and make the same mistakes as they made wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there has no temptation taken you but such is as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to bear it I spoke about that this morning how nothing's new all these temptations that we have all these problems that we have other people have had them and yes you can overcome these things wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry now you have to think of Paul's audience here these are Jews and Gentiles that have have accepted the Lord Jesus just like us he's speaking to the conservative audience and he's speaking to the liberal audience and he says that these Christians these people that are Christians some of them some of them are probably new most likely are new converts but then there's some there that had been there for a while and that were well learned and understood these things and we're living this life that that was more above reproach than the others he's he's looking at this Corinthian Church and you see the whole spectrum of people he says this after he says flee from idolatry he says I speak as to wise men judge ye what I say I've heard some people say that that anyone who's standing in the pulpits anointed I would I would beg to differ with that you judge everything I say when I say it don't just think it's anointed because I'm standing behind a wooden box when I am ministering it's got to line up with the word through the Holy Spirit as I said it doesn't matter who's standing here and it doesn't matter just because I'm speaking to a to a church that doesn't mean that I'm right it doesn't mean that I can't make mistakes you judge what I say I'll do my best and I seek the Lord for these things and and I'm I'm trying but Paul right here says I speak as the wise men judge ye what I say this is the Apostle speaking so how much how much less how much more should I say that now this next verse shows us communion the cup of the blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ showing that that the blood the the wine that we we take represents the blood of Jesus Christ the the bread represents that torn broken body of Christ for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread now remember when Jesus in his last supper he tells us to wash each other's feet he uh he tells the disciples he says that he said I can only imagine and and as we as we take these ordinances tonight we do reenact what happened there at that faithful night that last supper when Jesus the next morning was going to be on the cross and so Jesus is is there with his disciples and he's teaching them and he's he's talking he he brings the disciples in he kneels down and he takes a basin and he washes their feet girds himself with a towel and and dries their feet off and he does it to each one and and then they they sit down for supper and Jesus says that one of you is going to betray me you know those disciples we know what they said they said like we would probably say Lord I hope it's not me and maybe they were thinking just like I was as a young man well I've done this and I've done this and I've done this and I'm not worthy well we're not worthy but we're still commanded to be here so much so that the disciples start saying Lord is it me Lord is it me so then we have this young man John who's leaning on the Lord Jesus's chest Peter says John says uh Lord who is it the Lord Jesus says the same one when I dip this bread in the SOP who I give it to is that one dipped it and he gave it to the Man Judas is carrot and he says go do what you have to do Judas up and he leaves and none of them understood it even though he said it they still didn't get it they're like oh Judas he's the treasurer so he's probably going to give money to the poor or or go do something so out he goes and now we have our communion service and here is Jesus and he's breaking this bread for the disciples and he he says this let me let's turn to John chapter 13. I don't have it written down here but I want to read it John Chapter 13 Verse 31. this is at The Last Supper John 13. 31. therefore when he was gone out about Judas I'll start with 29. for some of them have thought because Judas had the bag that Jesus had said unto him by those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor and then having received the SOP went immediately out and it was night therefore when he was gone out Jesus said now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him if God be glorified in him God shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him little children can imagine these are his friends these are the people that he loves more these are the ones that are closest to him I shouldn't say I don't know if he loved them more than anybody else because he died for all of us he died for me and I'm here 2000 years later but these were his disciples those that just stuck with him he says this little children yet a little while I am with you you shall seek me and I said unto the Jews whether I go you cannot come so now I say a new commandment commandment means he commands it a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another so as much as I have loved you I want you to love each other by this the famous scripture that's quoted so often but how many people put it into practice by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have loved one for another so I'll know you not because you're fighting about doctrines not because you're you're cutting people out of communion or you're allowing this one to take communion or you're trying to enforce something but the way I'll know you is because you love one another let's go back to First Corinthians 10. verse 18. behold Israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar what say I then that the idol is anything or that which is offered in sacrifice to Idols is anything but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to God and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils you cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and the table of devils remember what I was saying about them in the wilderness and how they were acting and how Paul here was saying remember the calf and what they did and and their unclean living and sleeping around and drinking and doing all this and you want to bring that to the communion table you're going to eat you're going to be out there living a double life eating and drinking with the world and then you're gonna come in here and eat and drink with the Saints Paul just went through all of these sins complaining idolatry sexual immorality and all the other sins they were committing in the wilderness and he says that you cannot be living a double life if you are coming to this communion table that's the key you can't be living the double life what you are today in this church should be what you are tomorrow Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday you can't be living on a sinful life outside different and then come here and try to be a saint verse number 20 let's skip to Let's skip for time's sake let's skip to verse 31. whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever you do all to the glory of God do you like that scripture I like that one I'm gonna read it again whether therefore ye eat or drink we're going to be doing both tonight or whatever you do do all to the glory of God give none offense he neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles nor to the Church of God even as I please all men in all things not seeking mine own prophet but the prophet of many I seek Paul as saying here it's a little hard to understand Paul is saying here that I'm not seeking this for myself I am preferring you over me is what Paul is saying even as I please all men in all things not seeking my own Prophet but the prophet of many that they may be saved I I have to admit that this first Corinthians chapter 10 I didn't see the significance of the communion table even though it's as obvious as you can be he's talking about the communion and he's saying look at all of these sins that happened out there in the wilderness complaining was a big one immorality was another one and you can't do that and also call yourself a Christian and come to this table how can you eat at the table of devils which is when they built the calf worshiping that and eat the at the table of God which is the table we're going to come to tonight you can't and that's why it's so important for us to examine ourselves to make sure that I'm not just a Sunday Christian then I believe this with all of my heart I want to live this I want to serve God lord I want to do what you want me to do this is a question between you and God between me and God it says let a man examine himself brother Jeremy it doesn't say let brother Daniel examine brother Jeremy it's not what it's saying this is you and God this is each one here and the Lord you are making this decision saying Lord I know as I said as a Young Man Lord I know then I'm not worthy but I also know in my heart that I am a Christian that I do my best to live this gospel to the best that I know how and as I said before as a 27 year old man and as a 51 year old man there's a big difference in my life I was living a good life back then I wasn't I wasn't sinning and doing so many things that the world um does but I wasn't the place where I am now and we always need to be ready and I think that I know that Jesus will soon have another supper let me just talk about it for a minute I just I just think he is going to have a wedding supper he said he says this is the last time he says I'm breaking this he says you're not going to do it with me anymore until I come with my Saints oh I look forward to that day so much when we'll rise up and we'll we'll sit in that table and and uh he's how happy will you be oh man I'm not worthy Lord I'm not worthy enough and I will probably be there saying oh but I've done this and and oh dear God and you know what it says he's gonna do he's gonna wipe those tears away oh he's gonna he's gonna do it we're gonna be in that on that table bro I wanna I just I want to lean across say he eat it he overcame by the we overcame by the blood of the Lamb amen and we are going to be there and that's what this table represents I want everyone in this church to come to this communion table I want everyone that comes on Sunday morning I want everyone in this neighborhood quit your sinning come to this table here's what it represents there's coming a day that we are going to eat this supper with the Lord Jesus Oh Brother Matthew I just want to be there I I just want to be I just want to be in the door and sitting at the table and this is my my seat I made it oh Lord Jesus thank you I wanna I Wanna Be There Let's Make Ready brethren for the communion service let's let's take two or three minutes of quiet meditation to think about what happened that day 2 000 years ago what happened in that last supper what this means this time that we have what it means to you and me ask the Lord in your own way any sin that might be separating you from the Lord Jesus ask him to take it away repent of it I am said this morning that that says in this last stage in Revelation chapter 3 it says be zealous therefore and repent amen the repentance is there too there's so little repentance in the world but as as we get quiet before the Lord and and the brothers get ready let's just take just a couple minutes I think it'd be well worth our time quiet meditation before the Lord foreign Lord we love you First Corinthians chapter 11. verse 23. it's so beautiful the very next chapter the one I just read makes sense for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you take as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world amen Brothers if you come forward for the ordinances sister Martha are you playing or sister Lily could you come this bread and it's broken into little pieces it's it's broken and it's torn and it represents the body of our Lord Jesus as you take this bread remember every piece is different and this bread is not the body we're not Catholic but it represents the body Heavenly Father as I hold this bread knowing Lord that it represents body of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Lord may your anointing be with us as we take this in remembrance of the Lord and Lord may your blessings be upon this bread as we take it and we consume it as was commanded by our Lord and savior Jesus name [Music] it's wine represents the blood of our Lord and savior it has so many times we see that different faiths May take grape juice or they may take water or something else but this wine active it has spirit inside of it God the Lord told us to drink the wine in remembrance of him and to think that this wine that I look on right now [Music] represents it's red and it represents the blood that was shed on the cross that was spilled down his body and went out on the ground the blood of the one man that had never sinned the blood of our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ father [Music] I hold this wine in my hands representing the blood of our savior [Music] Lord as it comes to our lips and we drink Lord May our minds go back to Calvary Lord we do this in obedience to your word to us Jesus Christ's name we pray father may your blessings be upon this wine the ordinances thank you [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas's caring Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh thee to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord thus thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but
