that is so true his faithfulness it's great it's Dependable it never fails that's about the only song as well that I know of that comes from the text of the book of Lamentations it's our immense privilege and Grave responsibility to share with you this time about the book of Lamentations and I apologized to the kids when they came in there was no quiz hand out for them I know the only reason you came was for the quiz so I apologize that I didn't get that ready lamentation what is that it's it's a lament the act of bewailing an audible expression of Sorrow to express grief for or about to mourn to grieve audibly to wail the book of Lamentations is a collection of five poems bewailing the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple it's read aloud in Jewish synagogues the world over on the date called Tesha of Tesa is Hebrew for nine and a is a month so on the ninth month ninth day of the Hebrew month of a they read this text the book of Lamentations that's the date of the destruction of Solomon's temple in 587 or 86 BC and it's the date of the destruction of the second temple in 70 ad0 it's the saddest day in the Jewish calendar this year Tesa baav fell on August 12 and 13 just last week from Sunset August 12th till Darkness on the night of the 13th before we open the sacred book and read from it please join me in prayer to the one who inspired it Lord Jesus we're so grateful that we can be gathered together that we can draw strength from you and from each other Lord Lord this is not a a book of Celebration and rejoicing but as you taught us in Ecclesiastes Lord that there's a time to mourn A Time To Laugh A Time To Dance a time to re born a time to die so Lord we pray that you'd be with us as we approach this book this evening Lord that we can find in it Lord lessons for our life that we can apply in Tucson Arizona in August of the Year 2024 because your word is Everlasting it always applies help us to apply it thank you Lord forgive us Lord where we fall short Lord May no words be spoken tonight that would cause anyone to stumble but Lord May there be something said that would help someone Lord we ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and we thank you for your presence with us amen we sometimes sing songs like Standing on the Promises every promise in the book is mine but we're often careful in choosing which promises we want to claim which rules we wish to obey keeping that in mind for our opening verses and while we're standing and you'll be standing for a couple of minutes it may get slightly uncomfortable but Lamentations is not a comfortable book so while we're standing let's read a couple of short selections from the book of Deuteronomy first consider these instructions about leadership from chapter 17 think of what we learned of King Solomon earlier in this series Deuteronomy 17:14 when thou art come unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee and shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein and shalt say I will set a king over me like as all the nations that are about me Thou shalt in any wise set him King over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose we know that was Saul and then David one from among thy Brethren shalt thou set King over thee that mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy brother and now come specific commands to anyone who would have that position of leadership as a King rule number one he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the people to return to Egypt to the end that he should multiply horses one sorry for as much as the Lord hath said unto you you shall henceforth return no more that way rule number two neither shall he multiply wives to himself that is heart turn not away rule number three neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold he's not to seek wealth and it shall be when sth upon the throne of his kingdom that rule number four he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites and it shall be with him and rule number five he shall read therein all the days of his life read your Bible pray every day isn't just for Christians today it goes all the way back to 1400 BC some of the reasons for these rules are that he may learn to fear the lord his God and to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them that his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren and that he turn not aside from the Commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his descendants in the midst of Israel we know Solomon failed at each one of these and this SED the seeds of division in the Kingdom which occurred as soon as his son rabam took the throne in fact if you think back to the recent lessons that we've had in the book of Hebrews you no doubt realize that in the list of face Heroes of chapter 11 the only King mentioned is David no mention is made of Solomon in fact Solomon is never ever mentioned by Paul or by any other author in the New Testament after the book of Acts well you know the history Israel immediately went into idolatry Judah attempted to blend worship of the Lord with other gods doesn't work turning now to chapter 28 our second of two readings this is about blessings and curses and it's really about conditional promises we read starting at verse one it shall come to pass if thou notice not ye but thou thou was second person singular so this is addressed to the nation as a unit if Thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth so again it's the unity of the group and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God skipping to verse 7even the Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and flee before the seven ways verse nine the Lord shall establish thee and holy people unto himself as he hath sworn unto thee he swore it unto us oh but wait this is a conditional promise of blessing it's by no means unconditional if Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God and walk in his ways and all people of the Earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord and they shall be afraid of thee recall what happened when uh Rahab talked to the spes before they were going to come in they were afraid they'd heard these blessings continue on through verse 14 verse 15 but it shall come to pass here's another conditional promise you have a choice to obey or not if thou Wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all what portion uh the ones you personally approve of uh the ones you have a revelation concerning no the modifier here is all his Commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day that how many all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee again as a nation a unit a long list is given skip skipping now all the way down to verse 49 it's a long list the Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far from the end of the Earth as Swift as the eagle flies a nation whose tongue Thou shalt not understand so not Egypt not of Canaan remember the promises God now makes to the nation as we consider some of the Lamentations that will soon read a nation of fierce countenance which shall not regard the person of the old nor show favor to the young he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of thy land when will he stop until thou be destroyed and also shall not leave thee either grain wine or oil not petroleum olive oil or the increase of thy cattle or flocks of thy sheep until he have destroyed thee until you will not be recognizable as a nation and he shall besiege thee in thy Gates we'll see what that means in Lamentations in all thy Gates until thy high and fenced walls come down wherein thou trust us throughout all thy land and he shall beseech thee in all thy Gates throughout all thy land which the Lord thy God hath given thee these next verses are so hard to read to contemplate the horrors of of these promises but they are indeed among the promises God made with the people through Moses the prophet are you ready verse 53 Thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body the Flesh of thy sons and thy daughters which the Lord thy God hath given thee in The Siege and in the straightness where With Thine enemies shall d distress Thee I don't know if you can imagine such a thing and if that's not Dreadful enough we come to one of the most disconcerting verses I find in this portion of scripture which is verse 63 it shall come to pass that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you and bring you to not and you should be plucked from off the land whether thou goest to possess it the Lord shall scatter thee among all people from one end of the Earth even unto the other and there shalt thou serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even of wood and stone among these nations shalt thou find no ease neither shall the soul of thy foot have rest but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart failing of eyes sor of mind please be seated choices there are consequences to the decisions that we take the actions that we make good and bad the book of Deuteronomy is the fifth book of the Torah written by Moses concluding about 1406 BC it ends just as the nation of Israel is about to cease its wandering its diaspora if you will and enter into the land of promise the book of Lamentations describes the horrors of the final Siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 587 or 586 some 820 years later it is at the time that the last remnants of the nation are about to be expelled from the land of promise and enter a second diaspora and we could simply read the book of Lamentations together and we shall God willing it's a series of five poems four of which are acrostic a total of only4 verses it's shorter than the 119th Psalm I'll find a crostic for you when we take a look at the laments themselves but I think we need some context before we tackle the book and by the way I'll have you here less than two hours how did the nation come to the condition that horrific destruction would be the cup from which they would be forced to drink previously in this series we've covered the section of the Old Testament we call history so you have an idea of the emergence of the monarchy under Saul after the period of the judges the rise of David as the celebrated King the success ession of Solomon and how he set the stage for the destruction of the Kingdom which was thror apart at his death by the actions of his son rabam the trigger dividing the Kingdom of Israel came down to excessive taxation forced upon the People by a tyranical government bent on self-aggrandisement rather than serving its citizens but that was just a symptom that's just a trigger the cause was forsaking the Lord the split happened about 9:30 BC in his mercy God raised up prophets to rebuke and correct and redirect his people and their leaders when they went astray so it's no surprise the prophets come to the Forefront of scripture when the nation of Israel splits into two kingdoms and plunges into idolatry we read in the histories about prophets like Elijah Elisha Mika what we call the oral prophets the ones that didn't leave us any writings in the mid 700s BC the first of the writing prophets appear most of them wrote over a period of years the start and ending of which are somewhat ambigu a few were pretty specific as to the years of their Ministry such as Amos or the start of Isaiah's Ministry but in 723 BC the unthinkable happens the Assyrians brutally conquer the Kingdom of Israel and they don't just conquer Israel they depopulated scattering the people throughout the Assyrian Empire this is shown sort of with the red line there as they're taken away but Baron territory is not good for defense nor does it generate much tax revenue so the Assyrians repopulated the land with settlers and throughout their empire indicated in green this is why we later read of in the northern kingdom Galilee of the Gentiles it was repopulated with Gentiles in 723 BC you'll note the map doesn't show a kingdom of Judah recall when we studied Isaiah a few weeks ago Hezekiah was under siege in Jerusalem the Assyrians under their King sakb had already conquered nearly all of Judah the Lord destroyed The Siege Army at Jerusalem sakra returned home and was subsequently killed by two of his sons but while Israel was depopulated Judah became a tributary of Assyria a tributary doesn't exactly mean a stream feeding a river but it's the same idea it means that Judah paid tribute taxes Ransom extortion to Assyria it's a very critical time for Judah the temple meanwhile had fallen into neglect priests had failed for a long time to proclaim the law and in general to do their duties King Josiah who reigned in Judah some 60 years after Assyria conquered Israel orders the temple to be repaired in the rubble inside the temple that is being cleaned and fixed a bit like our church is undergoing Renovations now an ancient scroll is found it's part of perhaps all of the Books of Moses the Torah it's brought to King Josiah look what we found in the rubble in the temple and it's read before him I'm sure it included portions of Deuteronomy that we read at our opening this morning this evening Josiah is a gast falls on his face in anguish and repentance calls for the nation to return to the Lord he sets the example and there is a Revival unfortunately the Revival is shortlived apparently it's superficial for most folks after all this 2 Chronicles 35:20 when Josiah had prepared the temple this is now 609 BC Neo which means lame we don't know which Pharaoh it is Neo king of Egypt came to fight against that means near or in the vicinity of kemes by Euphrates and Josiah went out to be battle against Neo but Neo sent ambassadors to Josiah saying what have I to do with thee that king of Judah I come not to battle against thee this day but against the house wherewith I have War for God commanded me to make haste forbear thee from meddling with God who is with me that he destroy thee not nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from Neo and the Egyptian Army he hearkened not unto the words of Neo from from the mouth of God and Josiah came to fight in the valley of megiddo perhaps Josiah assumed that since there was a prophet in the land Jeremiah he'd be the one that God would speak through to tell Josiah what he should or shouldn't do how could the Egyptian pharaoh a heathen possibly be speaking the word of God there's a point here we can take home we must always be careful that we don't miss God when he chooses to inform us through a source we might not normally trust or respect we shouldn't limit God Josiah is killed in battle jeho Kim becomes king shortly thereafter Judah fall falls back into idolatry having conquered ass Syria the Babylonian Army comes to Judah it's now 605 BC the first three sieges of Jerusalem by Babylon jeho Kim surrenders to the Babylonians and and a small group of captives are taken to Babylon what does this Mark the beginning of what we call the Babylonian captivity and it starts a timer that Jeremiah spoke of of a 70-year period after which Babylon would be judged we read in Daniel the first chapter first verse this occurred in the third year of the reign of jeim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it besieged means you surround it you cut it off from all transportation from all Food Supplies from everything you isolate and the lord gave jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand he surrendered with part of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of Shar to the house of his God and he brought the vessels into the Treasure House of his God and the King spoke unto ashpenaz the master of his unic that he should bring certain of the children of Israel this young men not kids and of the king's seed and of the princes children in whom was no blemish but well favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning and knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's Palace and whom they might teach the learning and tongue of the Cal Deans recall the warning in Deuteronomy about being conquered swiftly by a nation from afar whose tongue they did not understand skipping to verse six among these were the children of Judah Daniel haniah mishel and Azariah this Begins the conquest of Judah by Babylon in the initial carrying into captivity starting that 70-year period that I just mentioned but time goes on what happens in 598 BC jeim left on the throne as a puppet King Rebels against the Babylonians he's killed jeho his son takes the throne for about a 100 days Nebuchadnezzar again besieges Jerusalem carries away jeim and his wives and children to Babylon along with the Mighty Men the Bible tells us the Craftsmen the workers of metal the extended royal family a total the Bible tells us of some 10,000 captives he raids the temple he leads the Bible says and I quote the poorest sort of people of the land he installs zedekiah as his puppet king of Judah about 10 years pass and zedekiah warned by Jeremiah don't do this he ignores the prophet and he Rebels against Babylonia he's got some other prophets that tell them oh you're you're going to do this we're the Lord's people these Heathen Nebuchadnezzar besieges Jerusalem for the third time when the city Falls it is raided of all its remaining wealth and completely destroyed the temple is completely destroyed the ruins are set on fire zedekiah is removed from the throne and Gentile Governor Galia is installed what God had promised in Deuteronomy 28 and 1406 BC began with the Exile of Israel in 723 BC is completed with the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 587 BC okay we'll stop the history lesson I wanted to give you context about why there is this terrible tragedy there'll be more to cover as we go into other books of the Bible as we continue this series but I wanted you to have an overview of how we came to the destruction of Jerusalem from our opening verses in Deuteronomy why it was ultimately destroyed I think that this context is so important to understand as we prepare to read Lamentations let's take a look at writing style and Define acrostic acrostic poetry I I I said i' do that I should probably follow through have you ever wondered why the 119th Psalm shows the first Hebrew letter Alf as a label even in an English language Bible translation or or why at verse 9 it shows the second Hebrew letter or at least declares the label Beth all 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet are listed in Psalm 119 in their proper order each letter is followed by an eight verse section each section is like a mini Psalm self-contained able to stand alone all of the eight verse sections of this Psalm begin with the Hebrew Alphabet letter that declares the section notice the first eight verses all begin with the same Hebrew letter Alf I don't expect you to know the Hebrew alphabet so I've highlighted the first letter and yellow remember Hebrew reads from right to left so you can see the one you can see the English on on the one side the Hebrew and the other but olive the second verse Olive third verse Olive all the way down the word that is chosen begins with that same letter for eight verses then at the ninth verse the second group of eight you get the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet bet and all eight verses of that section of the Psalms begin with the letter bet and then gimal do avov and so forth down through the entire Hebrew alphabet for the kids here's the alphabet on the one side the one you might recognize and on the other side the one you might not the Hebrew alphabet the first two letters are alfet alfet alphabet so that's the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet the 26 letters of our English alphabet so it goes alfabet gimal on down to the final letter Tav just like ours goes a b CDE e down to Z well this method of poetic writing leading with the alphabetic sequence is known as acrostic requires Great skill to write this way I I don't possess that skill Psalm 119 is a very intricate example of the form but it occurs in simpler ways in several of the Psalms sadly when translating from Hebrew to another language like English or Spanish this sort of structure is lost the only way to appreciate it is to learn the original language okay brother Lyall so what why are you bringing this up that's the 119th Psalm Lamentations is mostly acrostic four of the five chapters are acrostic chapters one two and four we might call Simple acrostic each of the 22 verses begins with the succeeding letter of the Hebrew alphabet so verse one starts with olive verse two with bet and so on to verse 22 with t let's quickly look don't try and read the Hebrew so we see the first 11 so it's ol of bet gimmel do I want to call that VAV but in modern Hebrew it's VAV in Biblical Hebrew it's w Zion [Music] T Shin Tav it's the 22 letters and that's how that Lamentations is written chapter 2 is also a simple acrostic written the same way chapter three has 66 verses three times 22 so as you may have guessed like Psalm 119 the first three verses begin with the Hebrew letter Olive the next three the Hebrew letter bet and so forth till you get to the final three verses beginning with the Hebrew letter T chapter four returns to the simple acrostic in chapter five though it also contains 22 verses it's not a crostic my personal Theory don't hold me to it's just my idea about chapter five is that the writer is so overcome with grief and pain that he can no longer contain the expression in this form and you'll notice that not only are the verses in chapter 5 not acostic each is very short it's like he is just out of of Tears he's out of words he's out of energy one final stylistic note the first word in the first verse of the first chapter is the Hebrew word that's the Hebrew name of what we call the book of Lamentations they just call Ita is the Hebrew word that means how how did this happen how did we come to this how moving on the authorship of Lamentations is unknown some traditions ascribe it to Jeremiah but even the most ancient Hebrew texts the Dead Sea Scrolls for example which contain the first portion of the book of Lamentations they don't indicate that however the Septuagint an early translation of Hebrew into Greek claims Jeremiah wrote it if we strip away all the Traditions about how it came to be the earliest copy of the septu we have is from a monastery copied in the 4th Century ad in English translation it reads and it came to pass after Israel was taken captive and Jerusalem made desolate that Jeremiah sat weeping and lamented with this lamentation over Jerusalem and said how does the city that was filled with people sit solitary she's become as a widow she that was magnified among the Nations and princesses among the provinces has become tributary I've highlighted the prepended commentary text on this screen and yellow again this statement of Jeremiah's authorship is not in any Hebrew text it was added by someone along the way okay brother while enough about historical context literary style speculation about who wrote Lamentations we know who inspired it so let's read it I'm going to read from the new King James translation you can follow in the regular King James if you wish the N kgv is primarily replacing some archaic words and in some cases using some line formatting or capitalization to suggest poetic intent Lamentations chapter 1 Jerusalem is portrayed as a grieving Widow how lonely sits the City Jerusalem that was full of people how like a widow is she who who is great among the Nations the princess among the provinces has become a slave she weeps bitterly in the night her tears are on her cheeks among all her lovers she has none to comfort her all her friends have have dealt treacherously with her they have become her enemies Judah has gone into captivity under Affliction and hard servitude she dwells among the Nations now nations in the Bible means peoples Gentiles heathens it doesn't mean political entities like the United States or Mexico or something with borders that are internationally recognized that's not what nation means she finds no rest all her persecutors overtake her in her Dire Straits the roads to Zion another name for Jerusalem the roads to Zion mourn because no one comes to the set feasts all her gates are desolate her priests sigh her virgins her young women are afflicted she's in bitterness her adversaries have become the master her enemies Prosper for the Lord has afflicted at her because of the multitude of her transgressions the lament recognizes the root cause of the horrors now being reported her children have gone into captivity before the enemy and from the daughter of Zion all her Splendor has departed her princes have become like deer that find no pasture that flee without strength before the pursuer and the days of her Affliction in roaming Jerusalem remembers all her Pleasant things she had in days of old when her people fell into the hand of the enemy with no one to help her the adversar saw her and mocked at her downfall Jerusalem has sinned Gravely therefore she has become vile all who honored her despise her because they have seen her nakedness yes she eyes turns away her uncleanness is in her skirts she did not consider her Destiny therefore her collapse was awesome a spectacle she had no comforter oh Lord behold my Affliction for the enemy is exalted the adversary has spread his hand over all her Pleasant things for she has seen the Nations the Heathen enter her Sanctuary those whom you commanded not to enter your assembly all her people sigh they seek bread they have given their valuables for food to restore life see oh Lord and consider for I am scorned is it nothing to you all who pass by behold and see if there's any sorrow like my sorrow which has been brought on me which not the armies of Babylon but which the Lord has has inflicted in the days of his Fierce Anger from above he has sent fire into my bones and it overpowered them he spread a net for my feet and turned me back he's made me desolate and faint all the day the Yoke of my transgressions was bound they were woven together by his hands and thrust upon my neck he made my strength fail the Lord delivered me into the hands of those whom I am not able to withstand the Lord has trampled underfoot all my mighty men in my midst he is called an assembly against me to crush my young men the Lord trampled as in a wine press the virgin daughter of Judah for these things I weep my eye my eye overflows with water because the comforter who should restore my life is far from me my children are desol it because the enemy prevails Zion spreads out her hands but no one Comforts her the Lord has commanded concerning Jacob that those around him become his adversaries Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them in the midst of all this upon reflection she realizes she recognizes the Lord is

compare with you that I may comfort you oh virgin Daughter of Zion for your ruin is spread wide as the sea who can heal you your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive Visions they have not uncovered your iniquity to bring back your captives but have envisioned for you false prophecies and delusions The Observer gathers himself all who pass by clap their hands at you they they hiss and shake their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem is this the city that is called the Perfection of beauty the joy of the whole earth all your enemies have opened their mouth against you they hiss and Nash their teeth they say we have swallowed her up surely this is the day we have waited for we have found it we have seen it the Lord has done what he purposed he has fulfilled his word which he commanded in days of old he is thrown down and has not pied and he has caused an enemy to Rejoice over you he has exalted the Horn of your adversaries their heart cried out to the Lord oh wall of the daughter of Zion let tears run down like a river day and night give yourself no relief give your eyes no rest arise cry out in the night at the beginning of the watches pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord lift your hands toward him for the life of your young children who faint from Hunger at the head of every street see oh Lord consider to whom have you done this should the women eat their offspring the children they have cuddled should the priest and Prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord young and old lie on the ground in the streets My Virgins and my young men have fallen By The Sword you have slain them in the day of your anger you have slaughtered and not pied you have invited us as to a feast day the Terrors that surround me and the day of the Lord's anger there was no Refugee or Survivor Those whom I have borne and brought up my enemies have destroyed the third lament is at once horrible and hopeful verses 21- 58 in particular Express hope faith and trust in the midst of Affliction it reminds us of job though God slay me yet will I trust him the he in this lament section is the Lord as if the author is telling his lament to a third party I am the man who has seen Affliction by the rod of his wrath he has led me and made me walk in darkness and not in light surely he has turned his hand against me time and time again throughout the day he has aged My Flesh and my skin and broken my bones he has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and woe he has set me in dark places like the dead of long ago he has hedged me in so that I cannot get out he's made my chain heavy even when I cry and Shout he shuts out my prayer he has blocked my ways with HED Stone he has made my paths crooked he has been to me a bear lying in weight like a lion in Ambush he has turned away away my ways and torn Me In Pieces he has made me desolate he has bent his bow and set me up as a target for the arrow he has caused the arrows of his quiver to pierce my loins I have become the ridicule of all my people their taunting song all the day he has filled me with bitterness he has made me drink warmwood he has broken my teeth with gravel covered me with ashes you the author now switches from third person and addresses the Lord in the second person you have moved my soul far from peace I have forgotten prosperity and I said my strength and My Hope have perished from the Lord remember my Affliction in roaming the wormwood and the g my soul still remembers and sinks within me and in the midst of this affliction this I recall to my mind therefore I have hope through the Lord's mercies we the author now speaking as a group that he is a part of we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is your faithfulness the Lord is my portion says my soul therefore I hope in him the Lord is good to those who wait for him to the Soul who seeks him it is good that one should hope and wait quietly for the Salvation of the Lord it is good for a man to Bear the Yoke in his youth let him sit alone and keep silent because God has laid it on him let him put his mouth in the dust there may yet be hope let him give his cheek to the one who strikes him be full of reproach for the Lord will not cast off forever though he causes grief yet he will show compassion according to the multitude of his mercies he does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men to crush under one's feet all the prisoners of the earth to turn aside the Justice do a man before the face of the most high or subvert a man in his cause the Lord does not approve who is he who speaks and it comes to pass when the Lord has not commanded it is it not from the mouth of the most high that woe and well-being proceed why should a living man complain a man for the punishment of his sins let us search out and examine our ways Psalm 51 and turn back to the Lord let us lift our hearts and hands to the God in heaven we have transgressed and rebelled the author again appeals directly to God you have not pardoned you'll have covered yourself with anger and pursued us you'll have slain and not pied you'll have covered yourself with a cloud that prayer should not pass through you'll have made us an offscouring and refu in the midst of the peoples all our enemies have opened their mouths against us fear and a snare have come upon us desolation and destruction my eyes overflow with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people my eyes flow and do not cease without interruption till the Lord From Heaven looks down and sees my eyes bring suffering to my soul because of all the daughters of my city my enemies without cause Hunted Me Down Like a Bird they silenced my life in the pit and threw stones at me the waters flowed over my head I said I am cut off I called on your name oh Lord from the lowest pit you have heard my voice do not hide your ear from my sighing from My Cry for Help you drew near on the day I called on you and said do not fear oh Lord you have pleaded the case for my soul you have redeemed my life oh Lord you have seen how I am wronged judge my case you have seen all their Vengeance all their schemes against me you have heard their reproach oh Lord all their schemes against me the lips of my enemies and their Whispering against me all the day look at their sitting down and their rising up I am their taunting song repay them oh Lord according to the work of their hands give them a veiled heart your curse be upon them and your anger pursue and Destroy them from under the heavens of the Lord the fourth lamentation how the gold has become dim how changed the fine gold the stones of the sanctuary are scattered at the head of every street the precious sons of Zion valuable as fine gold how they are regarded as clay pots the work of the hands of the Potter even the jackals present their breasts to nurse their young but the daughter of my people is cruel like ostriches in the wilderness the tongue of the infant clings to the roof of its mouth for thirst the young children ask for bread but no one breaks it for them those who ate Delicacies are desolate in the streets those who were brought up in Scarlet Embrace Ash heeps the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom which was overthrown in a moment with no hand to help her her nazarites this this means princes separated ones her princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk they were more ready in body than rubies like sapphire in their appearance now their appearances blacker than suot they go unrecognized in the streets their skin clings to their bones it has become as dry as wood those slain By The Sword are better off than those who die of hunger for these pine away stricken for lack of the fruits of the field the hands of the compassionate women have cooked their own children they became food for them and the destruction of the daughter of my people the Lord has fulfilled his Fury he has poured out his Fierce anger he kindled a fire in Zion and it has devoured its foundations the kings of the Earth all inhabitants of the world would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy could enter the Gates of Jerusalem because of the sins of her prophets those are false prophets and the iniquities of her priests who shed in their midst the blood of the just they wandered blind in the streets they have defiled themselves with blood so that no one would touch their garments they cried out to them go away unclean go away go away do not touch us when they fled and wandered those among the Nations said they shall no longer dwell here the face of the Lord scattered them he no longer regards them the people do not respect the priests nor show favor to the elders still our eyes failed us watching vainly for our help and our watching we watched for a nation that could not save us they tracked our steps so that we could not walk in our streets our end was near our days were over for our end had come our pursuers were swifter than the Eagles of the heavens recall Deuteronomy 28 they pursued us on the mountains and lay in wait for us in the wilderness the breath of our nostrils the anointed of the Lord was caught in their pits of whom we said under his shadow we shall live among the Nations rejoice and be glad oh daughter of Edom you who dwell in the land of O the cup shall also pass over to you and you shall become drunk and make yourself naked the punishment of your iniquity is accomplished oh Daughter of Zion he will no longer send you into captivity he will punish your iniquity oh daughter of Edom he will uncover your sins and the final lamentation Lamentations five not acrostic verses are short the lament is is drained remember oh Lord what has come upon us look and behold our reproach our inheritance has been turned over to aliens and our houses to foreigners we have become orphans and wfes our mothers are like widows we pay for the water we drink our wood comes at a price they pursue at our heels we labor and have no rest we have given our hand to the Egyptians and the Assyrians to be satisfied with bread our fathers sinned in are no more but we bear their iniquities servants rule over us there is none to Deliver Us from their hand we get our bread at the risk of Our Lives because of the sword in the wilderness our skin is hot as an oven because of the fever of famine they ravished the women in Zion the maidens in the cities of Judah princes were hung up by their hands Elders were not respected young men grounded the millstones boys staggered under loads of wood the elders have ceased gathering at the gate the young men from their music The Joy of our heart has ceased our dance has turned into mourning the crown has fallen from our head woe to us for we have sinned because of this our heart is faint because of these things our eyes grow dim because of Mount Zion which is desolate with foxes walking about on it you oh Lord remain forever your throne from generation to generation why do you forget us forever and forsake us for so long a time turn us back to you Lord and we will be restored renew our days as of old unless you have utterly rejected us and are very angry with us the musicians would please come Lamentations is such a difficult book to read despair horror extended suffering and death is the opening chapter of a saga that stretched for centuries then Millennia a punishment for sin after constant patience appeal for repentance and Reconciliation the obvious lesson here is that we should seek the Lord follow his will keep his Commandments not to avoid the penalty but from a heart that loves him when I read this book to prepare for tonight I could not help but think of another time in the environs of Jerusalem of some 600 years later another lament if you will Luke 22:41 and Jesus was withdrawn from his disciples about a stone's cast and he kneeled down among the olive trees and the Garden of Gethsemane overlooking the kidan valley where the blood from the sacrifices flowed and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from Heaven strengthening him and being in an Agony Jesus prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow to me Lamentations is a reflection of what was to come a shadow if you will another great suffering for sin but this time it was Christ the sinless suffering for me The Sinner only this time it would be the atonement for each and all of us and unlike the lamenter crying out for vengeance to the ones the Lord used to punish them Jesus prayed father forgive them and taught us to love our enemies and do good to them let's close this portion of the service and worship to the one who suffered the punishment we deserved who paid the price for our sins Here I Am to Worship light of the
