times she would tell me play with me but don't play the soprano play the tenor I like that one better I appreciated her very much and I'd like to sing two songs today that I heard her sing the first one being Zion's Hill there waits for me I'll glad tomorrow we are all talking and saying what is she doing today she's greeting everybody and probably telling brother green are you still doing that you know I remember her sin May Brown work we're Pharrell's back and I'd watch her and brother green would start going and she would do this so I cut it now but that's okay on the other side it'll be

right it was really good and just a lot of fun I tell you I really appreciate the fellowship that I got with the brothers um just it's just a good spirit a lot of fun good people good good Fellowship I um I wanted to talk this morning about Father's Day and about dads and um what's going on in the world today there's there's a definite agenda in the world and it's and we see here in the United States that it's really it's a liberal agenda that it's it's trying to remove the parents from the family and and make these kids have them have the state have the government make the decisions in raising them and and it's you see that our boys are taught in school that they're privileged and and they should they should give way to to the less qualified or or they should always take a back seat and they should lose in everything that they do and it's it's being taught in our schools it's being taught in our even in certain congregations it's it's just being taught in the culture of America and what it's doing is it's producing a generation of males of young men who are confused they're ambivalent they're uncertain about things they lack self-esteem and they just simply don't care and we see it we see it on the streets we see everywhere we see all of these strung out many of these young men homeless on drugs and if you've been on this Earth very long you can see it's never been like this in the history of this country and they're everywhere and they're being taught young men you don't have to work you don't have to earn a living for your family you don't have to be a man in life you just sit back let the government support you or let somebody else support you and just do whatever you want and other people should should be doing all of all of the the work and Society are making all the money but but you don't have to do anything just sit back and and be really be a coward and that's what that's what this generation is being taught they're being taught it everywhere being taught on television they're being taught this in the schools they're being taught by their culture that's forming in our society and you see there are a few men that will stand up against the establishment and look what happens to them when there's a man named Tucker Carlson many of you know him very popular newscaster stood up Against The Establishment got fired for it now I don't know I don't know if he's a Christian I don't know much about his personal life but I do know that that man is a man he's somebody that will stand up and the reason that he is hated is because he doesn't cave to the establishment is because he is willing to speak what he thinks is the truth and he does speak the truth he's a good man you see that that there's there's other people in society that this isn't a political speech by the way I'm not I'm not up here trying to to root for conservatives or root for for liberals but I am saying it's it's what is in our world today we see Donald Trump everybody knows Donald Trump I'm not a fan of Donald Trump I don't like the way he does things he uh he checks a few of the boxes in in second Timothy 3 that says that for men shall be lovers of their own selves comforters boasters proud blasphemers incontinent and fierce he does check a few of those boxes but he's a man and one thing I do appreciate about him is he is willing to stand up for what he thinks is right and looks what look what's happened to him recently he's been arrested on these Petty charges that really there are things that all of the presidents have done and yet they single him out why because he stands up against the establishment he's a real man that doesn't as I said I'm not advocating for him but I do appreciate that he's willing to make a stand he's the thing about that man that they hate the most is he believes in Freedom and he's willing to do whatever it takes to have this freedom and we see that that is what is happening in this country they are trying to take away the freedom of the people and people won't stand they won't stand up for it they won't they won't make a stand for what is right they tell us to wear these ridiculous masks all the time you know and I know that covert was here but they they they present this thing as as a fear tactic and they take they use it to take away our freedoms so much so that you can't go outside of your house you can't go to work they make you inject some chemicals you don't know what it is and force you to do it or you get fired or you get kicked out if you're a police police officer or you get kicked out of the military there's a couple families in here represented by that forcing them to do this and they do it with fear and what a masterful plan that Satan has engineered he killed millions of people with this incredibly contagious disease and he made the disease weak enough that most people just experience minor symptoms but it left a fear in the world and people gave up their rights as I said they gave up their rights for their health care they gave up their rights to to go to work they gave up their rights to even worship freely in church and I and as I said that people were kicked out of the military they were they were kicked out of the police department and then we see even pastors not willing to make a stand so afraid of this disease and I wonder I wonder how many Souls were lost because of this this pandemic versus how many lives were lost we went into this thing in in one sense and then we come out and we are a totally different country coming out and we have all these laws and regulations and the churches are about half of what they used to be because the people got used to staying home not wanting to go to church not not coming in exactly what the devil's plan was he was a master in what he did and he brought the people away from church and now they got into the bad habits and they don't want to come in and then there's a few pastors that we see out there that stood up against the establishment especially in Canada they came down harder on the people in Canada than they did here we have that those Pastors in Canada they were willing to be arrested for not preventing the people from coming together in worship and they they did get arrested for it went to jail for it and we think we live in a free society and look what's happened it's a scary thing there's a man that as I was as I was researching some of this a couple months ago there was a Canadian Pastor in Calgary called Derek reamer brimer he protested drag queen Story Hour for children in the public library he protested it he went out and said it is wrong for these perverts to be reading stories to our children dressed in the way that they were dressed dressed up like women he made a stand and he was arrested for it they they couldn't figure out being on public property they couldn't figure out something to charge him with so they charged him with hate crimes against the LGBT community because he protested how ridiculous but that's the world that we live in they're against they're against the police officers they're against anything that anything that is good but don't challenge let them protest all they want let them protest masculinity let them protest the American man let them protest hard work let them protest these things but if you try to protest against that filth that they're shoving down our throats you're going to be arrested for it and we live in a free country huh our freedoms are quickly leaving friends and like I said this isn't some political speech I'm just saying this is what's going on around us it was prophesied to happen and now we're seeing it it shouldn't be a surprise and I think it's the same in the ministry you know we look at the churches and we see that that so often the pulpit is controlled by the status quo it's controlled by the establishment you're only permitted to preach certain things and you have to preach it this way or they'll come against you the people will come against you they'll start murmuring among themselves and they're they'll come to you and they'll say well if you don't preach it like this then we're just going to leave oh we're gonna we're gonna take our as brother Brandon said we're gonna give me my uh letter and I'll just take it to another church as the denomination say and we see it so plainly today in the churches that there is no boldness from the pulpit to preach what is right even if it disagrees with the status quo second Timothy chapter 4 says this this is Paul instructing his Protege Timothy he says preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and Doctrine for the time will come well they will not endure sound Doctrine the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lusts after their own desires this is not taught this is talking about the congregations of the world the Christianity of the world after their own desires they will Heap for themselves teachers so they're going to put these teachers up there and these people are having itching ears because they're going to put up the ones they're gonna they want to hear a certain thing and if they don't hear that thing then they get offended and they have they have problems with it and we see that very scripture fulfilled today and then it says and they shall turn their away their ears from the truth and be turned to Fables believing things that aren't real we see that very scripture again fulfilled in this day it's the same I'll say it the the so-called message that we believe that that so often presented to us is so far off of what the prophet spoke that it doesn't even resemble it many in many places it's the truth and we see the world the same way this country this United States it's gotten so far off of what our founding fathers what they intended that it doesn't even resemble the United States they they would come here and they would be like what are you talking about we set this constitution in order and this is what you've done with it and the biggest enemy this is the devil's agenda everywhere and the biggest enemy of the devil's agenda today both in society and in church is the American father he is the most he is the biggest adversary and the devil can in the devil getting his agenda across he is the biggest adversary that he's faced and that's why you see it in the government that's why you see it in communities that's why you see that attack on parenting and fatherhood is because the enemy knows you get that Dad out of the way and I got it I found I think about how it's the demasculinization of the American man make him weak make him a coward make him afraid to stand up for for what's right and that's what we see we see it everywhere everybody's apologizing oh I'm sorry for for being a Christian I'm sorry for I'm sorry for for standing against something that the Bible teaches against if the Bible teaches against it why can we not stand for it I look at I think about Caleb 80 years I think about Caleb at 80 years old Caleb and Joshua they went over Jordan Caleb is an old man they're there for a while and there's this mountain that Caleb knew was his inheritance that God had given him he sees this mountain it's full of giants it's full of Warriors 80 year old man he goes to Joshua he says oh that's my mountain he says I'm a better man now at 80 years old than I was 40 years ago he says I'll go take it and you know what he did he was a man you look at Noah Noah and the Ark there's all the filth that was in the world Noah found Grace in the eyes of Lord he stood up against it and he said I'm gonna build this Ark no matter how bad that they made fun of him and all all that they did against him and Noah stood firm on on God's leading and his family was the only one saved in the entire world was Noah because that Daddy stood for what was right but how do you do it Romans 8 31 says this what shall we what shall then we say to these things and then he says this if God be with us if God before us who can be against us we look at these Servants of the Lord and he is still God but he's waiting for somebody that will stand up and have some courage to go against these things I was watching this video the other day of I like watching Wildlife I enjoyed um God's creation and I saw that they had on the video that there was this lioness I think it is one or two lionesses and there was all of these hyenas and they were surrounded there's like 50 of them and they were surrounding this lioness and they would run up and they'd bite her and she'd turn around she'd take a swipe at them and then another one coming bite her and here they are they're about to kill this this female lion biting her a little bit and they were just trying to get into the soft spot and the belly so they could so they could rip and disembowel her and and she's sitting there and she's growling and she's fighting she's doing everything she can and then something happened on the video they panned and here it comes out of the bushes you see the big male lion and man his eyes were set you talk about scary eyes you look at a male lion he was running and he was focused and here comes Mufasa out of the out of the uh did I do it again Amos I did sorry here he comes out of the woods Amos gets on me for quoting some things that I shouldn't sometimes but Here Comes This lion out of the bushes and he makes a beeline and he knew exactly which one to go after with all these hyenas running everywhere like scared rabbits now he comes out and he hits full blast after burner's on he's going and they had slow motion here he is and he picks out one hyena and that hyena was what's called The Matriarch she was the leader of the whole group and he's running after her and and she's she's cooking as fast as she can go because she knows that those teeth are big behind her and here he comes and and they have it in slow motion and he reaches out with his claw and just with the tip of his claw he gr Just Clips her back leg and she turns around he has her she turns around he opens his mouth and crunch right on top of her head and Jezebel was dead man right there that was it that was over the attack on his family was finished and I think about that lion and I think about the courage that he had to go right into that and I said Lord where is that courage today among our brother where is it it's in the Holy Spirit is where it's at as I said the the person that is in the sights of Satan today is Dad he's going after him in every way that he can I found some stats on a website called nickcady.org he's a Christian blogger I wanted to share some of these these stats with you because I I think that they'll make you think about how important dad is in the family Father's Day is the lowest attended church day of the year wow Mother's Day is the third highest attended church day of the year next to Easter and Christmas this uh this guy says this this guy's name was on this website I found this they quoted this guy Scott McConnell of Life LifeWay research he says clearly mothers want to be present for the at present for the affirmation that is typically offered in most churches but families also are present knowing their attendance will be will honor their mother the attendance different difference between Mother's Day and Father's Day is telling either churches are less effective in affirming fathers or family believe families Believe Christian fathers don't value their participation in worship services that's where the American father is today for new converts a survey found that if a child is the first person in a household to become a Christian there is a 3.5 percent probability everyone else in the household will father follow 3.5 percent three and a half out of a hundred If the child becomes a Christian first if the mother is the first to become a Christian there is a 17 percent probability that everyone else in the household will follow follow however when the father is the first there is a 93 probability that everyone in the household will follow wow look at how important a father is a father who regularly attends church even if the mother does not 66 percent of the children will attend church when they become adults when both parents attorney when both parents attend church 75 percent of children will become regular worshipers 63 percent of suicides come from a father fatherless home 71 percent of high school dropouts come from fatherless homes 75 percent of youths in chemical abuse centers come from fatherless homes 80 percent of rapists come from fatherless homes 85 percent of Youth in prison come from fatherless homes 85 percent of children with behavioral disorders come from fatherless homes and 90 of homeless and runaway children come from fatherless homes why does the devil brother Dan why is the devil hate dad so much because of their influence and we look at the direction of the world we see that that Society is constantly mocking manhood and fatherhood we had a men's meeting the other day and I believe it was the Lord's will that we had it we had a good conversation it it blessed me in doing that and and I want to see this continue with the brothers in this church because the horsepower Mufasa the lion is powerful dad has Authority dad can do it and I want to see these brothers get some things done Brothers in this church I don't want a group of men that just comes together and talks about it I want to see action and we've got it we can do it but Andy we've got it brother we've we've got the brothers that that have the they they have the history they have the um ability now we just gotta move forward and do it when God was walking through the Garden of Eden and his children had fallen into sin he God knew what had happened he was God he knows everything and here he is walking through he didn't say Eve where are you he didn't say serpent where are you he said Adam where are you you are the head of your house what has happened here the accountability Came Upon dad dad needs to create an atmosphere around him we need to put the word first in our families and if we hear dad and he's he's the family is sitting around the supper table or in the living room and they're talking and they're putting people down they're gossiping about each other they're they're saying negative things and negative thoughts are coming out in the family's home in 20 years our children are going to be doing the same thing talking about the same stuff as we were because the the children learn from the adults they learn from what we say both fathers and mothers and then they will turn in to whatever we were unless that cycle breaks I want to share a scripture that meant a lot to me a few years ago because I didn't understand it let's turn to Exodus chapter 34. we'll start with verse six Exodus 34 yeah 6. now this is what happened Moses was up on the mountain he had broken the first tablets of stone he got angry and then God gives him God prepares another um tablet a set of tablets of stone for the Ten Commandments and he says here take these and that so that's the situation we have Moses up on the mountain and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and Truth keeping mercies for thousands for giving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children unto the third and fourth generation and Moses made haste and bowed his head toward the Earth and worshiped and he said if now I have found Grace in thy sight O Lord let let my Lord I pray thee go Among Us for it is a stiff-neck people and pardon our iniquity in our sin and take us for thine inheritance he said visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children unto the third and fourth generation so I didn't understand that scripture and I remember praying about that Lord that's not fair I don't I wasn't arguing with the Lord but I didn't feel that that was fair that if my father was a sinner then how come I have to suffer for that didn't make sense to me really bothered me and I was looking at it one day and I was reading that and for some reason I flipped in my Bible over to Exodus I mean over to Ezekiel chapter 18. oh different generation here listen to this Ezekiel chapter 18 verse 18. as for his father because he cruelly oppressed spoiled his brother by violence and did that which is not good among his people Lo even he shall die in his iniquity and yet say ye why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father when the son hath done that which is lawful and right and hath kept all my statutes and had done them he shall surely live seems like a contradiction we have Ezekiel we have somebody asking him and says here doth not the son by the iniquity of the father had to be referring back to the scripture that I just said and it says that in Deuteronomy and other places in Exodus it says it often and then over here Ezekiel says no the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father look at that I will visit the iniquity Moses said of the fathers upon the children and Ezekiel saying the sun shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteous of the righteous shall be upon him the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wicked of the wicked and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him but if the wicked will turn away from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live and not die so what's the answer I think the answer is very very plain so here we have God saying I will visit the iniquities of the fathers upon the children and here's the prophet Ezekiel saying God won't make the children bear those iniquities of the fathers so what's going on here is when these young men and young ladies when they're when they're at home and they see the parents setting an example they see that they think that that's the normal way to do things and then they go and do the same sins as the fathers do and then they answer for that sin that they committed exactly as Ezekiel said here it's not con it's not confusing the two the scripture it's saying Ezekiel saying no he's saying if you sin you'll answer for that sin but if your father sins and you don't sin you're not going to answer for it so when we teach our children and we set that example before them it influences them now there is a way of course out of this do you want your kids to go to church go to church do you want your kid to read their Bible read your Bible do you want your kids to listen to tapes listen to tapes do you want your kids to like fishing go fishing you want your kids to like sports put them in sports take them to ball games do you want your kids to be gossipers and problems in the church then you'd be a gossiper and a problem in the church that's the best influence that you have that's the influence that they grow up with and many times they most of the time they will do what the parents do and then we have this continuing cycle my first as I've said my first memory as a baby was watching those reel-to-reel tapes go around and hearing brother William Branham preacher and listening to that over the years it was an important thing to my family that the kids they did that now we didn't have Bible studies that like I do with my kids we didn't have our devotions that I do with my kids but we did have that and it made an impression on me so much so that those that message is just part of me and I love it so much what if my dad and all the mistakes that he made and and all the the things that that that he did that he would probably would like to do different but what if he didn't do that what if he would have been a Dallas Cowboys fan and instead of worshiping on Sunday it was ball games I don't have anything against ball games but when you're replacing the Lord's Day and you're replacing it with something of the world what's going to be important to our kids what's going to be the most where what are they going to end up doing they're probably going to end up doing the same thing that they grew up with that's why friends that's why the new birth is so important that's why receiving this Same Spirit that when Christ was here and the way that he acted and the things that he did it's so important that God made a way to take that spirit that was on Jesus Christ and he said you can have it in your own life in your own body so then whatever you learned when you were young whatever bad habits you learned whatever it was it breaks that tradition it breaks that that way and it changes that person that's why we teach it in church it is the most important thing that you will hear from this pulpit is that you receive the Holy Spirit you receive that new birth Romans chapter 6. says this verse 5. if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death speaking of Christ we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that old man is the previous Daniel Evans the previous one that I learned all of these bad habits from parents or friends or whatever it is that previous Man is dead crucified on the cross like Christ was that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead in Christ we believe that we shall also live with him that's why baptism is important we talk about baptism in in I mean pretty much all of Christian ranks it's because it represents something when when you get up in the pool and and the the minister baptizes you it represents going down into the grave and coming up a new person do you come up a new person usually not but you are making that commitment that I am going to do a better job that's why baptism is so important it's vital to a Christian walk because you are saying in front of everybody I'm going to change I'm going to do my best to change and you set that old man back leave him in the water and then come out of the water let's turn to Deuteronomy chapter 4. I'm sorry Deuteronomy chapter 6. verse 4. Moses again speaking Moses said this hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sit us in thine house and when thou walk is by the way and when thou lie us down and when thou Rises up rise up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and upon the frontless between thine eyes he's talking to her about a Jewish tradition called philocrates when they have they have a certain number of scriptures and they're written in this little written on these little paper they put them in this box and they put them on their head and then they they bind them on the brother lives with left arm I think it's a left arm left arm you've done it before haven't you have you done it before have you done it before oh okay but you you bind them on your hand to represent what you do it bind it on your head on your on your forehead and then it it reminds you that of what you're thinking all the time and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and upon thy Gates Moses is preaching to the fathers here he's saying to teach the words of the Lord diligently is another translation for that diligently teach these things other translations says to impress them on your children and not only our children it says right here but our wives and even our guests and whoever is sitting in our house we should be talking about the word even if we're just walking down the road walking by the way we should be talking with whoever is walking with us about the word of the Lord it should be all the time the word the word the word and especially friends to our children Let's uh because of time's sake let's um let's turn to Proverbs it says this no no let's turn brother Jordan if you would uh I'll skip down let's uh let's go to that if you could quit put that quote up from Satan's Eden if you wouldn't mind so when we're when we're reading this Bible like Ezekiel as he was teaching and he was saying no no no no that you don't have to pay for the sins of your fathers you don't have to pay for what your dad did as long as you don't sin Ezekiel understood what Moses was teaching and it is so important for us to understand what this Bible is saying otherwise it's just a bunch of legalism it's just a bunch of rules legalism was not made a bunch of rules was not made to give us salvation it can't give us salvation it was made to help us through our life to understand what is sin and what's not sin but Salvation can only come through Christ but if we don't understand what the word is saying then how can we apply it to our lives we can't that's just a book of rules you know a man has to if he's in the Pulpit he has to have a suit on and wear a tie and a white shirt and and the women have to have hair down to here and and a skirt down to here and sleeves down to here and and the men can only say certain things and they can't do this and they can't do that it's just a bunch of rules but if you understand the meaning if you understand why behind those rules now you've got something because you can apply it to Everyday Life That's what Satan does he perverts the Nations he perverts the church he perverts the people he is a deceiver a perverter of the original truth God made a man a man and he made a woman a woman and he dressed them different and he meant them just to stay that way and to act that way one is feminist the other is masculine he separated Adam in the Garden of Eden and did this and separated Eve from him now where's her bangs she cuts her hair like his and he tries to wear his hair like hers see she wears his outside clothes and he wears her inside clothes now that sounds sacrilegious I don't mean it that way it's the absolute gospel truth if you don't know it then there's something wrong with you you're either blind or if you've never been on the streets and she thinks and he thinks that it's right and they're getting along somewhere look what it led to now that was in 1965. now we have transgender and it's wrong I know it's not politically correct to say that it is a sin and we see that we we see a man trying to be a woman woman trying to be a man it started way back way back here as brother branham's talking about what he's what he's doing is he's quoting Deuteronomy 22 verse 5 the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman woman's garment for all that do so or an Abomination to the Lord thy God you have to understand why he's saying that he's saying that because he wants to keep the gender separate he doesn't want a feminine weak not weak but some a feminine Spirit on a man and he doesn't want that dominating masculine Spirit on a woman and that's where we get so far off into today's society and as I said he got he he attacked motherhood years ago and now he's after Dad and he wants to pull Dad out he wants to pull him out of the whole thing and I know that I understand I'm speaking broadly here but what I'm trying to say is those of us that are dads those of us that that are looking after our family we have to have Heath we have to have that understanding of what this Bible is saying otherwise it's just a book of rules and it won't work but as a as a father as a leader of our home we need to spend the time praying studying and understanding what this means so we can apply it to our family so when we're raising our children that they will remember these things and they will turn out good now I know that as I said that as if we can get our kids to receive that new birth if we can get our kids to receive that same Spirit of Christ that breaks all the bad examples we've ever done and I'd also like to say that as I'm I'm pushing on the on the fathers it yeah we have time to read it let's read it Ephesians chapter 5. verse 1. be therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ hath loved us and have given himself for us and offering and a sacrifice to God a sweet smelling savior so what what he's saying here is how beautiful that Christ said father I give you my life and it came up before the Lord as it did in the altar in the Tabernacle it came up before the Lord as a sweet smelling savior saver and he liked it he it made it was acceptable to God Christ gives his life for that let's skip to verse verse 21. Paul the Apostle here he is saying submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body look at the importance of the husband look at the importance of the father he's comparing the dad to Jesus I'm talking to the dads now not the wives I'm talking to the dads to the men that will one day be be husbands will one day be fathers how should we Act how should we take care of our families of our children we should be we should be willing to go to the fire for them do everything that we can for them and we should be learning this this word all the time and praying all the time so that we might be that representation of Christ to our families remember the lion that came out there was not a hyena in Africa that was going to mess with his family he was gonna tear him up and he did that's how Dad should be I am going to be so in tune with God that I am able to be that representative of Christ to them submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God well I've submit yourselves to your own husband as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject under Christ so let the wives be subject to their own husbands and everything we see the divine order of the family here this isn't me this is the Bible by the way I'm not trying to say anything trying to slip anything in this is the Bible I'm reading husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such things but that it should be holy and without blemish so so ought meant to love their wives of their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself treat our wives well respect them love them we when we go to prayer when we ask the Lord Jesus to help us how will we like it if he didn't respect us if you didn't care about us and how much should we care about our families about how much do we care about our wives so ought to men to love their wives of their own bodies he that love loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth it and cheareth it cherishth it even as the Lord the church speaking about how we should treat our wives for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery Paul says but I speak concerning Christ in the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband there's a mutual respect going on here and in closing the musicians can come friends I'm talking about about dads about fathers and about how that important they are I hope I've shown in just a few scriptures how important it is for a dad to live that life and you might say well I grew up without a dad I didn't I didn't have a dad or or my husband isn't a Believer or or whatever it is but the whole the same Holy Spirit that wrote the Bible is the same Holy Spirit that's with you whatever situation that you're in some of us have a little bit harder than other others but the same God who is rich in Mercy that wrote this Bible will be there and be able to break that tradition as I said if there is sin there with the new birth and that's why we have to teach teach it so diligently in our churches we have to teach it diligently in our homes and in our families fathers have a high high example in Christ and we have a great responsibility to our families and we fall so short and as I said at the beginning I've read those statistics look at what happens when the father doesn't when the father's not there [Music] things Things Fall Apart but thank God I know that that there's some that single mothers that don't have a husband anywhere that doesn't have a husband in the home or anywhere the holy spirit's there and he can he can take care of it [Music] but those of us and I'm speaking to the fathers this morning look at how important it is that we're good Dads that were good husbands that we live a life that's worthy of this gospel and we were able to stand up there that we don't fall into the Trap Of The World of of being a coward not willing to stand up for what's right [Music] because what's going to happen generation after generation is going to pass and then there'll be a generation that rises up that's talking about the same thing that they learned around the supper table and they're going to be they're going to be talking about about whatever it is television and and dress and legalism and all that which I I'm not for that don't think that don't think that I'm not for Holiness I am and I love it I believe it pleases the Lord but they'll be talking about that still talking about the rules and the regulations looking for the Lord to come and the bride will be gone she would have already been so I've already been raptured and I won't know it but we need to make ourselves ready we need to be right back to Romans chapter 6 in closing I want to read that again [Music] says this we'll start with verse verse 4. now let's start with the first one what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of life foreign do we still do we still have a baptism this morning we do if you go and make ready is there anyone that feels on their hearts to be baptized in the name of the Lord to make that commitment that I am ready I don't want to be what I used to be as the Bible says that old man I want to be this new man I want to be something new something fresh and I'll make that commitment if you have that desire in your heart see the see the um the brothers in the back will baptize you but as as making ready upstairs I also want to say that [Music] fatherhood dads aren't perfect [Music] and and many of us really really fail but also appreciate a dad appreciate a husband for what he is appreciate the fact that he's stayed with the family I appreciate the fact that he loves that that he loves you I appreciate a look at my dad and what he was I see all of his failures and all the things that he did there were many many mistakes but you know what he loved me [Music] he loved me and provided for my family and how grateful am I that he did that and if you're not if if there's not a dad in your life give that's friends that's why we have a church too that's why church is so important that the weaknesses that are in all of us that we can account for each other's weaknesses and we can help each other out that's why this body is so important friends that's that's why you'll hear the pastor say come to church because we need each other foreign God bless you all I pray the Lord will give each of the dads a good day and it's in his service and in the goodness of the Lord that's that he's given to us and we won't have service this evening as I said so we can enjoy it with our families but I do friends I just want to say how important it is our church family how important it is that that the right message comes forth from the pulpit as the right message comes comes to the children and home and I I'm gonna say what's on my heart I'm going to do my best and I'm not I'm not gonna I guess you could say I've seen so many brothers fail I don't want to to bow down to the establishment I don't want to bow down to what is taught that you have to preach this this and this and this I'm going to do my best friends I want to preach what's on my heart what the Lord lays on my heart and I'll make mistakes but I'm not gonna do it because a denomination tells me to do it or an establishment tells me to do it I'm just not going to God bless you all I'm going to go upstairs and as I said Happy Father's Day I pray that I don't want to say anything hard or hurting to anyone I appreciate dads I appreciate all you brothers and what you do and what you go through and the hardness it's not easy to live in this world where everything every Bullseye is on Dad every one of them because if they take us out then there's nothing else to stand so let's stand strong in the Holy Spirit God bless you brother that's uh no not not everybody stand let's let's stand as Christians but not right now God bless you all pledge allegiance [Music] thank you I pledge away [Music] have heard how Christians [Music] were brought before a tyrant Stone they were [Music] if they would the day but one by one they chose to die

be able to do this and we see that the young man he wants to serve the Lord and I just pray that the Lord will be with him all times let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you young Souls that would come to
