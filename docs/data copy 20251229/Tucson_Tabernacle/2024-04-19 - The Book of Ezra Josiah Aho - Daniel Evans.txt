[Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] yeah [Music] h [Music] h [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] God bless you all nobody get up and leave I'm not leading songs tonight I want to give a report a financial report before we get started I that it was funny we're just back there brother Aaron's been trying to get me the lead songs all week and uh he keeps sing me texts and U then uh brother Josiah just just said he said you know he said if you lead songs he said then they'll appreciate what we do more thanks buddy um so what I'm going to do right now is I'm gonna give a financial report in our bylaws we say that uh we give the report at the first of April of every month that's why I made the announcement I had just I make the announcement last week that um we will give the financial report and from now on we will make this report at the end of March we will make it on the last probably Wednesday in March from this point on so what I wanted to do is tell the church here are the total expenses and then here is the total income special thanks to sister sister Rachel for working so hard on the books and um saving us so much money and uh all the effort I I know I complain when I have to do my taxes I can imagine how much it is to keep track of all the expenses of this church and we have quite a few more than you might think for the ministry the ministry includes um it includes the ministers Hospitality which means that whenever someone comes in we will give them an offering and then a lot of times we'll take them out to eat we'll put them up for the night or two nights or however long that they're staying um that's includes any missionary offerings that we give that includes any type of salary that I get or any of our brothers here that Minister here any um offerings that they get and like I said any visiting ministers so this is a a big expens for the church the church spent $85,000 last year on the ministry the next one is our Outreach and benevolences which is the fellowship hall supplies food for the church dinners special meetings Mother's Day gifts um money given to those in need which is a big expense and gifts to maybe in bereavement uh someone that is um struggling maybe to pay their Funeral for a loved one um and that also in their uh any type of Outreach materials which is Bibles and that um those supplies we spent $440,000 on that last year any special events which includes last year included Harmony um and included our family camp we went to I took um a group to Phoenix for special meetings last year um that was $21,000 you wonder why it's important brothers and sisters to take up an offering and I know that our example is brother brandom and the way that he did things and he said that giving and passing the plate was part of worship and he said uh they tried to get brother brandom to pull on the people for money and brother brandham he made this statement he says no he says just Pass the Plate he says that's all we do and brother brandham as you know he never got into money problems he was always on the level the lord always provided just as much as he needed so in these special events and um special services that's why we usually take up an offering is to pay because they do we do incur a lot of expenses in doing that administrative well for the Youth um that is food when we buy food for upstairs for the Youth if we um have any type of a youth Gathering and um any type of supplies that we buy that was $6,000 last year administrative fees which is Paypal fees and the fees that the church pays if you um make your donations online they're small but uh it's still um is um the church still pays fees for that um the phone hookup um the videos postage telephone internet um we installed a new phone system this year or last year piano tuning copyright and Licensing $177,000 the church property that's Insurance repairs maintenance um any type of if we do a special cleaning if we have someone come in and and do um any type of special work the new parking lot that we put in when we resealed it utilities and then um any type of Renovations like we did for the the room outside $13,000 we spent on the on the church building last year and then we also have the church has two properties um that it owns and uh if the Lord's willing we are going to sell one of those at least one of those and we spent $99,000 last year on those properties which is a very very small amount um considering that they're the full properties um we have uh some big expenses coming up this next year but all of that totals up the total expenses is $ 28,749 that were expenses for the church and as I looked at had it and went over it we didn't have any big expenses really last year so that is going to go up a lot this year because of our Renovations over in this room over here and then if the Lord's willing in renovating this um this area here I've asked them uh the trustees to let's please do our best to stay under $200,000 for all of our Renovations and everything that we're doing and I know brother has taking the lead there he's doing a very very good job he's pinching every penny that we can but we also we don't want to sacrifice quality for um low prices and we're doing our best to do the make a nice renovation for the church so as I said we spent $ 28,730 $774 last year and here's a miracle we took in [Applause] $336,600 um I think I've already spent it on on over here and uh like I said we're going to incur some pretty big expenses this next year and if the Lord's willing to pay for the these expenses that we're going to incur in all of these new Renovations um praying about it and we're moving forward and selling the one property that we have down the street here to pay for um our uh church and I'm just I'm thankful brothers and sisters it is a great honor for us to give it's a great honor that we have a place to pay our ties and that we have a place to give extra offerings and what's so great about giving is seeing results from giving you don't want to just give to your church and then it just goes away and you don't see any results you don't see any progress but as we're going to hear tonight when our brother Josiah talks about the book of Ezra these there were great Renovations going on in the temple and that money had to come from somewhere that money just didn't show up it was given freely by the people and it was it was given so that they might have a place to worship that the Lord would be welcome as he descended on on the people and uh that's what we're working towards today and and I tell you the truth as I studied on the book of Ezra over over the past little while it's really amazing that we are going through what we're going through now and we are going into this book right now this book of Ezra it's they were doing the exact same thing we are they were rebuilding a temple that had been built and beautiful and it was wonderful but it was time to rebuild it and that's what they were doing in this book of Ezra so to give a little background before we start before we start our worship the book of Ezra is the beginning of What's called the second temple period the first temple we just went through first and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles how Solomon built this Temple for the Lord and then the Lord blessed them and then it after a while the temple got worn down and and Nebuchadnezzar comes in and he steals the people away now this book of Ezra comes right here at the end when they come back to Jerusalem and they're able to leave and brother Josiah will give us an explanation of that so brothers and sisters if you have any questions on any of the finances feel free to reach out to me and ask me I'd be happy to answer any questions that you have and once again I want to thank everyone for their generosity for their love for this church and how that we're we're moving forward forward and we are able to spend some money and make some changes that uh I think all of us are going to benefit from God bless you all brother Aon hey man brother Dan had asked me before I came out if I had any idea and I think uh if we could run with my budget be a lot cheaper I said 40,000 I had no idea but you know God can meet a million I he can meet one so appreciate let's stand as as we we're together again just praising the Lord we're together again just praising the Lord we're together again and want to call something good good is going to happen something good is all work together again just praising the

andasi continue to remember him in prayer as he he did what young boys and girls do when they're little they fall in they they knock their teeth out but uh we remember him in prayer also um let me get this that way I get it right says uh our sister andreana she received a dental crown today and there was some complications it took over three hours to complete treatment and now she's in pain because they punctured a blood vessel but we know that Jesus Christ is faithful amen he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement for our peace was laid upon him but by his stripes we are healed and there's also a praise from our um Sister Sarah codner and her sister Anne want to thank everyone who prayed for an concerning the cancer diagnosis she went to get a

let's sing Glory Glory Hallelujah his truth is marching um if anyone's familiar with Ezra you might know he played a big part in making sure we have this hold up your Bible so in that book you have an Old Testament and a new testament you have an Old Testament thank Ezra that's right so this is a significant character in The Bible Ezra is a big deal and he doesn't get enough respect as I and my dad have said many times Ezra doesn't get enough respect let's just sing that chorus cuz God's word and God's truth is marching on and I think Ezra is a is a testimony to That hallelu Glory hallelu yes Glory Glory hallelu his truth is Maring on let's sing verse one my eyes glory of the coming of GRA of his truth is marching hallelu Glory Hall Glory H Tru let's just sing the course again GL Glory Hallelujah Glory hallelu [Music] Hall number two [Music] nothing praise the Lord thank you musicians appreciate you let's have a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus thank you so much for letting us be here tonight thank you for this building there's a lot of work that's going to be going on to make this place as as best as we can make it lord it's just all about you it's all about worshiping you you've blessed us you've done so much good and I believe there's going to be more good Lord but if you're not pleased Lord it doesn't matter I pray that we would learn some lessons from this book we're going to be reading tonight and that it would impact us Lord Jesus I pray this this simple little presentation would help somebody love you Lord and we just commit it all into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name amen you can all have your seats the story contained in EZ ER ra has been told many times so God has a bar or a golden standard and humans fall from that so we've we've been studying the Bible you see that God has a standard a uh something and humans fall from that and then what happens then God takes a flawed man and he uses that man that vessel to restore I guess the that gold standard and it's a and it's a common story and it always we learn one thing from it that without God it's over you know we're nothing we can't do anything without God and the sooner we understand that that we can't do anything without God the sooner we can just run to Jesus now and we don't have to we don't have to do that cycle so if we just if we just realize we're not going to do it by ourselves we won't be okay alone let's just go to God now let's just rely on him now let's trust in him now then it would turn out a lot better the grace of God brother Aaron was talking earlier and some of the chapters we're going to read tonight are terrible awful and you just wonder how did God love these people how did and then you think how did how does he love me how does he love me so you see up there Ezra and you see a picture of a temple because as brother Daniel said Ezra rebuilt the Temple of the Lord the second time so Ezra and all the children of Israel are captive in Babylon they come back and they rebuild and I have a scripture there Ezra and it says for Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments so Ezra is a big part with zerubabel and rebuilding the temple but Ezra his heart is for the word he wants to get the word back into the hands of the people and um I want to make the word clear to you tonight I hope I can do a good job brother Daniel or brother Lyall would do a lot better I just kind of piece together this little PowerPoint really to help me honestly it's you know it'll hopefully help you but it's really to help me stay on track so if we go to the next slide so what's the book about uh it's in two parts so part one you get a decree from Cyrus and I'm going to introduce all these characters to you they all have very very cool stories part one uh is a decree from the king and the second half of the book is the ministry of Ezra so it's broken up it's divided into two sections like that and the book spans about 80 years and Ezra and neem IAH the next book are wrote actually has two books or one book originally it's two books but it was originally one so it's hard to not read out of Nehemiah for this I tried to avoid that because I think brother Daniel is going to do Nehemiah but they're written as one book so who is Ezra Ezra followed and restored the law and ritual he's not a prophet that's a that's a that's a key thing Ezra and Nehemiah were not prophets they accomplished such great things and they didn't have Angel visitations and and visions and they were just normal people so a priest this would be like Ezra's a priest like like brother Daniel or a minister just a regular guy with a vision I think that's yeah a man with a vision that's Ezra he doesn't get enough respect I'm going to say that throughout so he's such a big deal to the Jews as you see up there there are Jews that say if the law of Moses had not come to Moses it would have come to Ezra that is a saying I don't know if you've ever heard that brother Lyall but there are Jews that that that say that if it hadn't come to Moses it would have come to Ezra he's so he's so highly respected to the Jews and we don't you know we know very little about him so here we're going to I'm going to introduce some of these other important characters so Nehemiah I talked to you about Nehemiah that wrote is the same book so Ezra restored the word and this guy zerubabel really heads on rebuilding the temple Nehemiah helped rebuild the city and rebuild the wall around the city Zechariah and hegi the prophets as we know them we're going to run into them this study Cyrus I have him highlighted because I love Cyrus I have a funny story hopefully you know some all not all of this will be boring there's a really funny story with Cyrus and then Malachi is actually not referred to in the book of Ezra but he's contemporary on all this the three prophets Zachariah hegi Malachi are all in this era and Malachi has a very big deal a very uh significant part at the end of this and we'll read some of Malachi after and you'll know why so Israel is in the Exile they were taken away for 70 years it was prophesied by Jeremiah I have all these scriptures and I'm not going to read all of them but if you want to like take a picture or write those down those are really good scriptures I'm going to read the first one which is Jeremiah and this is the NIV I have up here I'm going to read from the King James though it's basically where God prophesies that he's going to take Israel out um um and give them to the king of Babylon so it's Jeremiah 25 verse 9 and Jeremiah's prophesying behold I will send and take all the families of the north sayith the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant isn't that interesting uh a Babylonian King a gentile and God says this is my servant I'm going to use and I will bring them against this land and against the habitants and all the nations and I will UT l l destroy them talking about the Jews and make them basically make a make a lesson out of them and I will take uh I will take all the the the good s the good songs and the happiness and this whole land shall be a desolation and they shall serve the king of Babylon 70 years so Jeremiah prophesies they're going to come and they're going to be taken away and they're going to serve 70 years and it shall come to pass when 70 years are accomplished that I'll pun the king of Babylon which isn't Nebuchadnezzar it's another king and that Nation sayith the Lord for their iniquity and and the land of the Chalan and will make it Perpetual desolations so they're not always going to be slaves to Babylon God is prophesying Jeremiah's prophesying and so then Daniel he's one of the people who is carried away to Babylon and he's an old man and he's reading the scroll of of Jeremiah here's a question for you how did he have that cuz he didn't have the Bible as we have he didn't have a copy of this they didn't they didn't pass these out at the fair they didn't they didn't have it uploaded on a site he could go and find they didn't have an app or a tablet or something he could read Daniel has Jeremiah's message books because Jeremiah has a scribe named baru and uh Baro copies down Jeremiah's prophecies so somebody's handing out Jeremiah's message books to people and Daniel gets a hold of this message book and Daniel who's a prophet understands that jermiah is a prophet and he says in the first year of Darius different Darius uh I Daniel understood uh by the by books the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem So Daniel realizes time's almost up it's almost 70 years and I'm not going to read the whole chapter but this is a beautiful chapter if you want to learn how to pray read this chapter because Daniel falls on his face before God and he says we're terrible we're Sinners we're awful and Daniel Daniel's a clean righteous man but he he stands in the gap for the children of Israel and he prays and repents and it's a beautiful prayer if you want to learn how to pray read Daniel 9 it's helped me a lot so then Isaiah so this is the last scripture before we go into Ezra this is incredible because this is about 200 years if you want to verify you can talk to brother Lyle before Cyrus even ever existed and here's God calling him by name Cyrus isn't even born yet so it says thus saith the Lord to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I have Holden and the joke is coming whose right hand I have Holden to subdue Nations before him and I will loose the loins of Kings to open before him the two Le Gates the gate shall not be shut I will go before thee speaking to Cyrus and make crooked places straight I will break in pieces the gates of brass I will give you treasures and riches in in secret places that you will know that I the Lord have called I I am the Lord which call thee by name and the god of Israel and for my servant for Jacob my servant's sake and Israel my elect I have called thee by name I have surnamed thee though thou Hast not even known me so Cyrus isn't even born and God is using Isaiah years and years before to say Cyrus is going to be the one to head all this now where's where's the joke so Cyrus is the one who pulls up to Babylon and takes over does anybody remember what was happening in Babylon when they fall there's a famous thing called the handwriting on the wall the handwriting on the wall comes up brother brandham preaches that message the handwriting on the wall he talks about they're having a drunken rock and roll party and then they take the vessels of God and they make fun of the Jews they pour wine into the the holy vessels of God and drink out of it and then handwriting appears on the wall it says Bel shazar you're days are numbered and and you know your Kingdom's going to be destroyed well right after that handwriting on the wall happened Cyrus Pulls Up and destroys everything and it happens immediately after so what's funny is when Bel shazar sees the handwriting on the wall and I love the King James version for this it says his knees buckled and his loins were loosed and he's drunk so he soiled himself it's prophesied he will loose the loin of Kings can I say it he he pooped his pants and it was prophesied that he would poop his pants that King and it was Cyrus who fulfilled that God included that he will loose the loines of Kings so then now we're going to go into Ezra 1 so if you want to open up to Ezra chapter 1 so we we met Cyrus this great king he pulls up to Babylon kills the King kills all the the bad people and here's Daniel standing there Daniel had just interpreted the handwriting on the wall so Ezra chapter 1 verse one and I think brother Daniel or brother Lyall pointed out that the last two verses of 2 Chronicles are the same as the first two in Ezra so that makes us believe that Ezra wrote Chronicles so Ezra chapter 1 in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia uh that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah referring back to Jeremiah again might be fulfilled the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia that he made a proclamation so he just conquered the greatest Kingdom in the world at that time and he doesn't gloat he doesn't throw a big party the first thing he he he the first big thing he does is for the Jews this little insignificant group of people the first thing he just had a glorious Victory how they snuck in that's a whole another study they have this great military Victory and then the first thing he says the Lord God Of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem so I ask this question how did he know how did he know that maybe he had an experience with God maybe an angel came to him maybe like you know it says it stirred up the Lord stirred up his heart whatever that means well I tend to think that Daniel who was standing there knew about the prophecy of Isaiah because Daniel was reading the book of Jeremiah So Daniel standing right there I just bet he walks up to Cyrus and says you're Cyrus look I have you right here already WR already wrote down see the date that's a few hundred years ago God already knew you were coming he already called you for a purpose can you imagine Cyrus pulling up and then this old man comes out with a scroll that's how I imagine it it doesn't say that in the Bible but I imagine Daniel came out and said God's called you by name Cyrus isn't that beautiful and so the Jews who have been in captivity all these years now have a proclamation from the most powerful guy on Earth to go and rebuild the Temple so things things are looking better and Cyrus gives them in this first chapter uh well in verse three he says who is there among you of all his people uh if God be with him let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build the house of the Lord God of Israel he is the god which is in Jerusalem and whosoever remaineth in any place uh where he sojourneth let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with beasts beside the Free Will offering of the house of God that is in Jerusalem so he helps them he gives them gold silver he gives them a bunch a bunch of stuff B of Gold Silver and he sends them to rebuild the Temple what a glorious thing God bringing his children back so Ezra chapter 2 so they return we won't read Ezra chapter 2 it's it's a number chapter so uh these are the children there's 42360 rep people people that returned to Jerusalem and there's seven ,000 uh maids and servants and I loved this I had to include 200 singing men and women that return and it says singing men and women I was talking to Katie about men and women worshiping because it's always put on the the song leader you know the the the brother who stands up here and leads songs but men and women worshiping I had to throw that in there we're all worshippers and this is what this was all about it's not so they could have a nice Temple and a nice church this was to restore worship that was at the heart of it all to restore worship to restore the word of God to the people and 700 horses mules camels and for some reason they had 6,000 donkeys so we can move on past Ezra 2 to Ezra 3 you'll see this phrase pop up in the book of Ezra La all the people came together as one man as one man I want to maybe I'll maybe I'll make that a thing at church we're all here together worshiping as one man they all come together I love that so Ezra chapter 3 all the people come together as one man and they uh they they offer some sacrifices they kind of settle back in can you imagine coming back to church after 70 years so imagine you're a little little a little kid getting carried away to Babylon and now all these years later with 42,000 50,000 people this great big Caravan you come back and you offer that first sacrifice you you s you're singing songs you're worshiping it's a great happy time and it was actually two years before they even started building the Temple this is a big lengthy process they had to bring back all the gold all the silver everything and uh so they offer the offerings and in the second year so two years uh began zerubabel oh and I forgot to include this zerubabel would have been King so he's in the the davidic line he would have been the king so he uh Cyrus makes him the governor so he even recognizes this is their leader I'll let him run the show over here he gives them power he gives zerubabel so that's zerubabel he's in the davidic line he would have been King is that right brother Lyall he would have been the king you wouldn't tell me I'm wrong in front of everybody though so and so they uh the builders laid the foundation of the temple so there's that's verse 10 Ezra 3:10 they laid the foundation of the temple and they they have symbols and they praised the Lord and they sang together giving thanks unto the Lord because he is good for his mercy endureth forever toward Israel you see that phrase pop up a lot he's good for his mercy endureth forever in Ezra and Nehemiah and they shouted with a great shout when they praised the Lord because the foundation was laid and they're all happy but it's kind of an interesting thing that happens because they're shouting and they're so happy but some of the some of the people who were little and they were alive when they were carried off and now they're old that they came back it says in verse 12 many of the priests and the Levites and the chief of the fathers who were ancient men 70 80 years I don't know it says ancient had seen the first house when the foundation of the house was laid before their eyes and wept with a loud voice because they saw the first thing they saw Solomon's Temple and so you get the end of this chapter is kind of like are we happy are we sad because it says so the people could not discern the noise of the shout of Joy from the noise of weeping for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard AAR off so remember when Solomon dedicated the temple and the cloud and the fire and and God comes down and it's this glorious thing well it doesn't happen when they lay the foundation and so the people who had seen it before were there and they just start crying it's not the same and when I was reading that I didn't really know what to think about that you know God blessed them they came back they have this Foundation you think they'd be grateful but they remember what it was and so now we go on to Ezra 4 we'll leave that as is so when the enemies if you all look at Ezra 4 verse one when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the Captivity builded the temple unto the Lord God of Israel they came to zerubabel and the chief of the fathers and said let us build with you for we also seek your God as you do and we sacrificed to him uh since the days of this guy that brought us up hither but zerubabel and this is kind of harsh zerubabel and Yeshua and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel said unto him you have nothing to do with us to build a house to our god so these people are coming up offering to help and zerubabel says no we don't want your help have nothing to do with us we'll build it we will build the temple to God as king Cyrus has commanded us so it's kind of harsh I read that and I was like why aren't you going to let him help zerubabel but you see his discernments right because the very next part so so he says no you can't help us build so if they really just wanted to help they would have said okay we'll just mind our own business if that's what they really wanted to do but right away so these people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled them in building so they they don't let them build they don't let them help building and then they say all right well if you're not going to let us help then we're going to work against you like come on so one thing I learned about these people is they did actually offer sacrifices to Jehovah they did what they're saying is true but they had also allowed idolatry in they were worshiping all kinds of other gods they were doing all kinds of things it it reminds me of of some Christian churches today that stand for things that Christians shouldn't be standing for and they come to zerubabel and they say oh yeah we're just like you guys and zerubabel knows if I let them in they're going to bring all that bad stuff with them so he says no no thank you Cyrus commanded us to build we have nothing to do with you and it was the right call because these people are clearly against them and so they weaken the hand hands and it even says they hired counselors these people were working hard to keep to keep them from building their Temple I mean they really care that the Jews are getting something done if you want to if you think this if you think this uh this thing is funny just look at Israel today they try to do something immediately everybody's all on it they can't be doing that they can't be occupying this area they can't be here they're doing that they we want to have this this part of land every time Israel wants to do something it this is this is nothing new and and it's still happening to this day Israel tries to do something so I have on the bottom there the devil gives away what is true by what he fights so the fact that they have all these adversaries it's clear that's God that God is with them it's clear that he's blessing it but then there's people fighting it that proves God is with them so if you know just to bring it down to home if you know I'm in the Lord's will I'm doing what I believe pleases him but nothing's working out and you you're facing all these all these little obstacles here and there the devil gives away what is true by what he fights so they hire counselors they fight against them and uh there's one problem is the king is on the Jews side so they wait for Cyrus to be gone and then they write a letter to azerus to get this building project stopped so they're two chicken to go to Cyrus and and talk to him about it because they know Cyrus is with them so they write a letter uh to AR Xerxes and they say uh I'll just paraphrase they write and this is a copy of the letter verse 11 be it known unto the king that the Jews which came up from thee and are come to Jerusalem uh building the rebellious and bad City and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundations be it known now to the king that if this city is builded and the walls set up again that they won't pay toll they won't pay tribute so they won't pay their taxes they won't help the kingdom and they're just badmouthing the Jews saying they're not they're going to be a terrible group of people you shouldn't let them do do this so and then they say search the records see that the Jews have been difficult in the past so the king says I command a search be made in verse uh 19 and he finds he finds these documents and he says there have been mighty Kings in Jerusalem so he sees that in the past Israel Judah they've been blessed and so he says yeah uh stop the building stop so until indefinitely until another commandment is given stop the building and why should this this all this stuff continue if it's going to hurt my kingdom basically the king says so these group of people think about it originally they came up offering to help and now they've wrote a letter to the king and the king because of all their trouble they went through the king says stop the work so Ezra 5 it continues on this chapter doesn't start a new story so the building continues so the prophets on the scene in Ezra 5 vers1 hegi and the and Zachariah prophesied to the Jews so if you read the book of hegi hegi is encouraging zerubabel build do it so the king told him don't build stop and and hegi comes and says no God is with you I'll read just a few verses out of hegi just real quick in the seventh month 12th day of the month came the word of the Lord to the prophet hegi saying speak now to zerubabel the governor of Judah and to Joshua and and to the priest and the res of the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in her first Glory glory and how do you see it now it's nothing so he says in verse four God through hegi yet now be strong o zerubabel be strong and sayith the Lord and work for I Am With You sayith the Lord according to the word and so God basically comes to hegi and he says tell go tell them even though the king said to stop building go tell them to keep building so they have a commandment from the king not to build but they have the prophet praise God that he has a prophet there to tell him and so they they start building again because the prophet said so and immediately these idiots come back right away they come back maybe I shouldn't say that word they come back and immediately I mean they just start building again and these guys they can't get enough and they said who told you it's like it's like have you who has siblings and and you're and you're doing something and hey did Mom say you could do that it's like they're just building their Temple and they immediately come and says who said you could build this and then said we as we speaking unto them after this manner or they they said uh what are the names of the men that make this build building but the eye of God was upon the Elders of the Jews so God was watching over Israel uh that they could not cause them to cease so they're trying to make them stop they're trying to make him stop building but God was watching over them so then they write another letter to the king so it's immediately Mom they're building again and so they write a letter be it known to the king that we went to the province of Judea to the house of the great God uh which was builded with great Stones Timber and and we asked the elders uh who commanded you to build and we asked their names and uh they returned to us we are the Servants of the god of Heaven and Earth and build the house that was build these many years ago which a great king of Israel builded and set up speaking of Solomon so then they explain the story they get carried away they come back then they tell them but Cyrus commanded us to do this so they're recapping and all the vessels of gold and silver in the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took and Cyrus the king and he give he gives it back to us and so we came to rebuild and that's what we're doing so verse 17 now therefore if it seem good to the king let a search be made so they're they're they're trying again to get this to stop whether it be true that a decree was made from Cyrus to the house of God and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter so like I said they come running back to Mom trying to they they really care like I said the devil gives away what is true by what he fights so Darius makes a decree he gets this letter and he says okay yeah let's search and see if there was a command from Grandpa to build this thing and so yes sure enough they find at Etha brother Lyall they find a a document a scroll and they see this is true that Cyrus did command this and so uh and He commands how the temple should be built and all the stuff all the help all the gold and silver that should be given to the children of Israel to help them He commands that it should happen so then he writes a letter back now therefore in Ezra Ezra 6: 6 Governor beyond the river these are the enemies that are trying to stop them be ye far from V so now God is is using the king to help them again let the work of this house of God alone let the governor of the Jews and the Elders of the Jews build this house of God so God's back on their side again and he goes even further I make a decree that what you shall do to the Elders of these Jews for the building of the House of the god of of God that of the king's Goods even of the tribute beyond the river so the land you live in the king speaking to these annoying people the taxes you pay I'm giving it to the Jews to help them build ouch ouch that's a real burn he says I I I think the king picks up on their snotty attitude in their letter oh King we just want to help you we just want to let you know that the Jews are building this Temple he says well I'm going to let him keep doing it and the taxes you pay you're going to help pay for it and furthermore anything they have need of you're going to give to them day or night if they come ask for it you're going to give it to them so this this is a burn if they need Bullocks Rams Lambs for burnt offerings to the god of heaven so he's even helping them at church if they need wheat salt wine oil what ever the priests say you give it to them day by day without fail that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savors unto the god of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons and I have made a decree so you think okay so he's supporting them he's he's giving them money he's helping them out but he even he even give he even makes it even more intense he says who show whosoever shall alter this word let a Timber a beam be pulled down out of that guy's house and let him be impaled on it so he takes it even further or or hung it either be hung or impaled there's two but still he he says I'm serious about this if anyone Alters a word let it be taken off of his house and let him be punished severely and uh so it's it's pretty clear he supports them and I want to read in verse 14 because it says so they continue building obviously they have all these resources they have all this help and they prospered through the prophesying of hegi the prophet and Zachariah I think that's beautiful we have we have Ministry today we can you know turn on a tape and be blessed these people are building it's exciting and they have two prophets there ministering encouraging them and it even later says that the prophets helped they helped build and then it finally comes to the moment this house was finished on the third day and the children of Israel and the priests uh kept the dedication of this house of God with joy and they offered at the dedication 100 Bullocks 200 Rams 400 Lambs for a sin offering they haven't done this you know all those years in Babylon so they're they're offering these sacrifices they're haven't in church so we don't do that today but maybe when we come and sing songs Sunday morning maybe we could maybe we could put a little more into it you know it's a lot of work to kill a to kill hundreds of lambs and and and goats and and Rams as a song leader myself it would be nice if people raised their hand you don't have to kill a come up and and kill a and make an offering and bring a spotless lamb and just raise your hand worship him right from right right where you are from right where you are you can do it you know anyway and so they they uh they restore the feasts too they have Passover and uh the children which were come out of captivity uh they eat they Feast they have a good time it's joyful and uh um kept the Feast of unleavened bread all right now chapter 7 so Ezra so they rebuilt the temple but I told you at the heart of this Ezra wanted the word back to the people he wanted worship restored that was what was important to him and so Ezra this is where we learn that he's a descendant of Aaron the high priest so we learn in this chapter we see he goes all the way back to Aaron and it says Ezra went up from Babylon in 7:6 and he was ready scribe in the law of Moses uh which the Lord God of Israel had given and the King granted him all his requests according to the hand of the Lord God upon him I got to I got to speed up I won't take too much time on each of these chapters but the king writes him a a really nice letter and again says Ezra whatever you need I got you so at the end of this chapter I mean I mean the king really blesses him gold silver anything you need it's yours and Ezra says blessed be the Lord God of our fathers which hath put such a thing in the king's heart to beautify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem and hath extended Mercy unto me before the king so Ezra give gives thanks to God and now Ezra 8 so it continues on so they're there they're not in Jerusalem they got to pick all this stuff up from the King and they got to take it all the way back to Jerusalem so they come back they got to walk that whole way and and the King says whatever you need any protection anything you need I got you you know you're carrying all this stuff Ezra rounds up a group of guys and they're going to carry it all back silver livestock Temple vessels and no Army to protect them so they fast and they pray and it's really funny because Ezra stands up and he says we need to fast and we need to pray we got this long journey back and I'm ashamed to ask the king for help because I told the king that God was with us Ezra says that he says I told the king God would be with us and we wouldn't have we wouldn't have to worry God would watch over us we're God's people you know he's got us he's going to watch over us but we have all this stuff and we're going 900 miles I I did my research it'd be like walking with all that gold all that silver all those vessels all those animals from here to Dallas Texas walking all the way so they're at this River and he says we need to fast and we need to pray and so cuz and it even says he was ashamed I don't want to ask the king would give him soldiers right away you need soldiers I he would give it to him to protect him but he says my God is with us we'll fast we'll pray and it says that uh that the Lord intreated them the Lord heard them the Lord responded and he watches over them and he delivers them to Judah safely so you know he's still the the same God today if you need something you can fast you can pray the Lord will hear you like I said Ezra was not a prophet all these these group of guys that were with Ezra with all this stuff they weren't prophets they weren't Angels they were just people that had the vision they wanted to they wanted to do something for the Lord they fasted they prayed and it's a miracle that they went 900 miles and nothing happened to them they were perfectly safe not an ounce of gold missing not an ounce of silver missing and they get back of course they offer sacrifices to the Lord thanking him they weigh all the gold and the silver it's all there every weight every piece of it is there I also have a feeling that this is where Ezra got uh this is it might have been this trip that he got the Book of Daniel because like I told you Ezra was putting together the books of the Old Testament so he's back he's acquiring all these books I think maybe on this on this trip he got the The Scroll of Daniel and he said this needs to go in the Bible you know this so that's just me I have I have little thoughts Ezra 9 so this is where it gets really really starts to get bad so word comes to Ezra so remember let me let me back up Deuteronomy 7 is up there that's the scripture that says Don't marry the jebusites the moabites the Hittites don't marry all these people brother Lyall read that when he did his his study on Ruth it said don't marry all these people so these people had been gone in Babylon 70 years they didn't have the Bible they didn't have the word they didn't have access to it so they're marrying people that they weren't supposed to be marrying and it says they bring this report to Ezra in verse two they have taken of their daughters the Hittites the parasites the jebusites they have taken these people for themselves for their sons and the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands so they're they're they're trying so hard to do everything right and then they're like great for all these years we' for these past couple years we've been marrying these wrong people and Ezra says when I heard this thing I rent my garment and my mantle and plucked off the hair of my head and my beard and sat down astonished and there was assembled unto me everyone that trembled at these words so they realized this is a big deal this is not what God wanted us to do and so Ezra falls down and he says oh oh my God I am ashamed in verse six and blush to lift up my face to thee my God for our iniquities are increased over our our head and since the days of our fathers have we been a great trespass to you so so so he said for years we've been sinning we've been displeasing the Lord and you you've delivered us there's a lot of recap they explain What's happen there A lot of times they refer back to the last 100 years and now verse eight for a little space Grace has been showed from the Lord Our God and he says we don't deserve it but you showed us Grace and you allowed us to escape and to come back and to give us to give us a little happiness after all that and we've done this terrible thing and he's just heartbroken and and now oh God what shall we say after this for we've forsake we've forsaken your Commandments this is also a good lesson on how to pray so they've done something wrong they don't sidestep it Ezra says we're wrong Lord he come he comes humbly now if you know Jehovah God Jesus you know that he is full of grace so I believe that with that like that it says they're trembling they're repenting they're they're weeping I believe God would have forgiven them I believe they repented if they made sacrifices if if they did these things God would have forgiven them they they're sincere they know they were wrong and he prays on and he says we've done all this and our evil deeds and our trespasses and uh we broken your Commandments again and what are we going to do about these Abominations and in verse 15 he says oh Lord God of Israel Thou Art righteous for we remain yet escaped as it is this day behold we are before thee in our trespass we're guilty and we cannot stand before thee because of this so chapter 10 this is the last chapter of Ezra so Ezra had got through praying it's very sad and when he had confessed weeping and casting himself down before the house of God there assembled unto him some guys and and some men and women and children and the people all wept so I like I said I imagine God would forgive them I believe he would have and shechaniah the son of Jalel one of the sons of a lamb answered and said unto Ezra we've trespassed against our God and we've taken strange wives of the people of the land yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing so now he has an idea he says in verse three chapter 10 he says uh let us make a Covenant with our God to put away all the wives and such that are born of them so he says let's just divorce them all now these people had families kids wives and families and he says let's put away the wives and kids and uh according to the council now let us make a covenant that we put away all the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of my Lord and of those that tremble at the Commandment of our God and let it be done according to the law they say well we don't know what else to do so I guess we have to backtrack and put away these wives and then go on living good lives and so Ezra Rises up and he says okay I guess we're going to do that which was a huge mistake a few chapters earlier they fasted and prayed for something and God gave them an answer but they don't do it here they just rush into okay we're divorcing everybody sending the kids away terrible why didn't they fast and pray like they did at the river and God delivered them and they got their answer from God but they don't do that and they just rush into this this and it's just a mess and this is how this is how this book ends it's like after all the Miracles all the things God did for him it ends this way they're divorcing everybody and I counted it out 114 record Ed for people that divorced that had families there might have been more there probably was more and it's just and that's the end of the book of Ezra it just ends right there so I told you I was going to talk about Malachi so God sends a prophet and if anyone is familiar with what we call the message Malachi is important isn't he so Malachi comes on the scene in Chapter 2 Malachi 2: 16 for the Lord God the god of Israel saith that he hateth putting away divorcing so this is right after all this happens God sends a prophet and one of the issues Malachi deals with he says God hates divorce so God really come he comes down hard on them this is wrong this is not what you were supposed to do God hates divorce more than the fact that they married those wrong people they married the wrong people they made the mistake but God hates divorce even more and God shows it through Malachi right there he says he calls it out he hits it right on the nail this is wrong this is not what you were supposed to do so I'm going to put up this timeline because I want to show something so we've gotten all the way through the book of Ezra so Jesus is right here where the laser is Ezra Esther and Nehemiah are right here so when you look at it laid out like that Ezra and Nehemiah are not right before Psalms like they are in the Bible they're actually at the end of the Old Testament where Malachi is just just the way they uh organize the Bible they put them in the middle I don't know why I would have put them at the end but easier to say hindsight so they're right here so right before Jesus we have Ezra Esther and Nehemiah and then we have silent years and Jesus comes so right before Jesus comes they rebuild the Temple they get the word back to the people they do all this stuff why why did God do it then because Jesus was coming the the whole reason the only reason that it mattered was because God was establishing the the greatest thing the greatest gift that was ever going to be sent to the Earth was about to come so that's what I wanted to end with that because it's all about Jesus that's the lesson in this now the next slide how does this apply today well we have a message don't we and all of us personally in our lives in some way or another have come out of Babylon you follow me none of us have been to Babylon well some of us have gone to historically but none none of us have have have been enslaved this way but we all in our personal lives had to come out of Babylon this this is applicable to us we had to rebuild this Temple we had to rebuild we had to bring the word back we had to we we had to we had to make it real for ourselves we had to come out I can tell you personally in high school I was a pot smoking drinking cussing I'll use that word again idiot I had to come out of that why because I believe Jesus is coming again soon so he restores all this he restores the temple he restores the word and what happens Jesus comes again and they miss it could that happen to us should we be prideful and think think we have Zachariah heah Malachi now we'd say we have brother bram's message from God make no mistake from God we have it but could we get too prideful and could it go right over our heads this is serious God God does Miracles through Cyrus and God has given us a nation of free religion like Cyrus gave the Jews to come back to Jehovah fulfilling prophecy performing what he said he would do and Jesus came and they missed it I didn't bring the quote but in God hiding himself in simplicity at the end of the tape and it everybody's shouting at the preaching but brother brandham says it's going to come one day and he's in Indiana and he says how many will be gone from Jeffersonville maybe one brother brenham's friends were there his church he was at his church he wasn't in Las Vegas he wasn't he wasn't in La he wasn't he said how many will be gone from Jeffersonville maybe one like I said God brought them back He restored the word to them and Jesus came and they missed it let's all stand I think we should pray dear heavenly father we've come to a place in your word we see a marvelous thing you did Lord we see Miracles you've done back in the Bible and Lord we've seen miracles in our own generation we've seen them through the ministry of a prophet and we know it's from you and Lord I believe you're coming soon I believe that day it gets closer by the minute Lord Jesus I pray we would not get stuck in religion I pray we would not get stuck in Pride Lord don't let us become Pharisees don't let us become cold Lord Jesus you brought us in our own lives from sin you brought us out of Babylon don't let us miss when you come Lord Jesus don't let us miss you Lord that's all that really matters is you Jesus that's all that really matters that's the only reason you sent all those prophets is to prepare the way and then you sent a man of God in this generation to forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ Lord I pray we wouldn't miss [Music] it cuz I know you're coming help us to be in the right place Lord Jesus on this Wednesday night Lord God how many would just like to say Lord I'd like to rededicate my life to you we're Christians here we love the Lord but this is about eternal life Lord Jesus we give our hearts to you may this be a church that you are welcome at that you're not knocking outside the door we're renovating we're doing all these things we pray it'll please you Lord Jesus we want to give you a a good church we want to put we want to make it nice we believe you'll be pleased with it but Lord Jesus we just want to have you in our hearts that's all that really matters Lord is you thank you for this little service Lord thank you Lord Jesus we just give you our [Music] hearts I was brother Josiah when he closed he mentioned a quote from Brother brandom believe it was in God and simplicity I was in Jeffersonville and I was in my backyard and uh we had a a staircase that went um to up to the second story in the backyard and and I was standing next to that staircase [Music] and I heard brother bradam say that he said how many from Jeffersonville he said maybe one and I it just was overtaken by that statement that he said and I I sat down on the stairs and I started praying I said Lord maybe one maybe one from this place and I know what brother Brandon was saying he wasn't telling us that there was only going to be one that came from Jeffersonville but he was telling us that it's going to be a very very few that find this and it's going to be a very few that are [Music] taken these are perilous times brother Leo as the Bible says this is not a time to take these things lightly now brother let me tell you a lot of work goes in to Preparing a sermon like this and how my brother went through and he brought in zerubabel and how zerubabel was in this line I believe of Judah the king brought him and he brought he was a leader that brought the people out and here comes these prophets and they're prophesying here is Hagi and Zachariah and Hagi is there and he is encouraging this zerubabel to go forward now the brother talked about Cyrus the king and how how they found these Scrolls of dasas and the decree that he issued what a what a what a book this book of Ezra is and how powerful this man was that he brought this message to the people and I loved my I loved a lot of what brother Josiah said but one thing that he started with he said he was just a normal man he said like the pastor here like any of us this man Ezra but brother Lyle he wrote these books and I believe that the reason that the Bible is put in this order is because he wrote 2 Chronicles then he writes Ezra and then Nehemiah comes and then it it goes to Esther and it goes through this time of this captivity and coming out of this captivity and then it goes into the poetic books which are job Psalms Proverbs just to think of Lord we get to live in a time like Ezra lived and here we are as brother Josiah talked about the main reason for this Temple it is not a temple made with hands anymore it is a temple of flesh and blood today and these temples need to be rebuilt into the image of Jesus Christ and that is how we have to live because he is coming soon as you said brother Josiah and we need to be ready because there will come a day when they say well we thought Elijah was supposed to come [Music] first and then the answer might come back he he came already and you missed him you weren't ready brothers and sisters we have a message that came to tell us to get ready for the coming of the Lord I I want to do everything that's in me to get ready do you appreciate our young brother young man studying and putting this

was walking down the Mount of Olives and I saw a little hand painted sign there on the road and it said the Tomb of the prophets I walked in there and I believe it was Hagi Zachariah and Malachi is that right brother ly I think it was those three that were once buried in there and at least that's where they think that was but what struck me the most is where they were buried there were there were there were these tubes hollowed out where they would put the bodies but there were many many of these these graves in there and then there were two there were three different rooms and what struck me the most was those that really loved those those prophets were buried with them and it just it blessed me so much when I was there to see that and and to see now I know why that all three of them were together after today I'm sure that they all would have wanted to be in this day that we live in because this is the day that we don't see the first coming of Christ but this is is the day that we see the second coming of Christ and this is the day that it's all going to end that there will be no suffering there'll be no more shame and brother Leo he's going to have us all around his table and we're going to be weeping and and and all things are just going to be overwhelming and sister Shirley he's going to walk by and wipe these tears from our eyes that's going to be a glorious day I pray that every single one one of us is there on that day and brothers and sisters let's lead a whole bunch more let's all get a whole bunch of people behind us and say come on we're going to meet it we're going to meet the Lord Jesus we're going to be there on their day I'm going to be there now I want you all to come amen and be there with us God bless you brothers and sisters had a good
