you saints i enjoyed that singing there from my brother peter amen i greet you in the name of the lord this morning amen i was just worshiping with you there and i trust that you're uh an expectation this morning for what the lord will speak to us i would just say here just by way of starting that uh that i have a lot of upon my heart the lord just began to deal with me yesterday and then all throughout the night and all morning i just got a lot really heavy upon my heart and i i don't know what we'll all cover today i don't want to be too long long-winded today we just have one service this morning we won't be having a second service but just this morning service but just have a lot upon my plate and i may even seem a little bit scattered here today uh and maybe not as put together as maybe i normally would be but i'm just preaching something the lord gave me fresh amen yesterday and then just some things he's been stirring upon my heart here over the past few days and so i i just i just trust that you came with a expectation and i know you have needs because we're needy people but we have the need meter amen and he always meets our expectations so we're certainly grateful for that amen we're continuing to remember amen our brother paul and sister adriana amen this morning i spoke to brother paul and he gave me a really good report about sister adriana that he said today is the fifth day that uh that that she's been symptom-free sister adriana but she's still pretty weak and and fatigued but her oxygen levels are good so we're rejoicing amen sister adrian if you're streaming this morning we've been holding you up in prayer amen and thankful to the lord that he's an on-time god amen and so if you have your bible we'll turn to the book of malachi amen chapter 3 malachi chapter 3. amen and i trust that this is coming through brother jordan if you could just give me a thumbs up there and then make sure that it all sounds and looks good um you can stand to your feet if you could stand with me just for the reading of the word this morning we'll read just a couple scriptures amen malachi chapter 3 and i just want to read two scriptures actually hold your place in malachi chapter 3. i want you to turn to revelations chapter 20. that's where we wanted to turn this morning first revelations chapter 20. i'd like to speak to you or begin speaking to you here today uh on a thought if i was to give it a title this morning it would be the age of neurotics the age of neurotics revelations chapter 20 and i just want to read here from verse 11. and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books now notice books plural and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire malachi chapter 3 if you have your place there malachi chapter 3 amen verse 16 17 and 18 amen i trust this is streaming good through at home those of you at church that are gathered and those of you at home amen i just trust that you you can turn there in your bible hold it handy amen this morning malachi chapter 3 the lord just gave me this scripture supernaturally and i've read it before and it just really um i don't even know hardly how to explain it but just reading these three verses we're about to read i almost fell in my heart that i could read these three verses i could stand you i could i could i could pray we could dismiss sing a song and we would be thoroughly blessed uh to have been in church these three verses here just meant so much to me and i trust that they mean something to you and we're going to comment a few things on them towards the end let's just read them here malachi chapter 3 start at verse 16. then they that feared the lord spoke often one to another and the lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name let's read that verse 16 again then they that feared the lord spoke often one to another what were they speaking about their conversation they were speaking about the lord and the lord hearkened means he hasted means he met met the need means he ran to them means they were he was drawn to them and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name and they shall be mine saith the lord of hosts in that day when i make up my jewels and i will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him then shall you return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not lord jesus father even today lord as i stand here lord i'm just so thankful lord for your presence so thankful for your spirit lord how real it is to me lord jesus i'm so glad that father no matter how many years lord we serve you we preach your word we pray we lord we live for you lord your the reality lord of you and our life it never grows old lord it never it never gets tired it never gets weary lord religion is just a coat it's just a cloak lord and it's dead it loses its savior it loses its energy lord but a true relationship lord as paul said that i may know him in the power of his of his resurrection lord it never gets old it stirs our hearts this morning god now i pray lord that you would just come and speak by your word father may you steal my spirit lord direct my thoughts i believe lord you yesterday lord begin to impress this upon my heart father and all through the night last night late unto this morning lord and then this morning early just waiting upon you believing that i you've given me some inspiration lord for your people now lord what i'll say this morning really has no value at all god it it's really not important what i'll say lord even for the people to hear me lord it's not important father what i'll say to them but what's important lord is what you'll say this morning so lord we just lean to you father we we rest in you this morning god trusting upon your divine grace that it's upon our lives lord that you'll speak to us from your word we ask we ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen you can be seated this morning amen you can be seated as we just minister to you this morning i have a lot as i said upon my heart and i really don't have a real just a clear smooth direction just a lot that i would like to say amen this morning the scripture meant so much to me uh in the age when i begin to contemplate this thought of the age of neurotics i truly believe that we're living as the prophet called this age he said it could well be called the age of neurotics i want to read you and i i apologize this morning it takes a lot of preparation to be able to get the quotes uh to display them the way that we stream to you it's very difficult and i had so many i didn't have time so it is trust you this morning that you'll listen as i read these quotations and not lose your attention amen but listen to them very closely they they meant a great deal to me uh brother barnum says here and i'm just gonna pick up from the middle of this uh this quote here he says well now it is strange but in this age of pliny this is out of the lady you see in church age in this age of plenty uh in this age of abundance how can there be trials well now it is strange he says but in this age of plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there is so much more to be had what with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation when every everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about but millions are taking sedatives at night pet pills in the morning rushing to doctors entering institutions and trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol yes this age boasts of its tremendous stores of worldly goods but the people are less happy than ever this age boasts of its supernatural attainments but the people are less sure of themselves than ever this age boasts of better moral values and is and it's more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about its knowledge and science but it is fighting a losing battle in all fields for the human mind and the soul and the spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast with all the changes that have come upon the earth in one generation we have gone all the way from the horse and buggy to the space age and we're proud and boastful about it but inside is a dark void cavern that is crying out in torment and without now here's the key to this quote here and without a known reason there is uh my dad uh said has said my whole life he said well the greatest fear uh is not the fear of whatever's going to come upon you or maybe the fear of a disease or the fear in the world but the greatest fear is the fear of the unknown when you don't know you you're out of answers you don't have an answer to the problem i believe what you're witnessing today in the world is a is a paralyzing panic uh that's sweeping across the nation i posted it to our church whatsapp chat and i trust it was a blessing to you uh that what you're seeing is just a a panic and a paralyzing fear across all of the world and it's this fear that they don't know why they've thrown all the solutions they've thrown political parties they've thrown campaigns they've thrown money millions of money at it they've flown thrown their best drugs at the problem that's at the core of mankind but brother branham says without a reason without a known reason men's hearts are felling for fear the world is so dark that this age could well be called the age of neurotics now you look at that word neurotics and it's a it's a an actual mental condition uh and we were i believe that when brother branham was was referring to this he was referring to something specific he speaks of those uh that were uh given to inspiration and he says did you know everyone who has a gift in their life they tend to be a neurotic brother adam says that about himself he says i've been a neurotic my whole life so there was something he was interjecting here though that was that was different uh in in a sense it was different than what he's talking about but i believe that when you look at what the prophet was saying uh he was describing this insanity this condition of just on edge all the time he's he preached in the letting off the pressure and he says everyone's just in a hurry he says just go go and he gives the story of uh he's at a hospital somewhere and he's trying to go visit a a sister in the hospital room and he says that i went to the you know the information desk and he said and the woman there i said well ma'am could you help me uh i'm trying to find him and she just snapped at him real fast and said you know i'm too busy why don't you look it up somewhere and brother branham said oh my okay and he went to the next person he said the man there gave him such a look when he he was he said oh boy i don't even want to speak to him he went to the next floor and tried to talk to someone and said ma'am i've tried 223 and she's not in that room and and maybe she's in 233 and she said well you go try 233 brother branham startled by and said my goodness he said he went to the next person he said everyone was just in such a pressure such a tension and this is what he's speaking of when he speaks of the age of neurotics it's it's a it's a tense uh nervousness it's a it's just a stress and anxiety that blankets the world that we live in and and it's it's it's very temporarily a very temporary peace and men and women has tried to drown it out with riches and goods and vacations and entertainment and we get one entertainment only to be flooded my brother my sister do you well i don't think we realize because it happened so gradually to us but just in the last as brother adam begins to say we went from the horse and buggy age into the astronaut age and and he says and all we boast about it so much we've just progressed so much and yet we're more miserable than we've ever been yet we're more unhappy than we've ever been and let me just say let me just update it here today we have more uh entertainment at our fingertips than we've ever had before we have more things to drown out the noise of the world we have more things to drown out the pressure to check out of the pressure and stress of life there everything's at our fingertips nowadays it's entertainment has just blanketed and i'm speaking not just to the world uh you're saying amen i'm sure to the word this morning but believers aren't exempt from that we have to guard brother branham gave us a warning he said i want to give you a warning you've got to guard against soft living in this age he said it's the spirit of this age it gets you soft to get you off guard it gets you not ready and and you you you're in danger of being like those described in the book of luke where the master returns and his servant and he finds a servant sleeping and and i believe that we're just so inundated constantly inundated with entertainment on our phone entertainment on our computer entertainment on our laptop entertainment in the world is just constant constant constant feeding and consuming we live in the age of consumption where even all of our devices are tailored and engineered specific not for production but they're engineered for consumption and they're engineered to consume and everything is about everything i can consume my brother my sister as brother branham said everything the devil does is just a perversion of what god's doing and let me tell you god has an age this is the age of consumption and you should be consuming as the bible says john eat the book and and and prophesy you must prophesy again but before you prophesy you've got to consume it we should be living in the age of consumption but we should be consuming the word of god a daily appetite i say lord help me help me change my appetite from this worlds of vain riches and entertainment and let my appetite be changed to the word of god where i consume it daily daily in my life it's the age of brother adam says it can well be called the age of neurotics it boasts but it can't back it up it cries peace and there is no peace it cries that it has a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire the bible says there is no peace for the wicked saith my god there's no peace to the wicked they search for it they long for it and it could be described as the age of neurotics uh uh as the bible says it say or brother branham says he says i prophesy in the name of the lord that this world will go completely insane think about that just fear for a moment the world will go completely insane my brother my sister you may not realize it but every day when you send your children to school every day you get in your car brother and you go to work every day sister you go about your life's business you are living amongst diseased people neurotic is a disease you're living amongst diseased people diseased minds diseased spirits and you say how have they how is the world became this way because it rejected the only thing that can give them peace it's rejected the only thing that could they could give them uh uh tranquility and and love and harmony it's rejected the word of god so god has given it chaos and and stress and anxiety they have rejected the word of god it's an age to where the world is completely groping as we said in darkness i believe here more than ever before that there's a especially with the latest pandemic and i want you just to stay with me very closely here this morning because i'm going to cover a lot and some of what i'm going to do is more maybe on the grounds of teaching and i believe brother adam said teach and establishes the church and so we want to bring something here this morning and just maybe bring some balance to some things i believe that the age of of neurotics that we're living in it could be no better defined than the day and age 2020 in july of 2020 uh we are maturing more and more maturing the world is more maturing to fit perfectly this description of this prophecy that the world would go completely out of their minds they would go completely insane and you're witnessing it today friend i want you to wake up pinch yourself this morning it is not an accident what's happening right now in the world it is not just it is not just random it's this entire pandemic that's hitting the world it's it's not just oh it just happened oh it's just an accident and we'll get over it my brother my sister it's not an accident the bible says the times and the seasons are in the hand of god and i believe it's the season of the rapture i believe what we're witnessing today there's no way there's no way anybody could deny what you're witnessing today is apocalyptic events transpiring things that were written about in the book of revelation maybe maybe just a preview of what's coming but what we find in this age of neurotics is a world that has gone completely insane it's an age and atmosphere that is inundated with goods wealth entertainment and and and and everything that you could think that would satisfy a person yet we find that they're not satisfied yet we find that they we and my brother my sister you're living in this age this is where you're at this is what you breathe in every single day when you go out to your job or to your work or wherever you go this is what you're breathing in every single day that is why my brother my sister it is so important that you stay in the word of god that you make that the centerpiece of your life oh as we we displayed the quote for you uh through the chat let the word of the hour be your stabilization although the fear great fear waves are a fear for waves are all around us brother adam says let the word stay in the word don't move from it let it be your stabilizer in this hour let me just say this to you today my brother my sister this is this world is groping in darkness it's it's falling apart and let me just say this there is no church affiliation that will save you from it there is no church organization no government system or structure that no prophesying is going to save you from the coming impending judgment that's coming not not even preaching the gospel will save you not even casting out demons will do it or working wonders but it's going to come down to individual character whether your deeds which means your way of living is righteous or wicked as we read in malachi chapter 3 and verse 18 then you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not we see an age that's completely a world that's fallen apart there's even a i believe a survival panic that is gripping the entire world church world included we see these things unfolded in our world and if we're not careful we become gripped by this survival mode you know the survivalist mentality and you know it becomes this this thing of well you know what's we we got to we got to be wise we got to have wisdom we got to you know we we better stock up we better store it better buy silver because look what's happening with all the with all the cash or with all the cr you know now that they'll they don't there's such a cash a coin shortage that you got to use debit card and credit card and what is it for the man what's going to happen should we buy silver should we buy gold should we all live in tents should we go out in the you know in the wilderness somewhere and build a bomb shelter and live in bomb shelter and start should we start stocking up on canned goods and you know there's this survival panic that goes across the world let me say this tragically too many believers are living in the survival panic grip as if everything was out of control my brother my sister there's one thing you you must remember god has everything in control it's very simple oh amen brother matt it becomes a cliche just think just just just dwell on that for a minute god has everything in control he's not let control go the creator has everything in control should we get ready and stash away ammunition should we buy up guns and stash away gold or diamonds and get ready for this great terrifying depression even as some have suggested to me uh here recently i had a brother sincere brother i'm sure but but brother branham said you can be sincere and sincerely wrong and uh this brother was making he was he was starting to believe that this coveted you know 19 and all this other stuff happening was at the beginning of the tribulation period and and brother branham predicted this that the the the the the message congregations would see the tribulation and realize we missed the rapture let me just say this let me just correct this here just for a moment in your minds because it's important what your anticipation and your expectation is it will determine how you live uh let me just say this today and brothers if you want to display some of those quotes i'm going to read them for those in the live stream you'll just have to listen those at churchill see this i didn't have time to put them up but the the bride i read this here in titus chapter two it's very very lord has put this upon my heart and and i want to read it to you just here for a moment uh in titus chapter 2 verse 11 through 13. now now this brother was suggesting that we are he went further and suggested that this is the tribulation right now that what you're seeing right now is the tribulation period it's just the beginning and uh and and and we missed the rapture uh the brother even went on to say the rapture was spiritual the resurrection was all spiritual it had no physical uh fulfillment which is obviously in direct uh contrary to even what not only what the message says what the bible says paul dealt with filthus and hymenius and and you go read about it where he says that concerning filthus and hymenias who say that the resurrection has already passed and paul says and he's overthrown they've overthrown the faith of many believing this this this this um false doctrine didn't start in our age it's been all the way from the age of paul that that his brother went on to say that they right that they you know that this is the tribulation and we've all missed the rapture and we've got to start preparing for the tribulation we got to start preparing how to you know how to prepare ourselves and you even you know you had this um you had this dream that we showed you and let me just i may seem scattered but let me just let me just uh express my heart here today you have this dream here that we just played to you from this dana um cover stone i think his name was wonderful wonderful video i don't regret it all playing it i think it had a uh it served its intended purpose and i trusted it that it was a blessing to you but let me just be clear uh on this man and his and his dream because i even had a very disappointing thing it's amazing sometimes how well you clarify something and and i've realized and learned uh through ministry that no matter how long you spend clarifying something or how much time you put into something somebody's gonna misunderstand it no matter how good of a job you do a plus plus plus plus plus job uh qualifying and explaining and and and and and and just qualifying everything in someone's mind someone's gonna misunderstand i had a dear sister godly sister who uh was about to take a job and uh and i played that video and she she now has not wanted to take the job said oh after that video i just need to get ready for the rapture and i thought my goodness you've missed the whole you missed the whole point you missed everything you know i believe that this video was significant i believe it has significance you know i think i shared that uh with you the sunday that we played it and and it's amazing because this this man is from kentucky he's from the same town that was brother branham's homeland his his town and uh and you know he's he's saying in this dream that he dreamed about covet and all of the masks and the riots and the protests and i believe that he did i believe very very much accurately my personal belief is that that this man no doubt had a dream that came from the lord and and he was suggesting that his future dream his other dreams he had was that coming up in november election will trigger or trigger a civil war and there will be chaos and u.n is going to have to intervene and and and you know all of these things now i appreciated everything that the man said pastor and uh you know i liked his humility he wasn't trying to make himself somebody and not trying to make himself a prophet not trying to make his dream even a prophecy or thus saith the lord said he might be wrong and and his first stream was right and i'll apologize in december if i was wrong and and all of these things were encouraging that's what made me comfortable with playing it but i realized that sometimes you put something before people and you've got to be really careful uh uh as i as i presented that to you i want to make sure it's put in your minds correctly and and i believe that you know as i said um you know that i i believe that that that that dreams are prophetic in the bible and and and the the person who the dream comes to is there's no discrimination with god who it comes to that a dream came to a false prophet balak and he prophesied a dream come to abimelech uh who who was an unrighteous man who was about to take abraham abraham's wife sarah and abraham lied and told him it was his sister and god comes to him in a dream and says you'd sleep with her you're as good as a dead man uh you have another example of pilate's wife and she says this man's come to me and and my dreams are tormenting me about this man and don't have anything to do with him just let him you know let him be and so um so i but you say brother matt who is this dream for here's here's what i know that the context of the dream the entire basis or the core theme was this message that he kept hearing brace yourself brace yourself he said i heard it again brace yourself and he said he had the dream about the calendar and and seen it in november and he said he heard the message again brace yourself here's what i know my brother my sister there is a people who should be bracing themself but there's also a people who should be preparing themselves and it's a very different message let me just say here with and i'd to slow down so that i don't just blaze right over this i want to make sure it's real clear in your minds we have received the vindicated message of god and everything god wanted us to receive to prepare us for a rapture we already have received we don't need a message from a man from kentucky we don't need a message from a man from trinidad we don't need a message from a man from australia from tucson a prophet uh it doesn't matter jesus prophet told us about this that if he's in the you know behold he goeth he's in the west and behold he's here and and you know he's in the cave and he says but but here here's the message we've received we've already received the shout and the shout was what brother brandon made it clear he said it was the message get ready come out of her my people what was the message of the hour come out of her my people that you beat what was it out of what out of denominational ideas and denominational systems and reorganized religion come out of her my people and be not partakers with her so that you receive not her plagues there is a group of people there's multiple groups of people that god speaks to in the word brother brandon picks this up in the with when he's dealing with the book of revelations and he says you have to be careful because the spirit speaks to the true vine and the false spine and you've got to know whose message is what because there's a message for every group there's a message for the foolish virgin there's a message for the for the wise virgin the elected seed of god there's a message for the reprobate there's a message for the heathen there's a message for the world there's a message for denominational systems there's a message for the bride and you say brother matt what is our message is it breaks yourself no here's our message shalom bride peace it is well it is well with my soul loved how brother aaron texted me that i texted him we were just in a conversation with some quotations and i sent him this one here that i just thought was so wonderful brother branham says now we don't have to hurry we don't have to scuffle and act like the rest of the world and he says quiet down what's the matter with the christian the spirit of the world today is neurotic but that's not the spirit of christ did you ever see him get excited about something just as calm as he could be he knowed exactly where he was standing oh listen to this he says what a blessed assurance it is just like a baby to lay your trust upon him and let him take all your cares for he cares for you don't try to do anything about it dude anything about what brother matt your cares your problems your worries your anxieties your stresses he says don't try to do anything about it he will do it already he's promised he would it's his business as long as you're fooling with it well then he can't have it but when you turn it loose and let him have it i say lord i turn it loose today he will take care of it for you yes sir oh what a perfect calmness the christian ought to have now brother aaron wrote back he says it's well with my soul the song it's well with my soul came to my mind while reading this quote whatever my lot that was taught me to say not just a teaching the the it is well teacher glory living inside of me he's my peace my calm my all in all i say amen this morning he says there's a perfect calmness about it he says you turn it loose you let him have it oh what a perfect calmness the christian ought to have what a blessed peace what a rest we ought to have so the message is not brace yourself you say brother matt who who do you believe that dream was for i believe it had a purpose an intended effect for the foolish virgin i believe for for the for the false remnant though those those who are uh uh those who aren't under the sound or the calling of the elected seed of god the bride of jesus christ i believe there's a message going forth a preparation preparing them for a tribulation and and and and even even that dream as i said you know one the sister took it that way i thought my you've completely missed the point this isn't the message for the bride now now i tell you what abimelech's dream stirred abraham who was the seed of god stirred his heart so that dream was for abimelech but it also was for abraham so so that dream was the message brace yourself was for the world man goes on to say should we buy up goods we need to buy up ammunition we need to buy buy into silver you know they have all and maybe that's right for them that's right for those uh who that message is for but my brother my sister we've received another message what is that message brother matt shalom you're not in the age of neurotics you're not to come into the spirit of a neurotic you're to be at rest a calm settled deep settled peace for the believer oh as as our brother aaron i so enjoyed wednesday night just wrote down so many notes uh that that that brother aaron had upon his heart pre-planned for god prepared let me let me give you what i thought brother aaron pre-programmed everything is pre-programmed god's not programming the stage or the show as it goes it's already been pre-programmed your life has been pre-programmed your election is secure and it's and it's before the foundation of the world glory we could preach a whole message on that but brother aaron was saying there's a constant revolving news cycle uh and and he was i think brother arne was telling him that you know he said back in his days said it wasn't like this you heard the news maybe from a newspaper maybe at the barbershop you'd hear maybe from your family member you'd hear now it's just constant push notification and you get the latest fox you get the latest whatever your news outlet is you get this latest uh little notification ding ding ding and it's constant now my brother my sister the news cycle has always been at the same speed it is today but the difference is is that we're notified and people are on edge all the time this is what breeds the age of insanity even this brother this pastor said that every day i think he said i read 40 to 50 whatever it was newspapers every single day uh that he that he reads 40 to 50 let me just find that uh in my note here that i had uh yeah he said he had read 40 to 50 newspaper uh every single day and i and i begin to think about this you know this is a message i believe it's a dream from god but it's for those who miss the rapture for those who aren't called or elected or ordained to see the message and and uh you know i i thought about that here just for a moment and let me just find my notes here i wrote down on it um and it it to me in the context of the message the difference is is that it lacks revelation this man doesn't have the revelation of the of of the end time message so what does he have for him god gives him a dream brace yourself prepare yourself there's a foolish virgin who are who are going to go through the tribulation to be purged for their sin of unbelief and god hasn't forgotten about them now let me get back to my scripture thank you lord for reminding me and titus uh chapter two now now you say brother matt what does that mean it means the message wasn't a negative message the message of the hour is not a message of get guns get ammunition uh prepare stocked goods canned goods get ready for it because it's coming no that the message of the hour is this fear not little bride we are to live and go forward in faith and not in fear of the ongoings of the world ah the the the god hasn't caught his bride to dig in and fortify herself but rather look up for your redemption draweth nigh the man makes a comedy he's reads 40 to newspapers a day perhaps maybe just the headlines i have to begin to think about this my brother my sister if you were to do this if you're constantly if you're to constantly consume this headlines all day a new cycle all day and you ingest that as brother aaron preach wednesday night and you constantly are ruled by that and you're constantly consuming that then it's going to produce an atmosphere that you live in and the atmosphere is going to be the same atmosphere of the world insanity an age of neurotics uh and i believe even we ourselves if that's what we're feeding on my brother my sister i believe we're gonna have trouble getting into the channel that the lord wants us to be in uh this overwhelming influence of the newspapers and the world would would it's going to do damage to our spirits and our mind causing us to be alarmed by some of these things we hear about when the message that we have is not a message of alarm it's a message of peace it's a message of shalom it's a message of it is well with my soul amen amen the the lord gave us a message through the eyes of a prophet and our future was revealed in that message and our future was not one of condemnation and plagues our future was a future of peace and love and faith shalom titus chapter two you don't have to turn there just listen and let me read it to you if i could just here for a moment but titus let me let me just find it here i have it written down in these notes here on my phone titus verse chapter 2 verse 11 teaching us notice what he says here teaching us this is what the word teaches us teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly now notice this last part in this present world in this cosmos in this there's a present world and there's a world coming and the bible gives us instructions you could read titus as just one of many the word gives us instructions do you realize that within the bible is contained all of the instructions of how you're to live and conduct yourself as a christian how to be a father to your children how to raise them in the admonition of god how to get the holy ghost how to be born again by the baptism of the holy ghost uh uh how to be an employer how to be an employee the word has all of this within thee all of the instructions you could need for how to live a simple christian humble simple humble christian life until the coming of the lord is right in the word of god and we have the message of the hour which is binoculars looking deeper than what the rest of the world sees when you look at a bible friends when you hold the message of the hour up what are you looking through you're looking at the word the bible which is our absolute you say brother matt what is your absolute my absolute's the same thing brother branham's absolute was he held up a leather-bound bible and said this is the only absolute god ever gave and so you say what is your absolute your opinion of that bible no that's not my absolute my absolute was the absolute interpretation of the divinely of the written word by the spoken word and who who who spoke at a kentucky hillbilly with seventh grade education no no no no that was just the vessel god used he was just the mailman the message came from the king and that's my absolute glory but within the word is all the instructions on how to live how to be an employee how to be an employer how to go to church how to have deacons how to have pastors how to have trustees how to raise children how to how to how to establish your home by the word of god everything you need to live there's instructions for how to live pre-rapture notice my my my words i'm using here everything you need to know and how to live before the coming of the lord is written right in the bible we just read it in titus chapter 2 just one verse everything you need all the instructions for how to conduct ourself and how to live our lives before the lord in this present world are right in the bible but i tell you what is not what you will not find instructions for what is missing and what paul doesn't instruct us in peter doesn't instruct a sin jesus never mentions it none of john never mentions it what you will not find is that there is nothing said or taught or instructions on how to conduct yourself or how to live in the tribulation you won't find that you won't find nothing written about when the plagues begin to fall believers this is how you're to live this is where you're to go this is what you're to do now christians you use those of you who who when the tribulation starts to fall and and judgment begins to strike you're to do this you're to go here you're to watch for this you're to buy silver you buy gold you buy stocks better buy canned goods better buy ammunition living out in the desert live 40 miles away east of any town no you don't find any of that there's nothing said or taught about how to live and conduct yourself for god's family there's nothing said about god's family because why by the map because god's people doesn't go through or to the tribulation we go through a rapture that's why there's nothing written about it do you realize my brother my sister if we are meant to go through pre-tribulational judgment then there will be something written about it but there's nothing written nor said about it brother branham says there's no place where the church ever goes through the tribulation period christ's blood and the fullness of the application of the blood of jesus christ cleanses all sin and why do we have to be purged why do we have to be purged what is the tribulation for it's for a purging and and that it's a cleansing a holy fire it purges it cleanses brother madam says why do we have to be purged we are purged daily and then he stops he says no tribulation listen listen what jesus said in saint john 5 24 he that heareth my words believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come to the judgment but is passed from death unto life amen uh brother branham says in another place you say the church has to go through the persecution for the perfection of it then he says the blood of jesus christ listen to what he says here let me read it again you say the church has to go through the persecution but the man i know we're waiting on all this covet and everything is just setting up to close the church doors it's that squeeze brother brandon referred to you know and and it's going to be persecution it's going to get hard we see nothing yet people are believers are complaining about coping we ain't seen nothing yet my brother my sister i just i i i don't i don't i don't see that in the word i don't see that in my future uh i see an age of neurotics but at the same time i see an age of not survivors with a survivor mentality the word doesn't speak about survivors doesn't speak about those survivalists living in the woods it says to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me on my throne there are no survivors of lady asea you won't survive you'll miss the rapture and you give your life for the witness for the testimony of jesus christ but for the believer there's a no there's an overcoming not a survivalist brother madam says he says you say the church has to be persecuted for the perfection of it the blood of jesus christ perfects the bride a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found grace with her she's found grace with him he engages to her and if there is anything i love that if there is anything he'll keep her from every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them a group specific and so it will be upon the bride and so it is on the bride we unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it glory you say brother matt what is in the future is it is it more uh is it more is is persecution you know as we said this brother you know made the made the comment sincere loving brother not not speaking ill about him at all brother adam says the first thing now this is on the pdf brother uh jordan if you want to display that you can the first thing was the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation say brother matt who goes through the tribulation who goes through rapture let's just teach on it here for a moment the first thing was the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation for the purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period that's what happens to the foolish virgin those without oil brother branham says that he says that they are they are not saved as you are saved now you have eternal life now the nominal believer doesn't even have eternal life now they're believing unto and they'll be granted at the white throne judgment they'll be granted eternal life you are a believer those who are born again with the baptisms the holy ghost having an inheritance a portion are the only ones with eternal life right now everybody else is believing unto you saber the mat well thank god i'm in a message church i'm exempt wrong thank god my parents were born i was born and raised in the message i'm exempt wrong my brother my sister god doesn't discriminate as we said no organization is going to save you no no newsletter you get every month is gonna save you no tithing you pay is gonna save you give all your money but lose your soul no no affiliation not even preaching will save you not even prophesying as the bible says will save you not even healing the sick or raising the dead will save you so brother matt what's going to get me in a rapture it won't be affiliation with any church or movement or message or title or family remember it'll be one affiliation and that's jesus christ that you have been purchased bought regenerated through eternal life by the baptism of the holy ghost that's the only thing that will save you because that's what purges you brother adam says we're at the end we see we're at the end there's not no way to build upon the corruption how can we build upon a city how can we build a city upon the charter ruins of a sodom and gomorrah how can we do it there's only one phoenix left and that's the coming of the lord jesus oh my a purification through the tribulation period to bring back a restoring of a world the earth for a people who are just in the sight of god and live by his word he says in the message questions and answers book one now and then at that time see the speaking of that time what that time the tribulation see the gentile bride is in heaven and the sleeping virgin the gentile virgin is not to be saved during that time she's already been saved but has been rejected in the bride and she only goes through the tribulation period for the time of purification because she has rejected christ the word for her purification then she has to suffer for her deeds but the bride who has become the word a complete atonement was made of christ because he is the word that body was rendered and when that body was rendered the bride was in that body because it's all the word amen you see it uh the conflict between god and satan there's no place where the church ever goes through the tribulation christ's blood and the fullness of the application of the blood of jesus christ cleanses all sin and why do we have to be purged we're purged daily we read this no tribulation amen the next quotation uh this is from questions and answers in 1964 the question says and of standing in line to get into church is going to be only a memory what is going to happen if we are not going through the tribulation are we are we to be seen some suffering now he's going to answer the question directly are we going to see suffering now you've got to be careful here now i know some believers minds especially those really studied in the message their minds are racing what about this brother man what about brother benham said that that you have to really suffer hard and and he says all those who are not you know uh according to that system you got to remember those were those were brother adams referring to there are believers there are christians that go through the tribulation period and and so he's referring to some of those there's a lot of quotations that you could read about because you got to remember this and just just just give me some grace here this morning to stop for a moment and teach on this there's there's two schools of thinking that you have uh people in the message have let me give you one school of thinking and i'm gonna give you the second one okay so just follow this close because both schools i can i can i can give the example brother branham gave when he's speaking about calvinism and armenianism and he says there's a ditch on the left of the road there's a ditch on the right of the road then there's the middle of the road and the truth is in the middle it's not in the left edge it's not in the right ditch and and notice this here there's two schools of thinking both are wrong here here's one school let me give you the first i'm gonna i'm gonna describe it to you the first school of thinking says there is no squeeze at all there's no persecution there's nothing left to happen only the physical return of christ and 100 percent of the quotes hey man i think maybe my audio might be out here brother jordan we still clear it it's got a call here you can just you're back okay sounds and looks good okay good amen so let me know if it goes out again i'll just continue so so the one school of thought i hope you i hope that you heard um what i don't know what you missed before before i went out i'm not too sure so i'll just start where i think uh we were i'm not sure what what didn't come through but i'll just keep reading this i know the lord had had me to read this so there's there's two schools of thought and so both schools of thought are wrong let me give you the first school of thought first school says there's no squeeze coming there's no persecution brother branham said a lot about the squeeze he said a lot about closing a church door said a lot of germ warfare but then he corrected that later and there's nothing coming everything we've been doing since the seals has just been breathing air living dying working and and nothing's happening nothing is to happen just the coming of the lord that's all there is left there's nothing else coming we don't need to look for anything else uh everything we've been doing is just living dying breathing the only thing coming is the event is the one event that's the only thing left between now and the rapture is the one event well that's one school of thinking now let me give you the second school of thinking second school of thinking says there's a squeeze coming persecution brother adam said watch the third pool then watch it you've seen it what you've seen in part he says you just watched them when that little brat is persecuted there's there's okay got it back okay so just let me know if if you lose me again brother jordan not sure what's happening here i could try even killing my video if you think that would help maybe it's a bandwidth problem not really sure um but but the the second school let me just let me uh let me just start back up the second school says uh you know that that that there's a squeeze a coming plagues are falling they're going to squeeze the bride into believing for a rapture our bodies can't even change believers bodies people are looking for a body change and that's not even you can't even look for that because the squeeze hasn't happened yet i heard one minister say that i i can't preach to you that the your bodies are going to change tomorrow that they can change any minute and that's directly contrary to everything brother brandon ever said our bodies can't change the rapture can't happen miracles can't even take place there's no real power for the believer until the squeeze comes brother man watch the third pull then watch the council begins to tighten up we're all just waiting to be hunted down like dogs laws will change they'll shut the doors of our churches now listen this is no different than the spirit of return ministry who says we're just waiting on brother branham to come back can't really do nothing need to wait for him to fulfillment my brother my sister you missed the message you missed the whole point uh uh god's god didn't make an accident there wasn't a mistake that took place everything's on time according to god so so the the here's here's what i know now let me just stop here for a moment and say this you have to remember that it was it was the captivity it was the captivity of god's people that caused daniel to be it was the captivity the suffering it was the the bad situation it was the pressure in the world that caused a man named daniel to begin to read and the bible says he understood by books that the desolation of jerusalem was almost over and and and and and notice this here much like that if anything this pandemic has done as it's caused us to reevaluate the subject of the coming of the lord to dig in to take a fresh look into the word that was sent to us because we don't tend to discuss these kind of things in times of peace we don't even think about them in times of peace and calm what we call normal times what i also know is that we have to be so careful as ministers we have to be so careful in how we draw lines and our understanding of subjects like these it doesn't mean that we can't draw lines meaning definite definitive conclusions but we need to be careful how we draw them lest we think that we have all the answers lest we think that that we know everything you know i i just test witness to you here today i i begin to put a document together and i titled that document what's next question mark what's next and i i my intent the goal the motive was i wanted to compile a document of everything that happens uh at the coming of the lord we have the rapture then and put it in chronological timeline of this is what happens the the dead saints raised and then jesus uh reappears then we're here for 30 to 40 days and then we meet him in there then what happens after the rapture then the plagues start to fall california this is where california fits in this is where the world council of churches who the rome who controls the politics and begins to shut the churches down this is when that happens this is when the prophets appear this is when judgment day happens this is the bema the when the reward ceremony happens this is when the millennium happens this is and i wanted to put everything in a chronological order so that i can look into the timeline good good idea said but then that wow boy i'd pay money for that document i bet you would i began to realize as i began to compile it the lord just spoke to me and stopped me and said that's not how i've designed it i don't want you to be able to mathematically calculate everything that's going to happen now doesn't mean we don't know some things doesn't mean we don't know we can't discern the times and seasons but the bible says this in the book of acts of the times and the seasons god has put it in his own power and god begged to stop me and said that's not how i've designed this brother branham said over and over and over again god interprets his word by bringing it to pass so you say brother matt what does that mean that means that god didn't intend for us to all figure we don't know everything god didn't intend for us to have every every single question that we could possibly have answered and we know it all we're just know-it-alls because i believe that the lord always leaves up that he said but the matter does that mean we just don't figure out anything no that's not what i'm saying i believe we should be sober we should be vigilant we should we should be sober minded studying staying in the word of god finding out everything we possibly can looking into the message but i believe that there are certain things god leaves a portion of things to be interpreted by bringing it to pass and and and i believe that there are some things we know because we can know them and there are certain things that we don't know because we can't know and god doesn't want us to know right now even the seventh seal how do you remember the portion of the seventh seal that brother branham said it was silence it was the coming of the lord and and there was there was a phase of you know the third pool that was in an unknown tongue and couldn't be interpreted why do you think well there was no interpreter it was unknown because even the seventh seal has an element or a fold to it brother adam said that we don't understand that would include the coming of the lord the rapture of the church god will unfold these things in time by bringing it to pass as brother branham said over and over and over and over yet we have to realize as mature sons and daughters of god that at the same time we have to realize our position that god has called us to for such a time as this is to rightly divide the word and the present events and the current events happening to rightly divide it based upon the word that we've been given so there's a balance as we said a left and a right ditch and what we have to realize many are running to and fro and being tossed by every wind of doctrine but god has given us the stabilizer of our faith and that's the revelation of the word of the hour brother adam says in broken cisterns someone called me not long ago from up in the east and said brother branham i hear you've moved out to arizona and you've formed a place where there there's a safety whether there's there's safety and as you know how the message come and the lord told me what would happen in alaska and how down through california it would be and it's just been that way they said now if that's shaking and everything where is the safety zone brother branham where they were looking for a physical location where can we live what do we do brother branham says there's only one safety zone that i know that's in christ for those that are in christ are safe oh brother branham says in seed of discrepancy we find out god gave his children the best word that he says he says we find out god gave his children his word for their defense we have no other defense than the word of god that is our defense and there's no bombs no shelters no hiding place no arizona's california's or whatever it is there's there's only one defense we have and that's the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us which is christ jesus he is our only defense being in him we are safe so what we realize is that even in the ministry of brother branham there was a changing where he he begins to uh we we understand that something takes place but both supernaturally and naturally when christ was put out of the church in revelations uh chapter three the bible says you know that the the behold i stand at the door and knock so something happened in our in our age in our time in our generation where christ was put outside of the church and something naturally happened and something spiritually happened as well that that god called out a bride out of that church that had put him out so you see that the quotes that you can have and there you can give me hundreds of them uh brother random refers to a persecution and he says it this way he says there will come a persecution to run us together and and they they're they're all of those quotes that brother brandon mentions that there's come into persecution they'll run us together and they'll run us together and there's coming a squeeze all of those quotes that you read are in the context of brother branham having a church world view of the book of revelations remember after the seals brother branham says the bible became a brand new book so what was it pre-seals it was a church view it was a denominational view he even had the white horse writer this shouldn't be new to you as message believers this cover and some of this should be reviewed but but brother branham even had the white horse writer as christ he said he had it totally wrong even before he goes to preach the seals brother brandon says i had it all wrong he said then the angel met me there in that back room each night the angel lord would come and correct him and give him the interpretation of that seal he was going to preach brother man says i would have made an awful mistake i would have made a horrible mistake had it not been for the lord so when you so you say brother matt what does that mean that that means that all the quotes you read about persecution coming he's he sees the book of revelations he even applies the tribulation to to groups that he misapplied it to or reap or or reapply it to after the seals and questions and answers even even the feast of the trumpets brother brandon thought himself that was for the gentiles that was for the for the bride until god corrects him has a plane ticket to go to israel and god correct him says it's not the time and it's not your place even before the seals brother i mean before a feast of the trumpets and so he he has a church view of the book of revelations and he was trying to break down denominational barriers that was his that was his motive there will be a persecution brother man when that persecution comes then all of our barriers will drop down and all run us all together baptist with pentecostals with methodists with lutherans with church of christ church of god all of us will run together there's got to be a unity there's got to be a unity but then he comes and he preaches a message the seed shall not be air with the shock there had to be of necessity a pulling away of the shock from the seed not just naturally not just a natural separation where doors were closed to the prophet pulpits shut him out the world shut him out that was not just naturally that was spiritually that was christ being put out of the church not that brother branham was christ physically he was jesus christ it was the word that was rejected not a man it wasn't brother branham who they rejected they rejected christ the word wouldn't have been insignificant how they rejected that oh now now it was it was at this point that brother branham becomes the voice his voice he becomes the voice the man he becomes the fulfillment of the voice of revelations 14 18 4 where where revelations 18 4 and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not her plagues we must as believers realize that just as the seals were a milestone for the prophet a marker a junction the feast of the trumpets were as well even in the feast of the trumpets something changed in the way the prophet applied specifics concerning the squeeze or the persecution to run us together he realized god did not intend to run us together with the rest of the church world but to separate us separated people unto himself and bring the bride together not to a spirit not to a physical place but a spiritual atmosphere of safety in christ so this this brother who listen to what brother adam says here and he says this is this is uh you have the quotations brother jordan for this um you have the quotations for this you can you can display if you want he's asked the question and standing in line to get to church there's not going to be a memory are we going to have to go through suffering if we're not deceit brother madam says now now this question is probably this i'm trying to hurry i ought not to do this ought to lay these back because there's a place you could stay in on an hour and just tear it down i'll just stop i'll stop and he says look the people are wanting to say now notice this is after notice the date 1964 questions and answers this is after the feast of the trumpets at the feast of the trumpets you go and look up the quotes that's the quote we read brother branham says he says why would a man a husband for his wife put her through a bunch of suffering she's already found grace in his sight so brother madam shifts his entire view and the feast of the trumpets and and you know why because brother branham says that the angel of the lord met him in his room he comes to his wife go read the beginning of the feast of the trumpets he comes and says honey i would have gotten it all wrong he said the lord showed up and totally changed it for me now listen to what he's going to answer to this question are we going to go through suffering this is this is questions and answers are we going to go through suffering brother branham says look the people are wanting to say that thinking the church is going to hit the tribulation see it won't it can't because it's already redeemed now the church the nominal believers like lot he's going through the tribulation period and be saved as if it was by fire noah went through the tribulation period carried above it come out with ham who polluted the earth again see lot came out his daughter slept with him had children by his own daughter see but abraham brought forth the royal seed brought forth the seed of promise enoch went to glory in the rapture just took a walk and went home he never went through the tribulation period you see there you are see the bible cannot be by type and this this types can't fail see it does not predict that the bride now the church will go through the tribulation period now the people say what about the early saints that was the changing of the dispensation they were martyred they were persecuted even today there's persecution in other countries but that's not what's bringing perfection for rapturing faith brother adam says that was under persecution which is if you were here to hear this church jesus to see how they went under the darkness and he says i had to do that then that shows where they had take where had they had to take the persecution because each one of the church ages everything began to show that they were under the darker that they went darker and darker till they finally went into a complete place that they denied his name and picked up another name and they lived and they were dead sardis and then it come on out of that thiatira sardis then come out of that then it began to come out to the philadelphia and so forth and then come to the time of the calling of the bride which was to escape all the damnation it counted worthy to escape all a l l this damnation and wrath that's to come upon the earth that you might be counted worthy to escape it not go through it escape it do you understand everybody the church the lukewarm the anything outside of the elected bride but the ma who is the elected bride is it all those at tucson tabernacle is it all those at this church is it all those who say they believe a prophet is it all those who have message books in their homes no doesn't do you a bit of good no association no organization will save you no preaching will save you no prophesied will save you no gifts will save you no healing will save you no resurrection will save you that doesn't put you into the bride there will be many who miss the rapture that that foolish virgin will be made up of of anyone without the baptism of the holy ghost and it will not discriminate based upon whose church you go to or who your daddy was or who your mommy was or who your grandfather was or your grandmother was it won't discriminate it looks at one thing the blood that's why the message of today is you must be born again born by the spirit of god you don't get that by believing you say how am i born again by believing the message no that devils believe and tremble it's by a baptism of the holy ghost that you know that you know that you know that you met god by a pentecostal experience you say what is pentecost it's an experience it's different for everybody not the same for for one maybe maybe one it's just something that settles down inside of their heart maybe it's another they speak in tongues maybe another brother brandon it feels like water on your back maybe for another you pick up a piece of paper and you've been changed from that point on it's different for everybody but but here's what you know you make sure you got it make sure you know that you know that you know that should not hope so but that you got to know so in your life he says the church the lukewarm anything outside of the elected bride will go through the tribulation period very clear very clear they will not raise in the first resurrection and he quotes the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years so they miss the millennium they raise up after just the four ordained predestinated elected bride god's own election who is it brother branham i love this who is it brother branham i don't know i can't tell you who it is but i know it's going to be there because the lord said they would they are the ones who that'll go up from the tribulation but the rest of them will go through the tribulation go down and everything will be killed before the millennium then the righteous will come out in the millennium and live a thousand years my brother my sister if brother brandon was asked the question today he'd answer it the exact same way the squeeze people have looked for happens in the tribulation brother brandon makes it clear in the feast of the trumpets that the bride receives her squeeze in an ecclesiastical manner while it's israel who receives it in a physical manner the church will go through that time but not the bride he says it over and over again you say brother matt what is the ecclesiastical squeeze is a spirit that's been loosed upon the bride to try to kill the anointing to try to stifle the life in the church to try to make our message a dead formal religion where we're dead formal church members where we come to dead churches with no life no joy no love that's the ecclesiastical squeeze that's that's the delilah that's upon you church it's to try to destroy the anointing try to destroy the gifts of the spirit try to hush out divine healing try to put out the fire of the holy ghost get rid of prayer lines get rid of altar calls get rid of real lively worship where you worship god in spirit and in truth and in passion remember the math is that is it coronavirus that we need to fear no my brother it's that's the virus you need to fear that's the one we need to fight against and be concerned about one who tries to kill the reality of the living fire breathing holy ghost-filled church glory brother branham says he says that it says loose in the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what this is feast of the trumpets not upon the denominations upon the bride but here you'll get it the bride will not go through that time the bible says not the church will but not the bride can't you see it ministers can't you see it brethren you say the church has to go through the persecution for the perfection of it and then he says the blood of jesus christ perfects the bride glory uh brother and sister we can put in hundreds of quotes that say the same exact thing oh you say brother matt well you just got to have revelation you've got to read between the lines you got to it's not exactly there i know i know brother branham never said that the rapture was spiritual the resurrection was spiritual i know he never really said those things i know it there's no no he didn't say those things he didn't even say anything close to that not even remotely attached to that not even close oh the resurrection's spiritual it's not natural it's not physical it doesn't really happen the coming of the lord jesus everyone's looking for a literal coming of jesus it's not going to happen it's all spiritual it's not really there we've all missed it i i know i know that brother adam never said that brother matt you got to read between the lines you've got to you've got to you've got in order to have revelation you've got to read between the lines in order to see the picture listen to me brother and sister i love reading between the lines but what we read between the lines must still be in agreement with what's on the lines and many times people assert and presume things that are nowhere close to anything brother branham ever taught we must stick with what's on the tapes not our ideas not our opinions we check our opinions and ideas with the word and when they disagree with the word we chuck out our opinions oh scripture tells us that the the brother says oh scripture tells us that the dead in christ would rise first and and he said the brother went on to say the dead in christ have indeed risen and we missed it because we it didn't come as we we expected it my brother uh to believe this way is a is a gross uh uh misunderstanding it's directly contrary to what brother branham taught or what the bible teaches that teaching can't be substantiated with any quotes or scriptures it simply can be substantiated by one thing man's opinions and let me just say this you're welcome to your opinions but i'll i'll stick with the word of god i'll stick with the word of god oh brother madam says three kinds of believers listen to this i hope you got it displayed brother jordan if you don't it's fine i hope you got a display for those at least in church three kinds of believers 1963 listen what brother branham says that's the reason i do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and said in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride that will take her from the earth in a rapturing grace notice what he doesn't say he doesn't say that i believe that there will come a there will come a sound of coronavirus there will come the sound of to russian troops there will come a sound of a you in and chinese soldier marching there will come a sound of a shortage of food a shortage of coins and then that'll put the bride no my brother my sister that's not word of war to be looking to he says there will come a sound from heaven that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit they don't take her from off the earth i say lord send it like rain o god send that rushing mighty wind of the baptism of the holy ghost that will take your people off the earth in a rapturing grace brother adam says god promised it now listen he says i don't care how much science how many astronauts they signed up and everything else how many millions of miles they can see i don't care nothing about it there is a heaven and there is a jesus christ there that will come in a body form to receive his church let me read it again there is a heaven and there is a literal jesus christ that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth god said so and that's what believers believe i'd say yes that's what believers believe and my brother my sister let me just say now more than ever before it's time for believers to believe the unbelievers unbelieving the make believers make believing but believer let me just encourage you this morning believe now more than ever before believe believers stand on the word of god oh be shut into the secret place of god don't be consuming so much and consumption of the world and to put you in a state of of a neurotic let you consume as brother aaron preach wednesday night let your expectations be upon that prepared city that prepared place oh it says brother and read there in hebrews 11 they were not mindful they weren't thinking about the world of where they came from they were thinking about the world they were going to that's what consumed them that's what consumed them every single day oh i want it to consume me i want to say lord let me line my life up with the word not try to line the word up not try to line take take my life and make the word pattern after my life but let me pattern my life after the word first corinthians 14 37 if any man notice this if any man thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual let this is paul paul speaking says if any man thinks him spiritual to be a prophet let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord let me just say this brother my brother my sister just as the apostle paul was the authority to the ephesian church age we have received a vindicated prophet who came to bring a message that would introduce jesus christ and let me just say this the rapture is a process it's a cycle it's a shout it's a voice it's a trumpet god always perfected in three the message always comes in three the the brother adam said his coming is in three stages redemption rapture and millennium he's already came in redemption he's gonna come in rapture and then we'll be with him in the millennium the shout the voice the trumpet and the rapture cycle let me wake you up today the rapture cycle has already begun we have already received the message which is the shout and what was the message get ready little bride make your self not brace yourself prepare yourself and the bible says his bride has made herself ready his bride hath made herself ready oh i didn't really get to my thought this morning that's all right we just had a lot of ground to cover it's already amen going on 12 o'clock now we're going to have you uh close we're going to close this here brothers sisters brother peter come and musicians come let's all stand to our feet amen together i trust this came through i know we had um a few uh issues with the stream amen just what a lord put upon my heart the age of neurotics but there's a there's a people who the bible says malachi chapter 3 i love this malachi chapter 3 then they verse 16 then they speaking of a people that feared the lord spoke often one to another and the lord musicians if you could just come and play something and then softly i'm gonna turn it quickly over amen back to my brother peter and the lord hearkened i love that they that feared the lord he was identifying something and there was an age of neurotics there was an age that was going insane but then there was a people there was a people who feared the lord they spoke often one to another oh you're just speaking about the goodness of god speaking about the word of god uh speaking about about what the word means to you a constant inspiration and flow of the spirit oh he says he says they spoke often one to another and the lord hearkened he hearkened he had drew him something about that drew him and the bible says and he heard it and a book of remembrance you think you think that your your deeds that you live in your flesh mean nothing to god brother branham said they're written down in the book he says a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and i love this and that thought upon his name i just thought of that scripture as i was reading it last night i said lord let me be maybe you can just bow your heads with me here across the building every head bowed ever i closed maybe you could just say that today by an uplifted hand say lord i want to think about your name daily lord i want to remember you so that you'll remember me oh his brother brandon picks it up and he says there he says he'll speak and he says the voice of he says oh the voice of uh uh uh of of jesus brother and picks that up and he says oh he says i will put i will put upon you no none other burden oh brother branham begins to pick that up and and he says there's no there's no voice he says like that voice there's no he says everyone man loves to hear a claim they love to hear his name brother adam says man loves to hear his name spoken over a pulpit or if i was to say your name this morning it'd bring and bring joy to you to have your name mentioned in public it brother branham says it just brings such a a sweet feeling when someone mentions your name in front of others brother adam says there's he says oh but my brother my sister there will be no sweeter feeling than when when you hear the name at that great white throne he says when jesus speaks your name and says there was brother aaron there was brother peter there was brother jordan there was brother matt oh there was brother paul oh there was brother lyle there was oh he begins to speak the name oh there was this sister and that brother and this sister and brother and says when he began to speak that name and he says they stood for me on earth and now i'll stand for them they weren't ashamed of me and i'm not going to be ashamed of them brother branham says there will be no sweeter voice no sweeter time you hear your name called than when jesus calls your name i'll begin to think about that lord you're writing a book of remembrance for those that fear your name that speak to one another often oh and a book was written for them that feared the lord and thought upon his name and then you stop lord and i just want this to be said of me maybe someone here could raise their hand they could think of their family you could think father of your children your wife your maybe mother you want to say lord let this be said of me and they shall be mine saith the lord of hosts in that day when i make up my jewels and i will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him lord let me be identified as that lord is righteous one who speaks of your name often i'm so glad lord that my future is not a future embrace yourself oh that's the message to the world but the message to the bride is fear not little flock it's the desire of your father to give you the kingdom of god oh you you have a pool you you sir you you you have a thirst for god you have a you have a pool for god you want more of god brother branham said that's only that's only because that god's pulling you you only desire god because god desires you there's only there's a pool brother and said if there's a deep there's got to be a deep to respond you don't realize my brother my sister that righteousness that you desire when you want the holy spirit in your life you want more of god in your life it's because god's desiring to give you more of himself and i say this morning maybe you could say that by an uplifted hand as we close and we sing just here for a moment lord deliver me from the spirit of this world deliver me from this age of neurotics lord let me hear that message of shalom peace bride calm oh oh there's nothing to fear there's nothing to there's nothing to fear there's nothing to worry about there's nothing to stress over there's

nothing to fear little bride oh you've already been found in the beloved you've already been found in the in god all in the midst of of all of the terror and panic in the world brother branham says
