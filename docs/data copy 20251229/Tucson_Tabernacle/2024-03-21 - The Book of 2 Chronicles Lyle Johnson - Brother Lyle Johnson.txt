you cast all your cares on him for he cares for you he is our peace he is our peace thank you so much good evening it's good to see you it's good to see each one tonight oh we have an overview of the book of 2 Chronicles as you noticed with First Chronicles a perspective of Chronicles is very different than that of Kings Kings tells a lot about Elijah and Elisha and other prophets it's full of details about the various Kings of Israel as well as Judah Chronicles concerns itself with Kings primarily of Judah their genealogies and only briefly mentions various prophets Elijah for example is mentioned exactly once Elisha not at all in the Jewish Bible called the Tanakh which is an acronym combining the Torah the prophets and what they call the writings Chronicles is the last book not Malachi is in our old Testament ordering Chronicles was perhaps the last book written or edited in the Old Testament prior to its canonization and by that we mean it being accepted as holy writ from God to be read to be studied but not to be edited and not to be altered before we open our Bibles tonight let's speak with the author One More Time Lord Jesus it's a humbling experience to be here Lord to stand before the people that you purchase at an awful price but yet a price you gladly paid for each one Lord we pray that you accept our worship this evening and that Lord you would speak to us through your word Lord tonight it will be mostly your word not very many comments and it's from you Lord that we draw our strength we draw our guidance Lord forgive us where we have fallen short forgive me Lord help my sins help my shortcomings everything about me to just be out of the way Lord that you can speak that you can move Lord Jesus we thank you for your for your love and your grace and Lord we're aware of someone here in the audience who's lost a very dear friend Lord I pray that you would comfort their heart Comfort the hearts of those families Lord just draw Us close to yourself we thank you for each moment that you give us in this life that we can draw breath and serve you we thank you in Jesus precious name amen it's a book of 2 Chronicles so we'll start with a few verses from Hebrews chapter n Paul's writing about the Tabernacle and the Ark which was later placed in the first temple which we'll hear about this evening Hebrews 9 ver1 Paul says then verily the first Covenant also had ordinances of divine service and a worldly Sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the table and the shoe bread which is called The Sanctuary that's where only priests could go and Minister and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had mana and aon's Rod that budded and tables of the Covenant and over it the cherubim of Glory shadowing The Mercy Seat of which we cannot now speak particularly please be seated when we studied the book of Kings we discussed Saul David Solomon in some detail after the nation split we discussed rabam king of Judah and three the Kings of Israel jeroboam Ahab and jahu jeroboam out of fear rejected the Lord's promise and established amazing made up religion something he invented himself with madeup gods and madeup holidays and Idols in the form of Cales and place them in Dan in the north and bethl at the southern part of his territory near Jerusalem we learned of Ahab and his dominant wife Jezebel we saw jahu execute judgment on Ahab Jezebel and ahab's male offspring we touched on the ministries of prophets like Elijah and Elisha First Chronicles provided genealogical information for the first several chapters about various Kings and so forth and and then it focused on King David we learned that David brought the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem and placed it in a tent it had always been in a tent but this was a new tent that he made for it he then Drew up the plans and started importing the materials needed to build a temple to house it and after a bit of Palace Intrigue he named Solomon as his successor what will we find in second chronicles there it is seems like I located a special Sabbath supplement to the Daily parchment we see some 71 headlines 16 of them deal with Solomon almost a quarter of the total apart from Mostly passing references to the Northern Kingdom of Israel this entire book focuses on the kings of the Southern kingdom known as Judah they're not limited to descendants of Jacob's son of that name his clan or tribe 2 Chronicles covers a period of just under 400 years from Solomon's Reign starting in 970 BC through the conquest of Israel in 723 BC to the destruction of the temple in 587 uh this evening we'll focus first on Solomon and the temple is that a little hard to see ah no binoculars sitting too far back uh is that better okay so first Solomon there'll be a lot of reading but this is after all a Bible study 2 Chronicles opens on a hope hopeful note we'll see that it closes on a hopeful note as well 2 Chronicles 1 and Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom and the Lord his God was with him and the Lord magnified him exceedingly then Solomon spoke unto all Israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds to the judges to every governor in all Israel the chief of the fathers he gathered them together so Solomon and all the congregation with him went to the high place that was at gibian for there was the Tabernacle of the congregation of God which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness some 450 years prior to this but the Ark of God had David brought up from curiot urum to the place which David had prepared for it for he had pitched a different tent for it at Jerusalem well we read that they gather and they worship with numerous sacrifices and going on to verse 7 and that night did God appear into Solomon God speaks to Solomon twice in his life and said unto him ask what I shall give thee and Solomon said unto God thou Hast showed great Mercy unto David my father and has made me to reign in his stead now oh Lord God let thy promise unto David thy my father be established for thou Hast made me King over a people like the dust of the earth and multitude give me now wisdom knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people for who can judge who can govern who can rule over this thy people that is so great and God said to s man because this was in thine heart and thou Hast not asked riches wealth or honor nor the life of thine enemies neither yet H has asked for long life but has asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself that thou mayest judge my people over whom I have made thee King wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee that was the good part and I will give thee riches and wealth and honor such as none of the Kings have had that have been before thee neither shall there any after thee have the like that sounds really good Solomon eventually became spiritually impoverished in the midst of extraordinary wealth and Grandeur then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gideon to Jerusalem from before the Tabernacle of the congregation and reigned over Israel in Chapter 2 Solomon begins construction of the temple which David had designed as we learned in 1 Chronicles we find out in chapter 3 that construction began in the second month of his fourth year but there's something in chapter two that I had not noticed before that I thought I'd bring to your attention this evening about the people that built and decorated the temple it says Solomon told out that means he counted out or assigned or conscripted 3 score and 10,000 70,000 men to bear birth burdens carry stuff around and four score th000 80,000 to heue in the mountain to be Stone Cutters to quarry stone this is all hard work and 3,600 to oversee to supervise them that's 153,00 in total we'll get back to that number in a moment and Solomon sent to ham the king of tyer saying as thou did deal with David my father and just send him Cedars to build him and house to dwell therein even so deal with me behold I I build a house to the name of the Lord my God to dedicate it to him and to burn before him sweet incense for the continual showbread for the burnt offerings morning and evening on the sabbaths on the new moons on the solemn Feast of the Lord Our God this is an ordinance forever to Israel to my people and the house which I build is great for Great Is Our God above all gods but who's able to build him and house seeing the heaven and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him who am I then that that I should build a house save only to burn sacrifice before him send me now therefore a man cunning skilled to work in gold and silver and brass and iron and purple and crimson and blue and that can skill to grave with in other words teach and supervise the cunning men the skillful workers and Craftsmen that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem whom David my father did provide skipping down to verse 14 part of Hon's reply uh the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan and his father was a man of Tire uh skillful to work in gold and silver brass Iron Stone and Timber and purple and blue and fine linen and in Crimson also to grave any manner of graving any kind of Engraving to find out every device which shall be put to him in other words he can execute any design any task that's given to him this guy can do it and with thy cunning men skillful work skilled workers or craftsmen and with the cunning men of my Lord David thy father the list goes on for cedar wood and so forth the lead Artisans of the temple are from hyram they're Gentiles they will direct the skilled workers of Israel and at the very end of this chapter we read Solomon numbered all the strangers all the foreigners the the temporary residents that were in the land of Israel after number ing wherewith David his father had numbered them and they were found to be 153,00 there's that number again and he set he assigned 70,000 of them to be bearers of burdens and 80,000 to be hewers in the mountain to be Stone Cutters and 3,600 overseers to set the people to work to make the people work Solomon was requiring The Strangers to do the heavy lifting and the Quarry work Gentiles Gentiles provided the materials and Gentiles led the skilled people in the building and the decorating of the temple I'm sorry I can't move a magnifying glass around that for you but chapters three and four detailed dimensions of the temple the the holy of holies which is this area right here was a 30 foot Cube 30 feet wide 30 feet deep 30 feet tall they talk about 20 cubits uh it's while it was taller than our church is about the same length of our building not quite as wide in fact if you I I overlaid but the drawing got to be way too cumbersome the U the little drawing up here and I overlaid that over an aerial photograph set to the same scale of the church the whole Temple would fit within the walls of our building not not including the old school building the the upper room and so forth the entire Temple the store rooms everything would fit in this space it's a little bit taller the construction of the temple took seven years 2 Chronicles 5:1 tells us thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated the silver and the gold all the instruments put he among the Treasures of the house of God then Solomon assembled the Elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel into Jerusalem to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the city of David which is Zion from the tent that David had prepared for it just a few hundred yards away wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month the seventh month there's three feasts trumpets atonement and Tabernacles all occur during that month but we'll learn from chapter 7 that this is in fact during the Feast of Tabernacles going on to verse 7 the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place to the Oracle of the house that's the holy of holies the inner chamber into the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubim for the Cherub beam spread forth their wings over the place of the Ark and the Cherub beam covered the ark and the staves thereof above I I just have to say this I'm sorry the King James version talks about cherub booms no no no no one is a cherub not a cherub multiple are cherubim not cherubims it's just sorry that's your Hebrew lesson for this evening now I can take off that hat put on this other one okay and they drew out the staves of the Ark that's the poles that They carried it on that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle but they were not seen without outside of it you couldn't see that and there it is unto this day so we know when you'll find certain references to unto this day that this book is being written not all at one sitting but this is a Chronicle historians record keepers are writing these things down and at the point that this was written he says and at the day that I'm writing this that stuff is still there you'll see that as we go along there are changes of things that are no longer there so so don't get when I was a kid I said I want to go there and see that cuz the Bible says it's there to this day well um it was there to this day then it's not there to this day now that that's a different this day there's never been a day like this day we sing sometimes there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put there and at horb when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt recall in our opening scripture Paul says that there was not only that but there was aob of mana and Aaron's Rod that bued those had disappeared at some point probably in the account in 1 Samuel where the the the children of Israel bring the ark before this battle of the Philistines because they're losing they figure well if we carry this thing if we treat it like an idol if we carry this out in front of us and wave Our God in front of them this Ark that we're going to win no the Philistines captured the ark they eventually sent it back after they had a lot of problems and where they dropped it off there says it's several thousand people were killed because they dared to look inside the box so it could be that that's when these things were lost but we don't really know it came to pass when the priests were come out of the Holy place for all the priests that were present were Sanctified and did not then wait by course later on there's so many priests that they set them up in divisions this is your week you go the second week of the month you go the fourth week of the month that sort of thing at this point they're all gathered there also the Levites which were the sing singers all of them of Asaf this fellow Asaf is called a Seer later in this book and there's at least 12 Psalms that introduce themselves as a Psalm of Asaf we heard about Asaf under First Chronicles of Asaf of hon of jedin and their sons and their Brethren being arrayed in white linen having symbols and sues and harps stood at the East End of the altar that's a picture of a of a salt from about that period of time from a from a statue and a fellow that's plucking at a at a harp um after they had invented photography so it's not so old and with them 120 priests sounding with trumpets and it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord speaking of unity here and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praised the Lord saying what is it they said for he is good for his mercy endureth forever all the people said that for he is good for his mercy endureth forever let's try it again for he is good for his mercy endureth forever amen hallelujah that when all these conditions music celebration Praise of the heart one mind and one Accord then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God notice it wasn't because Solomon was there it was When Praise in unity was offered not the sacrifices on the altar but in their praise do we want the presence of the Lord in our midst time is short we have a lot to cover so read some more excerpts about this uh dedication but in your devotions read these chapters about the dedication it's a marvelous moment in the history of Israel beautiful beautiful words and things that happened Solomon prays at the dedication and we'll go here to Chronicles 6 verse1 Solomon's praying the Lord therefore hath performed his word that he has spoken for I am risen up in the room of David my father and have set on the throne of Israel as the Lord promised and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel for his name not for his dwelling place and in it have I put the ark wherein is the Covenant of the Lord that he made with the children of Israel it's like a safe deposit box it contains a contract that's what a covenant is it's a contract you do this I'll do that down to verse 18 but the will of God in very deed but will God in very deed dwell with men on Earth behold Heaven and the heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house which I have built have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication oh Lord my God to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee that thine eyes may be open Upon This House day and night upon the place where of thou Hast said thou wouldest put thy name there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place hearken therefore under the supplications of thy servant and of thy People Israel which they shall make toward this place hear thou from thy Dwelling Place even from heaven and when thou hearest forgive read this chapter your devotions it is just beautiful skip to chapter 7 now when Solomon had made an end of praying fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the house and the priest could not minister no no at this point they could not even enter into the house of the Lord because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's House and when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the Lord upon the house they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshiped and praised the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever skipping to verse 11 thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord and the King's house which took another 13 years and was much larger than the temple and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the Lord and in his own house he prosperously affected and going back down to the time of the dedication of the temple the Lord appeared unto Solomon By Night the second time and said unto him I have heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself for an House of sacrifice if I shut up Heaven that there be no rain rain or if I command the locusts to Devour the land or if I send pestilence among my people if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways repent then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place for now have I Chosen and Sanctified this house that my name may be there forever and mine eyes and Mine Heart shall be there perpetually but be careful Solomon be very careful because as for thee if there are three conditions first thou wil walk before me as David thy father walked and second do according to all that I have commanded thee and third shalt observe my statutes and my judgments then will I establish the Throne of thy kingdom according as I have covenanted with David thy father saying there shall not fail a man shall fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel but Solomon if you don't do these things the consequences are far far worse than you can imagine pay attention son but if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my Commandments which I have set before you and not only that but if you in egyan shall go and serve other gods gods and worship them then I will pluck them the gods no the People Israel I will pluck them up by the roots out of their land no the Lord says out of my land which I have given them and this house that you just built and dedicated that I filled with my presence which I have Sanctified for my name will I cast out of my sight and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations this is about a whole lot more than your descendants ruling my people Solomon are you listening and this house which is high shall be an astonishment to everyone that passes by it so that he'll say why has the Lord done this unto this land and unto this house and it shall be answered because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them it's about humility it's about obedience the next few chapters tell of his well the visit of the Queen of Sheba Chronicles doesn't tell of the way he turned from the Lord in his latter years we we learned about that in Kings some more lines here from the daily parchment his son rabam was 41 when he took the throne and had witnessed the Splendor of his dad's Kingdom and his dad falling farther and farther away from the Lord chapter 10 lays the blank for the kingdom splitting on ryab bomes following bad advice which is true but as we just read that happened because Solomon turned away forsook the Lord's statutes and Commandments and worshiped other gods rehoboam is following in his Father's Footsteps dads are you listening followed his Father's Footsteps the chapter ends and Israel rebelled against the House of David unto this day when this part of Chronicles was written the two kingdoms Israel and Juda existed it's often confusing to hear the words Israel and Judah Israel is a name given to Jacob it's a name used to describe the people descended from Jacob in the Bible up until the time the kingdom is split it's also the name of the Modern Nation in the Middle East shown to the left on the screen once the ancient Kingdom split the northern part continued to be called Israel this is the area shaded in light green on the right side of this green the southern part takes on the name of Judah one of Jacob's sons this is shaded in lavender on the lower part of the screen I've circled Jerusalem on each map for reference to help you link things together well after Solomon's Reign the United Kingdom of Israel was divided into these two Nations these two kingdoms Israel and Judah Israel is ruled first by jeroboam Judah by rehoboam both forsake the Lord and worship idols and lead the people further into sin and Disobedience arranging them from the Lord but chapter 11 tells us that in spite of the hard rule of rehoboam over Judah we read the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him to rabam they came to him out of all their coasts out of all their borders throughout jeroboam's Kingdom of Israel they fled to RAB booms Kingdom of Judah for the Levites left their suburbs and their possessions remember under Joshua the tribe of Levi had cities scattered all throughout the territory but they had no contiguous parcel of land of their own so they left those places and came to Judah and Jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the Lord and He jeroboam ordained for himself self priest for the high places and for the devils and for the calves which he had made and installed as you recall in Dan and bethl and after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto the Lord God of their fathers so they the priests Levites those who desired to worship and follow the lord they strengthened the kingdom of Judah made rabam the son of Solomon strong for three years for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon rabo ruled for 17 years though the first three were harsh he walked in the way of the Lord sadly by the fifth year he had forsaken the law of the Lord and the people with him shishak of Egypt came and spoiled ransacked Jerusalem only only 34 years after the temples dedicated its plundered while Judah forsakes the Lord 12 years later rehoboam is dead and is followed by his son abijah 2 Chronicles tells of a huge battle between Israel and Judah this is a nation broken into two kingdoms killing each other not all that different I suppose than America of 170 odd years ago the lord gave abijah a great victory over jeroboam's forces a Slaughter of Israel's Army by Judas First Kings fills in other parts of the story we learn that abijah quote walked in all the sins of his father rabam abijah lasted three years and died it's now been 20 years since Solomon died aija son ASA takes the throne and rules for 41 years who's ASA we read in 2 Chronicles 14 so abijah slept with his fathers they buried him in the city of David and ASA his son reigned in his dead in his days the land was quiet 10 years no war no fighting and ASA did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God for he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places and broke down down the images and cut down the Groves the engraved things the idols and ASA commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers and to do the law and the Commandment in chapter 15 we read the spirit of God Came Upon Azariah the son of ODed he's a prophet he went out to meet ASA and he said unto him hear you me ASA and all Judah and Benjamin the Lord is with you while you be with him if you seek Him He will be found of you but if you forsake Him He will forsake you skipping to verse 7 be strong therefore let not your hands be weak for your work shall be rewarded and when ASA heard these words and the prophecy of odad the prophet he took courage and he put away the Abominable Idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin and out of the Cities which he had taken from Mount ephra and renewed the altar of the Lord that was before the porch of the Lord in in front of the temple and he gathered all Judah and Benjamin and the strangers with them out of ephriam and Manasseh and out of Simeon for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that the Lord his God was with him skipping to verse 12 they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul verse 15 all Judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire what happens when we truly wholeheartedly seek the Lord he was found of them and the lord gave them rest round about verse 17 the high places were not taken away out of Israel nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days wow after 20 more years about 875 BC ASA is at war with Israel ASA emptied the treasury of the temple whatever silver and gold remained and sent it to the king of Syria the king of Syria was with Israel fighting against Judah so he said huh I'll pay you more than Israel's pay and be my guy and fight them so that mercenaries and that's what they did he bought the king of Syria so he turned on his now former Ally Israel he got scolded for that rather than depending on the Lord he raided the temple to depend upon Syria the last few years of Ace's life were not very happy he didn't worship other gods but we're told he failed to consult the Lord he died six years later his son Jehoshaphat became King around 872 BC 58 years after Solomon's death 87 years after the temple was dedicated and it had already been raid twice stripped of its wealth exactly what God told Solomon what happened if he disobeyed God Jehosaphat reigned for 25 years 2 Chronicles 17 we read the Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father David and sought not unto balim we sometimes say balum and think that that's an idol but it's Bim it's it's Gods it's a plural but sought the Lord God of his father and walked in his Commandments not after the doings of Israel therefore the Lord established the kingdom in his hand and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presence and he had riches and honor in abundance and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord moreover he took away the high places and Groves out of Judah also in the third year of jehoshaphat's Reign he sent to his princes to teach in the cities of Judah with them he sent Levites and with them elishama and jehoram Priests and the third year what is he doing sending these people out they taught in Judah and had the book of The Law of the Lord with them and went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people they taught the people from the book of The Law of the Lord they were having a kingdom wide Wednesday night bible study his big mistake was allying himself with Ahab and Israel's battle against Syria after being scolded about that he continued to do good things his son jehoram took over and was evil he started by killing his siblings to be sure they wouldn't revolt and followed the sins of Israel we're told he reigned for eight years the only mention of Elijah is during his Reign when Elijah issues a prophecy against jehoram his son aesia Reigns for one year and is killed by juu when he's destroying ahab's descendants in Israel we read this in Second Kings a couple of weeks ago aia's mother atalia takes over she kills the remaining what they call the seed Royal the the sons of aesia who had killed all of his own Brothers she's wicked she Reigns for six years it's now about 835 BC 124 years since the dedication of the Temple 40 years since the table Temple was last raided there's a priest by the name of yoad and he sneaks Yash an infant son of aazah out of the royal Nursery before atalia can kill him and yahho protects him when joash is seven years old yoa anoints him King at Alia is killed and joash Reigns for 40 years there are great reforms in Judah while yah HOA is alive in the 23rd year of Jo ases rain about 8810 BC the temple repairs begin shortly after yah hoedad dies and joash in chapter 24 we find takes the wrong turn he goes even to the point when one of YH hoad's Sons tries to explain something to him and tell him something from the Lord he has him killed the the son of the counselor that had done so much good he raised the temple treasury to buy off the king of Syria Syria seems to like getting the temple Treasury and he's assassinated in Revenge for killing YH hoad's son and it's curious that the Bible says that the the two people the two men that assassinated him were Sons one one of his one of the mothers the no the mother of one of the men was from Ammon the mother of the other man was from Moab strange how the ammonite and the Lites keep popping up here well yash's son amiah begins well in in 2 Chronicles 25:2 it says he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord but not with a perfect heart he rules for 29 years and Midway in his Reign Rebels and worships the gods of seir you might remember Mount seer in some relationship with uh one of the other lineages that came down from Abraham that wasn't through Jacob the temple is rated again perhaps around 775 BC it seems to be a pattern people start off well then they get distracted they start worshiping Idols they go from good to bad but there's one who breaks this pattern we'll we'll we'll see towards the end of the book the next king is Uzziah he's mentioned frequently in the book of Isaiah we read of Uzziah in 2 Chronicles 26:4 it says heed that which was right in the sight of the Lord near the end of his life his pride gets to him he decides to go to the temple and burn incense I'm the king I can I can do this the priests warn him don't go in there don't do that this is a duty of Levites of descendants of levite don't do this don't please don't do this he I'm going to do it anyway I'm the king well he's determined and while he's there arguing with the priests he breaks out head to toe covered in leprosy so he has to now go into a separate place he can't even sit on his throne or be in his Palace he succeeded by his son yatham who rules for 16 years and we read in 2 Chronicles 272 he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all that his father the Uzziah did how be it he entered not into the Temple of the Lord Lord in other words he didn't make the mistake his dad did he was a good King he did good things but the verse goes on and says and the people did yet corruptly so while he was going the right way everybody else was going somewhere else I don't know if it was a leadership issue or if it's just the Lord's judgment proceeding because of the Disobedience of Solomon it doesn't tell us but the people don't follow his leadership well Ahab is next 2 Chronicles 28 ahaz was 20 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem but he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord like David his father for he walked in the ways of the Kings of Israel and made also moled images for balim if you think that's bad I hope you're sitting down the next verse moreover he burnt incense in the Valley of the son of hinam and burnt his children in the fire after the Abominations of the Heathen whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel yeah the king of Judah went so far as to sacrifice some of his children to Idols there's yet another civil war and during this war many people from Judah are captured by Israel but a prophet arises in Israel and says no this bad you send these folks from Judah you send them back home you don't keep them here we're in enough trouble as it is we don't need this trouble too about two years later 723 BC after these guys had been returned Assyria conquered Israel carried the inhabitants away the 10 lost tribes as they're commonly referred to so a number of people of Judah had it not been for that Prophet would have been carried off by the Assyrians as well verse 22 in the time of his distress he did trespass yet more against the Lord this is that King ahaz you can tell the writer this portion of the book is completely disgusted with ahaz he can't help himself yeah yeah that ahaz he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus which smote him and he said because the gods of the Kings of Syria help them therefore will I sacrifice to them and maybe they'll help me has no clue no concept but they were the ruin of him and of all Israel and it has gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord and made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem ahaz dies he has a son Hezekiah who becomes king so this is about 728 BC 2 Chronicles 29 begins Hezekiah began to Reign when he was 5 and 20 years old and he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem his mother's name was abijah the daughter of Zachariah and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all that David his father had done and what's his first order of business he in the first year of his Reign and the first month opened the doors of the house of the Lord and repaired them he brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them together into the East Street and said unto them hear me ye Levites sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness of my father Ahab out of the Holy Place skipping to verse 17 now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify what does it mean sanctify cleanse and set aside for service right part of our process of Christianity justification sanctification then the infilling of the holy spirit so he wants them to sanctify to clean this place and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the Lord so they Sanctified the house of the Lord in 8 days and in the 16th day of the first month they made an end now what's supposed to happen on the 15th day of the first month Passover right so this is this is a day late then they went into Hezekiah the king and said we have cleansed all the house of the Lord the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels thereof of and the showbread table and all the vessels thereof moreover all the vessels which king ahaz and his Reign did Cast Away in his transgression have we prepared and Sanctified and behold they are before the altar of the Lord after the temple restored it's too late in the first month to observe Passover but Hezekiah decides that it's just too important to not do so he says well we'll observe it in the second month not in Rebellion but in Zeal and in humility so chapter 30:2 also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the Commandment of King Uzziah and of the princes by the word of the lord and there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the Feast of unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregation verse 25 all the congregation of Judah with the priests and the Levites and all the congregation that came out of Israel and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel and that dwelt in Judah rejoiced so there was great joy in Jerusalem for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy Dwelling Place even un Heaven hezekiah's Reign is summed up chapter 32 now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his goodness behold they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amos and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel and Hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the chiefest of the supplers of of the sons of David manasse hezekiah's Son succeeds him to the throne he was a terrible evil person first part of his life he was a bit like me he was 12 when he ascended to the throne and ruled for 55 years might be the longest Reign what's this bad guy 2 Chronicles 33 he caused his children to pass through the fire in the Valley of the son of henm also he observed times and used enchantments and used Witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with Wizards he wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to provoke the Lord to anger who is this guy verse so manasse made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to Heir and to do worse than the Heathen whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel he put Idols in the temple including and the holy of holies why are you talking about this guy brother L he was eventually carried off in Chains to Babylon and guess what there he repented and sought the Lord and what did the Lord do delivered him and brought him back to Jerusalem verse 15 and he Manasseh took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the Lord and all the altars that who his fathers before him no that he had built in the Mount of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem and cast them out of the city he repaired the altar of the Lord and sacrificed there on peace offerings and thank offerings and commanded Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel notice these weren't Idols someone else put up he put them up this is testimony this is humility that's what I was but I'm not that that now this is confession this is an example a sinner saved by grace thank the Lord nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places yet unto the Lord the God only now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and his prayer unto his God and the words of the seers that spake unto him in the name of the Lord God of Israel behold they're written in the book of The Kings of Israel I I I can't help but think how God must have loved his arant son manasse to warn him time and again and finally to patiently put him in a place where he could see what he was and come to the realization that he though a king and of the davidic line was a vile person whose only hope was the grace of God that's me the story of manasse gives me hope if we are truly cognizant of our sin and sincerely repent God is ready to forgive not some incantation or some Indulgence not reciting words we think he expects of us but truly turning around and like manasse will see it in the actions that play out in our lives brother Fred Barker wrote that song that we sometimes saying it's the life behind the name that makes the proud heart humble so Manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house and Ammon his son reigned in his dead alond lasted two years he was an evil guy he he was murdered Almond's 8-year-old son then becomes king about 640 BC 2 Chronicles 34 Josiah was eight years old when he began to Reign and he reigned in Jerusalem 31 years he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord and walked in the ways of David his father and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left we're not told who his advisers were this eight-year-old boy but they must have been wise men no doubt influenced by the transformation that they saw and manasse just a few years earlier for in the eighth year of his Reign while he was yet young at age 16 he began to seek after to the god of David his father and in the 12th year at age 20 he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places and the Groves and the carved images and the molten images verse eight now in the 18th year of his Reign age 26 we read hilaya the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by Moses and heaya answered instead to shaon the Scribe I I found the book of the law in the house of the Lord and hilaya delivered the book to shaon and chafon the Scribe told the King Josiah saying hilaya the priest has given me a book and jefon read it before the king and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the law he rent his clothes the king commanded hkah and ahum the son of chafon and abdom the son of Micah and shaon the Scribe and asiah a servant of the Kings saying go inquire of the Lord for me and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah concerning the words of the book that is found great is the Wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not not kept the word of the Lord to do all that is written in this book they go to the prophet as holda who tells them that Judah will be destroyed but because of Josiah's tender heart and humility he would not see that destruction we read and the King Josiah went up into the house of the Lord and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites and all the people Great and Small they were getting together for this purpose he Josiah read in their ears all the words of the book of the Covenant that was found in the house of the Lord spoiler alert I I think in a couple of weeks we'll hear another Josiah tell us of one who stood and read the book to the people with great effect the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord and to keep his Commandments testimonies statues with all his heart and with all his soul to perform the words of the Covenant which are written in this book and Josiah caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Ben Benjamin to stand to it and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the Covenant of God the god of their fathers and Josiah took away all the Abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel and made all that were present in Israel to serve the Lord their God and all his days they departed not from following the Lord the god of their fathers chapter 35 moreover Josiah kept a Passover unto the Lord in Jerusalem and they killed the Passover on the 14th day of the first month skipping down to verse 18 we read there was no Passover like that to be kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept and the priests and the Levites and all Judah and Israel that were present and the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the 18th year of the reign of Josiah age 26 was this Passover kept 13 years later at age 39 jiah is killed in battle 609 BC recall the propheus indicated to Josiah's emissaries that the nation was past saving we've seen individuals including those of great influence can be saved but the nation was doomed yahwe Josiah's son is King for three months the king of Egypt comes and dethrones him putting yah's brother in his King 11 years later Nebuchadnezzar comes puts that King in Chains and Carries him off to Babylon along with raiding the Temple of its Treasures there's a rapid succession of puppet Kings the people not serving the lord at all 586 BC just 20 years after Josiah's death Jerusalem and the temple are destroyed and burned another 47 years pass and Cyrus becomes king of Persia musicians please come 2 Chronicles 36 we read now the first year of Cyrus King of Persia it's about 539 BC that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying thus sayith Cyrus King of Persia all the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God Of Heaven given me and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there among you of all his people the Lord his God be with him and let him go up those are the closing words of 2 Chronicles and in the Jewish ordering of the books of what we call the Old Testament it's the closing words of their Bible let's take a closer look lessons that we can get from second chronicles two lessons jumped out at me from this book the first regards entitlement and pride royalty thought they were special because of who their parents were we saw that in the various Kings with rabam being a prime example in our time we often hear of the bride and the church there's often an attitude expressed that if we're part of the Bride we're somehow better than other Christians we sometimes speak of nominal Christians my brothers and my sisters we must be very very careful our standard is not the other person it's Christ don't be distracted from pursuing him look at Jesus who was more entitled than him he said to be like him to serve others not to be served by others and finally look at the lesson of manasse true repentance brings true forgiveness and restoration salvation as we turn this service to our pastor let's sing to be like Jesus to be to be like Jesus to be like [Music] Jesus on Earth I I long to be like him all through life's journey from Earth to Glory I only ask to be like him probably up a little bit to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth th love to be like him all through life Jour from Earth to Glory I to be like him let's all stand to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I long to be like him through life's journey from Earth to Glory I only ask to be like him brother Jeremy bagot if you come and close brothers and sisters there is no story there's no book that has ever been written there's no movie that's ever been made there is nothing in the world that can compare to this book How The testimonies in this book and how the teaching in this book though it be thousands of years old can be applied to our lives every day I so blessed to hear about manasse and his testimony looks like we'll get to see him one day and shake his hand and say brother that repentance was a blessing to many many people and it was a blessing to me on one Wednesday night at the Tucson Tabernacle then [Music] um with these Kings and with these testimonies and how important just every word in this book of 2 Chronicles is how how it just it really illuminates much of the Old Testament I think brother Lyall will you agree with me that say to say brother Lyall did a really good job tonight it's a blessing C a blessing to me I learned a lot tonight brother Jeremy if you close let's bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father we just count of an honor and privilege to dwell in your house once again and and read a Old Testament scripture Lord of Jehovah God ruling and reigning over his people Lord and your ways haven't changed we just thank you Lord that we can come before you and repent and turn towards you and and know know your ways above every every way of the world we just ask you to go with us go before us be in US Lord let us yield to your spirit to talk to somebody along the way we just are thankful Lord to be be your children Lord we just ask these things in your precious Name Lord Jesus Christ [Music] amenur it will be worth it all when we see Jesus Liv trials will see so small when we see one glimpse of his dear f all Sorrows will so greatly R the way till we see it will be worthy when we see Jesus life trial will s so s when we see c one glimpse of his dear face all Sorrows will so bravely run the r till we see brothers and sisters have a good week pray that the things that we've heard tonight will stick with us and anchor down deep in our hearts and and in our minds so that we can remember the successes and we can remember the failures we can remember that Temple that was built up so beautiful and it didn't last long and then the enemy got in and he tore it down and that's what the enemy wants to do to these temples yeah the Lord May build us up but don't think that just because we're built up and we're Christians and and we Believers don't think that that Temple can't fallah if we allow the enemy to come in so stand strong as I said Ponder on these words study these words and uh was it 1 Chronicles 6 that you said to read during our devotions I mean 2 Chronicles 6 2 Chronicles 6 yes remember read 2 Chronicles 6 um for our brother L actually read it this morning it's it's very very
