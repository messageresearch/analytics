said she's not feeling 100 maybe allergies and hay fever sister rachel guetta brother aaron said also he's been having hay fever real bad and not sleeping well as well so let's remember both of them in prayer let's also remember brother charlie and sister rachel collins family in prayer for those you may not know they were a young couple at brother erickson's church and they passed away this week in a an explosion in their house i think it was a gas propane explosion possibly let's just remember the families in prayer i know they had the service yesterday and many people were coming in for it

brother curt speaks to the lord on our behalf oh yes oh libby leave only [Music] things are possible only believe [Music] only believe oh only believe all things are possible [Music] let's bow our heads and our hearts lord jesus we don't have words to describe how we feel about you words that the language that we have here is not good enough to tell you about the love we have for you this revelation that you have put in our hearts about you you are alive and you are well and it's with great joy we come and talk to you this morning we you are the middle you are the center of our lives god we've left everything for you we've given everything to you and we just can't express it exactly but there's there's this worship that comes out of us towards you and you made this all possible god you took five great wounds in your body to make it possible to as we sit here justified father nothing on our account the record is clean because that blood was god's blood and we know that was perfect blood and we know that the losing from any kind of charge against us lord is dissolved in a great bleach with that in mind lord we know also that you are a great king and a high priest that could be touched by the feelings of the infirmities of these requests you cared about every word every thought that was pinned or spoken concerning these requests and we do by the revelation that lives in our heart we do believe we believe with that faith of the son of god lord as it just beats in our heart lord and how happy we are to present these cases to you i don't remember all the particulars but you do and we all in this building we know you do we know what was even written behind the words and behind the things that were spoken you know all of that and with great confidence we place them at this great throne of mercy with boldness we all want to leave them there with you knowing you are the almighty you are el shaddai and you know exactly what to do with them and with great confidence we leave these here and we'd like to just ask all those things in the name of jesus christ and we'd all like to present ourselves to you this morning lord may you open the doors to our heart and may you come in and out freely may we surrender may we yield and may that anointing fall fresh upon the speaker may that anointing fall fresh upon the audience and together may we give our lives to you and we dedicate this time to you and we just dedicate our lives to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen we're going to have brother daniel evans ministering for us this

us lord jesus you're so wonderful and if we know about the love of jesus lord i stand here as a sinner saved by your grace and father i know about your love thank you o god for being so good to us in jesus name amen god bless you friends i'm sorry it's this service is starting so emotional in my head oh praise god he's so good to us let's start in the book of psalms chapter 90. brother matthew i'm sorry i'm going out of order i felt to put this one first this morning by the grace of god he's so good psalm chapter 90 verse 8 thou has set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the light of thy countenance for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years as a tale that is told the days of our years are three score years and ten and if by reason of strength they be four score years yet it is their strength labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away who knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy fear so is thy wrath especially listen to this so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom amen may god add the blessings to the reading of his word you can be seated thank you friends by the grace of god i am here and i always want to thank the lord for all that he's done i was i was in a service one time we were at a minister's meeting um with steve robson uh and some of the some of us other brothers we were in a minister's meeting in south carolina and there was a black brother he was there was a minister's meeting and then after the minister's meeting there was a dedication of a large message church in south carolina and the brother he had more charisma in his little finger than i do in my whole body and he gets up and he he stands before the people and he says he says do you love jesus and they said amen you know and he says he says i mean do you really love jesus amen he says how much do you love jesus and they started praising the lord he says because we're about to take the offering i thought that was so cute it was it was it was such a blessing to have been there and like i said that brother i can't remember his name but he's got a wonderful church in south carolina the lord is so is so good to us i i read that psalm i wanted to talk this morning i wanted to talk a little bit about the biggest mistake i have ever made and some of the brothers might be sharpening their pencil [Laughter] maybe get maybe get a few things on brother daniel evans this morning but um it is it's it's i think the biggest mistake i've ever made in my life and it's a mistake that i've made over and over again it's a mistake that i made as a young man in school it's it's a mistake that i've made as as i've grown up in my career it's a mistake that i've made as a servant of the lord it's a mistake that i've made in in my studies as far as the bible and brother braham's message it's a mistake that has reoccurred with me throughout the years and especially you young people i want to tell you please don't make this mistake and i think you will make the mistake but when you start making this mistake catch yourself and and stop it got them joe you got your family there good looking set of boys there it's good to see you you guys god bless you all it's uh you're welcome here and praise the lord i saw you i saw you there tonight and it's good to see you again and then brother david and sister sharon you know let me tell you you and your family mean the world to me you really do and sister sharon your family and brother vic and and um all that you all have stood for over the years and stand on playing brother brown's message to the people i appreciate you sister sharon and your family i appreciate your kids too god bless you all um the biggest mistake friends that i've made in my life and and i've said this and i said it it's it's from when i was a young man all the way until now it's i didn't give the lord enough time you know i didn't i didn't take i didn't give him enough of me and in our daily walk with lord we see that there's so many distractions especially for you youth now especially for you we never had this i call it the little square idol we never had this when i was a kid i had other things that took my time but now the enemy has has placed this in our hands and i'm not against cell phones i'm not against smart phones i i i think they can be used for the lord and they can be a blessing but uh they can also be a curse brother branham talked about he talked about how the pentecostal people they never go see a movie and and then he said well he said then the devil pulled one over on you and he said he put the movie theater in your home in the form of television and then we see so many message believers now they won't have a television but uh they sure do have this little guy and they spend enough time on it and and i'm not i'm saying that it can be a time waster friend it can gobble up the time that we could be spending doing other things and i'm not just talking about things of the lord i'm not just talking about praying and studying our bibles that's important and listening to tapes that's important but it also takes time of things other things you should be doing just doing your doing your school work doing doing your your work at home fellowshipping do doing things that please the lord and and you know when we say we're serving the lord it's not always visiting the sick it's not always praying when we're serving the lord a lot of times it's doing what we should be doing it's uh cleaning uh cleaning our rooms cleaning cleaning the house uh husbands helping our wives a little bit and some of the things that they do around the home or or finishing finishing our work paying our bills doing those things that's serving the lord too and many times we waste time and we put other things in front of the lord and i want to tell you friends it's the worst mistake that i make is not giving the lord enough time how much did he give me and then i don't give him my all and all right i um i want to give him more he deserves it let's turn to ephesians chapter 5. this is the apostle paul speaking ephesians is a very deep book so many of the ministers quote ephesians quite a bit because there's there's a lot of the ministry in there but there's also a lot in the book of ephesians that uh speaks to all of us ephesians chapter 5 verse 6 says this let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience and we see right here friends that there are deceivers in the world the apostle here is warning us that there's deceivers to come so we should be vigilant we should be ready for these things be be not partakers with them for you are sometimes darkness but now ye are light in the lord walk as children of light imagine how a son of god a son or daughter of god should walk through this world paul's saying here that you're children of the light so walk like children of the light he said do you do we as children of of of the light do we spend all of our time on unproductive things and i understand there's a time for rest and as i understand there's a time for relaxation i understand there's a time for entertainment understand that to relax ourselves and and to completely say we should completely deprive people of this i'm not by any means advocating for it but to say that we should completely take this sometimes it it puts a greater burden on the people than they can bear so we need to be careful and being being too hard on this but we also have to remember that when we are doing these other things and they may be perfectly moral and holy but when we are doing these other things we are taking time away from god so let's we need to watch that we need to be careful for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable into the lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but in all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light listen to this wherefore he saith awaken awake thou s that sleepless and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil make the most of your time friends because these are evil evil days that we're living in wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is and i said as paul was saying here we are only here on this earth for a short time you know if we look throughout history and if we look for the for let's say let's say that man has been here on the earth about 6 000 years and we live as the bible just said 70 or 80 years that's a short time for the while that we have to get to work it's a short time that we have to do something not just not just to work for others but friends we don't get a second chance at this this is the time that we have to serve the lord this is the time that we have to accept jesus christ as our savior this is the time that we have to place our sins upon him and accept god and then get to work for him we don't have any other time we can waste it doing something else we can waste it on the phone we can waste it in front of the television we can waste it with entertainment we can waste it hunting or fishing or doing those things but there's something to do and if we are going to be raptured friends if we are going to come through on the other side now i know we can't earn our salvation i understand that but jesus said he also said by their fruits you'll know them you'll know them by their works what are my works how am i spending my time if we if we lose track of that then we might consider ourselves and where do we stand in this great economy of god when the saints all rise and we have this great resurrection day am i going to be there you know not just because i've heard of this man william branham and and my family has has has has followed him and i believe every word that he says not just because of that not just because i i do believe this bible when i call myself a christian but is this bible living in me is that message that brother branham preached do i do i believe it do i take it as the truth i believe i do but there's more to do and i fail i'm not living up i feel like i'm not living up to what the bible teaches let's turn to i'm going to go through a couple of scriptures and i'll slow down when i when i get when i get to my testimony here first peter chapter 5 verse 8. it says this it says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil has a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may desire devour now friends this is a lot bigger deal than oh i like to hear this preacher or that preacher you know this is a lot bigger deal of or than where we choose to go to church this is our own salvation that we're talking about this is a devouring lie and this evil spirit called satan that is looking to each one of us wanting to devour us and is our prayer life are we able to stand up in his face are we able to take this word and apply it in our lives as satan comes in devouring who he may devour are we able to say it is written here and we have spent the time in prayer we have spent the time studying we have spent the time listening are we able to stand against him do we have that same spirit of god to stand against him friends this is this is a serious matter it's something that should be on our minds all the time and let me tell you satan's biggest tactic and where he really wins is he creates apathy he creates something that you know what i don't really care i don't care enough to really dig in and pray sister shirley i'll do it tomorrow you know it'll be well i'll pray tonight i prayed 15 minutes before i went to bed dig in and pray you know i hear i hear people say so much you know it's it's i'm gonna go on a diet and i'm gonna do this and this and this and uh and you know it's really easy to go on a diet just after you eat man i do it every time just about i probably do it three or four times a week you know i go i go on the diet right after i get done eating and boy you know it's i'm gonna do it but then i start getting hungry again and that's that's when i fail and friends it's the same spiritually it's i'm going to do it tomorrow i'm going to i'm going to really dig in i'm going to do this but no do it now now is the time this service right now this is the time to make a change and you you young people you're um you're about to embark on a life on a career you're you're thinking about what you're going to do in the future and so often i've seen so many young people fail i've seen them fail because they always say i'm going to do this you know this is my dream i'm going to do it but then they won't take the time to buckle down and study because nobody really wants to study school as far as school is involved you don't want to but if you want to be a success in life there takes a sacrifice to get to that success there was a at a football coach one time he said he said wherever you're at be there so if if i'm if i'm in this pulpit i want to give it my hundred percent if i'm here if i'm studying in school give it to your 100 and you'll be successful and it's the same thing with christianity let's give it a 100 let's not let's not wait around let's not say i'll do it tomorrow i'll do what if tomorrow doesn't come when we just i heard the prayer request horrible tragic news that brother jordan read about this young man young lady that passed away it's a and i know i i know that um you see the picture of them they're just beautiful people you can tell they have a nice spirit but what if that happened to certain people in this room right now what if it happened right now would you be ready would you be ready to stand before the righteous judge and say lord i did everything that i could or would you stand before the righteous judge and say i was going to do it yeah but i just never got there ephesians chapter four you know it says uh when we when we take communion we always read the scripture let a man examine himself and that's what we should do we should be doing that every day but joe adams was preaching last week i appreciate some of the things he said he was he talked about some pertinent things um and i wanted to go a little deeper into some of the things that he said ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. this is a famous scripture and we always use the scripture for the ministry and and it's it kind of sometimes i think it kind of justifies having a preacher up there and and that it shouldn't be that way it seems like so often we're we use this many minute this scripture to justify how we feel about things but i want to dig a little deeper and i want to i want to if the lord's willing read what is the purpose of this scripture and he speaking of jesus speaking of jesus gave these things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ verse 14 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things that we may grow up in every way into christ which is the head even christ that is the role friends of the ministry the ministry is not to point you to a man standing in the pulpit because this man will fail and let me tell you i'll fail everybody that stands in this pulpit fails we say things that that maybe we don't mean or we say things that are maybe we made a mistake we're wrong in saying them but you are responsible to be in this word enough to where you know to where and you're so in tune with god when the minister says something's like ah that doesn't sound quite right you don't say you don't have to criticize him but when it says something it's not it's not gonna hurt you you're not gonna suck down something that's just pure nonsense but you have to be in this word i have to be in this word this word and us have to become one it's that important you can't just go to church three times a week that's not what it's about going to church three times a week refreshes us and it gives us a reason to go and to hear the word and to fellowship together but every day paul said i pray always or he instructed us to pray always every step we take we're praying we're with god lord is this right is am i going down the right direction with this everything from our lives from our for you you uh young people who you're going to marry what job that you're going to have all the way to to where when you have kids how are you going to teach them you get homeschooled you're going to put them in public school what are you going to do you're not going to follow the establishment or necessarily what the preacher says you're going to do what god leads you to do and don't don't don't be afraid just make a stand see i stand on this because i believe god sent this to me and uh let me read it again verse 14 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they they lay lie in weight to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ and friends i don't know you may you may have a better way but i don't know a better way to accomplish that than to spend more time to spend more time with the lord philippians chapter 2 verse 12 says this wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling the apostle paul here is writing this to the philippian church and he's saying i was once with you and i taught you these things but now i'm gone be careful study these things listen pray because you have to work your own salvation out with fear and trembling it's not up to me paul is saying to do it it's up to the individual and that individual must have a personal relationship with christ brother ronnie there's nothing better that we can do it's it's everything is to develop that relationship with christ and that is the reason for this pulpit that is the reason for this bible right here is for us to become one with christ it's everything it's everything that we we do and it's the ultimate goal as paul said here not only in my presence but in my absence work out your own salvation through fear and trembling we've uh friends we we've got to be get ready and how do we get ready like i said is time in preparing for service today you had to get ready you didn't come to church in your pajamas i don't think i've seen kids sometimes moms they put them on but but you didn't come to church in your pajamas you probably spent more time getting ready than you did driving here you had you had to make an effort to get ready and and now you're here and there was there was preparation it took to get here this the spirit that we see in the world today of this this not caring like i said apathy it's it's i don't i don't really care you know well i go to church and i believe the message and or i'm catholic or i'm baptist and and yeah and every all of salvation is built on just a few works during the week and it goes perfectly with this laodicean age this layout to see an age we see the different ages and and in each one it says to him that overcomes but there is one age there's one age that says be zealous doesn't say that in any other age but it says be zealous and i bet you can't guess what age that is this laodicean age and when and jesus instructs he says be zealous therefore and repent have zeal for this but you're lukewarm you know and and it makes me sick i would rather you be a hundred percent against it or a hundred percent for it but yeah you know i'll come to church everything's good i'm okay friends that ain't gonna cut it when we get to that day and it doesn't cut it now there is so much work to be done brother joe there's so much to do and yet here's laodicea and laodicea invites this spirit called nicolaitanism where that pastor becomes our mediator or that priest becomes our mediator and we rely so much on that person or our mother or dad that becomes that that becomes our walk with the lord is this this layout this nicolaitan spirit where he conquers the lady and you know what it does it takes out our relationship with christ and it puts the man in the middle and the laziness of the people and wasting time like i said i have done far too much it invites it right in well here's the holy man he can tell you what to do he can make all your decisions for you i think brother joe touched on that last weekend i appreciated what he said we have to be we have to be vigilant there's uh watching my time um the lord jesus he's great he's he's everything he didn't make a mistake not one he uh he walked from the cradle to the grave walk to life perfect before the father and he was our example he uh he prayed for these things this is the virgin born son of god why would he spend so much time in prayer he was that he was everything he was not only the savior but he was god in flesh but he spent time in prayer there's there's one place in in luke chapter 6 that it says that that jesus had he had a conflict with with the um pharisees or sadducees one of the clergy group and then he and then a little while later he goes to prayer and the bible says he prayed all night as i said this is the virgin-born sinless son of god he prayed all night he had a decision to make you know what the decision was he had to choose 12 disciples after he spent that night in prayer then the next day brother curtis joseph's 12. and they changed the world but my point in saying it is the virgin born son of god the sin sinless lamb that takes away the sins of the world he had to pray and he did pray and how much more should we how much more should we spend how much more time should we spend but we don't and i'm speaking to myself as i said this is my mistake this is the greatest mistake i've made in my life we uh i wish you boys i wish i could go back and be your age again i really do i would do things differently and the thing that i would do differently as i said i'd spend more time i'd learn more i'd uh i'd probably learn an instrument guitar or something i would definitely have invested in apple and amazon it would make things a lot easier but i would i would change some of the things that i've done and the main thing is i would do my best as a young man to give more time to the lord there's a man that's uh i think uh that did this in the bible there's a man that struggled with the same things we struggle with he was he was a man that gave his life to the lord and he was he was a great example to all of us and uh this man's name was elijah we've heard a lot about it he was a tremendous man he had wonderful character this man elijah powerful powerful man of god and i'll read at the end of service i'll read a scripture that says he was no different than you and me how can this man be so great and be like me well he brother kevin he made the choice he um i'd say when he was on a diet he didn't cheat when when he was living his life he lived what he said um i want i do want to mention a friend of mine you all know brother israel paul he uh i was at service i don't know as a while ago and uh brother poe made this statement that stuck with me and i thought man that is that is really good brother israel said he says why don't we if we we tithe we pay 10 of our income we should he says why don't we tithe 10 of our time it's not that much you know just like 10 of our income's not that much but why don't we take 10 of this time that god gave us every day and give it to god yes but everything always steps in front and uh with this man that i want to talk about today um he still made it he made the sacrifices he did it i want to read a quote for you from brother branham this is from trying to do god a service without it being the will of god brother matt if you could put that up there brother branham says this now when i'm talking about when i'm talking about these things and devoting time and and serving the lord and serving the people i'm talking about what's called works works are as james i believe as james has said works are faith expressed works are something that will not get us to heaven they don't do it it's the unmerited grace of jesus christ that gets us to heaven but brother branham as always he said it perfectly listen to this but abraham says this he says he only reveals his word in the predestinated now when i use the word predestinated now it's a bad word to use in public especially when we have mixed crowds between armenians and calvinists excuse me i've asked you not to think i know it all i've asked you not to think i know it all but they're both wrong according to the scripture grace is what god did for me works is what i do for him isn't that beautiful the prophet in in his simplicity in in the way that he says things he shows us that we do oh christ we can't earn our way to heaven but we do owe him for what he's done for us next next quote is as i was with moses so i will be with thee says this just goes to show that time is fleeting and it waits on no one we must work while it is day for the time will come when we cannot work no longer and i always liked longfellow's psalm of life with partings leave behind us the footprints on the sands of time we must make footprints while we can make them each of us let's not waste one day but make every day count the best that we can for his glory amen brother branham he did that he dedicated his life to god's people this man elijah that he so pleased god that god didn't even let him die there's coming a group of people that are going to please god so much that he's not going to let them die either elijah was our example to this group of people elijah that spirit of elijah was so loved by god that that when elijah went up on the chariot that the spirit that same spirit that was on that man rested upon his servant a man named elisha and then we see hundreds of years later that god again he loved that spirit so much that he placed it upon a man named john the baptist who introduced the first coming of none other than jesus christ and then god again he loved that spirit so much that dedication that elijah had that love for the lord that willingness to put god above everything else that he brought a servant in this day name william branham who's setting the example for us not to waste time not to think about the things of the world he preached against those things but to think on the things of god and even further he said i am a sign as john the baptist was that the second coming of christ is at hand it's going to be here any minute so get ready and ah we heard a tape on wednesday night there were very few people here but uh i believe it was mary's faith was it oh mary's belief yeah it was wonderful and at the end of the sermon service remember that he starts going through the prayer line and he starts telling the people you are this you are this you're this and even i thought it was cute he gets this one lady and he was saying this he said i'm doing this to increase your faith he says it's not my faith that heals you it's your faith and then he gets to this one lady i don't know if you remember it he gets this one lady and he says he says now i could tell you who you are and um and he says but but that's not that's he said something like it's not needed he says do you want me to tell you who you are and the lady says you can hear on the tape yes i want you to tell you tell me who i am oh it's great and then he tells her and then go and be behold in the name of the lord he was it was a great sign and let me tell you friends i know that uh you know there's a there's a big ballyhoo about the infallibility of brother branham to everything they say was it thus saith lord or not but let me tell you one thing when he was in that prayer line it was never wrong never infallible perfect every single time you talk about prophecy it never failed and i think all of us many of us know people that were in those prayer lines and there's still people on this earth today that can testify to that this man elijah first kings chapter 17. i'm going to summarize it but i think maybe i'll read that first verse elijah he comes out of nowhere we don't know anything about him we don't know where he came from but it says this and i love this because if you want to hear a wonderful message there's a message called be certain of god and brother branham starts that tape with these words and nobody i don't believe could ever read it like he read it but it says this verse 17 i'm sorry chapter 17 verse 1. and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be do nor rain these years but according to my word and at that time a drought started in israel and it didn't rain not even dew came down friends we're in a bad drought in the southwest right now but it still rains it still snows up in the mountain and we see our reservoirs starting to fall and it's becoming it's becoming a big crisis because we're not getting as much rain as we should and the snowpack isn't as much as it should be but imagine if it did not rain at all or snow or even dewfall for three and a half years we would be in a crisis situation and we're already getting a crisis situation now with just a little bit of rain that we're getting but imagine if this happened and there was no rain to water the crops they didn't have diesel pumps pumping groundwater 500 feet little while they didn't have that they had rain and they relied on god and it stopped by the word of this man elijah so the famine starts to set in and god is protecting his servant elijah he goes and and the ravens feed him and then he's sitting by a brook and he's drinking water out of the brook and then the brook dries up and god sends him into a town and he meets a widow lady and this little lady she's as you know she's gathering two sticks and she's gonna make her last meal for her herself and her son and they must have been right at the point of death and this man comes to her and he says give me some water first make me a cake first and by the grace of god elijah knew that god would bless her and she passed the test she put the brother over herself she passed that test and she she gave this man elijah she made him a cake and she gave him a drink of water and he made the prophecy that this little barrel of meal that you had you just took your last handful out try it again put your hand back in there and keep putting your hand in there until it starts to rain and this this this bottle of oil this crucifoil that you use to pack it together and to fry it up he said pour a little out and now pour a little out again it'll never fail by the by the grace of god and the power of god and the mercy of god elijah goes and then her son she was a widow she lost her husband so her son dies he probably had something like covet it says in the bible it says his breath had gone from him i assume it was some sort of a respiratory disease and the young man died elijah goes and brings them in to where he was staying the hospitality of this lady and raises her back up again because elijah was in the presence of god all the time he was trying he was he was spending the time he was praying he was studying he was doing everything that he knew how to do and look at even other people benefited from it it wasn't just elijah that benefited from it many many others benefited from from his dedication to the lord and then the lord speaks to elijah in first kings 18 he instructs elijah to go to the king and tell them it's going to rain so elijah goes and he goes before the king and he gets he gets the meeting and he says this he says he says ahab he says get all of your profits get the best that you got take 450 from over here take 400 from over here and bring them down and we're going to have a showdown if this one that you worship this this god named baal and what's strange by the wild is when i read this again i thought that these i didn't know these were hebrews these are hebrews these are what we would call today in our little in our little group right here we might call message believers these are people that had gotten off the path that had gotten caught up in the world a little bit and they're worshiping baal and probably not even knowing it probably not even knowing that they were idolaters and they're he gets them together and he says let's take two bowls and he says you can pick which one you want they picked this one he takes this one and they they they sacrifice the bull and he says here's here's the here's the stipulation he said if baal be god then let fire come down from heaven and consume your sacrifice your burnt offering and if god be god if jehovah begot then he'll come down and he will consume my sacrifice i said great let's read it um verse first kings 18 verse 26. and they took the block which was given them and they dressed it and they called on the name of baal from the morning even until noon saying oh baal hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made they they had all this emotion and they jumped up and down and they they were trying they tried to stir everything up and remember they were keeping the sacrifice and i have to ask i wonder these prophets of baal these holy men so-called holy men i wonder if baal ever spoke to them as i was reading this this morning actually i thought i wonder if baal actually if this evil spirit or whatever it was actually spoke to these so-called prophets or i wonder if they just generated these voices in their minds i wonder if they just drummed it up because this is how i think things should be this is how i think that that we should do things this is how i think that god should act and thinking they were worshiping god they were actually not they're actually worshiping satan so then friends when we get an answer from god if we're praying and we think we get an answer from god check that answer with the word because god can because satan can deceive and he can make it seem so right but check it with the word always and continue when you get an answer continue to pray about it don't just sell i got an answer because i had this thought like i believe that these men were doing and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry loud for he is for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is journeying or pear adventure he sleepeth and must be awakened god has a sense of humor he was mocking them he's like hey you're yelling um maybe you should yell louder yeah maybe maybe he's busy if you yell louder then maybe he'll hear you because elijah stood fast he knew where he stood and he had prayed and i'm sure he had received word from the lord this is a very applicable scripture now especially for you young people and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them and we see that spirit beginning to manifest itself today that they cut themselves and and the science would say well well they're trying they have anxiety they're trying they're trying to trying to escape what they're suffering from but friends young people i'm sure you've heard of it right no boys am i right they do it people will cut themselves and and it's a spirit and that spirit comes all the way back twenty six hundred years or whatever it is and we see it right here in the scripture cutting themselves the heathen trait taking the place of god trying to take the place today of jesus christ if these young people would accept the lord if they would have christ in their lives then they wouldn't go to these things and it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there is neither voice nor any of the answer nor any that regarded they failed then elijah brings the people together he rebuilds the altar and he digs this big trench around the altar and he cuts up the sacrifice and the way that it should be cut up and he puts it on the ultra for the burnt offering and then he says you know what he says pour four barrels of water on it remember fire's gonna come down from heaven let's make sure that you see the men go out and they dump the water these four barrels of water on there and you know what he says do it again four more barrels i mean the the confidence of this man so they pour another four barrels on there i just says four more so they poured another four barrels and that big trench that elijah had dug around filled up with water it was wet there was no way to get this stuff started and then elijah prayed this man had prayed before he'd been on his knees before he knew how to contact god he had put the time in he had heard god's voice before it came to pass verse 36 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word again you've been in the presence of god hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord thy god that thou art the lord god and that thou has turned their heart back again wow there is the spirit of elijah let me read it again and the thou hast turned their heart back again we all know malachi chapter 4 verse 5 to turn the heart of the fathers to the children or the children to the fathers brother branham taught us turn it back to that of the pentecostal fathers and here we have the original man elijah then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the bird's sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal and let let not one of them escape and he took them and elijah brought them down to the brook kishan kaishon and slew them there and elijah said on ahab get the up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain so ahab went up to eat and drink and elijah went up to the top of carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees look at the reverence of the prophet when he comes before the father in prayer and said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there's nothing and he said go again seven times god does things so strangely you know with us it was like why would why do you have to go up there seven times and look there are no clouds in the sky you just said they're gonna rain there's nothing up there elijah's like go another time go seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there arises a little cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up say and they have prepare thy chariot and get thee down that the rain stopped thee not and it came to pass in the meanwhile that heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab road and went to jezreel and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his loins and it ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel i'm going to i'm going to speed up here i'm running out of time but but things after all these victories things started to get bad for elijah and how many times has the lord blessed us and we've had a great victory and and things are going so good and we say lord you're so good and then all of a sudden we got a problem and we cry out to him lord what are you gonna do i'm in trouble and here is elijah now now he's fearing for his life because ahab goes and tells his wife jezebel jezebel says he did what he marked us he killed our prophets and she writes this letter says send this to him and it says this day won't pass until you're dead why did you get scared what am i going to do the whole kingdom's against me elijah goes up seeking the voice of the lord he goes up and he lays under i believe this is when he laid under the juniper tree and an angel came to him and as i was reading that again this morning i was thinking that i don't know if elijah knew that was an angel or not i don't think it matters but how many times do each of us have to have the opportunity to be an angel to someone else brother branham said that god loved his prophet and he sent the angel with the softest hands and how many times do we have that opportunity that we can go to someone and we can be that angel sent from god brother joe you do that to me so often and i've talked to the brothers you do that to other people too thank you my friend but it's it's an opportunity that we have i don't want to let it go brother jeremy you do too with these encouraging quotes that you send me and it means something to us we should be that angel we shouldn't be the one always waiting for the angel to come to us maybe we should be that angel this was a very very hard time for elijah and he's under this juniper tree he's seeking the will of the lord he's seeking the mind of the lord and how many of us have been in that situation brother ed dougal sent me such an encouraging video the other day and i think it's appropriate that we play it for the for the church it's about eight minutes and it's about a lawyer who was went up to alaska he was he was doing he was working he had he knew a pastor that was up there this man was a christian and he got himself into a precarious situation maybe very similar to what our friend elijah was doing so brother brother matt if you could play that i hope that i'm not going to be on on the spot and tell the story this man i hope that we can play the the video because it is inspiring but this man was uh he uh he like elijah he got caught up in a spot where he was gonna die and he desperately sought the voice of the lord not knowing what to do and here we go sometimes when you stand in this pulpit it's awkward we're way out in the aleutian islands getting ready to leave and go back to anchorage and then home and i had a ticket in my pocket to get on an airplane the pastor came up and he said listen i can save you money i said how's that he said i flew a small airplane up here and i fly a small airplane and i can take you in my little airplane and you can save your ticket and this did not sound i said gee thank you so very very much but i've got this ticket we'll just make our way on home me and this other lawyer with me he said no no no you got to do it you got to do it and against every better judgment i had i said okay well we went out to the airport took us by his little plane and i looked at it and i thought well one good thing it's shiny then he walked around it we got in he's on the left front i'm on the right front the other lawyer's sitting right behind me and he started it up and it started up just fine well we taxied out i said should we pray he said yeah that's a good idea we normally don't i said well this time we're gonna and i'm telling you i prayed five eight minutes i prayed a long time we went and got on the runway he starts down the runway the plane lifted off ever so gently and we start climbing and it's wonderful not a problem in the world we started climbing and we flew probably three four minutes and something happened that will never leave my mind the pilot turned to me and he said we're going in the clouds and i can't fly in clouds they make me pass out i said clouds make you do what now it's been cloudy all day and we go right up into the clouds and you can't see anything and he looks at me and his eyes roll back in his head and he starts mumbling and he passes out passed out cold now i grabbed him and i shook him and i said come on you got to wake up so i can kill you now we are in the clouds flying along with no pilot and my friend in the back seat said we're dead aren't we i said there's a very good chance of that yes he said what are we going to do i said i don't know but there was a radio right there and i handed him the microphone and i said start asking for help so he's in the back seat reaching up and he said hello hello we didn't know any proper radio etiquette all we were saying was hello and somebody answered back hello hello don't you guys know proper radio etiquette and i said i said we don't know nothing tell them we're in an airplane with a passed out pilot and we don't know how to fly this plane the guy said i'm a freighter flying out of anchorage on the way to tokyo and he said you're telling me you have nobody who can fly that plane with you said tell them that's correct now you've got to understand i am sweating bullets he said the first thing i'm going to do is start circling so i don't lose you because i'll fly out of range of your radio and you won't have me anymore and he said i'm going to get anchorage emergency for you an anchorage emergency will be the people that can maybe help you try to save your life after about five minutes anchorage came on said we understand you have a passed out pilot and those of you do not know how to fly that plane we said that's right they said well the first thing we got to do is find you now never forget what this man at anchorage said he said my job is to get you home safe he said that's my job but he said here's the deal if you want me to get you home safe you got to promise me you'll obey my voice he said you can't see me but i can see you and he said if you're not going to obey my voice you're going to die when you can't see anything you have no idea how disorientated you become finally he said okay i found you now hear me clear he said you're four minutes from a mountain he said you're gonna crash in that mountain and die follow my voice i never said i have to follow your voice is that reasonable you see i understood without his voice i had nothing and do you understand without god's voice you have nothing nothing finally he got us turned and he said i'm freezing all the traffic in the area he said it's going to take me an hour and a half to get you to anchorage and there's a lot of weather between you and anchorage you're in for a rough ride and he said i want you to hear me i don't want you to look at what's going on outside i don't want you to pay attention to the storm just my voice he said if you start watching the storm you will die but i'll take you through it now because they cleared all the traffic several pilots those nighttime freighters o747 started talking to us they said we're praying for you men you're going to make it but listen to the voice that's the key they said trust the voice you realize your head is full of voices and everybody in this world wants to talk to you and everybody wants to be the controlling voice and god says i want you to be a living sacrifice i want you to put yourself on the altar and let my voice be your voice finally we went through the worst of the weather but there was still more and then the voice came back and it said now i'm going to line you up he said i'm going to bring you in right down the runway and at the foot of the runway are some lights and they're in the form of a cross he said don't you forget this the cross is the way home finally he's bringing us down we still can't see anything and all he kept saying is stay with me my sheep the bible says hear my voice and they follow me finally just a couple hundred feet off the ground we saw the cross i landed the plane in fact i landed it seven times finally it all came to a stop and the minute we stopped the pilot woke up the voice said thanks for listening i watch them crash and burn all the time because they won't follow my voice they don't understand i'm the one who can see them even when they can't see me but they get the voices in their head and they kill themselves they self-destruct thanks for listening to the voice then they put us in a motel room in about four in the morning the knock at my door i opened the door and a man was standing and he said hello david i said you're the voice you're the one who got me home he said i am you understand one day you're going to stand before him and say you were the voice you're the voice that brought me home if you're not on that altar as a living sacrifice your head's full of voices and then we wonder why kids crash and burn we wonder why marriages are shattered and the lord's saying i'm the one who has the voice all i can remember is that voice saying stay with me stay with me don't listen to what's going on in your head and don't watch the storm stay with me and i'll take you through tonight you have a god who has promised to take you through a living sacrifice holy can't see me you can't see me but i can see you that's what the lord said or what uh what symbolized the lord in the story elijah went up to the mountain he was scared to death but he had spent the time with god that he needed he went up to the mountain he found himself in a cave he's praying and asking the lord for things and then the lord passed by and there was a great wind a tornado came and elijah ripped the rocks out of the side of the mountain but elijah had been with god he knew that god was not in it went and then as he as he continued his quest to hear the voice of god and he was praying an earthquake shook the whole mountain but god was not in the earthquake and then a fire came down and swept through but god was not in the fire friends how many times would we make that mistake if we're praying about something and we hear we hear a great wind or an earthquake or a fire but we're not mature enough in the lord like elijah was to know that that's not god and then a still small voice a still small voice spoke god he followed that voice and then elijah eventually got his answer let's stand friends i'm sorry to keep you i kept you a few minutes over but by the grace of god we have a voice that we can hear but we have to do our part to hear that voice we have to do our part to be a mature enough christian like this man elijah was that we can distinguish between the voice of baal and the voice of jesus just like elijah did friends i am so grateful that we have a voice we um we have a voice that was prophesied to come in this day and we can hear it it can help make that voice of god clear to us and the more that that we are in this word here the um more clear that that voice will be and as that that man that lawyer said and as the the tower told them he said i can see you but you can't see me but do exactly as i say and i'll carry you through let's pray brother jordan if you come let's bow our heads almighty god we love you lord and father we we're me lord i'm stand here unworthy to stand before your people and knowing lord that i've i've made mistakes i haven't spent the time that i should lord i'm sorry i want to do better i want to do more lord i look at this man elijah and how what a great man he was that he spent the time and everybody was blessed because of it thankful for john the baptist i'm thankful for brother branham and he spent the time that he preserved the word for us to encourage us to refresh us lord god i'm so thankful lord help everyone here i pray lord every may every person here after this service today may we spend more time lord may we take this this video
