don't uh I don't maybe see them right now but welcome and God bless you thank you for for coming I U I wanted to share before we get started I wanted to share a testimony from last Sunday's service I was um his mother's day and and you know it's important to me and I'm sure it's important to everyone here that we honor our mothers in the proper way because they mean so much to us so Stephanie and I were working on getting um our Mother's Day gifts ready and and um it was just we're excited about service and uh so what happened on Saturday is that we uh something the enemy will always throw a curveball into your plans and some Stephanie and I were dealing with some stuff we were some some people that were close to us family members they said a couple things that that got to us and and we were a bit upset with this with with the whole situation so Stephanie and I were at uh at home and we were talking to each other and we were just complaining to each other and and we shouldn't do it and that's why when I came to church on Sunday morning I was like that why that was one of the first things I said is never say anything about anyone even it's if it's in your private home and to your closest person which would be your wife or your husband or your children be careful what you say so Stephanie and I were we were complaining to each other and we shouldn't have and uh the day goes by and we had ordered these these cakes uh for the mothers and I don't know how many we had 70 or 100 cakes or whatever it was and we uh we were going through the day and I was studying for my sermon and Stephanie was uh she was busy doing her thing and we forgot to pick up the cakes both of us were so devastated and both of us knew immediately that this was a result of us complaining even between a husband and a wife complaining and this was the Lord showing his children I'm a son of God Stephanie's a daughter of God he was showing us hey don't you say anything remember what I said last Sunday that if we are a Christian if we're not a Christian then we have every right to complain when somebody does us wrong we have every right to defend ourselves if somebody talks bad about us we have every right to get our way if if we are right in the in this course but when you become a Christian you forfeit those rights you no longer have a right to complain even if you're done wrong you no longer have a right to go after somebody even if they come after you when you become a Christian you forfeit those rights so I was feeling really like a hypocrite on Saturday because they were closed on Sunday morning and there was no way for us to get the gifts for our CH for our mothers I was upset Stephanie was upset so Stephanie was with her family with marily Lee and um um Stephanie's Brother David her her sister Tanya or her sister um Melissa and their families and uh they were there was it a what was it it was a shower um it was a dinner of some sort and I was at home studying and Stephanie was she was so upset she had told me on the phone we forgot this and I was like Lord first thing I did was I went before the Lord and said Lord I'm sorry I shouldn't have been complaining this morning and that was the first thing Stephanie said is when we were talking on the phone I said we shouldn't we shouldn't have complained so first thing we did is we got off the phone and I pray us Lord I'm wrong I we need a we need a miracle here and Stephanie she was worried and they had the the group around there and so Stephanie's telling the family about what we had done about how we forgot the cakes and Tanya my sister-in-law David Carroll's wife she said David knows the owner of the company and he calls the owner and the owner saysure I can meet you there on Sunday morning before church and and give you everything that you need and and you can bring your um bring it to your your church thought Lord once again got on our knees Lord you are so great he is brothers and sisters when I give a testimony and you know me now I've been preaching here here long enough when I give a testimony it's to show how foolish I am and how in inadequate I am and how how much I have no abilities at all but when you surrender to the Lord Jesus then he can make a way when you surrender to God he will make a way for you if you would just humble yourself and come before him and say Lord I'm sorry I'm not capable I need you and he's always there e puts his hand on us says I'll take care of it but the thing that we did right was we confessed before the Lord and we confessed to each other and then he made a way I also gave a testimony of uh of a brother that um had got into it with his with his colleague at work brother Manny is it okay if I say that it's you I don't want to embarrass you it's all right okay [Laughter] so brother Manny sends me a text last week and he says this he says good Afternoon brother Daniel I've been struggling with a coworker he said I went off on him he said that's not me he says it wasn't cool and I feel really bad about it he said the coworker has no respect but I'm going to apologize on Monday he said can you pre please pray for me prayed for brother Manny and then brother Manny apologizes he couldn't wait as I said he couldn't wait to get back to talk with this guy to make things right because remember what I said it doesn't have anything to do with Manny if he did him wrong what matters is how you how you respond to it brother Manny made a mistake and he was going and he wanted to make this right no matter what this man had done to him so you know it was a long weekend huh bro and then he finally gets back there and he's able to talk to this man and to make it right and then he sends me this this text he said good evening brother Daniel I don't mean to bother you he said I patched things up with my coworker but he stopped talking to me it's fine I have no animosity or hatred towards him I did my part God has blessed me so much am he says I don't care what they say about me God knows where my heart is same as we did and and it gets better and I responded to him I said brother Manny you did your best now it's up to the Lord to work on this man so then brother Manning sends me another text with a meme of a statue a picture that's missing the midsection of there it is right there of the middle and it says how empty the soul is without Jesus and he he writes me this this is how my life was when I was of the world until I met Jesus Christ he broke them chains of bondage of the street life and he deserves all the praise amen thank you brother Jordan then another day goes by and he sends me another text and he says brother good afternoon and brother Daniel my co-worker came to me and told me he was sorry for snapping at me we shook hands and made peace with each other we gave each other a big hug now we can clap did you notice that in both of these testimonies we had to repent we had to admit our faults and we had to ask God for mercy and then when we show that we are nothing but sinners that is when God steps in and gives us a testimony both times we weren't looking neither of us we weren't looking for a testimony to tell everyone about that would maybe Lift us us up and brag about something that the Lord did for us both times we humbled ourselves and said listen I'm the sinner I'm the what's wrong Lord help me I repent and then God Made A Way that's how we have to do brothers and sisters we don't seek our own thoughts we don't seek our own way we don't seek our own will we seek what God wants in our lives I want the church to please we we um we're under construction now and uh there's a lot of decisions that have to be make made and I want the church to pray for our renovation in in the construction that we're going through right now pray that sister Martha has been she's been looking to see how much it costs to rebuild the pews and then we've also brother Ed and I have looked in to getting chairs to replace to replace the pews we're trying to make the right decision so please please pray that the Lord will help us and we are together as a group and we want what's right and brothers and sisters I tell you I don't want anything with Daniel Evans at all I want my thoughts I want my desires I want them completely out of everything I want Lord I want what you want I want what God wants for our congregation I want what God wants for our people and that's that's the reason we see so many problems it seems like everybody is trying to get their way they always put themselves and their opinions above anyone else it's a stubbornness and I think that it's it's I think it's the most prevalent I think this problem of looking to ourselves and trying to serve ourselves is not not only the biggest problem in this church I believe it's the biggest problem in the entire world right now it's people trying to get what they want trying to please themselves and their opinion matters more than anyone else's what we should be doing is seeking God's will on these things putting him first and no matter what his decision is I don't even have an opinion on it Lord I want what you want that's how our attitude should be have your way Lord have your perfect will in every aspect of my life and that I know that's going to be better if I could just find his will I know it'll be better for our church I know it'll be better for our families I know it'll be better for our communities I know it'll be better about for our country we see the Holy Spirit if he would if we would just open our elves up instead of closing ourselves and try and get our way if we would just open ourselves up to him then we would Prosper we look in the politics of today we see these two Waring factions against each other and if they would just stop and if they would pray and they would ask the lord lord what do you want do you think he's going to tell the Democrats something that he's going to tell the Republicans he's God he's one and he'll say the same thing but instead we're just trying to get what we want we're trying to vote along the party lines instead of seeking God on those things if they would seek God then they would agree I know there would be little minor disagreements when we when we let the flesh get in there but our country would return to its Original Greatness we were talking yesterday wasn't complaining um but was talking not totally complaining I was talking with Stephanie about our President we should pray for our president I don't care if you're for Donald Trump or Joe Biden or whoever it is we should pray for our leaders because we will prosper if they make the right decisions we were I was telling her that this this man I was reading a a thing on the news and I said honey he's he's not capable he's not he's not in his right mind and I and wasn't complaining was just stating a fact that's a good excuse never do that but I was talking I was talking to Stephanie about this and I said he's not capable he can't even walk up to the podium and I said who's running the country and before she even thought about it she said Satan I thought that's right that's the truth and we see that it's Satan running this country because everybody's trying to get their way no one's thinking of the best for the country or the people they're trying to vote along the party Vines we see it back in the Garden of Eden right at the beginning of the Bible we see the serpent come in and he wanted his way and he had his way with Eve he got what he wanted and then we see even his children we see that they go through and we see the evilness of Cain and how Cain wanted his way and he was willing to kill his brother just to get his way his offering was not accepted by God and it angered him and it it offended him so much so instead of changing to God's way he killed his brother because he wanted his way of doing things and as I said I believe this is the biggest problem that's in the world today is we want our way remember the song Can't Always Get What You Want don't look it up brother Joe is a different Arrow huh but it's true you can't get what you want you want to get what you should want is what God wants and in this Great quest in our lives to get what we want we follow we fall into the Trap Of Destruction and that's why we see Wars around the world that's why we see hating in politics that's why we NE neither side cares you see countries attacking others because they want something and they are not seeking God about it but Sheed when they when they attacked Israel and Israel defends itself they want their way they want to conquer those people they want them wiped off the match show me how that can be God right it can't be most of the time and we talk about we pray about something most of the time we go to prayer with the wrong motives a large portion of the time you just want to say I prayed about it rather than staying in prayer and getting an answer from God and many times those answers don't come right away they come after hours of prayer and days and sometime years of prayer then you finally get an answer and God sees your heart that you're sincere in doing this in James chapter 4 it says this verse one from whence come Wars and fightings among you he's talking about prayer from where does do these wars and fighting come come they not hint even of your lusts that war in your members that word lusts means Desires in this Modern English it doesn't have any sexual undertone it's because of your desires you lust and you have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and War you have not because you ask not you ask and receive not because you ask a miss that you may be consumed May consume it upon your lusts the NLT translation of that says and even when you ask you don't get it because your motives are all wrong you only want what will give you pleasure it's all about what you want and that's why God won't answer those prayers because we have a preconceived outcome in our Minds that we desire the right way to approach God is to say Lord let your will come into my mind and my heart and then I can do your will this has nothing to do with me it happens brothers and sisters it happens all the way from the very top all the way to to countries all the way down to churches all the way down to our individual families even a relationship between two people it's two people instead of getting on their knees and praying to the Lord and asking him Lord what is your will for me because I want to serve you I want to exalt you as the song was saying that we're singing We Sing the song but do we really want to exalt God or do we want to exalt ourselves do we want to serve ourselves eles but Lord I want to exalt you I want to serve you what is your will for us in our lives and you see sometimes that circle gets smaller and smaller because we have self self-promotion we have self-will and smaller and pretty soon we're the only ones standing in our Circle how does that go with drawing the circle bigger but more often the case that is the case and what's all the purpose in this Stephanie's answer to my question was who is in charge and she said the devil is she said Satan is 2 Corinthians chapter 4 therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not but we we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness manipulating other people to get your way nor handling the word of God deceitfully a minister trying to get his way by using the word of God as justification but by manifest manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God but if our gospel be hid it it is hid to them that are lost in whom listen closely in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is in the image of God who is the image of God should shine unto them so the gospel is hidden to those that are lost and how is it hidden everybody knows everybody knows the gospel everybody knows about Jesus you may not believe Jesus but everybody knows about him so how can it be hidden the God of this world has blinded the minds of those who don't believe and if he didn't blind their minds then they would have received the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God but instead they serve themselves ultimately the spirit of Satan makes us the god of our own worlds what he does his spirit is he wants to be exalted as God he wants to set up high in the high places and be as God over the people as the Bible says but he also wants us to follow him he wants the people to be like he is and then if we have his Spirit then we exalt ourselves as gods of our own worlds so that now we become the center of everything that is in our lives instead of God we become the center the center when Jesus and it's says how can how can Satan be the God of this world when Jesus was tempted in the wilderness Satan offered him the kingdoms he offered them everything so how can you offer someone something that you don't have we see that he is the God of this world because he owns it it's his and now he has created his own Eden here on Earth where he is the God and he wants us to do the same he wants us to follow in his footsteps so he's this spirit is Lord or this spirit is I'm going to be Lord over my life I am going to be the ruler I am going to live my life for myself Genesis chapter 3 when they fell in the Garden of Eden Genesis 3:22 and the Lord God said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever so mankind is creating their own world with their own knowledge outside of God and they're beginning to trust now in their own merits in their own feelings in their own desires rather than trusting in God for everything and then he kicks them out of the Garden of Eden even in nature humans even in the in the natural world humans through their technology now they can change the hormones and and they can make their bodies different than something God has created mankind now has the ability to change the gender of a man or a woman this has never been the case how can this be it's because they're God over their own lives I don't care what God Made Me I don't care what God says I am going to do what I want to do and now we have we're able to use technology to do it Deuteronomy 22:5 says this a woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall the man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are an Abomination to the Lord thy God a woman should not wear masculine clothes and a man should should not wear feminine clothes that's meant to separate the genders a woman should look like a lady a woman should look feminine and a man should look masculine you should be able to tell the difference otherwise the Bible says it's an Abomination it disgusts God they all wore a robe back then but those the sisters wore a feminine robe and and the brothers they wore a masculine robe there was a difference and you see if you saw a man wearing a woman's robe you'd say there's something wrong here and that's what he said he said I want this these genders separated but now we can even change our anatomy now it's beyond clothes a woman can dress up like a man and look like a man but now she can change to a man a man can change to a woman and it's all because of self-will I am here on this Earth to get my way I'm here to serve myself and that's what I want that's the extreme but we're all subject to that influence every one of us let's go back to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 5 for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake Paul is saying that we are not preaching these things to serve ourselves and get our way the Amplified Bible says this for we preach not ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord and our and ourselves merely as your bonder servants for jesus' sake so we're not preaching this to benefit ourselves in fact we're slaves for Jesus's sake it's the other way around the minister is preaching to get his way or to further his narrative like the politicians do and to prove that his doctrines are right then he's thinking of himself and not Christ there's so many ministers I do that but I ask have they had a true experience with God where they completely surrender to the word and they are willing to preach whatever the Bible says even if it disagrees with their way of thinking that's a question to ask for all of us that stand in this pulpit and all of everyone else that listens to the one standing in the in the pull pit again Paul's saying he's saying we're not preaching this to promote our own Ministries but in fact we're we become your slaves we lowering ourselves to serving you for the for the gospel of Christ's sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of the darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of knowledge of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have it this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the of the power may be of God and not of us again it's not about me it's not about getting my way and these Earth and vessels you know what they are they're us they're human beings that all although unworthy they contain The Treasure of the Holy Spirit we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body of the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body these Earth and vessels then that power that raised Jesus from the dead will dwell within us and the Holy Spirit will dwell in these Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us so what does that mean it means that we need to surrender Our Lives brother and sisters to God to him remember in the Garden of Gethsemane came down to the end he could have walked away he knew that they were coming to get him and here he is bowing on his knees the man Jesus the man remember he was Flesh and Blood he was a human being and there he is and he's crying out to God and he's says Lord let this cup pass from me but thy will be done not my will that's a Christian that is the way we should be for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus's sake that the life of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh what is that life of Jesus that life of Jesus is a surrender to God complete surrender Lord I don't even want to have opinion I just want what you want tell me Lord show me what you want and I want to fall in line but it's the hardest thing for a human being to do today there's life if we die to our own thinking if we die to our own stubbornness if we die to our own desires there is life so how can we have he's talking about that we die and then we live how can we have both death and life let me read that that scripture again for we which are which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus's sake everybody dies from Adam until now everybody with the exception of Enoch and Elijah everyone has gone the way of death so he's saying here we all die that death that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our Mortal Mortal self so how can we have both life and death the last verse verse 12 answers it so then death worketh in us but life in you the life comes from the spirit of God death comes from the Mortal bodies we teach our children they watch us and we we show our children how to we want to get our way no matter what and then we teach our families to do that we teach our children to get your way in life I'm talking about everyone I'm not just talking about sexual immorality I'm talking about all of us that we spend our lives trying to get our ways rather than surrendering Our Lives to the desires of God for his will I really I use the example of changing your gender because it's so blaring but it's the same spirit all the way down in the churches all of us we are going to be the center of our world and we create this world around us where we are God and our opinion matters more than anything else you hear when when I'm witnessing to people you hear that oh I'm spiritual or I have something that you know you ask them do you know the Lord do you know God is there something in you that that wants to know God and then they they respond if you if you witness to a lot of people they respond that oh I'm spiritual or I have my own relation and what they're saying is that I I Am The Sinner of my world and I'll have a God in it as long as God does what I say as long as God listens to what I do what I say what I tell him to do then yeah God can come into my life otherwise I don't want God the exact opposite Psalm 81 says this verse 7 thou call callest in in trouble the Lord's speaking the anointing upon the psalmist thou callest in trouble and I delivered Thee I answered thee in the secret place of Thunder I proved thee By the Waters of meba Sila do you remember from our Wednesday night bible study what Sila means it means pause it means take it means take a moment and digest what you just read what you just heard here oh my people and I will testify unto thee oh Israel if thou will hearken unto me there shall be there shall no strange God be in thee if you listen to me neither shall thou worship any strange God I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt open thy mouth wide and I will fill it but my people would not hearken to my voice and Israel would none of me so I gave them up unto their own hearts lusts and they walked in their own counsel how true is that today we went through the Book of Judges and how Israel could was condemned because everyone did what was right in their own eyes they made their decision based on their own morality or their own understanding without dilig ently seeking God they lived in a world that pleased themselves rather than pleasing God verse 13 oh that my people had hearkened unto me and Israel had walked in my ways I should have subdued their enemies and turned my hand against their adversaries I would have come to help them if they would have just listened to me rather than doing it themselves the haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto him but their time should have endured forever he should have fed them also with the finest of Wheat and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee you missed the blessings of God because you wanted your way it's a shame I was talking with the kids on Friday night in the upper room and it was it was a smaller group of us so we we had a little bible study and uh Camila had on your phone you had your daily scripture and it was Matthew 28:19 go you into all the world and make disciples and I asked the group I said what does that mean why would you want to be a disciple what what what does that mean why would you want to be a disciple of this man Jesus how would that benefit anyone and and what does that even mean to be a disciple and come I think it was you that gave the the answer is that we all want to be identified with something we want to be identified through social media with this influencer or that in influencer and she said to be a disciple of Jesus is to be identified with him I thought that was really better than any answer I could have given and then it goes on and says to be baptized and we talked about what does it mean to be baptized and it's requirement that you are baptized in his name that you are no more your own person now you are taking on the name of God and you are no more your own person you surrender to God and you are making this public confession and that's what baptism is Lord I want to be with you I'm done Daniel Evans is finished now it's all the Lord after our discussion Hano and I had a chance to talk and and he asked he asked me when I was baptized and and just some some personal questions about my testimony and I told him I said well I said I gave my heart to the Lord on my 21st birthday I said I was a sinner I wasn't living right and I said said I I felt in my heart I felt condemned so I gave I made a commitment to the Lord and I gave my heart to him there but I didn't yet have the Holy Spirit that was a change in my life believe me that was the most pronounced change in my life that anyone has ever seen that that has seen me but has has known me but that wasn't it so time went on and H started asking about the Holy Spirit and and when that I receive that Holy Spirit and by this time it was just him and me talking and I said that there was a a time that I knew that I had received the Holy Ghost and and uh I don't know if Sister Yunis is back there but it was similar she gave a testimony one of our testimonies nights it was similar to that there was I was driving home from work it was late at night and there was something about this the the Lord was dealing with me and I knew I had completely surrendered to God and it was no more my own world it was no more I was closed off and I was the God of this world it was Lord I will do anything that you want I will preach I will say I will do anything that you want me to do because it's no more about me I want to surrender everything no matter what it is and now it's about you and I told him that was the moment that I knew that the Holy Spirit came into my life came into my heart and it wasn't that I spoke in tongues it wasn't that I even had an emotional response I wasn't crying there was nothing different about it other than I was sure I have the spirit of God in this vessel this Earth and vessel and that's how I know Lord whatever if I can just find your will whatever that will is whatever it takes I want to be that Stephen in the book of Acts he said he makes a statement he said you always he's talking to the Pharisees that are that are going to Stone him they cast him out of the city and they're standing there this man this young man named sa of Tarsus is there and they're going to kill this man and Stephen looks up and he says you always resist the Holy Ghost and it's because they want what they want themselves they want to be the god of their world it's like two Waring armies I am one Army you are one Army and God is the other Army and we're fighting against God it's our nature brothers and sisters don't say that you haven't been that way because you have you were born like that and we're fighting against God we want our way God wants his way and when two armies are fighting against each other and one Army is prevailing is overcoming the other Army there's this thing called surrender you raise up your hands and you give up and then you are under the control of that other Army that dominating Army that just won the battle that caused you to surrender you raise your hand say I give up raise the white flag say don't shoot anymore but imagine if you don't surrender imagine if the if the two armies against each other and this Army says we are going to fight to the last man we're not surrendering one after the other they fall and if you don't surrender you will be destroyed God is the prevailing Army I promise you Jehovah God has never lost a battle that's right if the people will put him first and not sin show me a place where they ever lost but when they sin is when they lose so us when we surrender then we come into the care of the other Army and we are completely subject to that other Army we lay down our arms we give up that other army takes in as a prisoner Paul said I am a prisoner of Christ not I'm going to rule my own world not I'm going to do it my way but now I become a prisoner of Christ Jeremiah the Lord sends him one day to see this Potter the Lord raises him up he says go over to this Potter's house and watch him work do you know what a Potter is when you have the clay and they have the thing that spins around and and the Potter takes the clay and he puts water on his hands and he starts forming this pot and he puts his hand in there and and makes makes this vessel and and then he takes it and and they he fires it well Jeremiah's watching this Potter God's with him he's saying watch what he's doing so he's watching this guy and the thing's spinning and he's forming this and there was a imperfection in the pot and the Potter sees it and he mashes it back up reforms it puts it back on the thing that spins around and starts forming it again then Jeremiah God tells Jeremiah he says behold the clay that is in the Potter's hands he said so are you in my hands he says see how I can recreate this thing that had blemishes that was messed up I can take it and I can reform it he says now go and tell the people what I said tell them this experience preach this sermon about this Potter so Jeremiah goes and he goes to the people and he preaches this sermon to the people Jeremiah 18:12 and the people respond to the prophet Jeremiah's sermon and they said there is no hope but we will walk after our own devices and we will do everyone do the imagination of his evil heart the NLT says don't waste your breath we will continue to live as we want to stubbornly following our own evil desires the enemy has the same purpose he's trying to get us to continue to follow along the way that we're doing and not surrender to God like this like this lump of clay there was a blemish and there's so many blemishes in me I see so many sins and I see so many things wrong with me and it's just like Lord all right here we go again Mash me up and for me I want to be that perfect vessel and he says I can do it God tells us I can do it just surrender to me I'll close with this man John the Baptist I believe he was the greatest of them all have pretty good reference in saying that is Jesus said the same thing this man John the Baptist it's a young man he was from the priesthood he goes in the wilderness as a young man and he is his whole desire and I can prove that John the Baptist more than anyone I have ever seen aside aside from the Lord Jesus wanted God's Will and it didn't matter what his will was John wanted God's will so he goes in the wilderness and he lives he comes out of the Wilderness and he starts preaching repentance and he starts preaching like hey you're not all that you need to repent and you need to come to this these Waters and be baptized for the remission of sins so he's preaching this and the lord gave him some Vision John 1 ver 25 and they asked him and said why baptizes thou then if thou be not that Christ nor Elias neither that Prophet John answered them saying I baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom you know not he it is who after coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latched I am not worthy to un loose these things were done in bethabara Beyond Jordan where John was baptizing the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world right there we see that John was the first Christian this is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me this is the one I told you about this is the one that's coming after me who is far greater than me this is him and I knew him not but that he should be made made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water NLT says I didn't recognize him as the Messiah but I have been baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it Abode on him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said okay so John's saying the one that sent me to baptize the one that gave me my commission this same one which was who was God this same one told John upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost so John had an experience before this happened he saw this in a vision or or however the Lord spoke to John and he said that this one that's coming this is the one that's not going to baptize you in water but he is going to baptize you with the holy spirit of God the same God that moved across the waters in Genesis chapter 1 that separated the light from the darkness that created light upon the Earth this Same Spirit is coming and it's not going to be water like I'm baptizing you with you're going to get baptized with that Spirit was John's old Ministry hisory look how important to John this is and I saw on bare record that this is the Son of God again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he said Behold the Lamb of God and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus John and Andrew now this was John's whole Commission in life this was everything thing to John this was his whole Ministry that we're talking about but John more than anyone else as I said John was not the god of his world John's world did not revolve around his ministry John was willing to give it up at any time for God he was willing to say I'm wrong he was willing to do anything this great man John the Baptist and I'm going to prove to you that he was willing to do that the musicians can come and get ready Luke 7: 19 this is after this is John's in prison now these people hated John he was thrown in prison they wanted his head and here he is and his disciples were come to him and John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus saying are thou he that should come or look we for another so John is asking he's saying hey I know I preached this message I know I did I I know I preach to you all of this stuff but I want to be right I could be wrong it was the most important thing to John the Baptist that he was right with God not that he was proven right not that he was the god of his world but that he was right with the father no one else mattered to John so he said hey can you just go ask him I know we had this experience I know I know I said all of this but this is so important just ask him am I right when the men were come to him they said John the Baptist has sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or should we look for another and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sight then Jesus answered and said unto them go your way tell John what things that you have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf here the dead are raised the poor to the poor the gospel is pre preached preached and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me another translation says God blesses those who don't fall away because of me the Messiah requires a lot but God will bless those who when they hear the true gospel preached that they won't fall away until their own selfishness to their own Traditions but they will surrender to God and when the messengers of John were departed then Jesus began to talk to them to his people he began to speak unto the people concerning John and he says what went you out in the wilderness to see he said a reed shaken With the Wind many of these people that were there were baptized by John but what we went you out to see a mo a man clothed in soft rment behold they which are gorgeously appar which are gor gorgeously apparel and live delicately are in the king's courts but what went you out to see a prophet I say unto you much more than a Prophet this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face Malachi chapter 3 is quoting which shall prepare thy way before thee for I say unto you among those that are born of women there is not a greater Prophet than John the Baptist but he that is least in in the kingdom is greater than he and all the people that heard him and all the publicans Justified God being baptized with the baptism of John but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves being not baptized of him they wanted their [Music] way and the Lord said where unto where unto then shall I liken the men of this generation and to what are they like they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have piped unto you but you have not danced we have mourned to you but you have not wept for John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine you say he ha the devil the son of man cometh eating and drinking and you say Behold a gluttonous man a wine bibber a friend of publicans and sinners they're calling Jesus worldly because he didn't line up with their religious world that they had created in their [Music] minds but wisdom is Justified of all our children you see John the Baptist he was willing to go before whoever it was and say I was wrong I was mistaken about my religion I was mistaken about the way I thought but do you see his heart he had a pure heart and he was right but the reason he was the greatest of them all is because he was was willing to Humble himself for God and he wasn't wrong he was very much right and I see that how many of us are willing to say you know what I may have been wrong about the way I believe I may have I may have have have thought wrongly about certain things about maybe some of my doctrines I could have been wrong well not me brother I'm sure about what I believe are you more sure than John the Baptist was when he looked across the river and said Behold the Lamb of God I think not we always have to be willing to Humble ourselves and say I am not the sinner of My Universe I am not the the god of my [Music] world the God of this world ultimately becomes ourselves brother and sisters we want our way and God you can be my God as long as you'll serve me that's the way of the world that's the attitude of the world but we should be falling down on our knees and crying say Lord I just want your will Jesus said he said straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there will be that find it it's going to be those that actually surrender to the the Lord those are going to be the ones that find it Jesus said many will come in that day and say have I not done many mighty works in your name have I not cast out devils in your name maybe healed the sick in your name have I not done all these things and Jesus will say depart from me you that work iniquity I never knew you the Pharisees they look looked the part but the disciples they were these of the Pharisees thought there are these these worldly people that came out of the world that they had a tender heart brother Manny they would do anything Lord whatever it takes I'm going to do it I may have this bad past I may look this way and but Lord I just want to serve you I want to make it right with my colleague at work I'm willing to say I was wrong I'm willing to say I looked at people and I judged them wrong I condemned them and I'm the one that should be condemned as I said My Testimony with my wife we repented Lord we're sorry for complaining we have no right to complain you've done everything and we just we just want to be in your will and then look what he did he talk about a miracle right there sitting next to my wife was the one that knew the owner of the the company he says I'll take care of it he says you're my child that Potter that clay he says no I'll just REM mold it you're okay you're all right but I've done all this Lord I've messed up I I've sinned and I've I've I've made all these mistakes he's like it's all right just let me do it don't be the god of Your World let me be the god of your world and then he can remake us Bible says that we seek out our own salvation through fear and trembling am I saying that you should question what you believe yes I am go before God and ask him Lord am I right am I right in the way that I think I want to know you don't question him because you want to break the rules you don't question him because you want to sin you question him because you want to be right but God can't come into your world you need to come into His World that's the truth brother Josiah I know the time is near where everything that I hold dear will lay before the holy consuming fire all my works and all my deeds and every prayer sit on my knees will lay before the holy consuming fire and all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him that same spirit is what I want to see in me all I want to see is Jesus Lord let that spirit that was in Christ Let It Shine forth from me sh through humility that he had hurt and self-inflicted pain and everything that I thought gained will lay before the holy consuming fire words of knowledge in his name Healing Hands that touch the lame but lay before the whole holy consuming fire all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus Shine Shing through me all I want to see oh all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus Shine through me and hear him say and hear him [Applause] say Well done my preious one oh well done well done my faithful [Music] brothers and sisters can you imagine John the Baptist he was struggling as I said the greatest the greatest of them all and there he was struggling Lord I just want to be right dear God let me just let me just be right you're the one that matters to [Music] me I can see why Lord let me be a John the Baptist I can see why he was so special in God's mind and he said when those two Messengers came back can you imagine how he felt when they said brother John the man that that was on the river that day that you said Behold the Lamb of God God that takes away the sins of the world that man he said to come back and tell you things that we saw he said to tell you that the sick were healed he said to tell you that the blind were given their sight he said to tell you that the that the the poor had the gospel preached to [Music] them Imagine John how was right I was right can you imagine how he felt in that song wasn't too long after that that they cut his head off because of his testimony can you imagine how he felt when he went up and he heard those words that Josiah just said well done a good and faithful one brothers and sisters if we could just surrender ourselves and not try to get our way in life if we can just search the Lord say Lord I'm willing to give up anything I don't care that's how I feel feel like Lord I'll preach whatever if it disagrees with something that I've said before Lord I'll preach what you lay on my heart for all all of us here there's a reason it says that you will work out your own salvation through fear and [Music] trembling not that you're going to rely on the pastor I'm like that Clay Pot constantly having to get rebuilt it's not that you're going to rely on any Prophet or anybody else you're going to rely on the one that did save save you you're going to rely on the perfect Lamb of God but you have to talk to him you have to know what he says and you have to be willing to forsake everything you have to be willing to say you know what I was wrong about this I was wrong about that you're not greater than John the Baptist and he did it and then it came right back around said no you were right but because you surrendered your life because you were willing to follow me come on in well done my good and faithful one all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus shining through me and hear him say Well done I [Music] preious [Music] one well done my faithful one all I want to see is is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus shining through me let's all
