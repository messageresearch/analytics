in the Book of Psalms the first [Music] Psalm I uh didn't plan on reading this Psalm I it didn't even come to mind and I was talking with brother Josiah in the back and thought this Psalm is perfect for the message I want to bring this morning Psalm chapter 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in in his law that he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the riv rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper what words let's bow our heads our Great and Mighty Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for these words and Lord our Delight is in your word father we pray that we could just find our place in this word and in your perfect will and move in tune of the Gospel in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you you can be seated thank [Music] you welcome brothers and sisters welcome visitors I um brother Benji God bless you you're you're an old friend but we've never met it's it's good it's good to have you in service from Nevada right God bless you my friend sister Jessica welcome it's good to to see you again welcome I love that smiling face and that Zeal to serve the Lord welcome God bless you I met uh uh sister Rebecca Oliver where are you sister Rebecca could you raise your hand there you are hiding back there it's good it's good to see you I I was thinking about so when sister Rebecca walked in um we uh I greeted her and she said she's knows my brother Jeremy at voice of God Recordings sister I'm trying to place your family do you know Josephine Jarvis you've never met her well God bless you it's it's good to have you in service welcome and all the other visitors if I didn't recognize you God's recognized you it's it's good to have you line old man where you been bro you've been awall for a while been to Japan and Hawaii and all over the place it's good to have you back my friend God bless you Stephanie and I were we're driving to church this morning and um it's really neat because she wanted to teach on the Beatitudes in her Sunday school class and um she asked me she said um there was one of them she didn't understand and she said it was blessed are the poor in spirit and she said what does that mean and I said you know what I don't know I said look at a couple of the other translations and and see if you can get it well so she gets on on her phone and she types it in and uh right away it comes up what it means and I'm driving I look over and that's not the Bible that was AI generated answer so she she types it in and these this it scrubs the internet and it it generates an answer from everything it's written and it's not even a human being that wrote this thing it's something that's not it's not real it's a machine and it makes it to where now it's like this artificial intelligence is better than even a preacher it's better than anything and it can give you an answer to whatever question you have and as I was thinking about that and going along and I was like honey turn that thing off just read read the Bible and she's like well it's it's it's a good answer I said yeah it sounds good but this this isn't even this is not even a living breathing organism it's it's fake it's it's a computer and you I was just thinking on that and that's the way that the enemy does the enemy wants to take the Holy Spirit out of the Church to take each one of us have a each one of us have a role in this divine plan of God and what the enemy does it's like no I'm going to take that out I'm just going to make it easy on you just so you can search the internet and I'll I'll make a machine that can give you the answer and it's almost always a better answer than a person could give you and I'll just give it to you right here really easy and it's pulling out the gifts out of the church and replacing them with something else and it makes for a lazy generation it makes to where we just we have all the knowledge we need we have everything that we have is right here in the little square Idol what I call it I mean it's more rectangular than it is square but you know it's it's it's a plan of the enemy and it's like I said it's to take that relationship that all of us have with God to take that out and replace it with something else wow I was driving home week or two ago from Flagstaff and uh I listening to um the Bible and Book of Matthew and I got to Matthew Chapter 5 and Matthew Chapter 5 is the start of The Sermon on the Mount most famous sermon that brother that the Lord Jesus preached just a I mean a masterpiece and as I was listening going down the mountain I was just taking in this wisdom and I I was I was saying Lord How could a man speak with such words how could a man speak with such wisdom as the Lord Jesus taught and and one thing after the other when it went through the Beatitudes and it and then he he goes and he he Contin continues his sermon and out loud I was saying Lord who could say such words he's saying things like you are the salt of the earth but if a salt has lost its flavor then what good is it it's the same thing brother James taking out the Holy Spirit out of the church and just replacing it with a machine or phone he says you are the light of the world he said but don't hide your light under something he said let your light shine among men he said that and then he warns the people he says I've not come the Lord Jesus the Messiah God in flesh he says I haven't come to do away with the law and the prophets he said I came to fulfill what they taught and he's warning the crowd he's like you're going to hear something that might not be what you've grown up with he's warning the crowd that it might not be your way of thinking then he goes on and he starts talking about this law and he says you've heard it Tau that you shall not murder he said but and if you murder you're liable to judgment but he says this he says but if you're angry with your brother you're liable to judgment taking the Commandments The Ten Commandments and now he's making them real in people he says this he says you have heard that you shall love your brother and you shall hate your enemy he said but I say to you love your enemies and pray for those that persecute you so your F so you that this is very important pray for those that persecute you so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he makes his son to rise on the evil and on the good and send Reigns sends rain on the just and the unjust for if you love those who love you what reward do you have I ask us in this congregation if you love that those that love you what reward do you have and because and then he says but the Sinners and the tax collectors they do the same thing he says and if you greet only your brothers what more are you doing than other people if you're just greeting those that believe like you if you're just greeting your your brethren that are part of your group then what good as Jesus said what good are you he says don't even the Gentiles the unbelievers don't they even do the same thing he said you must therefore be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect so how can we be perfect he and and as he's as he's ministering there and he has this big crowd out in the field in the grass it says that they were they were sitting there and and as he's ministering he starts to change direction from these Commandments in the law and it's such a sweet thing as I was going down the mountain I was like Lord you're so kind you're so sweet in the way that you are and he's looking out on the people and he must have started to feel their anxiety he must have started to feel that that these people are are struggling with themes every one of them is struggling with things at home they're struggling with their jobs they're struggling with their family they're struggling with their kids with their moms and their dads they're they're they're having problems and then the Lord in his kindness and his love he looks out and maybe and I can't speak for God but it seems like maybe he felt that from the people and then he he starts to move as I said he starts to change directions of the church I mean of of his sermon and the Lord Jesus the Bible says that he's a high priest that's able to be touched by the feelings of our infirmities he understands how it is he understands how it is to suffer he understands all of the sins that are out there he understands the Temptation for all of them all of us have different Temptations and all of us have different weaknesses I may be able to relate with brother Aaron's weaknesses but I might not be able to relate with brother Josiah's weaknesses that's why God has placed in this church different people with different experiences and different gifts to bring because I can't if brother Josiah as I said if I don't understand I can't counsel I can't encourage brother Josiah like someone else that maybe has gone through what he's going through and vice versa but the Lord Jesus was different he understood all of The Temptations and the enemy knew who he was and the enemy hit him with every Temptation that's on the earth so he is that high priest he understands he understands how it feels for somebody to have a weakness with addiction he understands how it feels for somebody to have a weakness with sexual immorality he understands all of those things while some of us might not understand it but he understood it and that's why Brothers s it's so as I just said we can't take those gifts out of the church we need the people here not for yourself everybody thinks going to church I'm going to go to church because I want to get something I say it a lot go to church to give something go to church to give out your love wow I just saw the garas back there brother and sister Gara God bless you welcome to patriarch it's good to have you in [Applause] service come to give and then we receive as we give so he looked at Jesus he he looked out on this audience feeling their their anxiety there was a on Wednesday night there's a woman that came um sister Missy is she here that that lady that you witnessed to um um the lady that you witnessed to that was talking uh her name was an she came and just a hard life elderly sister struggling and has has I mean struggling with a place to to sleep at night going from shelter to shelter and just not having anything and she she comes and brother Jordan and I were talking with her and she was just destitute and and I said are you a Christian she said well I don't really know what it means and I said let me tell you a scripture and and I quoted to her the Lord Jesus saying um come unto me all ye that are burdened and heavy laden and I will give you rest and she looked at me and she said I like that she said say it again and and I simplified it a little bit and I said come unto me all you that are carrying a heavy burden and I will give you rest I said that's what Jesus does and she said tell me again and it was three or four times that I repeated it and she said oh I like that I said sister I said there's a whole book book of quotes like that I said and and every one of them is just as good as that one it's really really blessing her but there's something that we have to do also let's turn to Matthew chapter 6 now again Jesus is on the mountain and he's giving this sermon on the mountain and as I said precious words like no man had ever spoken is what Jesus is is preaching here Matthew 6: 25 and he felt as I said he must have felt the anxiety that was in the people and he says this he says therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the light life more than meat and the body than rainment so he's saying he's saying you're wor worth a lot more than the clothes that you have on your life is worth a lot more than the food that you're you're Desiring to have and God knows it and he says and he continues on he says behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor they gather into the barns yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not much better than that imagine the people listening to this and the struggles that they were having at home and he goes on and he says he says which of You by taking thought can add one cubit to a statue the ESV says which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his life he says you're worrying about anxiety and you that worry isn't going to change anything wow and why take ye thought for reignment for your clothes consider the lies of the field how they grow they toil not they're not working and that they don't Spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not AR raay like one of these so he's saying even the most prosperous King that had ever lived can't even compare to this one little beautiful flower in all of man's achievements he can never make something as beautiful as God's simplest achievements wow and these lilies they show up every year you can count on them being there you can count on sister uh sister Rebecca back back there you can count on the spring flowers coming up in Ohio and in Indiana you know that they're going to be there they they're going to show up and yet nobody's worrying about them the sun rises every morning no matter if we worry about it coming up or not it's going to be there whether I'm depressed whether I'm looking for a job whether I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills that light spreads across the Earth no matter how much my tiny problems are I've gave the testimony before as I was really struggling with things I was I was really sad and depressed and I didn't know what direction my life was going just a few years ago and I go up on an elk hunting trip in northern Arizona and I'm up there and and we come back after dark and we come back to the UTV and we turn out our lights and I looked up in the sky there was no moon no clouds just these beautiful stars you could see the Milky Way up there all the different colors and the Stars went all the way down to the ground most beautiful thing one of the most beautiful things I could ever even imagine and I'm looking up there and I'm thinking Lord every one of those those heavenly bodies up there is bigger than the rock that I'm standing on and you created everyone and I'm worried about my problems thinking that maybe you're not hearing me no he knows if he can create all of this then he can surely provide for us verse 30 wherefore if God so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not not not much more clothe you oh you have little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed he's saying that's up to God to do those things so don't worry about how you're going to pay the bills if a car breaks down you're G to get it fixed brothers and sisters many of us have been here for a long time has God not provided Ed every time that we've needed it every single time and we worry we struggle how am I going to do this but he he does it we look back it's like well wow I got through it and we don't even remember those struggles but when it's here it's like man this is rough for after all these things do the Gentiles seek the unbelievers for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things so he's saying that they hey the unbelievers worry about this stuff you know the people that don't believe in God the people that don't believe in the Lord Jesus they worry that they're not going to be able to pay the bills right they worry that their kids aren't going to be saved aren't going to have a a a happy life or they're going to marry the wrong person or they're not going to have the right career they worry about all these things and he's like hey so the unbelievers worry about this why are you worrying about it because you believe in God right then why are you worrying about it but there's a catch to all this remember Jesus preached earlier in this sermon on The Sermon on the Mount he preached about being honest about giving to others and when someone slaps you on the cheek turn the other cheek and let him slap that to even pray for those that would despitefully use you to love your enemies like you love your friends he just finished praying or he just finished pre preaching about that that was the first part of the sermon now here's the catch verse number 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you what a promise seek first the kingdom of God seek first the righteousness of God he had just said blessed are that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled earlier in his sermon and now he's saying now you seek that righteousness and all these other things they'll be they'll be given to you but here's the most important thing take therefore no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow shall take thought for uh for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof English Standard version says don't be anxious about tomorrow for tomorrow will be anxious for itself sufficient for the day is its own trouble I promise you that once you solve this problem you're going to have more tomorrow right they don't go away you just get new ones it's a variety I appreciate it at least it's not the same one I'm but it is though it's you'll get past this one there'll be another one but seek first that Kingdom amen brothers and sisters when we work seek God's righteousness in your career your work will be a better place if you're a Christian at work just like you are in church practice Christianity at work if someone does you wrong at work be kind to them you're a Christian at work too so if somebody insults you or does you wrong or double crosses you let that Christianity come out and then you be kind to that person and help that person whoa It's what Jesus taught and it's not just for the folks in church if he B treat you bad then work harder for him say what you has no right to treat me that way yeah but did you have a right to sin against Jesus did you have a right to sin against Jesus no I didn't either and even if my boss doesn't treat me right I'm still going to serve him and do the best that I can we had a we had a guy that um was doing some international travel for work um not too long ago and we were was working with uh uh the travel guy um in DC and he just did a great job the guy I mean it was his job to get all of my travel and all of my every all of the Hoops that we have to jump through and all the all the stuff and this guy just do did a great job so when I got back I uh sent him a cash award and boy he he just he really appreciat appreci ated it but he did his job and he worked hard and he did what he was required to do but a little bit was added to him just for doing a good job and that's how we are if we do a good job of work if we if we are kind to people and respect people it will be added to us you will be more successful I promise if you respect your colleagues if you respect both those that are underneath you and those that are above you and those that are equal to you you will prosper be a Christian first the um we need to make sure that we're seeking the benefit of others more than ourselves Jesus as I said Jesus didn't say just those at church Jesus said prefer your brother prefer these other people over your and you'll see that if you do that you will gain more respect like this young man that helped me at work you will get more respect and you will prosper from it same thing is at school when you're at school you are representing the kingdom of God seek ye first the kingdom of God when somebody sees you at school are they seeing a Christian are they seeing someone that they want to be like are they seeing someone that respect are they seeing someone that that acts like a Christian that that talks like a Christian that looks like a Christian or in our in our social media Snapchat and Instagram and all that when someone looks at your stuff are they seeing a Christian are they seeing a Godly person when they look at your page or your post does it represent Jesus Christ come on now or is it something else that the Lord might be ashamed of wow same thing I'm going to go through a couple more like our personal finances are we seeking the righteousness of God first above everything else in our finances what do you mean I gotta have I got to pay my rent I got my car and pment I have my insurance I have my food I've got to eat I've got to do all these things but are you sinning with your finances it's my job as Pastor to get into your personal life sorry I'm not sorry I just kind of say it broadly and then you take it and apply it to your life all right are you being frivolous brothers and sisters with your spending buying things you don't need to do taking the money that God gives us and blowing it are we doing things like that it's robbing God and if we are robbing God if we are not living up to our role which is seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness then we are robbing God of something we're taking the money that God gives us and robbing it you say well it's my money I'll spend it the way I want to what do you mean I Rob God Malachi chapter 3 says this verse eight will man rob God yet you have robbed me but you say wherein have we robbed you and tithes and offerings notice he said tithes and offerings you know me I'm not pandering for money I'm telling you what the word says you are cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat meat means food may they that there may be food in my house and prove me now herewith sayeth the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall be not room enough to receive it seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and these things will be added to you how do you expect to be successful in life financially if you're not doing what God told you if you're not giving him his first you're not making a deal with God either you know this Prosperity Gospel nonsense you're not making a deal with God is like Lord I'm going to give you my next paycheck then you're going to let me win the lottery that's not what he's saying he's saying just stand fast be steadfast give and then you will receive but as I said it's not it's not a deal and watch how God protects those who are faithful and giving verse 11 and I will rebuke the devour for your sake and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the field sayeth the Lord of host of host if you're a far farmer your crops will do better if you're a businessman your business will do better if you have a steady job then your finances will go farther farther that's God's words it's not my words and all the nations shall call you blessed for you shall be a delight delightsome land sayeth the Lord of hosts it's the same thing seek first the kingdom of God in our relationships and our families with our husbands and our wives mothers and daughters cousins and brothers and sisters seek first that Kingdom and his righteousness and it'll be added to you we if you perceive someone Did You Wrong your husband your wife be a Christian about it turn the other cheek are you a Christian with your husband are you a Christian with your wife are you a Christian with your parents with your children Stephanie and I were we building this house and um if you haven't noticed things are more expensive now than they were a couple years ago so when we got our loan it was great we could pay for it but now it's like Whoa man how are we going to how are we going to finish this house and it was just it's really started to the pressure started to get to us and and so on uh yesterday day before yesterday so we started to bicker you know and I was like you don't need that and this and this and there too much money and and and and she got upset and and you know how husbands and wives do and you know brother brandham tells the story when sister brandham was upset and he walked up to her as a good husband would and he he said honey kindhearted and he said he he wanted to talk he started to talk about things that she would want to talk about and he started cons solar and just like a good husband you know I didn't do that I should have but I didn't do it and so we we continued on in our and our whatever we were doing and then finally we both honey I'm sorry and and I'm sorry and and you know we we made up but we'd already escalated it too far and got mad at each other and both of us just felt terrible about arguing and and but and I was like honey it's okay everything will be okay and she's like honey it's okay you know we're feeling good and and then out of the blue I get a phone call I get a text and we have this little piece of property in Jeffersonville and I've been trying to sell it for three years and finally we just gave up and and it the the um contract with the real estate agent expired and it was just sitting there and right after Stephany and I make up I get a phone call from some guy in Jeffersonville wanting to buy our lot and it was is pretty much exactly the money that we would need to finish [Applause] up but we sought first the kingdom amen we sought first righteousness we we admitted we were we were wrong and arguing and then the Lord's like if you just do this if you'll just be a Christian I'll add to it don't worry about it I know your heart when you went into this I know what you're doing and you may have regrets and and think that I made a mistake but the Lord knows and he's it's a promise right here he said I'm gonna provide for you there's a story that we all know but I I want to I want to tell this story again in the book of First Kings and what happens in chapter 17 is is this man this great Prophet Elijah he comes and he he just comes out of nowhere and he goes to the king and he says neither due nor rain is going to fall until I call for it later on we know that Elijah prayed under the anointing of God Elijah prayed that it wouldn't rain because of the evilness of this man Ahab and his wife Jezebel so he's Elijah prays this and brothers and sisters when we pray for something and it's the Lord's will we have to live in that prayer and it might not be the easiest thing when we're praying we want God's Will and we want to live in God's Will and here is Elijah and he prayed that it wouldn't rain and he had to live in that famine that was created from that prayer so Elijah the Lord tells Elijah he says go up to this Brook and stay there he says I've commanded Ravens to feed need you so Elijah goes up and he's sitting by this Brook and every morning and every evening the birds would bring him food what what a tremendous testimony Elijah sought first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and then it was added to him he got what he needed he got his food and he got he got his Dr his water from the brook and everything was working out good and he's there and then the brook dries up because again it was a famine and it was a drought so God tells Elijah he says go down to this place first Kings 178 and the word of the Lord came to him saying arise and get thee to zerath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee stop there for a moment I have commanded a widow woman to sustain you that's amazing an amazing statement there's people in this situation now all many of us might be in this situation we might be this Elijah or we might be this widow woman God knew what his commandment was the widow woman or Elijah knew that God told him but you know who was left out of the knowledge the widow woman yet she was commanded to sustain this man of God so he arose and went to zerath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to f fetch it he called her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thy hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little oil and a Cru and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die so she was starving to death and worse than her starving to death her son her little boy was starving to death and imagine she's going out there she grabs two sticks she's going to bring it in and start a little fire in her stove and she's GNA she's going to boil maybe this water and and she's going to put this this meal in there use the water maybe to to get the meal and then fry it up and that's going to be the last meal that she has there was no chance for anymore imagine her looking at her son his maybe sunken in cheeks little skinny arms she sees her boy dying and she looks and here comes this man maybe she knew him maybe she didn't I don't know and she says and he says go and get me a drink and she says okay I'll go get you some and he and he says and make me some food too and she says she didn't lie she says listen she says all I have is this handful of meal and just this little bit of oil it's all I've got in my house many of us someone might ask us for money and my first answer is I don't have any money and I might have a $20 bill in my wallet but she was honest and she said we don't have anything but just this little bit and then I Elijah said something so strange but Elijah knew that he was commissioned of God he knew that God had prepared this woman to feed him to take care of him he knew that God was with him but the woman didn't know that God had commanded her all of us look at look at through your lives how many times have you gone forward in faith not knowing and then you do something and you look back and you say that was God it's the same thing he commanded you to do it you just didn't know you were walking perfectly in God's Will and that's this woman here she has no idea and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou Hast said but make me there thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son she must have thought and I know this man's a man of God but she's asking for the little he's asking for the little bit that I have God's asking just for this little morsel that I have how much more important was that than all the granaries that maybe Ahab had stored up this is what God had chosen this is the blessed as as we've heard the prophet say the hidden Mana maybe the Mana that was put into the ark this is something this meal is blessed for thus sayith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the Cru of oil fail until the day that the Lord sends reain upon the Earth so she was Pres presented with the word of God seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness she was presented with that and it these things shall be added to you it's the same thing Elijah is telling her that the Lord Jesus was saying when he looked out upon the audience on The Sermon on the Mount and he said seek first the kingdom of God and all this anxiety that you have it'll be added to you and she did according to the saying of Elijah and she and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not de neither did the Cru of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by his Prophet Elijah so every time she put her hand in that mirror that that Barrel she dumped it out she gave it to Elijah she goes back in there puts her hand in there there's another handful takes the Cru of oil wow she makes it up she fries it up they get hungry again she reaches in there it's another one a miracle how many of us can say lord always provided for me he always took care of me he was always there for me when I needed it he never forsook me I thought I was so poor and I thought I was so destitute I I thought everything was bad and I thought all my family was gone and then all of a sudden it's changed and there's a turn of events in each thing for us that the Lord has his hand on it just like he had his hand on this widow woman that was commanded to do one of the greatest things that we read in the book and she had no idea it's one of the best stories I mean we we look at all the people out there at that time with Ahab and Jezebel and and and all of a sudden this little widow woman shows up in her son and God had mercy on her and gave her a great work to do how many times can we say it and it's happened to us everybody can but we don't recognize God for what he does but seek first the kingdom of God live right be a Christian do your do exactly what Jesus says in all parts of your life honey I told them about our argument the other day it's all her fault that's what I told him no I [Laughter] didn't but when we sought the kingdom of God he provided and when we sought his his righteousness he provided it when Martha and and Mary when Jesus came to their house Jesus entered into the village a woman named Martha welcomed her into the house and she had called her her sister Mary who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching but Martha was distracted with much serving and she went up to him and said Lord do you not care that my sister I'm doing all the work and she's left me alone to do all this tell her to help me I'm cleaning the dishes and I'm I'm serving the food and I'm sweeping the floor and all look at look at the sink it's all full of dishes and nobody's there to help me and there's Mary just sitting at your feet listening to you talk and then Jesus rebukes her and he says Martha you're too you got too much anxiety about the things of the world Mary is more right because she sought the kingdom of God and his righteousness she wanted that word I always related more to to Martha I would have been that believe me I would have been the Martha I would have been been out there I'd have been the one working say no I'm not the only one the place does anything and then the other people would have been more right than me and here is Mary and she's just taking in these beautiful words from the Lord wouldn't you have loved to been Mary and listening to I would have loved to been Martha too and serving the lord Jesus such a such a wonderful wonderful thing and then he says Martha you're anxious and you're troubled but there's one thing that is necessary Mary has chosen the good portion which will not be taken away from her there's Cain and Abel they uh they come to the Lord and they build their Altar and they make their sacrifice and here is Cain and he's thinking here here is what's the best looking here is here is what that the Lord will be more pleased with look at how much better my altar looks than his pile of rocks with blood on it and a dead animal look at how much better mine is than his and then God looks down and he refuses Cain he says Cain just do it like this but Cain was full of him himself he would not change he wanted to do it his way he wasn't seeking the righteousness of God he was seeking the the he was he was seeking fame he was seeking recognition he was seeking validation when Abel he was just seeking the righteousness of God he just wanted he just wanted God to be glorified and then at the end of the story Jes the Lord says if thou doest if thou doest well Cain if you do well look at how God loved even Cain he wanted Cain to succeed he wanted Cain to be saved he didn't want Cain to make a mistake and he says he said if you if you do well then you then you'll be accepted but if you do not well he said then Cain sin lies at the door for you if you're not serving God if you're not seeking God first if you're seeking these other things of the world if you're not looking for th if you're not looking if you're looking at those and you're not seeking God then sin comes right in your life and causes problems and causes problems in our families it causes problems with us it causes problems with our businesses it causes problems in school it causes problems in church if we're not seeking God first if we're not just being a Christian like the Lord Jesus said that we should be it's that simple and then we worry and God promised he promised he said that I will restore he said that I'll take care of you but seek first that Kingdom the musicians can come and I'll close it's really been on my heart I've talked with brother Jordan about it I've talked with some of the other brothers about it I want to help our kids I want to help our young people I want to help even people that aren't so young that might need help in their careers I want to help them move forward I want to provide the tools that they need to succeed I believe that's that's the Lord I believe the a church isn't just the preacher up there preaching and explaining the word the church is there to help us all we give as I always preach give give give but then we also receive and if you want to do something for me as you've heard brother brandom say do it for my children and I want to do that for us I want to help I want to start helping these young people and and older people too that maybe want a career change I want to start helping them move forward in their lives so I've asked brother Jordan he's gonna he's going to help me out we're gonna start looking for avenues that we can find um financial aid or or or classes that are you that our people can take if they want if they want to move forward word and help them succeed brothers and sisters I want to see every one of you succeed if you're 80 years old or if you're 15 years old I want to see the Lord bless you and I'm not talking about financially I'm talking about in life I want to see you choose the right man or the right woman to marry I want to see this happiness but first we have to seek the kingdom of God we got to be Christians and everything that we do and if you start a new job or if you start a a new fellowship or whatever it is and you do these principles that Jesus set forward then the Lord will bless you he promised he'll provide what you need you might not make us a millionaire but maybe we're not supposed to be maybe we're supposed to struggle because it builds our character it's okay to struggle as as Jesus said he says you have a lot of anxiety today he said don't worry you're going to have it tomorrow it'll be there but seek first the kingdom of God and he'll take care of it brother Josiah when I think about the [Music] Lord when I think about the Lord how he save me how he rais me how he filled me with the whole Holy Ghost how he healed me to the uttermost when I think about the Lord how he picked me up turned me around place my feet on Solid Ground when I think about the Lord oh when I think about the Lord how he Sav me how he raise me how he fill me with the Holy Ghost how he heal me to the uttermost when I think about the Lord how he picked me up turned me around place my feet On Solid Ground it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord you're worthy of all of the glory all of the honor and all of the praise it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord worthy of all the glory all of the honor all praise when I think about the Lord how he Sav me how he raised me how he filled me with the Holy Ghost how he healed me to the uttermost when I think about the Lord how he picked me up and turned me around how he set my feet on Solid Ground it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord you're worthy all of the glory all of the honor all of the praise it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord you're worthy of all of the glory and all of the honor and all of the praise amen amen brothers and sisters [Music] it's the best thing that we can do in life is to be a Christian I was wondering how do I know if if I was that widow woman how do I know that God has commanded me to do something because he didn't come down like he did to Elijah the prophet he didn't come down and talk to him talk to her like that she just was faced with a decision and she made the right decision and I think that there is a pull that's on us and as we pray and as we go through life there's something that's just pulling on us to do something and you know that if it's not God you know that it glorifies yourself but if it is God then it's glorifying him and it's usually the harder thing to do and it usually requires a sacrifice of your time a sacrifice of your prayer prayers he usually requires that like this widow woman then the rest of the story her son died and there was that man of God there and man of God raised up the child to live with his mom she was a blessed lady and I just think she was commanded by God to do something great I want to feel that commandment Lord I want to be in that channel you may not say it to me but you can still command me to do something we were talking the other night about how do I know when I have the Holy Spirit how do I know when it really is dwelling in me and there's a number of different ways that we know one of those ways is that there is just a continually refilling of the Holy Spirit we know the parable of the wise and the the foolish virgin the wise virgin kept that oil in the lamp all the time and it was constantly filling it up but then there is that place that we get to like this Widow woman where we bow down and we say Lord whatever you require that will I do then you know that Holy Spirit is operating right there and that's what we all need to be brothers and sisters Lord whatever you require of me whatever you want me to do I'll do it no matter what it is if you want me to go witness to homeless people if you want me to move to another place if you want me to serve every person here do whatever I can that's the Holy Spirit operating in us if we're completely surrender brother brandom said this he said but you can't become you can't be a Christian until Christ injects him himself by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into you then you're connected with him you're no longer Twain you are one Christ promised to be in us as the father was in Christ I and my father are one you and I are one
