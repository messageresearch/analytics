have been washed [Music] he has forgiven me thank you good evening thank you so much for coming out to service tonight thank you to our musicians for their assistance i'm going to ask you to be seated for just a moment and then of course i'll have you stand up again but i wanted to speak to you for a few moments before we read our topic verses and dive into what i believe the lord has put in my heart to share with you today as most of you know is veterans day now exactly two years ago i also spoke with you on veterans day it was a sunday in 2018 the 100th anniversary of the end of world war one i told you a story then of a british captain named howard rose how he was marching his men to the front the trench warfare in europe at that time machine guns chattering artillery shells exploding men dying of terrible wounds while politicians in berlin and london moved pins on a map i told you how howard rose had his men make a turn at a fork in the road the decision immediately resulted in complaints it wasn't the direct route to their destination which appeared safe and open it was an indirect route and it looked quite dangerous but howard felt something inside of him it was a voice he said telling him to take the dangerous looking path howard was not a christian at the time he didn't understand what was happening but he turned a very short time later the road that would have been marching down at the time and place they would have been on it came under heavy enemy attack they all would have been killed the grumbling stopped howard fell to his knees he promised god that he would seek him and serve him for sparing his life and the lives of his men and so we did paul tells us that we love god because he first loved us howard rose survived the war he became a christian he became a minister he became a mentor to a young pentecostal girl who would become heather's mother tonight i'd like to ask if there's anyone in the congregation that has served or are currently serving in the military to please stand thank you and remain standing those of you who were seated please look around the people standing put their lives physically on the line so we could be here tonight they'd risk their lives to defend the freedoms that we have in this country maybe they saw a battle and perhaps they didn't but as citizens and residents of this country we are in their debt and i want to thank each of you that are standing for your service you can be seated now each of you who are christians please stand to your feet if you're able today we're in a battle we're in warfare in the spiritual realm all of you who are standing please look around please these are your fellow soldiers you need prayer you need to talk to someone you need god with skin on him reach out to one of these who are standing don't depend on the brothers who stand here we're no more special than any of you because we're all in this together three years ago this month i had a very serious heart attack now i know that jordan and martha peterson's little girls lydia and caitlyn prayed for me in my physical distress their prayers made a difference don't discount the prayers of young children their faith is not hampered by doubt jesus told us of such is the kingdom of god not will be is to each of you standing thank you for your service in the service of the lord [Applause] now while we're all standing i'd like us to pray together then we'll read from god's word and then i'll let you sit down again let's just go to the lord father we are so grateful for this opportunity that we can gather together on november the 11th 2020 in tucson arizona lord a time of turmoil in our country lord a time of turmoil in the world a time in many ways it's unprecedented but lord we're in your hands we pray lord that in the service tonight lord that you'd help us to lay aside every sin every weight every burden lord help me lord to just lord just get me out of the way nobody wants to hear from the scoundrel that's standing up here but we've all come to hear from you speak to our hearts meet our needs lord we just commit this services these remaining minutes we're together here this evening into your hands and as you have your perfect will your leadership and your guidance we depend upon it and we thank you in jesus precious name amen now if i can get the right button it works while we're standing i'd like to read from the gospel of matthew chapter 25 verse 34 jesus is speaking here then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world and to some of them he mentions two verses later i was in prison and you came to me i want to read next from acts chapter 16. this is uh paul's second missionary journey as it's known now when they had gone throughout frugia and the region of galatia and were fit and forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia after they will come to micah they assayed to go into bithynia but the spirit suffered them not and they passing by my sia came down to troll us and a vision appeared to paul in the night there stood a man of macedonia and prayed him saying come over into macedonia and help us and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them therefore loosing from troas we came with a straight course to some other k and the next day to neapolis and from fence to philippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia and a colony and we were in that city abiding certain days please be seated this evening's message is titled philippians joy and irony now when we read from acts 16 just now did you have a clear idea of exactly where paul and his company were traveling do the names of the towns and areas bring a picture to your mind or are they just a list of sometimes hard to pronounce names of places that don't really matter much to a person in the 21st century living in tucson arizona i find in reading the bible every word is intentional luke is not just giving us an exciting travelogue of paul's adventures around the mediterranean to fill a page no pun intended god had a purpose in leading paul and his company of believers in the path they took it's no coincidence that they ended up in troas when paul had the vision to come to macedonia just like it was no coincidence that uh brother ed biskell's wife packed a green checkered shirt in his gear before he went on a certain hunting trip the bible records only a few times that paul had a vision and i've not found another instance where paul's vision was of anyone other than the lord or angel but this vision was different it was specific a macedonian man as specific as a green checkered shirt and why philippi where's philippi what's special about philippi why might god have chosen it to be the place for the launch pad extending the reach of the good news into europe on our most recent road trip we spent some time with sarah my brother noel's oldest daughter at her home in jacksonville florida she was relating to us about some issues that her husband was having in atlanta teaching people showing people training people how to install glass sheathing on tall buildings that's not a he'd have a problem training me to do that well sarah has a lot of experience training people in various jobs she said the first thing you need to do if you're training someone is to ask them how do you learn some of us need to be shown others guided some a youtube video a picture some just need to read the directions and do it we all learn differently i i think the same applies to the word we're used to preaching but we sometimes need visuals or even drama or something else to help drive home a point to help us remember perhaps some of you were here the time brother green came back from israel he had us open our bibles to the place where jesus talked about faith being like a mustard seed and while our bibles were open he walked up and down the aisles and sprinkled a few mustard seeds in the open bibles mustard seeds from israel i doubt anyone who is here has forgotten that service so with that as background welcome to wednesday school i'm going to approach tonight's message just a little differently there will be a number of images in the next few slides so we might need to dim some of the lighting ah i remembered where the green button was so this is a map from about a century ago showing the world the world's not really flat it's only the map that's flat now you recognize of course the united states on the left and this red triangle in the center is showing the eastern mediterranean region and this is this area here encompasses all the lambs mentioned in the bible i'm sure most of you know this but i just wanted to show you that to get you into this area this next image is from google earth and it's the portion of the world that we saw in that red triangle now this is based on images taken from space and here we see modern names of these areas like turkey here's lebanon jordan israel greece italy and so forth this is this is the region where events of the bible take place and especially the events of the new testament now i'm going to replace that with a map this map is showing about the same area but this is showing the provinces as they were in the areas in the regions during the time of the roman empire during the time of the new testament um modern day turkey that you remember look it's all sorts of provinces it's uh don't look at it lyle well let me turn it off and back on again maybe you didn't like the laser being turned on that much there it is okay don't move it so fast lyle so no it just went out again okay okay thank you you you can see turkey and the very western part of it is called asia you can see there's there's lots of different uh provinces there by thenia and galatia you can see uh modern-day greece is called acacia in macedonia there's a place up there that's called threaque that corresponds to modern-day bulgaria um one thing that uh that that you should notice here is that region that i called asia when the bible talks about asia it's not talking about japan and korea and china you won't find beijing in the bible right but but that area when they talk about asia that's what they're talking about that part of western turkey sorry about that it's uh still showing two things but great thank you there we go thank you very much my electric personality didn't work it took batteries so we can see asia here we can see cappadocia pontus by phineas alicia there's just all sorts of all sorts of things going on there so that's these roman provinces and so forth now i'm going to go to the next slide here we are now this is showing pretty much the same provinces but it includes an overlay of the probable route of paul's journeys as told in acts the portion that we read is this red line it picks it up about here but it actually started over here antioch taurus's derby leicester they had some issues there timothy joined him somewhere along here iconium antioch and they came through here ultimately bypassing mycea coming to troas and then they took a boat went up here into here and then walked up to philip hi now i'm going to read from acts 16 again but i'd like you to look at the map while i talk about this so you can get a better idea what's going on some context so when you hear about paul's travels you have a better idea of what's really going on now when they had gone throughout phrygia which is here and the region of galatia up here so even though this is showing a red line going straight they probably didn't exactly follow that line they didn't have this map they were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia so so they're they're here and now they're moving into this area and and they want to preach the word that's what's in their heart they want to share that's what's in our heart we want to share the lord says not here not now after they would come to my sia which is up here they say to go into bithynia they decided well okay we'll go around asia and the lord said um no i i don't think so the spirit suffered them not so at this point paul and silas and perhaps timothy they'd walked from here that's about four or five hundred miles and they're doing this on foot there's there's not uber and there's not uh planes and there's not uh somebody with a rickshaw this is a different asia right it's like walking from tucson to los angeles although not through the sonoran desert so passing by my sia they came to troas little little town here on the coast a little port so that's maybe another 100 miles 150 miles they had maybe they needed to buy new sandals and i don't know the uncertainty in the distance is because we don't know the exact route they traveled on verse 11 i'll read therefore losing from troas in other words they're in a boat now we so luke has joined them up until now it was they but luke has joined him in troas came with a straight course to samothrace right here this little island halfway about 80 miles you do that in the daytime the wind's good you go into port at night you don't have gps you don't have lights you don't have red lights and green lights and all that to mark the port and starboard and so forth and the next day after they overnighted they came to neopolis another 80 miles or so and then they walked to philippi about another 20 miles which is the chief city of that part of macedonia in a colony and we're in that city abiding certain days so we see how paul and his company could immediately respond to a vision-based request to come to macedonia because they were on the coast the lord had told them don't go there and now they can go there because the transportation's available the lord's timing is always perfect he always sets things up exactly the way they need to be set up and if we're just obedient and responsive to what he wants us to do it's all there okay so they traveled onto philippi and then they stopped well here's here's a somebody that's a lot better drawing than i am thinks that's what philip i looked like and this is what the ruins of it look like today you can see this amphitheater here in this amphitheater here which will play a part in our story philippi why philippi what's special about philippi philippi played a very important role in the history of the roman empire and especially in the times just prior to jesus birth it's a lot more from town on the map on march 15 44 bc anybody remember that date yeah the ides of march it's about 40 years before jesus was born julius caesar was assassinated in a conspiracy led by two roman senators brutus and cassius julius had become the latin word i don't know but the translation is dictator for life of rome brutus and cassius wanted rome to remain a republic ostensibly representing and responsible to the people well a series of civil wars ensued for about two and a half years in october of 42 bc in a decisive battle near philippi brutus and cassia's forces were defeated by the army of mark anthony and octavian brutus and cassius committed suicide octavian eventually became emperor changed his name to augustus and was ruling the roman empire when jesus was born this happened in philippi so this set the stage for jesus ministry in the later spread of the good news the gospel if you've ever participated in any kind of a play or drama or production you probably know that the stage doesn't set itself and this drama that's going to be played out is so important to all of us that god watched over every detail no matter how minor and spared no expense in setting the stage even to the giving of his own blood back to philippi a coin was struck in philippi to commemorate augustus victory the coin was first minted around 31 bc about the time augustus was declared emperor and the last one was struck 14 a.d about the time jesus was in the temple amazing everybody now i i have one of these coins and i intended to bring it with me but i managed to forget in my haste to get here this evening so i apologize but but this coin was in use in philippi during the episodes and acts that we just read on the screen you can see it a lot better than if i was holding this thing here about the size of a penny right so on the slide you'll see here on the left we have one side of the coin vic for victory oddly enough even though it's latin and it looks like a vg but it's aug is for augustus this is celebrating the victory that augustus's forces had in philippi okay and here we have the goddess victoria holding the wreath the victor's wreath do you see something else here i looked at this coin and and i saw something else but it it it's just me it's nothing to do actually with philippians but a few years ago i shared with you how octavian though not a biological offspring of julius claimed him as his father through adoption does that sound familiar and changed his name from octavian to augustus he claimed julius was a god and proclaimed himself to be the son of a god well what i see here is a woman may maybe a bride rising up standing tall her feet are firmly planted on a rock she's achieved victory through the son of god jesus all in this ancient coin from philippi and here we have paul and silas calling out a bride to jesus christ through faith in his grace and love in the very city where this coin was minted some two thousand years ago and was then in current circulation okay back to the coin on the right side of the screen you can see the words cohort for cohort that's like a a unit in the army about the size of a company when i was in the army 50 years ago a company was yet varied in size around 100 people pray for the praetorian guard the palace guard and phil for philippi this is celebrating that victory and they surround three military standards which represent loyalty courage and strength a kind of a three-in-one the little images on the top of the slides that you have seen and we'll see your photographs i took you the actual coin that i have just to keep this tie in with uh with philippians now i did not obtain that coin when it was new right i'm gray but i'm not that old well philippi itself was a roman colony in macedonia many veterans of that battle were given a plot of land to settle on a good way to reward service and to keep them out of rome in case they decided to side with the other guy the next time there was a political dispute so now with some context about philippi let's get back to acts we read acts 16 um starting at verse 13. on the sabbath we went out of the city philippi by a riverside where prayer was one to be made and we sat down spake unto the women that resorted feather and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyroid tire which worship god heard us i put this little piece of map in here because this region of western turkey was called lydia via tara was a a city in that area it's kind of like moving to l.a and calling yourself arizona and are they israel's not an uncommon name well lydia in whose heart and in lydia's heart the lord opened paul didn't open it silas didn't open it the lord opened it and she attended unto the things that were spoken by paul she he got their attention he got her attention and when she was baptized he really got her attention and her household she besought us saying if you've judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide there and she constrained us she must have been pretty persuasive constrained means to force contrary to nature to compel by entity in other words i'm not taking no for an answer you boys are staying at my place then paul and silas went there spent the night left town haven't seen the vision fulfilled right no wrong they stay and they continue preaching and proclaiming the good news we're familiar with the story there's a demon-possessed slave girl who follows him around for several days we don't know how long that they were in town preaching but she was declaring listen to paul he has the words of salvation she was telling the truth she was witnessing to their witness yeah we know the demons believe they they tremble but knowledge of christ is not salvation by christ our sins must be confessed his gift of life must be accepted and not just reciting a sinner's prayer but a change of heart repentance paul gets exasperated and casts the demon out of the girl this leads to a riot incited by the slave girls owners who just lost their income that they would get from her so we read in acts 16 verse 22 the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes this means that the magistrates had the clothing violently torn off of paul and silas they didn't rip their own clothes they ripped the clothes off of these guys and commanded to beat them and when they'd laid many stripes on them roman flogging was brutal many who were beaten didn't survive this isn't 10 lashes with a wet noodle kind of thing they cast them into prison charging the jailer to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks this is the traditional site of the philippian jail where paul and silas were imprisoned what a miserable state backs bleeding and great pain not even an aspirin to relieve it filthy prison conditions they weren't disinfecting for covet 19. ankles clamped in notched wooden blocks chained probably sitting in the waste from the previous unfortunates who had been fastened in those stalks in a stone chamber no heat if it's cold no cooling if it's hot no cot to lay down no chair to sit on no food no water a stench and the foul stale heir unjustly accused no one to help soothe or comfort what's their reaction at midnight paul and silas prayed and i don't think so is this was just lord bless all your believers around the world amen i don't think it was now i lay me down to sleep no they prayed and they sang praises unto god they didn't just whisper the prisoners heard them now this is the only instance recorded in the book of acts where paul sings he and silas equally miserable and weak both singing praises and hymns to god no musical accompaniment the other prisoners listening maybe they were singing in latin or greek or aramaic or hebrew we don't know we don't know if the others could even understand the words but they were singing loudly enough to be heard by the others and wasn't proclaiming teaching about and worshipping the one true god why they were in such a condition in the first place it's like daniel defying the king's decree what were they thinking and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's bands were loosed and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep maybe he thought they were singing a lullaby i don't know the guy fell asleep seeing the prison doors open he drew out a sword and would have killed himself supposing the prisoners had been fled the fate that he would suffer would be a lot more painful than just a little hairy carry right but paul seeing what the guy was about to do cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm we're all here notice the earthquake paul and silas didn't get up and leave come on guys let's get out of here the miracle wasn't for them it was for the jailer at first the earthquake simply awakens him then he sees the prison and shambles and starts to worry then he sees the prisoners are free he really starts to worry he gets ready to quickly kill himself it's preferable to the punishment he'll otherwise receive but paul stops him remember the angel that stopped abraham from sacrificing isaac paul stops the sky do thyself no harm we're still all here then he called for a light and sleepily sauntering and not now he sprang in he's motivated he came trembling it wasn't only the earth it was shaking that night and fell down before paul and silas on that filthy prison floor and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved what shook the jailer even more than the earthquake he saw the demeanor of these prisoners when they were brought in and now he experiences their concern for him coupled with their worship and singing rejoicing in the midst of adversity integrity instead of taking an easy out this captured him what is this their concern for the safety of the one who put them in the worst part of the prison and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house now we know each person has to come to the lord individually my faith will not save my children but if i have faith the lord can reach them i need to have the same faith for them that i have for myself they still have to repent and accept the gift of life but my faith says they're going to do that we're told what only believe some things no all things are possible and they spake unto him the word of the lord unto all that were in his house and he took them out the next day no the same hour of the night what is it two three four in the morning now washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway they're not wasting any time and when he had brought them into the prison again no no into his house he set food before them and rejoiced believing in god with all his house and when it was day they were having an all-night meeting when it was day the magistrate sent the sergeant saying let those guys go and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the magistrates are sent to let you go now you can go go in peace god bless you shalom so paul and silas grateful for their release walked away that's not what it says but paul said to the sergeants the magistrates have beaten us openly uncondemned no trial never asked us what happened and we're romans silas was a roman too and have cast us into prison and now do they thrust us out secretly ain't going to happen nay verily but let the magistrates come themselves and personally fetch us out paul is no longer the submissive subversive he's refusing to leave the prison the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates and the magistrates feared when they heard that paul and silas were romans does that strike you as strange that's a very odd development we'll get to it in just a moment and the magistrates came and pleaded with them besought them and brought them accompanied escorted them out and asked him please leave right desired them to depart out of our city and what you see here there's felipe where the arrow is in this big long road here of course you have to take a ferry across the water here but this is called the via ignacio it was constructed in the second century bc so the road was about 200 years old uh when paul and then were going on it's 2200 years old now and uh it's not in such terrible shape the the photograph part of it uh is the portion of the road that uh uh hang on just a second yeah there we are this part of it here that's part of the road that paul and silas walked on escorted by the magistrates if you keep going you'll be out of town don't don't stop keep keep going so what happens they went out of the prison and entered into the house of lydia and the king james version when they had seen the brethren now a little clarification here this is lydia's house right the greek word is eldoffos at alphos it's translated as brethren but literally it means from the womb it includes the sisters too you'll find other translations where it says the brothers and the sisters so this this brethren thing here is not a gender specific term um anyway they comforted them paul and silas bleeding hurting wounded wincing but they're comforting their new friends and converts who had undoubtedly been in prayer for them while they were locked up and they departed how strange does it strike you as strange paul and silas could have asserted their status as romans when all this trouble was coming down and they never would have been beaten they never would have to spend the night in prison why didn't they do that why didn't they remember brother branham's story of the green plaid shirt he'd had a vision being on a hunting trip and shooting a caribou with 42 inch horns and then killing a nine foot silver tip grizzly bear in the vision there was a man wearing a green plaid shirt when he saw ed biskull in that shirt he knew the vision was going to be fulfilled after killing the caribou he was walking back to camp with bud sothwick and suddenly a grizzly bear rose up in their path brother branham shot once bear kept charging bud told him shoot it again grizzlies are tough but brother branham said the vision i only shot at once and this bear's charging collapses at their feet well in acts we're told paul saw a man from macedonia in his vision luke's careful to point that out to us in the narrative paul accepted brutal punishment for his testimony rather than declare he was a roman citizen and likely avoid all that why didn't he now this is just my opinion this is brother lyle speculating okay i think he was still waiting to see the man in the vision he was waiting to see that vision fulfilled he was looking for the green checkered shirt if you will when they dragged him into the jailer and the jailer made him fast in the stocks i think paul recognized the jailer as being the macedonian man in the vision that he saw my personal opinion come and help us no wonder they were praying no wonder they were worshiping they knew what was going to happen speculation ended let's get back after leaving the prison they went to lydia's house and comforted them and being escorted by the magistrates may have brought some amount of protection to the reputation of that new congregation then they leave philippi and continue on their journey spreading the good news of the gospel to thessalonica maria athens these events most likely happened around 50 to 52 a.d now luke left out a pretty important detail about the church at lydia's house that day we'll get to that next time god willing anyone recall our opening verse from matthew i was in prison remember i titled this philippians joy and irony irony the dictionary defines irony as the use of words to express something different from an opposite to their literal meaning somebody gives you some food that they know you don't like and you say thanks a lot yeah and it also means incongruity which is a dictionary fancy word for inconsistency between what is expected and what actually is well then where's the inconsistency or the irony here who was in prison being visited the jailer a different meaning to prison ministry how many are willing to perform prison ministry by becoming the prisoner rather than the visitor so you can reach the jailer rather than the jails now i'm not raising my hand either yet some have been in this congregation in that condition been prisoners and reached others while serving time god was able to use them god can use you wherever you are whatever your condition is whatever the circumstances he's not limited by those well that's a lot of background for the letter to the philippians i wanted to give you some context for the letter that paul wrote to them while he was under house arrest in rome about 10 years later now that's house arrest complete with ankle monitor yeah that's right we'll get to that in fact why wait let's do it now paul was sent in chains to rome to await the result of his appeal to caesar after his arrest in jerusalem it's all recorded in the last chapters of acts while in rome he wrote a number of letters which has survived not the originals but copies and have come to us in our new testament one of these letters was to the church at philippi he was in prison in philippi we've just reviewed that and on the occasion of this letter he writes to them from prison in rome seems paul just can't stay away from prison ministry well i'm going to read a little bit from the niv rather than the king james but i'll put the king james on the screen at the same time that i'm reading the niv philippians chapter 1 he says now i want you to know brothers and sisters that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel as a result it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that i am in chains for christ let's skip to acts 28 for just a little more context here when we came to rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but paul was suffered or allowed to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him the photograph here is a relief of the roman palace guard or praetorian guard from about 52 a.d is when this was carved so this was a 3d image that they took in rome about that time now i'm we're told it was customary for a person under arrest and guard to be chained to the guard i further understand that this was about a 12-hour shift for the guard well let's pick up acts a few verses later in fact the very end of acts 28 verse 30. paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house lord willing we'll discuss that next time and received all that came in unto him what was he doing kicking back you know preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbidding him so the guards chained to paul were the equivalent of today's ankle monitor for a prison under house arrest who was the captive of whom that brings new meaning to having a captive audience right and this captive audience of paul's heard the gospel with all confidence no man imagine imagine being chained to the messenger of your age for 12 hours at a time how effective was paul's witness with us while he's with those guards let's get back to philippians philippians 1 and again to top his king james the bottom is the niv and i'll read the niv because of my chains most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear he's talking about in the city of rome so we see that the believers in rome were emboldened by paul's example and we also see as fall closes his letter philippians chapter 4 verse 22 all the saints salute you chiefly or especially they that are of caesar's household those are the palace guards it's clear that at least some of the guards chained to paul received the good news too now we don't have time to go over this letter line by line or verse by verse but its main theme is very clear we should have joy in the midst of suffering regardless of our circumstance who better to understand this than the philippians who witnessed a miracle as paul and silas rejoiced and worshipped in the midst of suffering while imprisoned in philippi a very appropriate message to that particular place in fact i think it's certain that the jailer assuming he was still alive was part of the congregation at philip high when this letter was received why would paul and silas have suffered so to have a reception to the gospel and baptism of the entire family of the jailer whose name we don't know if their faith wasn't genuine paul uses the words rejoice joy or glad 17 times in this letter in the niv 14 times in the king james and this isn't just some superficial why worry be happy paul's facing a death sentence in rome if anyone could testify to the honesty of paul's insistence that the philippians rejoice in the midst of suffering it was the jailer and any of the other prisoners that might still be around if you could ask them that were there that night paul can be joyful in prison it might be more accurate to say that he was able to find joy in spite of being in prison he wasn't necessarily glad about his situation oh boy stocks i just love stocks chain me but in spite of that situation and in this condition he exhorts the philippian believers philippians 4 4 rejoice in the lord from time to time no rejoice in the lord always and again i say i'm going to emphasize it i'm going to repeat it rejoice a very prominent theme throughout the letter to the church at philippi is finding joy in the lord regardless of circumstances being content and living like it another example paul relates how some in rome are preaching the gospel out of good will but others are doing so out of envy and rivalry what's his attitude about that philippians 1 king james says what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretense or in truth christ is preached and therein i do rejoice yea and will rejoice and the nlt it says their motive doesn't matter whether their motives are false or genuine the message about christ is being preached either way so i rejoice and i will continue to be rejoice but what about those guys with the false motives remember jesus talks about that lord lord we preached the gospel we did mighty miracles in your name depart from me ye that work iniquity i never knew you the person that receives the gospel whether it's from a person whose heart is right or not that person still receives the gospel but if your heart's wrong when you're presenting it look out be careful brother lyle again we see paul emphasizing joy in spite of the motives of those who may be simply trying to make his life more miserable or otherwise lessen his influence moving on paul said we should be like-minded and this will bring him even more joy philippians 2 we read if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love of any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels compassion and mercies do you believe they're such do you want to partake and participate paul tells us how fulfill you my joy be like-minded have the mind of christ right having the same love being of one accord of one mind i'm taking a hit for the team i need you the team to stick together but what if the body of believers are not like-minded what if there's discord or strife what do we do then well on the sermon on the mount jesus said blessed are the peacemakers for they should be called the children of god this isn't guys that fly around in airplanes and try and get people to stop fighting wars he's talking paul's jesus is talking about the body of christ peacemakers this is the only occurrence of this word in the entire bible this is a photo of uh some artwork in our home it's an illustration of jerusalem it was given to me by a dear friend who has since passed on named jim reynolds jim was a christian man i met him in the late 1970s and he worked for me at two different companies over the course of about 20 years on yom kippur october 6 1973 israel was attacked by egypt and syria in the aftermath of that war a fragile end of hostilities occurred the united nations sent a team of observers to the golan which forms a border in the north between israel and syria and another team to the sinai in the south between israel and egypt my friend jim worked for the un in the sinai as one of the observers he purchased that art when in jerusalem during that mission and gave it to heather and me many years later jim's mission was not a peacemaker he was a peacekeeper one who tried to keep the factions from attacking each other but not one who tried to get them to settle their differences when the apostle paul wrote this letter there was trouble in philippi and this young church that paul loved so much there was discord it was so bad paul was made aware of it hundreds of miles away presumably by a frauditos the man who transcribed this letter for paul and carried it back to philippi on his behalf philippi wasn't a very friendly place for the gospel remember how paul and silas were treated but even in the light of this external pressure there were divisions among believers infighting if you will pastor matt's told us of hostility he's witnessed between fellow christians over the recent election extreme partisanship is that how we should be acting towards one another and to the world around us let's read philippians 4 begins therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy and crown so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved this is a pretty impassioned plea paul is very serious about what follows it's an example it says i beseech yuariya and i beseech tsuntuke that they be of the same mind in the lord the nlt says now i appeal to yodia and suntuke please because you belong to the lord settle your disagreement and in case they need a little help a peacemaker paul continues i entreat thee also true yoke fellow that's a little strange help those women which labored with me in the gospel with clement also and with my other fellow laborers who are in the book of life nlt maybe helps a little bit i ask you my true partner what's that to help these two women for they worked hard with me telling others the good news the word translated as partner or yoke fellow it suits a ghost well it sounds like a strange word to us but it's a proper name like leonardo or marvin in other words paul is asking loyal suits a ghost to step in and be a peacemaker help settle this problem help settle the dispute these two people are believers let's get past this thing and how does he conclude this appeal he directs their attention to where their energy should be going we read this already rejoice in the lord always again i say rejoice i believe the holy spirit inspired the letters paul wrote and which are preserved for us in the new testament they're therefore a reason greater than the immediate context in this case of the church at philippi it's more than paul saying hello to a few friends as he closes the letter we sometimes have strife divisions in our churches today sometimes even right here if you see that be a peacemaker jesus said you'd be blessed and be called a child of god now paul goes on he doesn't just say stop it he he tells you what to do he he gives detail how to avoid these divisions in the first place some practical advice that we can apply in our day as well and i'll read this in the niv i find it a little bit clearer than the king james that verse 4 again rejoice in the lord always i will say it again rejoice let your gentleness be evident to all be considerate in all you do the lord is near this isn't talking about jesus is coming soon god transcends our limited universe's dimensions and constraints jesus said he'd be with us even in us until the end of the age you can't get more near than that remember the lord's here he's watching he's observing you you can't hide don't be anxious about anything but what in every situation every situation by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your request to god be thankful right well if you do this what's going to be the result paul didn't end there the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in christ jesus that's a promise there's no maybes finally brothers and sisters here's some hands-on advice how to stay focused not let divisions arise whatever's true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever's admirable if anything is excellent or praiseworthy not just things that i may have listed here think about such things right keep your mind on jesus keep your focus where it belongs and and here comes a last bit of advice whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in me put it into practice you do it too follow me as i follow christ is what paul is saying and again he reassures us the god of peace will be with you paul states the same advice in philippians chapter 3 and i'll go back to the king james for it brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as you have us for an example in other words there are people that are doing what i've told them to do they're an example follow that example right keep your eyes on jesus sometimes you need gods with skin on them right philippians contains such a rich set of lessons for our lives i'd like to invite the musicians to please return there are at least at least two more important topics paul addresses in this epistle one is support as in financial support for the apostolic ministry and the other is the nature of suffering and persecution that it's not evidence of rejection by god or weakness of his power but it's a gift now there's not enough time this evening to cover those topics i hope to share them with you some future meeting so please just remember from tonight we should have joy in the lord regardless of our circumstances in spite of our circumstances we need to have unity that takes work we should be peacemakers we can disagree without being disagreeable and we have practical advice how to avoid conflict and how to keep our hearts and minds clean and pure before god as brother aaron comes to close tonight's wendy school service i'd like us to sing i'm so glad i'm a part of the family of god maybe we can start with the chorus on that [Music] i'm so glad i'm a part of the family of god i've been washed in the fountain cleansed by his blood [Music] jointers with jesus as we travel this song for i'm part of the family the family of god you will notice

of the family of god i've been washed in the fountain join us with jesus [Music] just let's foreign for a moment just bow our heads quite either just [Music] just kind of put your in a situation right now maybe something you've gone through recently or and you've wondered you've questioned you didn't see the reason or under or understand the why we've heard today about paul's experience in silas i've always wondered if if silas didn't ask paul how did we end up here paul didn't expect this on the journey maybe you've you've got to a place in your life or a place where you've wondered lord how did why did this turn out this way but i challenge you if you believe god has everything ordained god watches each step he knows what's going on there's a reason for it and i would challenge you to believe and just say i bless your name i bless your name i give you on earth i give you praise you are true i bless your name i bless that first verse [Music] in prisoner's shame [Music] with and silence they pray that night i challenge you here and in their pain [Applause] began to sing amen there changed see if he says the same yesterday today and forever i bless your names i give you grace [Music] i bless your name i'm [Music] [Applause] [Music] if [Music] maybe in asking god why why why this break it right there reach out and praise tell him lord i know you're in charge [Music] i bless your name i bless your names [Music] i give you praise you are [Music] the truth i bless your name there's a way if i could say this you'd have control over a situation or you can be controlled by the situation but god said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and paul gives us a think on these things take the mind and begin to say god your word says god your word says you said i can have peace and joy in the midst of my troubles you said you'll never leave me never forsake me you said you've broken every chain you said and that's what you begin to talk about and think about and then those around you say hey joe how can you be like this with a smile in your face in the midst of this trouble you say because i choose this over that and god's word never fails i think that's a reason why these things were recorded in the scriptures there are examples and we love them for that today remember somebody's looking at you because you're the only jesus some people ever see in the bible some people the only bible some people will read but as christ in you the hope of glory so we appreciate the word of god today amen to remind us that god is mindfulness amen god be with you

prison guard you could love them paul said hey because of all of this they received the gospel also amen god knows how to do it i think about it quite often 14 mile creek the cave specific places that god chose to use when he called out one of the to me one of the great revelations just to tie this bible together jesus christ of the new testament the jehovah god of the old testament the same
