Lord the test testimonies that we hear the different things that have happened in different people's lives are such an encouragement to show off that Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday today and forever it's not lost your strength but Lord You're Just The Great I Am Lord so as we speak your word as we speak the thoughts you've placed and Lord may it just encourage every one of us Lord we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated thank you I I did forget to to read something uh from Brother Dan emmans this morning so it's going to be a little late but please tell the congregation that everything is going well here in Las Cruses the church P put on a Youth Event last night with games food and lots of good Fellowship our kids are having a great time and this is the part please remember me in prayer this this morning so but uh we did he said I will be ministering on the importance of unity in the body I I think brother Ryan covered a little bit of that today too and and I I so they should be on their way home has anybody heard from them at all anybody a text or anything that he said they thought they'd be getting in a little late this evening but Lord bring them safely so there's a a quote a little thing that I heard or I saw written that brother brandham had spoken on some boys not being eaten up by alligators and I'd never heard that before so I looked it up and there is a testimony that brother brandham gives and I'd like them to play this just a couple moments if you could play that uh so we could hear what a mighty God we serve so if if they'll put that up and just play that real quick here I did send them the information so they should be able to find it has anybody ever heard this it was a surprise to me I didn't know he had had said this so I think you'll enjoy it should be paragraphs nine and 10 of that message don't leave me standing too long up here there brother Jordan somewhere back there maybe oh they look for it brother Daniel had ministered on worshiping at the altar of fear Sunday morning afca okay going way out there among those Natives and those tribes out there that hardly are civilized maybe way back in those jungles where those missionaries is fought to win the prize and sail through bloody seas oh how they went in there with nothing and had to almost fight their way in not long ago one was speaking a little Tabernacle home he had a coat and he how God he gave his testimony of how God had marvelously send him over there and used to be I didn't think much about missionary well I thought the Home Folks here and I do love the Home Folks but oh my those poor people were you've got preachers everywhere and they're dying to hear the word and this man said he was telling a story he said God put it upon his heart to go he didn't know how he was going he needed $500 he was in Brooklyn he was preaching in a little mission and some lady Rich lady was going down to deposit uh some money in a bank from her husband's business $500 and she heard him preaching she'd come across the street to listen he never said nothing about the $500 that at the end of the service she walked up she said sir I don't know what's happened to me but said I was taking $500 down to the bank but God tell me to come give it to you there it is when God's moving God will break the way and make it right he wept he said bitterly he said oh God how I thank you how he's able to put it upon the people's hearts if he's sending you he'll make a way for you and there he taken it the money and they worked their way over on a fruit ship and he was going to some Island I forget this where it was weigh down in there there a lot of head hunters and people who had not become civilized yet to Christianity and so forth and they they would very fond of dog meat they' take the dog and beat it they beat in apartment in sit down and need it so they wore bones in their ears and so forth and then he said they had a lot of these big crocodiles and things around in this part of the country where he was said he they couldn't let him off right at the place where he wanted to go and they put him in a boat his wife and he and one he had a quartet and the other one of the boys of the quartet was his own son said they had a great big image of devil sitting out there on a rock they call it the devil rout and said when these people when they started through said there's many of those great crocodile and things along the banks and said they begin to scream out to this devil Rock to turn their boat over said brother brandom I don't know how much you believe this but said our boat begin rocking now look a devil has a power that's right now I believe just as much a personal devil as I know there's a God there's because God said there was and there the boat began to rock and he said my wife got off of the seat back there in the stern and S down raised up her hands and said father dear you sent us over here now help us will you said they come on by The Rock went on to the shore and said when they landed said oh there was a all of the natives was down there and they was making a big screaming beating those Tom Toms and things said after a bit while they heard him screaming again and they were screaming through this rock to turn over these boys that were coming somewhat 100 yards behind them coming in and said brother Brandon their boat turned over a crocodile turned their boat over something out there and there was their boys right out there among those crocodiles and the mother started weeping in the church when they was telling it she said oh I just knew that they just pull those boys apart and said dad and I put our arms around around one another and fell down on the bank and begin cre screaming to God with all of our heart to save our boys and know that God had sent us down there and said these people went into a frantic cutting themselves and everything because their God had overcome their God seemingly they were screaming and jumping around said expecting anytime to field a big uh Stone Hammer maybe to MH through their skull and kill him as it was kneeling there praying so all at once everything got quiet they didn't know what would happened so they listened closely and all thing they could hear them was the waves coming into the shore so directly they begin to hear some singing they looked out and said these boys were lined up and every one of them perfectly in harmony swimming right through those crocodile singing Rock of Ages CL for me let me hide myself and thee I'm telling you brother the same God that could close the lion's mouth and the Dan with Daniel can C close the crocodile's mouth he's the same God today that he was back in those days yes he is then he said when they was converted if they that People Prayed day and night just happy and he was back there taking up money and I gave him all I had try to build a little church down there and so forth they got them started how they prayed and God gave them rain and what all more things to take them faing there oh what a truth it is to go and to work for our Lord in other fields amen amen God can take any situation and turn it around and I wanted to play that because sometimes we wonder God where are you why am I going through this why does it look so difficult why does it look so hard but every power is subject to his power amen and you're one of his you're his redeemed amen you're his you're the reason why he went to Calvary shall you know he watches over you amen so in Proverbs chapter 3 verses 5 and six very very familiar scriptures trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto your thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths and that's nothing but the truth in all thy ways acknowledge Him and you know in in the morning when you get up and it sometimes for some of you it's it's very early in the morning start your day some not as early but whenever it is that you get started and you're you acknowledge Him say Lord I commit my way my day all of this into your hands I Surrender it to you you know and and sometimes you it might you might question you might wonder why I'm in this am I in this situation and God has a purpose in a way and a work to do show and as I was saying brother brother Daniel spoke on worshiping at the the altar of fear and you would say I would never do that but when you give way to your fears that's what you're doing you're giving you're you're lifting it above God Amen and we're all subject to fear yeah um when something bangs you're asleep and something bangs loudly at night and startles you awake I don't think most of us get up oh well I'll just go see what that is in fact it's usually nudging the other the husband or the wife go see see go see yourself you know it it's a it's a startling but as quickly as you can you say okay I'm going to go you get a light you turn on all the lights to where you get to where and you come back in it it's it's part of it's the nature of Fallen man but you know what the angel said to to little Mary Don't Fear do not fear Satan Works through fear amen God works through love and love is a comfort love is a strength Love is Everything is if God is love God is everything anything you need out of God is there so lean not to your own understanding he says and in all things acknowledge Him well brother Aon I'm in in in a situation that I don't feel I can talk to God you can talk to God anywhere any place if you're willing to say Lord I'm sorry I need your help there's nowhere in the scripture says You must come to the altar at the church there as soon as you brother bam says you can get brother green just say as soon as you can get a hold of yourself turn around and acknowledge Him leaning not to your own understanding our understanding is limited our vision is limited you know but if we look to what God's word says there is there's a promise there as I was looking at this and as I was talking to brother Daniel after last last uh Sunday morning I had a couple of thoughts in my heart and he had asked me about ministering and sometimes you're do I go this way do I go this way and you don't want to get behind the pulpit and preach exact opposite of what the brother before you preach and seem to be you know and and you would want it to follow in continuity so I telling a little bit to brother Dan about what I was thinking about and he goes here and he hands me a a page and on there are two quotes he hadn't read yet he didn't get to Sunday morning and I looked at him I said well I got them for Sunday next Sunday night and and in in the first quote a personal experience with God I gave it to the brothers we'll read it a personal experience with God not your neighbor 's experience not your father's experience not the pastor's experience but your experience with God so if you can get that first one up there they can follow along from the message a personal experience with God preached in 54 he says just a minute sir and these were the quotes of brother Daniel had okay like I have him here just a minute sir an evil spirit went from the man and I seen it rise somewhere else just he says oh kind heavenly father who knows all things and then he says he it's it's your faith has saved you lady you have been nervously broken down and you have been told a lie by Satan Satan has told you that you have committed the unpardonable sin and you cannot be forgiven your sins are forgiven you sister Jesus Christ makes you whole stand up on your feet and accept that now as God's blessings raise up your hands and stand up and give him praise was there something wrong with this man there Satan thought he would get by with that but he couldn't do it you're both delivered God bless you go on your road rejoicing there's an angel of the Lord standing around them both God be praised and blessed a prophet could see this it's it's got a special place for those those things but it was for that man and for that lady it wasn't for brother brandom you understand and then in question and answers 62 this is a question I have lived I have lived many years in sin until I found the Lord please brother brandom I have sinned again and I am not worthy to come to you in this holy place please tell me if I can be restored whole again yes you have not sinned my friend so far in God but what you could be restored if you had sinned so far that you could not be restored you would never want to be restored see he said but as long as there's something dealing with your heart you're still in line of restoration guilty of the least is guilty of the whole I have now here's brother Brown saying I have sinned many times every day every one of us do things we don't don't want to do that's true if you'll be honest that's true it's in it's it's in our heart you don't want to be that way you wouldn't ask a question see that itself a proof that God is still dealing with you you've probably gotten nervous probably Satan telling you that you can't be restored he's lying certainly he is because look if there's a deep deep calling there's got to be a deep deep to respond to the call if there's a hunger for it and I'm glad when something in my heart says I I I need forgiveness I need help I need changing I need cleansing there's still there something there for you to reach out to and you know there's some days that I could leap over a wall and run through a troop and there are some days that I'm hiding in the corner with fear if we'll be honest there are days like that saying Lord where are you Gideon said if God be for us then where are the Miracles you know what he was he was hiding he he he was he was threshing the wheat hiding because the enemy had kept coming stealing it but he called out to God he said where are you and then Abraham and his seed after him says do you see it don't look at yourself look at your sacrifice God don't look at you he looks at your sacrifice which is Christ don't look at yourself I'm not worthy you're not worthy nobody's worthy but he is the one I'm not counting on what I've done or what I am I'd never make it but looking to what he's done that's where I'm trusting what he's done He's My Sacrifice I'm not worthy of healing no no sir Lord I ought to have died long ago ought to have never been born but I live I got eternal life I'm going to to Heaven why because he done it for me he was the one he took my place then he said I was knock needed cross-eyed in every kind of condition but he took my place spiritually speaking I was all twisted up and all messed up but he took my place so he makes me a perfect Son of God a perfect daughter of God the word perfect there is whole complete missing nothing we take the word perfect and we look at ourselves and we try to say make no mistakes no have no run thoughts no fail that's not what he's talking about you have everything in you to make it home you are complete says a perfect daughter of God his sacrifice did it not mine I had nothing to do with it if we had something to do with it we'd make a mess out of it this one here we maybe we'll we read it at the end here now as I was I was looking into some of some of these some scriptures and things and some of the examples in the scripture and the scripture are written are for our example that's why the detailed life of many is given that's why you go to the Old Testament you see their failures and their victories because if the Bible was only written in about everybody's Victory we'd have a hard time with it because we try to measure up exactly to that but because God shows both sides you could say hey I have hope I have a promise look at Paul look at Peter look at what they did but look where they ended up at and I have a hope he says now sometimes in the message hope is not a um not using your name sister hope the word hope is sometimes people say well hope is is not Faith have you ever written and looked into what Biblical hope is when the Bible is being using the word hope it is used quite a few times in the Bible the The Hope description in the biblical hope is The Confident expectation that God will fulfill his promises to us it's not I hope so I'm barely oh God I hope so it's I know therefore I am resting my Hope on your promises and what you are able more than able to do it is based on what God has done for us in the past and what he will do in the future that same God that delivered me here will deliver me there that same God that healed me here will he heal me here it doesn't change it said it's also it's not a passive thing or a static thing but it's Dynamic active directive and life sustaining Force that's biblical hope hope is a sense and it's that Faith sense of trust in Jesus and his saving work so when you get to look in in in in the scripture sometimes you find that and this lamentation the Prophet Jeremiah Lamentations 3: 18- 26 I just I I I pulled up the word hope in the Bible how many times it comes up and it comes up quite often and I said my strength and my hope is perished from the Lord My Hope and my strength is perished from the Lord I think Jeremiah began to to look at his situation how he was feeling and he said oh I have no strength he's not saying that God didn't have it he just couldn't see it he says remembering mine Affliction and mine Misery the wormwood and the gall he says my soul has them still in remembrance and is humbled in me here's Jeremiah saying all this is just governing me it's it it's all just just suffocating me it just seems to be taking me over but then he said then I recall to my mind this I recall to my mind therefore have I hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because of his compassion because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness now I know every one of you I can honestly and I can say with an assurance woke up this morning you're all here so this morning you had new mercies waiting for you that's what that's what he says it it's new mercies they they are new every morning it they're renewed they're refreshed Great Is Thy Faithfulness the Lord is my portion sayith my soul therefore I will have I will hope in him I will have my expectation it is in him the Lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord and you look at that word quietly it's what we tell our grandchildren sh go play quietly over there please wake no what are you doing when you're quiet you're not stirred up in yourself you're resting you're not you know bringing agitating everything I will quietly I will be at rest I will be at peace while God is doing this work I will praise him I will give him honor I will give him glory quietly doesn't mean you can't praise him it's say you're at rest about it this is what Jeremiah says it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord because God has promised that and you know sometimes you have to do this and then I recall to my mind therefore have I hope sometimes I just have to remember you remember brother Brandon would say that I had to remind myself what God had done for me and Satan would begin to talk to him and begin to want to to to bring him down and he would say then he'd say ah but who healed that one ah but who did that one who took care of that situation who and he said I would begin to encourage myself I would begin to strengthen myself I've I've shared this with you and um when I was in that that one house working and they had this music on and that music got stuck in my head the words and all and I just couldn't break it mostly one time you walk out of the house and I'm going to work at another house the music has turned off I don't hear it anymore it just was oh it felt like something was poking me and I said God can you help me with this and that song think about his love think about his goodness just started coming right through me I said he was singing it to me that's how I felt it was and you know what every time this has happened again I've just gone right back to that song and encouraged myself and you know what that does it just makes the rest of it go away I'm not turning that music on I walked into a situation with that but greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world that's his promise so he says this I recall to my mind you know it is both good it should both hope and quietly wait quietly again mean meaning not in in frustration all but being at rest Lord you said Lord you will you and and it's it's amazing how many things if you'll go back into the scriptures there were so many different ways to see how people had to do that great prophets you can look at it in the thing uh um Elijah Lord I'm the last one there's nobody else serving you but me and God I like this God said there's 7,000 that have not bowed their knees he didn't said I know I have a bunch he knew exactly how many there were he was very he's got you name he's got you numbered he knows who you are where you are he can call you by name so this hope and you know you look and and I I just wrote down a few of these maybe would encourage you let's see where I put it but you think of about Peter you think about some of these men that that had a uh you know their their their their stories are written in the Bible for our example Peter who uh who struggled a man who said I will not forsake thee I'll never leave you I'll never depart in fact I'll I'll go hang on the cross with you let's start with some of the disciples here and I just I'm not going to quote the actual script scriptures I'm just going to tape or some of them and just say what what he did and and look at this and Jesus here in the scripture says and when he entered into a ship his disciples followed him and behold there arose a great Tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with the ways but he was asleep now if your savior is asleep in the boat with you the captain of the ship is asleep in the boat and resting peacefully I would think that would say everything is okay if the captain of the ship the pilot of the ship is nervous and anxious and fretting then I would say the whole crew is going to be the same way but if Jesus is resting is your ship and you're crossing the sea I think you can be at rest too he says and the disciples came to him and awoke him and saying Lord save us we perish and he said of the unto them why are you so fearful oh ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the Sea and there was a great calm but the men Marvel saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the Sea obey him well he's still the same there were some boys that got dumped into the water with crocodiles and he said don't touch them they're doing my work here now we just read those scriptures there Peter says to the Lord and I'm I'm taking just different portions here then Peter said Lo we have left all and followed thee we know Peter didn't have any trouble speaking out he said and then in different parts again he said and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am Peter answered said Thou Art the Christ of God and that's when Jesus chur blessed art thou Simon barjona because my father has revealed this to you this is not not something you learn earned or worked for but God has made it real to you so that made Peter superhuman he was almost oh God you know but no watch then not too long down from there Peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet I will I never be offended you've read the scriptures and then you know Jesus is being crucified and there's some Maiden that comes and identifies and points out at Peter he said you're one of them and about the space of one hour after another company affirm saying of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is a Galilean and Peter said man I know not what thou sayest the same Peter that said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and immediately while he yet spake the crew and the Lord turned and looked upon Peter and Peter remembered the words of the Lord and how he said unto him before the cockro Thou shalt deny me the r and Peter went out and wept bitterly I have failed I'm no good I'm useless I don't have a chance and there was Resurrection morning right after that and if it wasn't for the resurrection where would we be today but on Resurrection morning he tells his disciples or the the ones that were there he says but but go your way tell his disciples and Peter specifically said and Peter the one who had just Den denied him call him tell him that he goeth before you into Galilee there ye shall see him as he said unto you I don't know who I'm talking to today maybe somebody listening on somebody watching maybe somebody here that in your life you wondered have I denied him have I turned my back on him does he still care for me remember Peter literally said he cursed he said I don't know that man turned his back on him and then he tells him tell his disciples and Peter to meet me I'm going to meet them here's Daniel and the three Hebrew boys Nebuchadnezzar spake unto them and said Is it true oh Shadrach Meshach and Abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up and they answered if it be so our God whom we serve is is able to Deliver Us From The Burning Fire furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto thee Oh King what we will what that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up he tried to hit him with fear make him afraid and then after they're thrown into the the furnace and Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished and Rose up in the haste and spake unto the his counselors did not we cast three men Bound in the midst of the fire they answered and said to the king true oh King oh and I like this answer that answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is is like the Son of God they said we won't deny you and even if he won't come and rescue me I'm still not going to deny him he didn't deny you when you failed he didn't deny you when you were living in sin he didn't deny you when he said come on unto me and I'll give you rest you could go through the scriptures and find every example Paul who had those put to death for the way they were serving God and you know what Paul had to live with himself after that oh miserable man that I am who shall deliver me I find myself wanting to do this but doing this instead with my you know he struggling through this why imagine yourself struggling with that that you had your neighbor put to death because they didn't believe the way you believed you had your fellow countrymen put to death because they were believing different than the law of Moses and yet this same God that they were serving has now called you to be his Prophet this same God now has called you to be a living testimony of a living God amongst those who at maybe at one time you served Satan with or you drew back on but today he calls you and said you're my light he has confidence in you in Romans chapter 5 verses 1-5 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ peace is the absence of War which is the absence of fear right now there's so much going on all over the world every day if you look at the news something else is happening happening battles Wars There Are People Dying there are people suffering but he tells us don't be afraid don't have fear and if you pay too much attention to the news and if you look at every channel of the news you'll get a different uh interpretation or version of the news this one will blame it on that one and that one will blame it I know which one is to blame there is only one that is to blame and that's Satan and there is only one to get honor and glory and that's Christ that's God he says by whom we also have access by faith into the grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and again if you think of that word hope with an anticipation wi with a draw with a pull towards and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience Lord I want patience and would you please give it to me right now because I need to be patient right about now no patience has come through tempting and trying and working they that weigh upon the Lord shall renew their strength and and patience experience how do you gain experience by reading a book by watching somebody else um brother no you're laying on the table and you need heart surgery and you hear the doctors talking and you hear one say to the other have you done this before he said no but I read the book no but I watch another doctor do it no you want to hear oh I've done hundreds of these this is not the first one when you're talking to God you're talking the one that lived this life already the one who knows every ins and out about it with patience experience he tabernacled himself in a body of Flesh so he could understand your feelings be touched by the feeling of our infirmities an experience worketh a hope an expectation he says and hope this expectation this desire maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us it make us not ashamed nothing you have to be embarrassed about nothing that you would say well I tried it but it didn't work I don't know you can you can say he is faithful he never fails he never misses he's right on time Romans chapter 15 verse 13 and now the god of hope this God that will meet your expectations your desire your earnest desire may this God fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope that you may abound that this will be the drive within you I know he can I know he will he's faithful he's proven himself over and over through the power of the Holy Ghost and I'm glad that Paul put that in there because it's not based on my ability to Hope but through the power of the Holy Ghost and that's Christ in you the hope of glory the expectation the desire the draw is Christ in you remember there is no fear in perfect love God is love greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world there is no fear fear is the absence of love you know it it's it's it's interesting interesting child and I I was watching lurel a little bit with the with her her sisters and stuff she's not afraid that they're going to drop her that they're they haven't done anything to do that to make her fear that now when they get a little bit older and they realize that Mom and Daddy are human and we do make mistakes sometimes they you know they might say well well we heard this a few times daddy said yes and mama said yes and they said they would but they never did we had intentions to do it and maybe it didn't happen but I know one who has never failed and never will there is no fear in perfect love God is love greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world in every situation and everything you face and every decision you have to make when the phone goes off in the middle of the night or you're you're somebody sends you a text please pray for me I'm in a desperate situation you can get on your knees and you can call out to God for that person those who they are with a confidence that God hears and you know you may never get an answer back from that one that ask you to pray but you may get an answer this thing Sarah was at at dialysis yesterday right yeah it was yesterday and she sent out a text she said my body is itching all over the place and it just it's so bad pray I bowed my head and prayed right there not I will but I did and a text come back she said they're going to give me they gave me some medication and it's helping it didn't say God take the heal what God provided away it's that simple God provided a way uh Ephesians chapter 3 20 and 21 now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us it's in you it's Christ in you the hope of glory and when you have Christ you have every one of his attributes everything that he supplies he he walked he was born in flesh he grew up in the flesh so that he could understand the feeling of your infirmities the hurts the weaknesses the troubles the hard times the thoughts Satan as we even heard this this morning Satan came and tempted him he stopped and said but the word of God says but the word of God says but the word of God says it'll work for you too but God said God said God said he said to that woman where they caught her in adultery and he said to her where are thy condemners those that accuse you there are none when she looked around and he goes neither then do I accuse you he just said go and sin no more go and disbelieve no more and if you do make a mistake just say I'm sorry forgive me it it it's one of the easiest things if that that's the wrong way to say it if we'll do it it's one of the quickest ways to get peace and Harmony again just just make something right to say I'm sorry don't blame don't make an excuse to why you're sorry just say I'm sorry forgive me he says now unto him that is able to do abundantly above all exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us again Christ in us the hope of glory now to him who is able to in full measure more than all our desires or thoughts through the power which is working in US sometimes I'll go to one of the other translations just to see how that is word sometimes I'll word it away in in in in the Bible and you go back and look at it and it just it'll just make it a little easier to understand he's able to do in full measure more than all our desires or thoughts through the power which is working in us it's not something that I have to get down and pray and say oh Lord send me the power send me it's in you already take that what you have and use it now here's something it it's that power and and in the most beautiful uh graduation or or how it increases when he has given us exceeding yay Abundant Blessings still we may ask for more and he is able to do it but we may think of more than we have asked how many have done that we think of more than what we'll actually ask God I know you're able you can heal you can lift up you can there it's unmeasurable what God can do brother Jordan the other day speaking about this the the sand on the sea and the stars and the comparison and all he's a God that created all that he knows the number of hairs on your head it was Sister Janna stro Corp and brother Al Peterson and we got a little bit of laugh of this and brother Al was saying about I think she was cutting his hair some and brother Al said something about him knowing the numbers of of hairs on my head and sister Jan said Dad I think there's so few left you could probably name them now got a little bit left but you know even the ones you've lost he knew those and when we get to the other side brother Braham says something between 19 and 21 years old a full head of hair not needing a haircut once a month and all those other things that go with life today but he says more but we may think of more than we have asked he knows our thoughts he is able to do this also yay and above all this above all we ask above all we can think exceedingly abundantly above all that we can either ask or think you'll never delete you'll never exhaust he is more than able and then Paul says unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End amen amen it is finished thus sayeth the Lord to think of this this almighty God that would come and say I love them Father I will not lose a single one of them they're number they're listed on the palm of my hands and not a single one of them will be lost sometimes we get a little disappointed we get a little bit frustrated we get a little bit impatient because we want it now I've got to have it now I need it right now God knows your situation he knows what's best for you and sometimes when you give a child everything when they that they want when they want it you create a spoiled child the the child that will embarrass you at the store the child that will will will uh oh I don't know how to say this nicely you wish you left him at home maybe that's about the best way to say that hadn't taken him with you I'll tell this this little story my my wife's youngest brother Jonathan um he did this on purpose mama would have him at the store and he would want something and she would say no so she he would throw himself on the floor and start thrashing and and then she would come and then he would say don't beat me like you beat me at home mom don't beat in front of the whole crowd children can can get even with their parents quite quickly I'm glad God doesn't treat us that way but you know sometimes he'll let you go do what you think you want to do he gave that that story of the prodigal son who said father I'm of the age now I want my inheritance I'm capable I'm mature I can go do this and I can take well care of it but we know what happened we know where he ended up we know the sad situation he got into and it was a bad situation and and the Bible doesn't say anything about uh where he lived but I suppose it was in a neighborhood his father house was up here and one day the young man comes to himself gets a hold of himself and he's in such a low estate he said the servants at my father's house live better than I do and I'm a son of the king but I'll humble myself I'll go back to my father and tell him I'm not worthy to be your son I'll just be one of your servants the Bible didn't say that he got new clothes and dress himself up and washes himself up to go meet the father it said he just got a hold of himself and he meant began to make the Journey Back to dad's house and my thought has always been this the neighbor saw him walk out take off on his journey proud dressed nice got a picture of him you know with the stick and all the money in the bag I didn't know how it really was but just that's the picture I have I'm going to go have a great time in life I'm going to go do the things I want to do but that same boy coming back up had a whole different look looked Haggard he was his his clothes was bad he hadn't hadn't bathed he was hungry and I think the neighbors might have been looking out and said who's that coming up the street and they're all kind of looking at and I don't know what his dad's name we're going to call him Bob It's usually the name I use when I don't know anybody's name and uh isn't that Bob's son sure looks like him look at the mess he's made remember remember how he went down the street remember what he looked like then proud had all the riches dressed so nice looked like he was going to conquer the world here he comes torn up broken shredded probably didn't smell very good maybe like we see some of the homeless people and now you know the way they are today but in his heart he said I'm going to make it back to my father's house and I'm going to tell him I've sinned against him I'm going to humble myself and I'm going to say I'll just be your servant I'll have a good place to sleep at least some nice clothes I can take a bath every day and I'll have something good to eat that's enough but it says the father was looking down looking for him looking for his return maybe there were reports that came back do you know what your son is doing down here do you know what it tore the father's heart apart that's my son he don't have to be living like that the same one that looked down at the fiery furnace says I'll go the same one that knew that we would need to be redeemed he says I will inhabit a body of Flesh so I can bear their sin that same father is looking down and he sees you and he sees that you have need of him he sees your failures he sees your mistakes and the boy comes up and it says father went out to meet him went out to meet him again in my mind I hear the neighbors talking about it look at that look at him he don't deserve that he's he's made a mess if that was my son I wouldn't even let him in but the father was looking for his son there was a part of him that was missing and he wanted him back and when the father comes and his son meet he said dad I have sinned against thee I I I've I I've I've shamed your name I I've done done this that and the other I'm not worthy to be your son again but I'll be one of your slaves I'll be one of your servants and I'll just said nonsense my son you don't even know what you're saying you're still my son nothing you have done has made me you not be my son he said you're still my son you're not one of the hired servants you're heir to all that your father has and he says come and he tells the servants to clean him wash him get his clothes ready because my son which was lost which was dead is alive he's been found that's the God we serve I I don't know I just feel that someone that might be listening is in this stage right now how can I get back to him Come As You Are you can't make yourself holy enough to approach him on your own you can't make yourself good enough to get to God but if you'll come as you are and humble your heart before him and say have mercy on me he will accept you you're part of him and Paul finishes unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without and amen you're not going to get too low where he can't rescue you I I liked what brother Ryan said when he there at the end when he described the the Kings I had never looked at that never even noticed that lot his nephew he called him my brother we part of the same family of God you're my brother you're my sister I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God not a distant relative of my brother and my sister join heirs and he said these Kings of fear of Torment of problems of habits of whatever it is Abraham said I'm going to go to deliver him I'm going to bring him back for a lot the other one he says let's go you know these are the Kings this is what is this is what's got into into my my my brother my sister but there's Deliverance for it I I was thinking and reading in in a message and brother Bram gets into a description because they asked him a question and he said where are those spirits that were cast out of the swine that were cast out of I'm sorry of Legion and they went into the swine he said they're still here he said if you remember they asked asked God not to send them back he said today those Spirits are still here and he says they get in through sickness they get in through fear they get in begin they're just there to destroy but you know he set Legion free Legion was not the man's name legion was those Devils that was in him you know he might have been named Robert or Bob or Jeff whoever it was but he called him Legion because he was addressing what the problem was and in Deliverance he said he set them free and God will set you free from anything that's binding you the hardest the biggest battle where brother brandom says this is a religious spirit a spirit that says I'm good enough I don't need help I do this I read my Bible I pray I pay my tithe I go to church therefore I'm good enough Mercy rewrote my life it is the grace of God in my life that I am where I am today if we're not careful sometimes we can go to the other side I'm good enough no every day I I want to be humble before the Lord and say make me more like you for musicians would come from the last quote broken sisters watch this I've heard some of these testimonies from folks that got to know brother Brandon personally believe I gave you the the quote broken sisters I read this and and and and I just I read through and sometimes you read some of the things that brother baham says that he it's kind of hard to kind of to believe it in a sense see that he could do that greater is he that is in me he says I'm looking now at a man sitting in the back of the room here I remember telling him that on an old barn stall One Day by a manger and he said but I'm no good I said I know you're not and I said I'm not either but I said you're looking at what you are and quit looking at what you are and look at what he is he said if I could just get rid of these cigarettes brother brandom I would be a Christian I said don't get rid of them you're trying to get good and then come to him he never came to save good men he come to save bad men that know they were bad he said well I listen you don't want to go to hell do you he said no well you don't have to he died that you might not have to go what do I have to do I said nothing it's just that simple and then he said but if I can ever he said there you go back to that cigarette again quit thinking about that cigarette just remember think about him what he did what he is not what you are you're no good and you never was and never will be but what he is he's the one and I said now the only thing you have to do if he took your place down there just willingly accept what he did only thing you have to do is just accept it why he said it's it's that simple I'll do it I said here's a creek see I brought him up there and baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ some of his people are sitting here and I know that they felt funny at me for doing that but I know what I was doing I seen in the man something that was genuine I could see it there and I took him and baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and when he did that it wasn't long that after till I was went down to his son's house we had a a vision of a tree being broken a certain place and the man fell almost broke him his back took him in the hospital and that night the Lord revealed to me that was the end of the cigarette so on the next day he wanted some cigarettes I said and I said I'll buy him a carton and take it to him you just watch and see his cigarette days are done he's never smoked one since and never wanted one since brother brandom says you're struggling to become good enough to receive God just as I am just as I Am Lord take me Lord receive me just as I am let's bow our heads Lord you we could look through the scriptures and see how you took men that we would say were not worthy to be to be helped by you or received by you but you weren't looking at their re their were worthiness you were looking at what what you were going to do with them as you walked along the shore and you saw them fishermen and he says come follow me I will make you Fishers of Men a man that was self-righteous in his actions and he was going had gotten letters and the authorization to go have these new Christians put to death or imprisoned but you knew he was one of yours and you knew what a great place or what a great position Paul would have in Christianity you had mercy on him there's so many Lord we could look through the scriptures we could even look in our lives how good you've been to us how merciful you've been to us Lord and it's not us trying to do good deeds to make you accept us lord it's us accepting what you've done for us and letting it live in US letting it apply to us lives Lord It's the spirit of Christ in us that is the hope of glory Lord thank you Lord for your mercy to us for greater is the one living in us than he that is in the world Amen let's stand oh greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me
