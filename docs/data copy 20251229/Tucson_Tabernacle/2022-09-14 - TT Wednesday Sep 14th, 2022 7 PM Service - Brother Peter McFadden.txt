message brother branham preached god's provided way to do things in one of those services and he talked about how each one of us or each each one in the scriptures that would daniel and the lion's den

gone for a few days and i just want to share one little kind of funny thing that happened and but we enjoyed ourselves and we stopped in yellowstone and stopped at the the place there and i i bought a coffee mug just to remember we were in yellow yellowstone and i mentioned to the uh the lady there the cash register that in august of that year uh 50 years earlier we had been there when i was 12. and she looked at me she goes that's amazing because you were here at our 100th anniversary and now you're here at our 150th anniversary and my first thought was man i'm old that's what hit me not planned but we enjoyed ourselves had a good time drove a lot of miles all over the country but it was nice and [Music] what little uh internet we had we were able to make some contact but a lot of times nothing and we had a wonderful time up there now my daughter rachel was supposed to fly home on sunday and i said if you'd like to go with us you could stay with us me and mom would really enjoy that so her boss let her have the time off too and she got to drive quite a bit and it was uh i guess on uh that would have been saturday we were coming down through southern utah heading into northern arizona and we saw a road sign that said no cars oh no vehicles over 30 feet you're going on one of the most dangerous roads and it's partly graveled and we're thinking should we turn around now but we went we go out there and it's 1200 foot drop like this straight down the side of a it was amazing she took the first curve and she said you take over and when she got to the bottom she said i wish i would have done it but to look back but you know the beauty of the variation of god's work as as we went we took all the back roads and things and just just enjoyed ourselves to see the beauty of god oh what a day that will be on the other side amen what a wonderful thing and uh so i told brother peter brother peter will be ministering this this evening i said i was gonna make some announcements at the beginning and then we would um we just go into some time of worship but um brother um marvin warner when he was here the last time some folks requested about how they could contribute to the missionary work and he sent me the information and how to do it i'm going to ask sister rachel peterson if we could just keep it in the office and if somebody needs a copy on how to do that and he's planning some trips and things and so we'll do that and also um this sunday lord willing myself and brother lyle ministering and brother noel johnson will be coming in and next wednesday he'll be with us the following week and it'll be brother uh reggie platt and his family and then the following wednesday we still haven't set that up uh just to see who's going to be in town but the following sunday the first week end of october brother matthew watkins and sister rachel are going to be in town sister rachel's going to be here helping her mom so he's made himself available also to minister so that's just looking over the next few weeks so but i know one that said i'll be with you i'll never leave you i'll never turn my back on you and that's one that we love and serve so just looking forward also brother ted but sadly the last weekend of this of this month is having their annual services and he sent me a note saying you're all welcome to go up to there in the prescott area for their uh their anniversary services so i have the information and we'll get that posted also amen you asked me why i'm happy and i'll just tell you why one more thing that i did forget and just remember us in prayer um myself and my son-in-law stephen my boss gave his notice i've been working with him for 15 years now and his last two weeks and he's retiring he asked me to retire with him he said let's do this together and i said well if you'll pay for my retirement sure and then dan and brother jerry mcfadden work with dan he walked in today and he's our other service tech and he said tomorrow's my last day i'm retiring also and then the girl that is our csr who we just brought her on a couple months ago is doing very well she told us friday's her last day so i told stephen i'm just tempted to tell you see you later but no so things are hard right now and in all the industries we know that but um i talked with my boss and i said i don't know i do not want any more responsibility i'll continue doing what i'm doing but i don't want to assume all these responsibilities says i won't give them to you you'd just be the service tech and i said thank you that would be appreciated so just remember us and i know it's everywhere just things things are tough in the end work but again i know a god who watches over us you ask me why i'm happy so i'll just tell you what be calm my sins are gone [Music] when i meet the scoffers who ask me when i say my sins are gone they're underneath the blood on the cross of calvary as far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of god's forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise god my sins are calm it was at the old time where god came in my heart and now my sins are gone oh the lord took full possession the devil did depart i'm glad my sins are gone there underneath the head on the cross of calvary as far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of god's forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise god my sins are when gone comes to tempt me he tries to make me down i say my sins are gone you got me into trouble but jesus got me out i'm glad my sins are gone there underneath the blood on the cross of calvary as far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of god's forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise god my sins are gone i'm living now for jesus i'm happy night and day be calm my sins are gone my soul is filled with music all my heart i say i know my sins are gone [Music] the blood on the cross of calvary as far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of god forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise god let's clap while they just play that song [Applause] [Music] praise god my sins are gone praise god my sins are gone one more time praise god my sins are gone amen you know he said it is finished amen that's just something that's been in my heart for the last few days you can tell my wife and i shared some with her he said it is finished it was finished i was asleep and i generally wake up about four o'clock in the morning and i did i woke up because i'd been dreaming and it was a combination of the dreaming of being at work and then being at church and at work they were asking me some questions and i just said well i've been doing this for 40 years now i know what i'm doing just let me do my job but then it switched to being in church and we're sitting there now sitting probably maybe kind of where sister holly is but a couple rows back and the lord just he spoke to me right there and he said it's finished it's done and i just remember just jumping and shouting on that seat there and that's when i woke up and i said thank you lord it's finished i just have to take you at your word you said everything was done so and now i'm living on the hallelujah side amen i get the words to that because once a center far from i believe the first verse hallelujah sidon oh glory hallelujah my savior's praise is foreign [Music] once a sinner far from jesus i was perishing but the blessed savior heard me when i cried and he threw his robe around me and he led me to his fault and i'm living on the hallelujah side oh glory be to jesus

those be more than just words but father would you have your way in each heart lord and these words that are spoken lord let them not be my thoughts but let them be your pure words lord our desire lord is more of you to walk closer to you and to love you more father to sit at your feet and learn of you so lord come and have your way and bless this word as as you open it to us lord only you can guard my mouth from speaking anything that's not of you and just anoint my lips and the ears of the here is that we could have a wonderful time in your presence father in jesus name amen amen while you're standing let's go to genesis chapter four and we'll go to the fourth verse we'll go to genesis chapter four and verse four just uh a prayer request for for this friday um friday at 6 30 we're planning to have another youth meeting if lord wills and so we just want his way in that and not anything else so if you would pray with me for that i really appreciate that okay genesis chapter 4 and verse 4. it says and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock then of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering and then let's go to luke 6 and 38. it says in verse 38 luke chapter 6 jesus speaking a simple commandment one word he says uh let's let's get that up uh luke luke 6 38 if we could it says give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give unto your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again amen you may be seated i want to speak for a little bit of time tonight on giving on gifts and giving and i want to speak on giving all that you have and we've all received gifts we know that it's it's a really nice thing a lot of times to receive a gift and probably most of us have given a gift and we know the joy of giving a gift can be even greater than receiving a gift especially if you're giving the gift to somebody that you love and especially if they love you too then then that's like that's the top of the top that's really good gift giving and we look back through history and we see that gift giving is one of the attributes of god and we see that he's the first giver of gifts he's the giver of life the giver of breath he's the giver of the first gift that i could think of to a living man was a woman eve and what a gift well that's a and so those of us that have received a similar gift or blessed but we see that god is showing something about himself everything that he does is good god is good and everything that he does is good and as he displays his in his actions he's displaying his attributes he's giving us an example that as he walks we can walk just like the uh the father walking through the snow and he's making footprints and then the boy comes along and he tries to walk in those same footprints i'm getting a little bit of a ringing up here maybe maybe i just need to talk louder we'll just see what we can do um but now we see we talk a lot about well abel gave a lamb we kind of leave it simple like that but the details of a gift matter and how a gift is given matters and we see when abel gave this lamb he didn't just give any lamb but he gave the first slings of his flock he gave the first and he gave it says he gave him the fat thereof he he picked the one that would be nice and tasty and juicy and that's the one he gave and he didn't just give any any gift and what jesus says then in this commandment in luke where he says to give he doesn't just say give but he says with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again and so there's different levels of giving you see these pledge drives and they say well for one dollar you can be a bronze giver and then for five dollars you can be a silver but a hundred dollars you can be you can be a gold star giver well there is something to the the different levels of giving is going to determine what your reward is and see the beautiful thing about a gift is that a true gift is a voluntary donation from the heart you're not given a gift to try to buy anything back if if you're doing that then it's not really a gift it's just an attempted purchase transaction but a true gift says i don't have to do this but it is my desire i would love to surrender this thing that means something to me and and bestow it to you and hopefully it'll mean something to you and we know that god loves a cheerful giver the way that we give is important but there's a lot in here about jesus's real teachings on a gift so let's go to mark chapter 12. and verse 41. let's read through this is this is the story that i was really thinking about and this is this is where this thought came from is this story jesus said if you love me you'll keep my commandments i want to know what his commandments are and i want to keep them and so here in luke he said to give and so i want to know how to do that so here in mark it says and jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how many people cast money into the treasury so one thing we know about jesus is he's watching you coming to church the way you come into church he sees it the way you leave church he sees it the way you sit in church the way you raise your hands what you do see we're all watching each other and oh what's this person that doesn't matter what matters is that jesus is watching and he's noticing he's noticing what we're doing and how we're doing it and he doesn't just see the outside but he sees the heart he sees what is causing you to do this are you just coming out of fear or tradition or are you coming because you love him he's watching us and he sees people how the people cast money in the treasury and many that were rich cast in much and as they were doing it i'm sure they were glad people were watching they loved to hear the the clatter of all those coin and everyone look over whoa that was a lot of coin and they drop it in and we get that way sometimes right we like to come into church and uh look holy and seem holy and everything but that's its own reward is is that the rich have their reward but then there came verse 42 there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing and then he calls to him his disciples and he says unto them verily i say to you that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living jesus noticed this and he used this he didn't just say well that's nice but he said disciples you better see this there's a lesson here there's something that you need to see in this and so what can we see in this well we can see that god notices the widow he notices the one that nobody else notices the one that comes alone the one that's forgotten jesus has not forgotten you he knows that you're here he knows what you're doing he sees though maybe you can only cast in two pennies you say well what does that matter what does it matter if i come at all should just stay home i should just give up doing no use nope god sees you he sees what you put in he sees your heart that you're putting in but i believe there's more to it than that i believe that this caught jesus's eye because this woman this widow woman she had somehow got in this channel where her gift was showing something about god and we always look at this we always say oh well i'm the little widow i'm just the poor one that throws in everything i have and that's about me but i believe in this there was also something more than this that this was showing what jesus was going to do this was showing the one that became poor he was rich but it says for your sakes he became poor he came down and he became so poor that he didn't have a place to lay his head he didn't have didn't have anything but he became so poor to all that he had was his body and then he gave that and then he gave everything then he though he had nothing else he just gave it all and when he died they even cast lots for his clothes he didn't have one possession to his name he had not a not a shirt on his back nothing but he gave it all just like this woman gave it all he threw it all in and what an inheritance we have from that the poorest man that ever died in some ways but all what a richness of the inheritance that was purchased by that giving of everything and i believe he's calling us he's showing the disciples this because there is a call for us to give in great measure we don't have to do it a gift is a voluntary donation from the heart but god loves a cheerful giver and if you love him you'll keep his commandments including to give when we say i want to be like jesus you are saying i want to be the one that gives everything for the ones i love for the for the ones that i know my father is calling me to give for would we really give like that or we just give like these rich people that they've got so much that they can just throw it all in you know which which one are we really we i believe we could stop here i've got a lot a lot of notes but i believe we could just stop here and we could just think in my in my worship of god because when you give a gift to god that's worship you're giving you're saying oh god i know that you don't need anything that i have he talks about that in the bible he he doesn't need a temple built with hands he doesn't need our works but he loves a gift he loves the widow's two mites because he knows where it's coming from it's coming from the heart and so i believe we could just look and say okay let's not just hurry over this let's not just continue on but let's look at our lives how am i giving when god looks down what is he seeing in my life am i throwing in my scraps see the other scripture that really really jumped out to me was this uh let me see if i can find it here it says it's first corinthians 15 and 19. this was the other one that i was really thinking of first corinthians 15 19. and this is paul describing how he's living he's an example to us he's 15 19 first corinthians 15 19 it says if in this life only we have hope in christ we're of all men most miserable is that true of us is that how we're living because if we're living by faith if forgiving like this widow gave then we're planting we're putting a seed in the ground and it doesn't make sense unless there's a harvest right but if there's no harvest we're just ostriches with our heads in the sand we're just clueless if we're living like that but but the way the way most christians live is not like this the way most christians live their lives are not miserable whether there's a god or whether there's not because they're not really given everything they're keeping enough back they're hedging their bets enough that even if there's no resurrection still had a pretty good life still had a nice house and car and and vacations and everything and we're not living in such a way that our lives only make sense if there's a resurrection because we're not planting everything we have we're keeping back we're throwing in our scraps we're throwing in our extras i'm talking to myself here this is not an easy thing to to preach because i don't want to be a hypocrite but what i don't want to do is only preach the parts of the bible that i can currently reach i want to keep reaching higher i want to say lord i see it in here and i don't see it here yet but lord i believe it and i believe if you said it there's a way somehow that i can please you by faith that i can walk in and that i can present my body a living sacrifice see god doesn't just want your heart he wants everything he wants all of you and so a lot of us will say okay god you can have my heart but if you really gave him your heart your body would be a living sacrifice my body would be a living sacrifice i would say god it's all yours and i believe that is our heart i believe that's the desire of our heart and i believe that that is what is happening in in around us but sometimes it's good to be reminded of this sometimes we we we are fully sold out but then the devil just tries to get us to grow cold and get us to back slide away from from the intensity of our first love let's just believe and push in and and i believe you know some of you have have been living like this for a long time some of you are very close to to your reward and i think that's a beautiful example i think we can look around to some of our elders and we can see their lives really didn't make sense look into just an earthly lens they gave too much but i believe that god will reward those ones that there will be a great reward see what we have is not a lot what we have is not the ability to to change the world in ourselves but if we'll just give our two pennies god can multiply just like the the boy that gave his lunch a couple fishes couple loaves look what god did with it he's the same yesterday today and forever and if you'll really give him your whole lunch i don't know if it would have worked if he just said well lord i've got one extra fish you can have it but he gave his whole lunch and look what the lord did the lord loves that because once you give he'll take care of you see we're supposed to be living by faith and we work so hard so that we don't have to have faith our our examples are you know work so hard get enough of a retirement that no matter what happens you're gonna be good you're gonna be okay that's not where our confidence should be our confidence is in the one that fed elijah when elijah had given everything right he's all alone he's starving but god fed him with the ravens that's what god wants he doesn't want 90 he doesn't want 10 he wants you he wants me he wants you to have a faith like the father of faith abraham that son isaac meant more to him than his own life he was old he was near done but that son that was the future that was everything was that son and he was willing to give it he had to be willing to say okay god this is the only thing in my life that really means anything and i'm not just gonna teach him about you and i'm not just going to try to make him the best that i can make him but i'm going to give his life totally to you that doesn't make any sense unless there's a resurrection unless there's a real god and that's how i want to raise my kids is to give them totally to god to teach them to live in such a way that their lives don't make sense there's a resurrection because i do believe there is a resurrection i do believe these are not just stories if they're just stories then just come to church throw in your extra that's fine but if this is real then the only way is to give your all just like the woman with the alabaster box that was the only thing that i know that she had the only glory that she had left was her hair she worshipped she gave it all these are examples for us these are these are just people that were human they didn't have the holy ghost but somehow they had enough faith that it says abraham staggered not at the promise of god how much better of a report can we have who have the blood of the lord jesus who have his spirit but is that our report or do our lives make too much sense if there's no resurrection here's a more recent testimony there's a pastor brother in new york named devon carrion maybe some of you know him and one of the one of the testimonies that i loved from his life is there was a man off the street that ended up at his house just a stranger to him i don't think he was homeless to get a job i don't mean to stay off the street like that but just a stranger there's many people in new york so of course they don't know each other and they were talking and then this brother had to go he came to the end of the evening he had to go across town to his own house something in brother yvonne see brother von cared about this man and brother von says okay well you need to go across town here's the keys to my car why don't you bring it back in the morning that's faith i don't know that i would do that but that man is a believer now i met the man he loves the lord he saw something real he saw somebody that was willing to say here's my car hope you bring it back do we give like that or do we just give the things that we can afford to lose we just give the keys to the car that we we're okay but we walk by faith not by sight and god will take care of us i've never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging for bread for bread if god cares for all of his creation won't he care for his sons and daughters that are stepping out in faith i don't know how to live like this but we have examples and i believe as we as we reach out towards the lord he'll draw us close to help us but i don't believe although we're talking about a gift we're talking about something that's voluntary i believe it is more serious than that because we see in the story of the rich young ruler this guy was good he was the guy you'd want your kids to hang out with and go learn to be like this guy i mean he was good he's the best guy in church probably he dumped a lot of money in the offering maybe he was one of the ones giving when the widow came to give and i bet he was glad to give his extra i bet he was a cheerful giver for the extra that he could give but when it came down to it when jesus said to him you lack one thing go thy way sell whatever there has give to the poor and i shall have treasure in heaven come take up the cross and follow me he was sad he was grieved he had great possessions but what was he asking was he just asking master everything's great is there any extra credit i can do when he came his question was good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life these are serious things you can't buy eternal life we're going to see that later that once you go and try to buy something from the lord no no go but what god is looking for is obedience he's looking for a heart that will follow him because here's the thing that last two words were the most important he only heard this other sell what you have give to the poor but follow me follow this that's where we ought to be lord help us there's also one a certain man named ananias if you read this story peter says that he lied to the holy ghost it doesn't record him actually saying a lie in acts 5 and 1 it says a certain man named ananias with sapphire his wife sold a possession and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet that's all it says he did it doesn't say that he said this is everything but in his heart he was keeping something back it cost him his life was it worth it it's just like achin trying to get this little babylonian robes and a wedge of gold it wasn't worth it why do we think it's worth it to hold back part of our lives and say god i'll give you i'll give you six hours a week and me sitting in church and ten minutes today praying isn't that enough but he wants us to give everything he wants us to really follow him and he will provide and see i don't i don't know that this means for all of us to to literally sell everything that we have and dump it in the box maybe it does but i don't know that but what's important is that we're following the lord and we're listening to say lord what would you have me do because see here here's something that we learned from abraham is that what was important was the willingness to give it all it wasn't actually required that he killed his son but what was required is that he was willing to and the same thing i believe is required to us that maybe it's not actually required that we dump it all in the box back there but i do believe it is required that we say lord it's yours and the moment you show me to drop it in there i'm i'm gonna do my best see it it's in the heart god sees what's in the heart see this man ananias he had the best church i mean his pastor wrote most of the new testament wouldn't you like that go sit there and oh what does this one mean and he still died because he held back i believe if each one of us would just say lord it's all yours i believe we would see something happen and i believe we are seeing that things happen i believe that is the desire of our hearts how many of us have been here at the altar and said lord i surrender all i don't believe that we're we're so far from this i believe that we're just forgotten somewhere and we start to think oh well this is mine you know we're just stewards we're just entrusted with these talents for a little bit of time until the master comes back and we say lord here you go my crowns are yours everything is for him but this is about more than just putting money in a box this is about are we giving him all of our thoughts that we can our attention are we are we seeking him early in the morning like david said early will i seek thee are we giving him the leftovers this one's preaching to me because i like to sleep i like to sleep as long as i could but i believe it would please the lord if i would say lord i want to give you the first fruits of my day i want to seek you early i want to give you my mind while it's fresh instead of when it's so tired i want to give him the first of my love in mark 12 and 28 the scribes were asking him what is the first commandment of all what is the most important thing verse 29 and jesus answered him the first of all commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment see that's more than just all your money because you can give all your money but if you give it without charity it profits nothing still a sounding brass tinkling symbol you can do great works you can go live your life for others and and heal people and all this stuff and still get to the end and he says i never knew you but if you just obey this first commandment if you just say lord help me to love you like that see i was thinking of what i said last wednesday where i said oh we ought to be twitterpated with him you know that's that's kind of strong i think well is that really are we supposed to be so so in love like that i think this is stronger language than twitter painted love him with all our heart with all our soul and mind and strength that's with everything that we are because anything less than that is just giving them our extras casting in like the rich but jesus said want you that are rich for you have received your consolation people love the sermon on the mountain they love the blessed are the poor and blessed are the meek i mean that part's easy to preach your poor thing blessed are you what about where it says woe unto you that are rich huh that one's a little harder more want you that are full for you shall hunger don't see that on sweatshirts what unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets but that's the word of god if we take that out it's not the gospel anymore it's not good news anymore it's death but godliness with contentment is great gain it says in first timothy six and six if we brought nothing into this world and there's a certain we can carry nothing out having food and raiment let us be there with content contentment amen but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some have coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows we pay for our own selfishness these corruptible things the sin and loving corruptible things is that it keeps your eyes off christ and any separation from god is death and so we chase after our own death our own destruction when we chase after things that will take us away from the lord jesus but the next verse says but thou man of god how many men of god women of god do we have and this is for you flee these things flee these earthly riches run from them and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life it's not a picnic to be a christian it's a race it's a battle we're unto thou art called and has professed professed a good profession before many witnesses see we make being a christian so boring because we don't live by faith but it ought to be we say lord unless you come through i'm in trouble that's what that's the kind of boldness we should live with i say well lord i'm putting myself out here not to test the lord god we don't do that but because the way he tells us to live is is a bold way to live it's an offensive way to live that we're going we're going to go take back what the enemies took from us we're not just going to leave our loved ones out there but we're going to go and fight for them and anytime you go into battle you've got the possibility that things could go very badly if you're not taking steps that could go very badly you're not really fighting on the offense are you if we're just hiding hiding in our safe little lives what faith does that take but thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy there is going to be a people that has faith enough to take this word and just go and say i do believe that if i'll just throw my two mites in they'll take care of the rest dropping down to verse 17 there in first timothy 6 there are some people that are to be rich that's okay it says charge them that be rich that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded there's a way to be a christian and have some wealth but it's you got to do it the christian way that you don't be high-minded that you don't trust in these uncertain riches but in the living god it's on the money still i believe in god we trust who giveth us richly all things to enjoy that they do good that they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to communicate laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life don't trust in your riches but go and lay hold on eternal life that's to know him to follow him that's life eternal it's not just about giving a sacrifice what we think is pretty that's cain's offering but it's what's according to this word it's worshiping the father in spirit and in truth it's this obedience that's better than sacrifice it says and then we always quote that we go to obey is better than sacrifice and then we'll go to the next one and we'll say rebellion is like unto the sin of witchcraft amen but the next part of that we leave out a lot of times it says and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry got to be careful got to be pliable got to be not so set in our ways got to say lord it's all yours do you want me to move this way move that way even if i've been here a while maybe i should preach from here for a while off center we want to stay centered in the words i think it's good to preach from the center of the pulpit but you know don't be so stubborn don't be so sure that the way you've always been doing it is the right way it's very important how we bring our gift it says if we bring our gift to the altar a great gift a good gift the best gift and then we remember that our brother has ought against thee well it's him with the problem i don't have ought against anybody huh i just love everyone but your brother's got ought against you things are not right it says leave your gift there go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift god has a way of doing things and we can't just go and and go with our best intentions and and just do it our way but to obey is better than sacrifice it was simon that came and he offered them money to get the gift of laying hands on people need to receive the holy ghost peter said to him thy money perish with me because those thoughts the gift of god may be purchased with money now it's neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of god repent therefore this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven me you can't buy with our gifts then your heart's not right but if we will obey that first commandment and we'll love him with all our heart soul mind strength and body then how can we not give if the spirit of mozart was in you you'd write symphonies if if monet you paint paintings hitler you wage war if the spirit of christ is in you you'll lay down your life for your friends so there's no greater love than that and god is love and his spirit is the spirit of love his spirit is the spirit of sacrifice we're to take up our crosses daily every day it ought to be lord let me die for you today let me die to my own thoughts my own ways the stubbornness that i have let all that just be crucified today that you would be glorified that my treasures wouldn't be here on earth but they'd be laid up in heaven i believe there will be a people that lives like that i believe when we're talking about the manifestation of the sons of god we're not looking so much for glitter and glamour but we're looking for character we're looking for sacrifice we're looking for love so we just give our two mites and give our all and how do we give to god is it is it that box is that god's box there in the back that's the way that we give to god we give to god by giving to one another if you see your brother in need and you shut up your bowels of compassion how dwelleth the love of god in you jesus said as much as you've done it to the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me if you want to give your all to jesus give it for your brother your sister as much as you've not done this you've not done it unto me who's my brother the samaritan your enemy the person that can't pay you back that's who we're supposed to invite to our feasts right it's easy to invite the people that can have you over next week let's say come on i can't i know you can't pay me back but i want to give you my attention i want to hear your talk that's how we ought to love that's how we know that we love god it says let's go to first john 3 and let's read from 16 down to 24. do we give to others the first fruits the fat part or do we give to others leftovers i usually give them leftovers but i want to give to them like i'm giving it to god let's put that 16 it says hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren that's strong words we don't just lay our lives down for for god but we lay our lives down for the brethren so brother sister if it cost me everything i want to help you i want to bless you whoso hath this world's good and seeth his brother in need and shut up shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelt the love of god in him my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue oh i love you god bless you go be hungry but indeed and in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth this is how we know that we've got the truth it's not by the revelation that makes you jump it's by the revelation that makes you bend down and wash somebody's feet this is how we know that we are in the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward god and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight see a lot of the reason we don't have faith to see miracles and to really see the sick healed and the dead raised because somewhere deep down we know that we're not living like jesus lived and so we can't pray with confidence because we know that we're our hearts just not right it's not about us buying our own salvation if we'll believe on him it's by grace through faith but then comes the holy spirit and does this work that lets us give our our bodies a living sacrifice see god didn't just save you to save your soul he saved you to save you and defeat the works of the enemy deliver you from sin give you the victory don't just look back to past generations one of the prophets the way the book starts i was just reading i forget which one it was god says i'm i was so displeased with your fathers they didn't do it right we can't just look to the church fathers we've fallen from where we were where the church was in the book of acts we don't want to just live as good as the methodists did or the baptist did or they did in the 60s but we want to live like jesus lived because that's how peter and paul and them lived they all gave their lives except for one or two see the miracle wasn't just that they went and healed some people that would be power but the power with character led them to live their whole lives in such a way that they didn't take this healing ministry that they had and just build themselves kingdoms and castles and nice cars and houses like a lot of us would do but they saw it all the way through that they were like jesus in the healing in the preaching in the forgiving in the dying and they'll be like him in the resurrection a perfect match these are big things to preach but i have confidence in his word that if his word goes forth it's going to accomplish that which is said to accomplish if his word comes and says give i believe that's not just a commandment without power to fulfill the commandment i believe if he tells you to do something he's going to make a way to do it we just got to be willing to give it all here's my two mites lord where were we and this is his commandment verse 23 that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave us commandment and he that keepeth and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us and that spirit's the spirit that works those works of god do we need that spirit we need to be led by the spirit that's that's how we know the sons of god as those that are led by the spirit those that are not so stubborn to keep their own ways but those that can be can be moved around we need wisdom to apply this jesus said to be wise as serpents harmless as doves we need to be led by him very very exactly when jesus went to the pool bethesda there was many sick but the father wanted one healed so we can't just go and well give everything i have to everybody no we have to give our all to god and he'll show us how to give it to our brother because if we go and do it in our own thinking then we'll be the ones at the end of the day say lord we've done these miracles these great mighty works jesus says well i never knew you but if we can abide in him and him and us he'll show us jesus said in john 5 19 verily verily i say unto you the son it's talking about him but that's talking about us right the son can do nothing of himself what do you see at the father do what things so ever he doeth these also do with the sun likewise we've got to be watching father what are you doing not what did you do 20 years ago or yesterday but lord what are you doing today let me see you do it and let me do what are we it what is he doing is that our desire to say lord my first objective for today is to see what you're doing so that i can do likewise it's going to be different for each one of us we have different lives we have different ways to give our all but there is a way there are many widows in israel in the days of elijah he was sent to one there's many lepers none was cleansed saved naaman but if we'll just say lord who is it what is it lord i'm willing he'll move us we won't even understand it probably won't even know what's happening but his will will be done in this earth as in heaven as long as we're obedient see what i want to what i want to see in this church what i want to see in myself is another book of acts that says the same thing as the first book of acts i don't want the second book of acts to be a different story i want it to just be the same same things in in acts 3 6 then peter said silver and gold have i none isn't that something he didn't have anything but he did have something given all that you have these things that we could have the silver and gold that's not really what it's about but what it's about is what peter had such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk i want to have that i want to be able to give that and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaped up and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with him into the temple walking and leaping and praising god and all the people saw him walking and praising god and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him see the beautiful thing here this that was in peter that he could give this now this is something that's welling enough inside of him this is a fountain by christ's poverty we've been made rich that we can just give and give and give if we just empty out the channels for just give it all so that the power of god can move through us that's why we have fruit that's why we have water it's for the guy sitting by the beautiful gate that he can see god that he can praise god i believe if we'll just obey so just say yes lord help me lord i believe we'll see this i believe this is the will of god that we love the man sitting outside that he'd be healed and that he would worship god for our musicians would come one last scripture john 6 and 37 maybe think well the lord wouldn't want my two mites i'm too bad it says all that the father giveth me shall come to me though this is a big a big thing that seems so hard to get to we're not just the giver we're the gift we're just the gift this is a gift that god has given himself is this bride just like he gave adam this woman eve didn't have to say oh well let me let me become all this and that she was just a gift that's what god's doing once again is he's pulling a church a bride out of the side of christ by his own power calling her out from the world cleaning her up dressing her in his word we're the gift and god is a good gift giver and that which he's given it can't fail to come and he's not going to refuse that gift you are the gift that god is giving to himself in christ you are the bride if you'll be led by the spirit if you'll give away that rebellion and stubbornness and just say yes lord then you're that one that the father is giving and he's the one that does the work he'll know why is cast down cast out for i came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given all are you in that all [Music] all that he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up the last day i believe we're very near that last day i believe as the lord is raising up this gift he's not just raising it from the dead naturally but he's raising us from the dead spiritually he's raising up a people that for too long has been asleep and empty that they'd be full and awake and that they'd love the lord their god with all their heart and soul and mind and strength and body and they love their neighbor as their self because that's the second one do you feel the father drawing you we say yes lord amen lord we give your all [Music] let's just stand and pray [Music] god thank you for your word it's a lamp to our feet it's light to our path father [Music] we love it lord it delivers us from evil it shows us the way it shows us where we can walk safely where we can rest father well we don't have to do it in ourselves but lord where we can surrender to you and let you make everything beautiful in your time father though we don't have much to give lord you still want us to give and you still call us to give lord help us to give our all for you you gave your all for us father and we believe by faith lord by the revelation that you've given us that we're part of that bride a part of that gift lord that you've given yourself that will be without spot and without blemish lord that will be perfect through the blood of christ through the blood that was shed on calvary lord that that would be applied to us that we could walk like you walked father that we could love like you loved father give us faith to believe that we could live by faith lord that we could walk boldly in the confidence that you will take care of us lord that you'll keep us from fallen and lord where we've fallen that you'll pick us up father that you'll reach down your hand again and again father for that righteous one that falls seven times and rises again lord that we could love one another not in word but indeed father that you would be glorified father help us everyone from the oldest the youngest lord just to love you more to believe you more and to surrender to you help me lord i i fall so far short of this but lord i thank you for your grace lord your mercy that that draws us lord that restores us and renews us father as we seek you lord you said we find you as we open to you to come in and sup with us father bless us now i pray [Music] heal us lord everywhere that were broken in jesus name amen i give myself [Music] i away myself away so you can use me i give myself away [Music] i give myself away so you can use me here i am here i [Music] stand lord my life is in your hands lord i know to see your desires revealed in me i give myself away i give myself away so you can use me i give myself away i give myself away so you can use me my life is not my own to you i belong i give myself i give myself to you my life is not my own to you i belong i give myself i give myself to you i give myself away i give myself away so you can use me i give myself away i give myself away so you can use me amen as brother aaron comes let's sing as the deer planteth for the water [Music] oh as the deer pantheth the waters so my soul longeth [Music] you alone are my strengths [Music] you're my friend and you all my brother even though you are the king i love you more than so [Music] are much strength my shame to you may my spirit i want you more [Music] is [Music] you alone are my strength my shield [Music] desire god is looking at the desire of your heart the motive of your heart because there are those that give everything some of the greatest people you've ever heard of and they've given their whole life to something but they've given it to a wrong thing give it to them but they gave their all god looks at the motive and the desire of the heart and if you're it's like you said that the two mites that she gave meant a whole lot more and sometimes god just wants to see what your reaction is how you would act in that and he can say this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased they've take just after their father so fill my cupboard [Music] this thirsting of my soul o bread of [Music] is [Music] brother peter ministered on on i believe his last wednesday night and he talked of that bubbling spring and i even heard it but while we were there in in yellowstone taking pictures of those bubbling thermals and as just as they come out it's what they do you can stand in there and look at it for an hour it just continues continues so my daughter rachel posted one of them and peter said that's just what we were talking about that with inside of you that flows if there's honey in the rock then you get honey from that and we just say fearless lord let it let it be christ in me oh fill my god [Music] come and quench this [Music] of heaven feed fill it up and make all to jesus [Music] love and trust i surrender all [Music] ah let me just take a moment as our sister plays that song and just say lord look at me closely is there something that i'm still holding to is there something i haven't surrendered something that i've not wanted to give or not been able to give lord and let you have full control the lord i say i surrender all now and help me to do that father and after how many times we could we could share where when we've given it to you what a blessing it turns out to be father because you can take that one penny out of the ten and do way more than we can do with the nine father if we just say here it is lord i give it all to you i surrender all to you lord jesus and i [Music] surrender home i surrender [Music] how many say amen to that today how many knows are going to be tested on that and say lord help me to pass the test amen as we go this this evening god bless you i like what brother peter said give him those first moments when you wake up and you're and you're you're feeling stronger give those moments to him too not at the last moment lord okay i'm
