we'll see we'll see how the plans go um that's it I don't think I missed any of the announcements um for tonight uh for those of you who haven't been here before Wednesday night we dedicate to a Bible study and brother Lyall and I go back and forth and uh we started in Genesis and we're all the way to the book that everybody knows that what that's it's almost everybody's favorite book in the Old Testament it's Obadiah right does everybody know what Obadiah is about it's the shortest book in the Old Testament it's only one chapter and it's actually a tremendously interesting book it's it's um it has some really really great lessons in it it it talks about it's it's addressed not to the normal audience it's addressed to these people called the it's addressed to the people of Edom so we have to understand who these people from Edom are and we have to understand the context of the book so the book starts out and and what had happened is these had betrayed their brothers in Israel there was a great attack that came from another country most Scholars think that it is the attack of Nebuchadnezzar that came in and destroyed the temple and took all of the captives and brought them back to Babylon and these who we're going to find out are related to the Israelites they sat there and they watched it happen and they didn't help their Brethren and not only that when the Israelites tried to escape they actually went after the Israelites and grabbed them and and held them so that the Invaders could take them captive so they really betrayed their Brethren and this is a prophecy to those people it's in two parts the first 15 verses are directed to Edom and then the rest of the book is directed to really everyone and it has a lot of pride in there and um has a lot of as I said a lot of lessons it's um it's it's really it's a unique book and to understand it we have to understand some history now brother ly and I have spent a lot of time on the Bible and explaining where these people Israel came from because pretty much every book every book in the Bible refers back to the Israelites so who are they and what is their significance so we see this man we in the Book of Genesis we see this man named Abraham God visits him the Bible says he's a friend of God God God gives him a promise even though he's his wife is Barren he has no children gives him a pro promise and said you are going to be the father of many nations promises him that he's going to have this land that's beyond the Jordan River and that his offspring will inhabit that land and that's pretty much what the whole Bible's about after that it talks about this group of people that come from this descendant of Abraham so Abraham then by a miracle he has a son named Isaac then Isaac has two sons Twins and those are firstborn is Esau and the second born is Jacob Jacob's name is changed to Israel so now we have the country of Israel and the rest of the Bible is pretty much about that group of people that come from Jacob so it's the sons of Jacob are also the sons of Israel the children of Israel that is who that is but this other guy Esau he was blessed also and he his lineage is called the or Edom so we have to understand that to properly understand this book of Obadiah now when ES and Jacob were born and we're going to read the scripture that they were born but when they were born let's just read it let's go to Genesis the um 25th chapter and start with the 20th verse now remember a Abraham had a son named Isaac and Isaac Genesis 2520 and Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca to wife the daughter of bethu the Syrian of pan mamam I'm sorry it's a hard one to pronounce the sister to laan the Syrian and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was Barren and the Lord was intreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her now she's inside of her womb we have these two babies would be called fetuses I guess if you don't believe that they're alive and there was some sort of cognitive um function going on and they were fighting inside of their mother's womb and the and the one people it says the two nations are and and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the Elder Shall Serve the younger keep that in your mind because that is going to be a theme now through the book of obadi keep that prophecy there in your mind that one shall be stronger and the Elder the the Elder Shall Serve the younger and when her days were when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb and the first came out red and all over like a hairy garment and they called his name Esau so when Esau was born he was a little red hairy baby and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold of Esau's heel and his name was called Jacob and Isaac was three score years old when she bare them so Esau came out first he was the Elder Jacob was the younger and they battled inside the womb and the boys grew and Esau was a cunning Hunter and a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents so these two boys they grew up and they were always at odds with each other and you'll see that the prophecy they started at odds in the womb and they they were at odds all the way for hundreds and hundreds of years after that their offspring so as they grew up the older Adam I'm the oldest so the older tradition was the older had the birthright which means that he got the the biggest share of the inheritance from the Father the younger here was Jacob and Jacob he saw that so there was one day and Jacob wanted this Birthright so he saw he he saw an opportunity Esau was out hunting he was a man's man he was rough he was out he he probably smelled like the field he did smell like the field he um he liked to hunt he liked to kill deer his dad was really proud of him Jacob was more you know he's he's more comfortable at home you know just a little bit of a of a of a softer person it seems like so he cooked up this nice bowl of red stew and Jake or Esau was tired he comes back in to the house and he's am and Jacob says here's some stew and Esau looks at it smells good and he's hungry and Jacob says give me the birth right first Esau didn't care about the birthright it wasn't important to him so he says sure he says you can have it just give me the stew I feel like I'm going to die so Jacob gives him the stew now that was just Aver conversation between two brothers in private but it shows that we should always be careful of everything that we say even the thoughts that we think because God was watching this conversation between these two brothers and that decision that was made by Esau to give that Birthright to his younger brother God saw and God honored now I believe it was God's will according to the prophecy given to Rebecca their mother that he would that the younger would have the birthright but still it was it was the oldest older ones to have so he had to give it up and he did and God was watching and God saw that Covenant that was made even though it was over a bowl of soup and later on we see that that um Jacob and Esau were coming their dad was getting old their dad Isaac was getting old he was blind and they wanted this blessing from their father that was a big deal so Isaac was calling his sons in Jacob's mom both of their mom preferred Jacob over Esau she dressed him up in in a in hairy hairy garment must have smelled like a goat and and made him smell and feel like the brother Esau goes in the father Isaac he's blind and Jacob is imitating his brother Esau and he says here I am dad will you give me the blessing and he says Ah you know you sound like Jacob but you smell like Esau you feel like Esau and he says no I'm Esau so the prophet Isaac gives his Blessing to the younger he was tricked into doing it but I always think that Jacob gets a bad rap because Esau had already given that Birthright to Jacob and God's Prophet Isaac a wonderful man a great great man of God he was just falling in the order of God's ordained plan even though he didn't know it so wasn't a mistake I don't think so I think it was just God leading Isaac to do this even though he didn't know what he was doing he gives the blessing to the younger because the older one didn't care the Bible says he despised the birthright it wasn't important to him so then he comes in after his brother leaves and he gets all mad and and um there's the it's it's just a continued fight between those two for pretty much forever so this book of Obadiah it is talking about the sons of Esau the sons of Edom and the lineage that Esau had so let's go to Obadiah and let's read the whole thing it says this OB verse one there's only one chapter the vision of Obadiah thus sayith the Lord God concerning Edom so Obadiah this prophet he comes and he is going to give a prophecy to this group of people called Edom we have heard a rumor from the Lord and an ambassador is sent among the Heathen arise ye and let us rise up and go against her in battle so the prophecy begins by saying that God sent a message which is declaring war on these and now he is going to speak to the behold I have made thee small among the Heathen the Heathen are the Gentiles Thou Art greatly despised the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee that thou dwell Us in the cleft of the in the Clift of the rock whose habitation is high that saith in his heart who shall bring me down to the ground now if you could put up that map first brother Jeremy let's first of all let's let's see where Edom is as opposed to Israel it's in the South you can see um there's Judah and then there's Israel on the left side of the Jordan River and the Dead Sea there and you can see Moab and Ammon but what we're looking at right now is Edom which is the yellow on the very south so this this country right here has be become a very powerful country and the scripture here God is saying through his Prophet he's saying the pride of your heart has deceived you because you dwell in the Cliffs of the rock whose habitation is high that saith in his heart who shall bring me down to the ground now if you could go to the next slide brother Jeremy this is um I forgot the name of it um the city of what is it brother ly the pet Petra this is uh this is Petra now this is probably what it looked like this is in modern day Jordan this is probably what it looked like it is very close to what it looked like when they first built this these are where the are dwelling and you can see that it's built into the Rock and it's built up really high so an invading Army has a major disadvantage there they can't Tear Down the Walls because there's no walls they can't tear down a mountain they don't have cannons they don't have a way to attack this so they have The High Ground so any attacking Army is going to be at a major major disadvantage because they can shoot their arrows down they can throw rocks down on them and it's going to be just a very very difficult thing for someone to attack and you can go to the next picture there and this is a modern day this is what the what it looks like today right here and uh it stood the T test of time so what the Lord is saying here he's saying that you think that you're in this impen impenetrable Fortress you you think that no one can get you because you are making your Abode up in these these Cliffs and nobody can get to you so he he is saying that you're going to be brought down though no matter how great you think that you are though thou exalt thyself as the eagle way up high and though thou set thy Nest Among the Stars Then will I bring thee down sayeth the Lord if thieves come to thee if robbers by Night how art thou cut off would they not have stolen till they had enough if the grape gatherers came to thee would they not have left some grape so what he's saying is if if a robber comes in your house or if someone comes in at night in your Vineyard and steals your grapes they can't steal everything they're going to leave some stuff there because they can't carry everything they can't get get all of your your possessions so you can still go through and glean something but he's saying here that no not you eat them you're not going to have anything after this is over I'll read that one again the though thou exalt thyself as the eagle and those they set th and thou set thy Nest Among the Stars Then will I bring thee down sayeth the Lord if thieves come unto thee if robbers by Night how art thou cut off would they have not have stolen till they had enough If thy grape gatherers came to thee would they not have left would they not leave some grapes how are the things of Esau searched out how are his hidden things sought up all the men of thy Confederacy have brought thee even to the border the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee and prevailed against thee that they eat thy bread and have laid a wound under thee there is none understanding in him shall I not in that day sayeth the Lord even destroy the wise men out of Edom an understanding out of the Mount of Esau and thy Mighty Men oh teeman shall be dismayed to the end that everyone of the Mount of Esau may be cut off by Slaughter so basically he's saying that that you've done this to this to to these people they this let's say Babylon Nebuchadnezzar invades you sat there and you watched it come in and because you've done this you've messed with Israel you've messed with God and you can't you are going to be punished let's go to numbers let's stop there for a second and let's go back in time to the book of numbers and this is balam's prophecy I want to show you something about this battle between Esau and Jacob and that had has gone on for years and years let's go way back to numbers chap 26 verse 16 and this is balum prophesying if you remember when we went through our Bible study in numbers balum was a man that was very gifted but he was a hling Prophet this King baac hired balum to prophesy against Israel balum who was gifted he couldn't do it when he was anointed by the Holy Spirit he prophesied for Israel now listen to this this is his prophecy he hath said which heard the words of God and knew numbers 26:16 he hath said I got the wrong one I'm sorry let's see all right it's worth it's worth the wait let me there you go numers 2416 thank you Brothers numbers 24:16 he hath said which heard the words of God and knew the knowledge of the most high which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open I shall see him but not now I Shall Behold Him but not nigh there shall come a star out of Jacob we remember who Jacob was they shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel and shall Smite the corners of Moab and destroy the children of of Seth so what is this prophecy of it's very common very prophecy we all know it's a prophecy of the coming Messiah verse number 18 and Edom shall be a possession SE also shall be a possession for his enemies and Israel shall do valiantly out of Jacob shall come he that ha shall have dominion and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city so we see way back A Prophecy of the Messiah coming and that he will D he will take charge of everything now let's go to Jeremiah this is a very very interesting series of scriptures so listen close Jeremiah chapter 31 verse 15 thus sayeth the Lord a voice was heard in Rama lamentation and bitter weeping roel I believe that's Rachel weeping for her children refused to be conf comforted for her children because they were not a prophecy that you would have no idea what that is until it happens let's go to Matthew Chapter 2 now this is the Fulfillment of that prophecy then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet saying in Rama there was a voice heard a lamentation and weeping and great mourning Rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not so that was when King Herod came on the scene the wise men didn't give him the information that he wanted so then he goes and he starts killing all of the young all of the baby boys and then this cry comes out out of Israel this mourning from all the babies from all the mothers from all the families that were suffering from this so This Herod was doing that and remember way back in balum he says that this star would come up so we see that that these two things are happening now remember way back he said the star of Jacob so remember that these two battling factions started in the womb between Esau and Jacob and they were fighting for all of these years now I'm going to get to my point I wanted to lay this foundation so they're killing these babies when Jesus is here and who is killing the babies you remember what was his name Herod Herod was an Edomite he was some someone from this lineage of Esau and you see they're still battling this out but right at this time just after this time Edom ceases to exist when Rome came in destroyed the temple destroyed and killed all killed all the the thousands of people that they did that is the last of Edom right there so there's this battle that has been going going on for hundreds and hundreds of years now let's go back to Obadiah verse 10 for thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee remember what Herod did to the children of Israel killing their babies for thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee and also them not helping out when when this invading Army came and thou shalt be cut off forever in the day that thou us on the other side now every almost every modern translation that it says on the day that thou stood us on the other side it says that on the day that you stood aloof basically you didn't do anything you saw all of this happening and you just stood should stood back you shied away you didn't you didn't do anything and that's when when we look at it brothers and sisters we we've said before that if you see something happening if you see a wrong being done if you see violence being committed if you if you see something and you just stand back and you hide your face and you don't do anything then you can be just as responsible for not doing anything as you would be for doing something wrong so not doing something is not always the safe way to do it we should always be working and serving God and doing the best that we can and this this chapter right here is very a very good lesson like don't stand back and not do anything be up and doing we live in this age now that we call the Leo Dean age from from Revelation chapter 3 it says I'm Luke just lukewarm I have need of nothing and it's a laziness and it's a it's a refusal of the people people to be up and doing up and and making things happen Psalm 1377 says this remember oh Lord the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem who said raise it raise it even to the foundation thereof that mean that word raise it means tear it down English Standard Version says remember oh Lord against the the day of Jerusalem how they said Lay It Be lay it be down to its foundation so God is accusing Edom here of doing nothing James 4 CH James 4:16 says this but now rejoice in your boasting all such rejoicing is evil therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin so if you know to do good if you know you should be doing something if you know you should be making an impact and you don't do it it's still sin even though you're doing nothing back to Obadiah number 11 in the day that thou stood us on the other side basically you saw that your brother need help but you did nothing in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces and the foreigners entered into his Gates and cast lot upon Jerusalem even thou was one of them but thou should us not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger neither should us thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress thou should us not have entered into the the Gate of thy people in the day of their Calamity yay thou should us not have overlooked their Affliction in the day of their Calamity nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their Calamity so what did is they watched as let's say it was Nebuchadnezzar they watched as Nebuchadnezzar's armies came in all the people ran away from the cities they took the captives they and then the ones that ran away they went out and they got them and they gave them over to the Babylonian armies and they went and they inhabited some of their cities even and God here is saying I saw when you did that and you they took advantage of their brother's Misfortune really and how many times do we see that somebody may get on your nerves or or do something against you or somebody you just don't like and you see hardships or you see something come upon them that you look on those people and there's something in you that says good I'm glad they deserved it it's a wrong spirit it's the same Spirit right here that Edom had for Israel that oh this is good finally they're getting Justice all that they've been given through all these years finally they're getting their Justice and God's saying you should have helped them neither should us thou have stood in the Crossway to cut off those of his that did Escape neither should us thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress for the day of the Lord is near upon the Heathen as thou Hast done it shall be done unto thee thy reward shall return upon thy own head do you remember when we went through the Book of Joel the recurring theme was the day of the Lord the day of the Lord is great for some and the day of the Lord is terrible for others it depends on where you stand with the Lord when the day of the Lord comes is it going to be a great day for you or is it going to be a terrible day but the day of the Lord is coming for all of us for as ye have drunk upon my Holy Mountain so shall all the Heathen drink continually yay they shall drink and they shall swallow down and they shall be as though they had not been but upon Mount Zion shall be deliverance and there shall be Holiness and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions House of Jacob is Israel possessing that of Edom and the house of Jacob shall be a fire and the house of Joseph a flame a flame and a fire these flame and this fly are are executing God's judgment and the house of Esau for stubble and they shall Kindle in them and devour them and there shall not be any remaining of the House of Esau for the Lord hath spoken it and they shall and and they of the South shall possess the Mount of Esau and they of the plain the Philistines and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim and the fields of Samaria and Benjamin shall possess Gilead and the Captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites even unto zerath and the Captivity of Jerusalem which is that at Shephard shall possess the cities of the South and the Captivity as they said the Captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess all of the Canaanites place now that hasn't completely happened yet Israel is back in their Homeland but I mean Solomon probably had the biggest kingdom that Israel has ever had but it still has not fulfilled this there is still land that is was given to Israel that they do not have yet and it says right here and all of this land was given to them and savior shall come upon Mount Zion to judge the Mount of Esau and the kingdom shall be the Lords for thy violence against thy brother Jacob shall come shall cover thee and thou shalt be cut off forever so most of the prophecy of this book has been fulfilled but there's still some that hasn't as far as the land and in closing in this book of Obadiah the first part is a judgment upon Edom for what they did and then the second part is warning all the people basically don't mess with Israel don't mess with my people because if you do then God's judgments will come down upon you and look at what's going on right now I mean this is this is a perfect example we see it on the news where these Hamas and Hezbollah they're coming in they're shooting Rockets over the border and they're trying to attack these people of Israel and when they do that they are fighting against God and let me tell you something when you fight against God you will lose and look what's happening they're taking people out with pagers and walkie-talkies and Rockets and bullets and the things that are happening it's every single one every time they someone else gets promoted he's gone another one gets promoted he's gone these these things that we're seeing over in the Middle East right now are I don't know how they could even be possible with the way that they're doing it one by one they're taking out these leaders and it shows here God is still fighting God's word is still true this word in Obadiah even though this this these have been wiped out there are still people coming against Israel and they're still forsaking Israel and they're still fighting against Israel and it seems like we would learn by reading this book don't do that because then you'll find yourself fighting against God and that is a losing proposition and we're seeing it now and pretty soon these prophecies will be fulfilled Israel will be in control peace will eventually come but until then it's just amazing to watch and we should always be friends with that country it's the Bible says it's the apple of God's eye and this book of Obadiah shows that it was another invading Army that came in and just because they stood back and allowed this Army to come in and Destroy these people they were punished and they were wiped off the map the lineage was was compl completely destroyed if they would have gone in and fought against Nebuchadnezzar let's say it was Nebuchadnezzar they would have probably lost but they would have been blessed and the lineage after them would have been blessed and they would have never been guilty of fighting against God's people but they were and then we see some of the worst people come from this line of Edom which is Herod himself and how we see we see Israel there and living their lives and we see the Fighting by Herod killing the babies and doing what he did and it it just continued it started in the womb and it continued all the way until that time and that's the book of Obadiah it's a short book very interesting book and uh and one that now you can say what it means means Daniel and and and the musicians Kum it's um I thoroughly enjoyed as I always do in every in every book thoroughly enjoyed all that um was part of of reading about this this book of Obadiah it's it's situated perfectly with Amos and Joel very similar in its Spirit we don't know when Obadiah uh was was actually given the prophecy was given it doesn't give us a date it doesn't give a king for a reference but it can say it was probably right after the invasion of Babylon into Israel when they took the captive into Judah when they took the captives Daniel [Music] and he answered [Music] me and delivered me from every fear and those look on him are [Music] ready they'll never be ashamed they'll never be be ashamed oh magnify the Lord with me and come exalt his name together oh glorify the Lord with me and come exalt his name forever this we uh we're not in sync tonight God bless you brothers and sisters I appreciate our Bible study it's good to have everyone come together it's good to learn about these books books and you know I've been been praying this week about the future and the direction of our church and as I always do and I always have and I really don't think that we can do anything better than to learn this book we call ourselves Christians how can we call ourselves Christians if we don't know this book how can we call ourselves Christians if we don't know what Jesus Christ was sent for what he died for and what he said we can't and I believe it's very very important that our church that we come together on these Wednesday nights we learn about this Bible and then on Sundays we we dig deeper into the scriptures and and bring out how this can be applied to our lives but I don't think there's anything better that we can do than to study the Bible so let's continue study it on your own read it on your own and stand strong on what it says and let the Holy Spirit interpret it to you and give your life brothers and sisters to the Lord and Lead others and don't do like these did where you just stand back and we watch as people be destroyed as hope uh brother Matt's still here he just is he still back there pray for one another no matter what situation that someone else is in enter into their suffering with them and pray for them be a friend be a brother not like Esau and Jacob were but be a brother like the Lord is to us and how much he loves us and he's always there for us we need to be like that for each other this book of Obadiah expressly condemns being aloof and not standing for each other so always do it brother and sisters always stand for your your your family your friends friends and those that are in need and I promise you that the Lord will bless you for it remember our lord Jesus said when the two came before him one thought he was going to heaven and he was going to hell the other one Jesus gave him compliments and and said enter into the kingdom and he said when I was in prison you visited me when I was in need you helped me when I when there there was many things and and and the man said when were you in prison and I helped you when were you hungry and I gave you food when did I do these things and he says in so much as you've done it unto these the least of these you did it to me and I believe that that is the big lesson Out of This Book of Obadiah is never stand back and let something let let someone be hurt and then never take advantage of someone's Misfortune amen let's all stand brother Daniel I'm going to pull on you to have you come and close in prayer if you would my friend [Music] yes this poor man cry and the Lord heard me and save me from my enemies the Son of God surrounds his sa he will deliver them he will deliver [Music] Jesus thank you for your word your Living Word uh we pray that you would help us to live out your word for your honor For Your Glory God we pray for your courage we pray for your strength uh we pray for your presence God in our lives your constant presence your constant faithfulness and we pray that we keep our focus on you and whatever trials and challenges we face um this week and throughout the coming days God we pray for your reminder of your Everlasting faithfulness God we pray these things in jesus' name amen [Music] amen oh magnify the Lord
