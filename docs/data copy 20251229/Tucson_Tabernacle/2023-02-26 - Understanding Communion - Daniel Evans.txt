subject of communion trying to if other man maybe lay a foundation for the people over the next week that they could prepare for what's coming up next weekend Lord I pray that your anointing would be here the peace would be here father that you would be glorified in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord God bless you all you can take your seats [Music] going to um I'm not going to start off with the scripture I wanted to um welcome visitors brother beautiful song I was just brother will right wow just really nice really a blessing Hunter it's good to see you my friend we go me and Hunter and his dad we go way back good just old friends you know they can never replace old friends Hunter thank the Lord for you and your family and I think I don't know there's many people on Earth that I know that's outside of family no longer than your dad God bless you it's good to have you I think that's to all the visitors we have I um I wanted to especially say I really appreciated also Angela's song I appreciate all the specials our sister there they're just saying sister you're back looking you looks like you're feeling a lot better am I right when you came up to sing God God bless you she came up for prayer this morning I could tell she was in a lot of pain thank the Lord he's good to us sister Angela's her song is I will make this trial a blessing and that's how it is friends when we go through all these trials when these things are hard and sometimes we ask the Lord Lord why do I go through this why do things get so hard but he has a long-term plan and this long-term plan isn't for us to be a bunch of sissified Christians he wants men and women of God he wants us to be strong and only the only way to get strong is to work those muscles and that's what the Lord does he he allows us to go through these hard times to work those muscles for in the future maybe we can help somebody else not only can we get through the harder times in the future because it builds our character but maybe also we can help other people with our own experiences and the Lord Jesus he went through the hardest of it and he is our example as as I'll read and talk about this morning God's greatest desire I believe and I know I can prove it in the scriptures God's greatest desire is to have fellowship with his people to have communion with his people we started out in the Garden of Eden he built this place for his son and his daughter to live in and they fell through sin we know the the sin that that they committed so they came out of the garden and then they had children and they started to multiply on the Earth they had two sons Cain and Abel and both of these boys they grew up and they made sacrifices to the Lord and Abel made a very strange sacrifice he took a lamb from his flock of sheep and he killed the Lamb on the altar as a sacrifice to the Lord Abel on the other hand he didn't like maybe the way that that looked it didn't quite fit the way that he thought it should be so Abel built he built an altar and he built put flowers like this on it and and they put fruit on there he said surely the Lord will like this sacrifice better than that of my brother and God he looked down upon these these two young men and he accepted that of Abel and he rejected Cain's sacrifice and it upset Cain Cain didn't he didn't understand why Lord that is that's that's gross that's not the way that we should do things I think that we should do it and have it a big beautiful altar this makes more sense in my mind but God said no he said no Cain and it looks like in the scripture that God wanted fellowship with Cain he wanted him to fall into line God is love as the Bible says so this this great Eternal being looked down and he's he said no if you would just do it like your brother does it then that would be acceptable to me and he if Cain would have understand if Cain would have prayed about the matter and Cain would have known the way that God was teaching he would have known that if he would have accepted fruit and flowers and all of this it would have messed up the whole salvation plan of God it wouldn't have worked way down thousands of years down the road the sacrifice that was given late later on it wouldn't have worked if that that that offering of flowers and fruit on the altar would have been acceptable to God but God he understood he saw the long-term pictures sometimes we just see the short term picture like sister Angela like your song it's the these trials that we have now if we would just surrender to God and commune with God and have patience with God then we in the future might understand things a little bit better but Cain didn't it upset Cain Cain was offended that his brother's sacrifice was accepted and his wasn't so much so that he was visually he was upset temper came out and came and Cain lost his temper hated his brother and killed his brother because of this just because of his offering was not accepted but as I said if he would have understood that God's plan did not allow for fruit in that to be an offering it had to be a blood sacrifice or it wouldn't have worked four thousand years down the road when Jesus went to the cross that was the blood sacrifice and this this offering that Abel made was a representation of something that would come much later my subject tonight is is teaching on communion so that we can prepare ourselves this week for what's coming next weekend and I want to answer hopefully some of the questions that may be on your hearts and if you have more questions as I said this morning feel free to email me or or ask me this week because this is this is a very very important subject that we're talking about so much so as I will get to later that Jesus says if you don't do this you have no part with me but if you do it unworthily you're guilty of the damnation you are guilty of the blood of Christ the stakes are high on either side and sorry friends you you got to choose one side or the other on this one you can't just walk down the middle of the way you can't ride the fence you got to get on one side if you're going to do it or if you're not going to do it so Kane he he killed his brother and and God was was going through and let's let's read Genesis chapter 4 and we'll see yeah we'll start with verse start with verse three and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel also brought up the first things of his flock and the fact thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth and his countenance fell he was upset and was written all over his face of what of of why he didn't why God would not accept this offering as I said let's skip down to verse 14. so so God goes and he's walking through and and God somehow hears the blood of Abel after Cain had murdered his brother this Blood of Abel was crying out to God and God goes to Cain and he casts him out of this place and he sets a mark on him there is the first mark of the beast and we hear so much about the mark well it's right here in Genesis chapter four that's the very first time we see the mark of the beast in Cain God tells Cain he says he says you're going to leave and then Cain responds that my punishment is greater than I can bear behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the Earth and from thy face shall I be hid that was the worst of all of it that Cain has to leave and now he is separated from God there is no more communion between this young man and God because that he was too stubborn he was too arrogant to accept God's way which is a blood sacrifice and he says this he says and I shall be he says behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the Earth and from thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me and even Kane's unbelief and his in his violence and hatred and everything the worst thing that happened with Cain was that he knew that now he was out of communion with God and the reason being is because he just did not line up with what God wanted so we go down through time and we see finally we go 4 000 years of sacrificing in the temple and and and up on the mountains and and it's everything from Bulls to to to goats to Lambs to turtle doves and all of these sacrifices down Through the Ages it all points to one blood sacrifice and that is at the cross the Lamb of God and the Lamb of God he has his disciples there and and he's ministering to a mixed group in John chapter 6. we'll start with with verse 51. and he makes a strange statement laying the foundation here for the communion ordinances that we will be taking Jesus said I am the living bread which came from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us give us his flesh to eat very if you think about it naturally speaking what a disgusting thing to say and that's in their natural thinking like Cain had they could not understand that this was the blood sacrifice then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you now he's jabbing him a little bit further and right here is the important importance of communion if you don't do this then you have no life in you look at the gravity of the situation whosoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up in the last day Jesus goes a step further and it says if you do this you'll have eternal life and I'll raise you up in the resurrection you have to be so much a part of me I love this part you have to be so much a part of me that you have to take part of me into your own body symbolically speaking we we see the bread we see the communion and spiritually speaking we see brother Wilson the Holy Spirit coming into our bodies look at look at what this communion represents that Jesus is talking about he's even talking about the very spirit and he says this he says for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me wow this is the bread which came down from heaven they're automatically thinking oh Moses in the wilderness the man that came down and laid down on the ground and we were able to pick it up every day this is the bread that came down from heaven not as your father's did he manna no he's that's not it that's not what you're thinking not as your fathers did eat Manna and are dead but he that eateth of this bread shall live forever the beautiful story of communion and the Flesh and the blood of the sacrifice of God the the sacrificial lamb Jesus wanting to commune with his children so now time is going on Jesus's Ministry his Earthly ministry as a Young Man the three years is coming to a close and Jesus it's the last few days of his Earthly life and he's God his disciples together in in this room he had already come into Jerusalem a triumphant King coming through on on the donkey and they were singing Hosanna and and he comes in and the week goes by and then the pressures building on Jesus and he has his disciples around them he brings them together and they're having their last supper and it just so happened that it was also the Passover it was around that time also so it's it's just beautiful how everything lined up with the Passover celebration Matthew chapter 26. verse 26. and here we're going to see the bread and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body I wonder if they remembered that sermon from a little while ago I wonder if if they understood if they remembered what he said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and he gave thanks and he gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is Shed from many for the remission of sins but I say unto you I will not drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom and when they had sung A Hymn they went out into the Mount of Olives so that is that's the Book of Matthew it talks about Jesus breaking the bread and giving it out to his disciples before that faith faithful night as he would go down the Garden of Gethsemane now the same story in John 13. we'll start with verse 1. now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end Hallelujah is right by Jonathan amen how beautiful is the love of Jesus he loves his people all the way to the end and in this case it was his own end that he was facing and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas's carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God the Lord Jesus had the revelation of where he came from and where he was going every Christian that has his Spirit we know where we came from and we know where we are going we may not know Sister Angela's the song goes we may not know the path that lies directly before us but we know the end of the path or was I verse 4. he rises up from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself wrapped it around me and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded you see exactly how we do feet washing it's right here we have a basin full of water we have a towel and we kneel down then cometh heed of Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord dust thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know hereafter I guess that answered my question earlier maybe they didn't know what was going on Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Thou shalt never wash my feet and Jesus answered if I wash thee not thou has no part with me look at the importance of feet washing and how many churches in the Christian world today practice feet washing that's a serious thing it's you know they don't because well we don't have to do that anymore or it's it's it's uncomfortable doing that but if you don't then you have no part with me is what our lord said Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus Jesus saith unto him he that is washed washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should be betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean and after the and after he had washed their feet and had taken His Garment and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if then if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye ought also ought to wash one another's feet here right here we have the Commandment of feet washing unequivocal absolute he said to do it imagine how uncomfortable this was for Jesus knowing what the rest of the day the rest of the evening held for him kneeling down and washing his disciples feet knowing in his mind that there Judas why he left and who's coming to get me and knowing that I am going to be stretched out on the cross tomorrow and yet he did this for his disciples he explained to them how important was was this to him that he would explain to them this is what you need to do in the future he says this for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done unto you he gave us an example of healing and we all believe that he gave us an example of Salvation we all believe that he gave us an example of Mercy we all believe that and he gave us an example of feet washing and we should all believe that also verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither is neither he that is sent greater than him that's than he that sent him if ye know these things happy are ye if you do them we're all happy when we understand what communion and feet washing the ordinances are about so we've seen that that Jesus gave the prophecy here of of eating my flesh and drinking my blood we see that he has his disciples there and he he serves them bread and he washes their feet and and he tells them to do this again then Jesus and his disciples he said he says let's go so they're sitting there they all they all get up they walk down the side of the mountain into the Kidron Valley they they and as they're going down he's teaching them and he's and they get down to the bottom and he says okay let's stand let's pray that we're all together and then he he asked the Lord Lord may they be one As We Are One I've preached about this many times it's one of the most special things in the whole Bible to me is when Jesus said Lord my father may my disciples may my people be so fitly joined together that they may be as close as you and I are may they have such communion among themselves may they be so close that they are as close as the father and of the son Lord may they be one and may the world know that I am your Messiah by their love one for another that there's Jesus and there's his last prayer that he prays over his disciples and he's talking about how they should commune with one another they should love one another right after we see the communion how important are these ordinances that we are going to take next week how we should be prepared for these things this is it's vital so much so that the last thing he does with his disciples they eat this communion their feet wash they go down and then he prays Lord may they be one may they be together then we see in the book of Acts we see that it's probably it looks like brother Wilson you're a scholar it looks to me like they took the the communion they took the the ordinances every time they came together they broke bread it seems like that it was so important that they had to be so ready to take this every time they had they came together first Corinthians chapter 11. very familiar scripture wonderful scripture with the communion says this let's start with verse 20. sorry brother Kevin but if I messed you up on my scriptures verse 20. when you come together therefore in one place this is not to eat the Lord's Supper for in eating everyone taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and the other is drunk and he's saying that that some people get there earlier some people want their food quick you know the others might be slow this is this is what you do at home he's like this is not this church is not a place to eat a meal when we're coming in here this isn't this isn't to to eat burgers and fries this is something that is meant for something else what have you not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye the Church of God and shame them that have not what shall I say to you shall I Praise You In This I praise you not for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread now Paul is moving into here are the ordinances and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you and this do and do this and this do in remembrance of me again the Apostle is teaching that Christ's body was broken for us that's why we see when you see the bread being passed and you see the plate you see the the the bread that's in there it's broken it's not a wafer you know that's that's like perfectly formed it's not it's broken pieces of bread it's very important that part of it is because it shows that Jesus I know his bones were broken but his body was broken he was hurt very very badly and and it and it we have this plate of bread that's that's broken and it's torn up and it represents Jesus if we have if we have something that is perfectly formed like round that that again like cane he's like you messed it all up Kane it's this this these this sacrifice it's not flowers and fruit it's blood and it's the same thing how they mess up the ordinances of God this needs to be broken or it's not it doesn't make sense if this represents his body it is a broken body are you with me it's it's it's important these little things if we miss these little things then we we can mess up the whole Plan of Salvation brother Nicholas it it messes it all up it's good to see you my friend Isaiah chapter 53 let's let's shift gears right here and talk about the Lord's broken body it's a familiar scripture but I think it would be good if we read it again Isaiah 53 let's start with verse 1. who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him his prophesying of the Messiah for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as the root out of a dry ground he hath no form or comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed a broken body broken bread in the plate Jesus said eat my flesh drink my blood it has to be broken all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all later in Christ our iniquity he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked he was killed on the cross with sinners and with the rich in his death he was put in the grave by the donation of a rich man because he had done no violence neither was there any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteousness my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore I will divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors on the cross with the two others and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgression transgressors there is that broken body that will pass before us next weekend that is what's coming that is what that represents it should be a solemn fearful time when that bread passes by and that wine that represents his blood comes before us back to First Corinthians 11 please and after the same manner also he took the cup and we had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye is often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup you do know the Lord's death till he come I've heard people say brother Aaron and I was just discussing it in the back I've heard people say that we don't need to take communion anymore this shows that we need to observe these ordinances until he returns wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord that is why I am preaching this with a weak to go before the communion service I want to make sure all of us are taking this in reverence all of us have some time to make things right all of us have time to pray about this I want to take this seriously because you see here this is a serious thing if you believe this word if this book means something this is a serious serious time but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of that cup friends I think communion should be taken often not maybe put off too long because it does make us examine ourselves it makes us check up I know even in my life in growing up if I knew that there was a communion service coming up I thought I better straighten up I'd better I'd better you know I better stop doing this or stop doing this that and and maybe get on my knees and say Lord I'm sorry Lord wipe this Sin from me I'm a sinner I messed up but I want to be right when I walk up there to that Kate that table for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink his damnation to himself for not Discerning the Lord's body we see we heard it about feet washing the Lord Jesus said now we're hearing about the bread the Amplified version of that scripture another translation says this anyone who eats and drinks without solemn reverence and heartfelt gratitude for the sacrifice of Christ eats and drinks judgment on himself if he does not recognize the body of Christ verse 30. for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep again that same translation the Amplified version of the Bible which which attempts to clarify some things it has inserts in there trying to lay the foundation the Amplified version says this that the careless and worthy participation is the reason why many of you are weak and sick and a number of you sleep in death basically Paul is telling us here that to take these things seriously your life or the life of others might be on the line when people come through by the LIE when we lay our hands on them to pray for them it's their life on the line now and all of us when you sisters when you when you come to The Altar and you pray with each other think of what that person's praying for and think about what's on the line it may be a sick loved one that could be lost in death who knows what it is but it's serious that we have to be ready for these things if I'm gonna lay my hands on someone these unworthy hands I wanted them to be as good as they can I want to I want to make sure I'm doing everything that I can to represent our Lord when we are praying for each other like I was ministering on this morning that we need to pray for one another but then we have an obligation we have an obligation to be living a life that's above reproach so that we are able to pray for them so if we're praying for someone that sin isn't coming into our minds as we're trying to pray as I always say it's not about me it's about the person I'm praying for so often we get stuck it's about me it's about me and I do this and I do that well what about someone else what about the person that you are laying your hands on for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged if we recognize our shortcomings and we correct our bad behavior then we won't be judged but then verse number 32 but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world when we fall short and we will when we fall short we are disciplined by our lord Jesus amen we're disciplined by our lord Jesus so that we will not be condemned to Eternal punishment along with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another again this is talking about the Lord's Supper it's not talking about having dinner together it's talking about taking of these ordinances and when we are tearing one for another also there there some of the things in the communion service there may be people that need to take communion that need to partake in these ordinances but are not able to come to the service they're not able to get here do anything that you can to get here but if if there is some reason that someone can't come then Brothers we need to make sure that we go to those people and bring these ordinances to the folks that cannot come May that maybe they're sick in a hospital bed or they're not able to come we need to make sure that we make a way so that they can take the communion verse 34. and if that is the case before I go before I go on to the next one if that is the case make sure you contact one of us that we can arrange for this to happen next weekend If any man hunger let him eat at home if you come not together unto that if you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come again he's talking about taking the communion having the ordinances in this sanctuary and then he says the rest will I set in order when I come he's I assume that brother Paul is talking about you have some other problems and when I get there I'll take care of those too but make sure you're doing this this is absolutely vital so one of the questions that so often comes up is who can take communion if we all look at ourselves and this is something this is a problem that I had when I was when I was Hunter's age and Daniel's age I I just didn't feel there was there was things in my life that I didn't feel worthy to take the communion as I said we can't ride the fence either I'm lost or I'm not so we can't ride that fence so if there's some sin in our lives what are you gonna do and as a young man it always troubled me that there's there's these problems I keep I keep messing up I keep doing this wrong I keep doing that wrong and and finally I believe that the Lord revealed it to me that there is a repentance now in me that was never there before all have sinned and come short of the glory of God we all do things wrong every day even sister surely does but we do we all do things wrong every day a saint of God does things wrong and a vile sinner does things wrong and we need the blood of Jesus Christ so as as we're going through and the enemy comes in and he will and he tries to tell you no don't take communion you can say well I'm doing everything that I can I sin I messed up I repented I I've Lord I felt bad for doing it and I've done everything that I can to make it right I've prayed and and I've asked you for forgiveness now if I have faith in the blood of Jesus Christ I am forgiven and I can stand up here at this platform and I can take that bread and that wine and I can do it with confidence because I know if I don't do it then I have no part with him and with all my sins and everything that's about me I want to have a part with our lord Jesus and what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to inform everyone about these so we can prepare as I said during the week so that question as I've said that question is so common is who can take communion and I was sharing with uh I think his brother Aaron earlier this evening that one of the questions was can I take communion at home with my family with my wife and the question is a bad question it's a bad question because usually the answer is because I don't want to take communion with them no the answer is no friends you cannot take communion at home the whole thing about communion is coming together and if you if you have if your church is split and you're mad at somebody or whatever then you better get right before you come before this stage here and take that bread that's the whole reason for it if you're trying to stay home and take it at home you've missed the whole point of communion the communion is so that they will be together and I I quoted the Lord's prayer this morning Lord forgive me in my trespasses as I forgive those who trespass against me I want to stand here and I want to take this bread I want to be part of that broken body and if I can't do that with these people it's not these people that are wrong I don't care if they're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian message whatever it is if you can't take communion with a Christian what's wrong with you what's wrong with me if I can't do it and that is the question that came on so often and the answer is get down to church and fellowship with those people I don't care if you don't agree on the third pole or the seven Thunders or whatever it is this is about Christ this is about Jesus this is about his broken body his blood that blood sacrifice that's what it's about let me read a couple quotes here from Brother Branham now one thing in some in in these questions sometimes the only place that we have to go it's not articulated clear in the Bible many things aren't so we see that there is something that we look to brother Branham for guidance on these things and that's where we can come together it's like well he said this I can't find it here but we can agree on this and it brings Unity now all that wants to stay this is Brother Brandon's addressing here who can take communion now all that wants to stay for communion we'd be glad to have you in this time of Fellowship now you have you have First Corinthians I believe the 11th chapter there which I just read I'll have you read it right now then brother Neville if you will but it never reads it that doesn't need any explaining it's just it's just this if we eat and drink unworthily we eat and drink damnation to our own self not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are sick many are weekly and sick among you and many are dead when we come to take communion every Christian should take communion every Christian should take communion it's your duty it's a showdown see Jesus said if you don't take it you have no part with me see but he that eateth and drinking unworthily eats and drinks damnation to himself that is if you're still out with the world and doing things of the world and people see you taking communion you're doing wrong we're only bringing a disgrace you're only bringing a disgrace to you and it'll only harm you it isn't that it'll harm God it'll harm you and so a person should examine themselves and before we approach the sacred moment you ask God to search my life and if I've done anything that's not right forgive me for it that's what this week is for I don't mean to do it I'll make it right if he'll reveal it to me and I'll ask the same thing for you said when you come together Terry one for another let's wait on one another and pray one for another we want to take this communion and if and if we don't do it we have no part with him that's what he said for or Saint John the sixth chapter now let's pray you pray for me silently why I pray uh then brother bran Whispers I pray that the holy spirit of God I pray that you'll forgive us for all of our trespasses oh Lord hear our prayer this is our prayer of forgiveness Lord we pray forgiveness we pray for Mercy forgive us Lord as it is written in thy word forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen I did not know that that was at the end of that quote and I I put that on there um and I've preached on that this morning I didn't know it was just till I read it in the next quote now we are having coming to the communion table and now yet there's some that doesn't take communion and maybe you just take it in their own churches but we'd be happy tonight if you could would want to fellowship with us around these things shows that we can bring others in this is not a closed communion we never draw any lines of who just as long as you're walking worthy of the Gospel that that you're listening to and confessing to be part of it you know you're part of this gospel you are written Epistles of what we're talking about and as long as we do something that's reproachful then we are an indentment to what we are listening to see we must live what we believe and live it in such a way that it will never reproach but reflect Jesus in all things that we do and say that's that's I'm sorry I lost my place where are we at I love him for and now tonight we're going to read no that's not the right quote well I'll I'll start with what I have in um now it's the same quote that I was just reading if you live a life that proves what you are you want to search your heart well let me be sure to mention on this that the scripture reads here that if we take it unworthily now we know that we are not worthy in ourselves none of us are but that we are not trusting in our own worthiness we're trusting in Him who has we're trusting in his worthiness that we have died to our own thinking and just think his thoughts and live to everything that we believe he commands us to do and look back and see that we are living and look over look our life over and we're doing things that not that's not worthy of the Gospel then we shouldn't take the communion but if we're doing the things that we think that our lives could be read of all men that if anybody could not point a finger and say I seen this man in a bar room the other day I heard this man stand and tell filthy jokes this woman doing wrong then if you know that that's the Holy Spirit pointing to you then don't take communion but if you feel that you're living that you look back and see that all your sins are confessed and under the blood then you're supposed to take it and you're part of it and we see as I said you can't ride the fence on this one you either take it or you don't take it if you take it unworthily you're guilty if you don't take it you're guilty there is only one way to do it and that is make things right that is live according to this gospel as as we approach this day as far as the wine the kind of wine that we use I know that there's a lot of kind of dogmas not bad dogmas but there's there's a lot of things that we do in brother brahm's message and um my brother Adam made the wine for the Branham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville and he was very very careful he was very sterile in everything that he did and and everything was done just perfectly so that this wine wouldn't make people sick it wouldn't it wouldn't be made wrong that it would be made in the right way and then it was bottled for um for the Bram Tabernacle um but because we don't want to drink spoiled wine we don't want to drink wine that's turned to vinegar so now for now we will be using the store-bought wine this this weekend which is most what most churches do that store-bought wine the brand that again this is it doesn't have to be this way but the brand that brother Branham used was um a sweet wine called Mogan David and it's it's a kosher wine and I found a couple quotes where brother Branham said that he used a kosher wine kosher meaning I assume that it's it's overseen by uh some Jewish traditions so this weekend we will be using the same now we may change that in the future but this weekend we'll be using the traditional approach which is using the the kosher wine the the Mogan David and one thing I have not been able to find in the scriptures or in brother Brown's message is that who as far as baptism who can take communion now I've heard many many times people have told me that well you can't take communion unless you've been baptized I can't find it and brother Brown's message and I can't find it in the scripture but the question would come up why do you want to take communion if you haven't been baptized when you want to get baptized if you feel that you want to partake in the body of Christ then I would highly recommend being baptized because that's what he's said to do um and the feet washing again in my opinion the the feet washing and then the question may be well how about feet washing if we haven't been baptized we don't take communion can we do feet washing I would say the same I would say well I can't I don't have a scripture forbidding it or a quote but don't you think that you'd want to get baptized first before you do any of these things and if uh if the if the sisters come if the musicians come brother and I'll have I'll have you close again use this week in preparation for the communion this Sunday and if you have any this next Sunday if you have any questions for me or for any any of us you can you can write in the email at pastor at brandometabernacle.com you can text me I want to make sure that I'm available to answer these questions and there's many many I I've seen many questions probably the most common questions are about communion who can take it how do we do it one of the ones that I said was was can we take it at home and not with the Believers well I think if you were in Greenland and there was nobody there then maybe yeah probably but that's not a question that affects us here we want to come together and I also want to remind mind everyone if there's someone who is part of this congregation or really someone that just needs it is not able to get out of the hospital or whatever we'll do our best to bring that communion to them bring the ordinances and make it uh as right according to this blessed book as we can let's stand God bless you all I pray that some of the things that I said I pray that they answered your question and they showed you how important this communion is what that wine represents the blood of Christ what those broken pieces of bread represent and how Cain he just didn't want to do it in his stubbornness but Abel had the revelation we have the Revelation according to the Bible and don't take it lightly this is a serious thing is going to happen this this weekend brother Nicholas I'm going to have you close in a in a minute brother and if you could lead us a couple in a couple songs my brother did for our transgressions okay [Music] [Music] our transgression he was broke for our iniquity surely [Music] for our sorrows and by his stripes that first verse on the cross crucify in great sorrow he does The Giver of Life yet my Lord was dismissed and rejected [Music] this Jesus of God glory he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity [Music] show surely [Music] our sorrows and by his stripes we [Music] this afternoon I was listening to questions answers in 64. the second service and a sister wrote to brother Branham and she said I did this and this that was wrong and I made it right with my husband she's he said and I also went back to the person I did that's when it made that right and she says now she asked the question does he need to do this and maybe you could go and listen to this yourself because there's two definite examples and brother bam told her you have done everything right that you needed to do you made it right with your husband you made it right with the other one and you made it right with God so you're free you're clear another one see that he talked with she said don't tell my husband [Music] he said now you're guilty of it still until you make it right that's right I've shared this with you and maybe this will help somebody today and that is We snuck into Old Tucson a group of us Brothers and when communia would come it would come to mind and I would take commune anyway but as guilty as could be because I could not get so they announced communion again and I said I know how to take care of this go back to Old Tucson and tell them I snuck in and pay what I had done for so we did that it shocked the young lady that was receiving tickets she didn't know what it had she handed me another ticket I said no I've already I'm just paying for we went ahead communion that night and it never troubled me again because it was taken care of was it worth it every bit of it so as quick as you can you say I'm sorry amen I didn't mean to do that I place it under the blood it's it's it's it's really a simple thing if you just do what God Said but if you would go back and read it it's just about five minutes longer listen two instances that would show you both sides a second service the evening service of questions answered in 64. and Brother Band says God is allowed these things to happen so you and I would have that opportunity to say that answers that question and I love him for that as our brother Castillo comes up we'll sing that one more he was wound it for our transgression [Music] he was broke for iniquity [Music] stripes we are here God bless you this evening Saints it's good to be here with you I had expressed to uh brother Daniel that I was going to be passing through yesterday and uh kind of caught me by surprise and I wanted to come introduce

conversation with the brother just a little bit before he passed and he was telling me how that Jesus came in 63 and I didn't come so therefore he's come already we don't have to have communion we don't and and that's okay I'll see my brother on the other side I'm not they're not going to divide Heaven into you believed it that way and you believed it this way and I pray that when we get there
