all of our heart this morning we can give him all the glory this morning we can say look what the lord has done in our midst amen amen just sing it again with all your heart now amen and think of what

on in the world in politics and the sickness and all the things going on we have a different report the devil said you couldn't make it the devil said he had it but i had a different report and this morning to look to that report i choose to look away from what the enemy has done and what the enemy has said and my report says that we're going to take a rapture my report says that we're overcomers my report says we can have our children my report says that i'm healed i choose to believe that report this morning amen can we go to him now in prayer before we even start gracious heavenly father lord what an honor it is to gather once again with your people lord to come into this house lord in your presence lord feeling you already moving in this place lord amongst the worship lord i pray now that you will just completely take control of this vessel lord as a human i might say things wrong and as a human there's nothing i could say that would even help these people lord but these are your people lord there are there a portion of that purchase that you bought there at calvary lord and i know that you will come and you will speak to them lord and you will feed them lord i'm asking that you'll shut my mouth lord in every area that you wouldn't want me to speak but lord where you have given me lord unction and things to look at i'm asking that you would take control and break the bread of life this morning lord i believe that what we have this morning is from you and i pray that you'll just help me to get out of the way father and deliver it to your people the way it was delivered to me father we're looking unto you now we're thanking you lord for all you've done we're looking at your report this morning but we're laying aside the negativity we're laying aside the attacks of the enemy recognizing that anything that isn't here to push us over across the river is from the enemy and we lay those things aside now we look under your word we ask that you'll bless it that you'll anoint my mouth and the hearer's ear in jesus name we pray amen amen hallelujah thank you amen it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning i ask that you'll turn in your bibles with me to genesis the 49th chapter amen genesis the 49th chapter when i came out i saw brother josiah sitting over here which means that somewhere sister anna with us hey sister anna god bless you it's wonderful to have you and the children with us and also it did my heart good to hear my friend jason sing while ago that was wonderful god bless you you and your family sister lisa so glad to have y'all with us this morning i pray that you'll be blessed here as we partake in the word genesis 49 and the first verse says and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of jacob and hearken unto israel your father reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou went us up to thy father's bed then defilest thou it he went up to my couch simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitations oh my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honor be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their self-will they dig down a wall curse be their anger for it was fierce in their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee judah is a lion's wilt from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old line who shall rise him up the scepter shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet unto shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be binding his foe unto the vine and his asses colt unto the choice vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the blood of grapes he shall be red with wine and his teeth white with milk zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be before a haven of ships and his brothers shall be undeside on is a car is a strong ass couching down between two burdens and he saw that rest was good in the land that it was pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of israel dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that biteth the horse's heels so that his riders shall fall backward i have waited for thy salvation o lord gad a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the last amen i pray god will add his blessing to the word as you have your seats i want to look briefly at one other scripture matthew 1 and verse 22. it is incomplete in a sense that it goes into the 23rd verse but i'm only going to read this this portion it says now all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying brother branham says the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was god god anointed that flesh which was human flesh if he had went up there as god he'd have never died that kind of death can't kill god but he didn't have to do it but remember he went there with you in him see god had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body see they are one same same word same word spoke of the groom speaks of the bride hallelujah that right there ought to give us something to be excited about this morning i tell you right now before we even get going i'm looking for god to move this morning you know brother jason sang about being in the valley it seemed like the valley all hit all at once this morning woke up with the roof leaking and water coming into my bathroom and i said well we're going to have a good time today in church amen so we're just going to get right into it looking back at matthew 1 verse 22 where we read from it's a phrase right in the middle of the verse here in matthew that strikes me and i've actually preached specifically on that phrase before and it says that it might be fulfilled now what i want to speak to you on this morning is crossing into fulfillment crossing into fulfillment and right there it says that it might be fulfilled it says this phrase in the bible 11 times now there's a lot of different times way more than 11 that we see fulfillment in the scriptures but specifically in the bible 11 times it says that it might be fulfilled and it's always a reference to different events taking place whether it's a king rising up or a specific thing that happened to jesus on the cross or joseph and mary having to go down into egypt that the scripture might be fulfilled that out of egypt i have called my son there's many different examples like this and it's a phrase that says no matter what god's word is going to come to pass no matter what no matter who he has to move no matter what he has to have rise up no matter what valley you have to go through it's all happening that it might be fulfilled now like i said there's many other ones and throughout the bible where we see fulfillment where we're just referenced in this phrase and we're going to look at a few of those scriptures this morning brother branham would say god spoke it it's got to be so thy word is settled in heaven forever it's already said they don't argue about it up there you know we may argue about what it means here and when's this going to happen and how that going but in heaven they don't argue about it he said it it's done it's settled and sometimes we wonder well when will when will win because we are time beings and so we're curious about time god is not a time being he is an eternal being and when he speaks that word is an eternal word it's going to come to pass he said they don't argue about it up there it's already settled we argue about it but in glory it's settled when god says anything it's got to be well isn't that wonderful i believe we could echo the prophet right there well isn't that wonderful because there's a word that says you're healed there's a word that says you're delivered there's a word that says you're gonna have a rapture there's a word that says these things it's already done it's already settled it's already finished in heaven and that's where it matters today we know that that fulfillment brings faith i know we're not to always look at it that way we're supposed to believe even when we don't see anything and as christians as abraham's seed we do but when we do see fulfillment it does elevate our faith to another level brother joe talked about that some in some of his sermons recently when we see the fulfillment of by his stripes we are healed it elevates our faith when we see the fulfillment of not even cancer then it elevates our faith it elevates us to believe for even more yes every one of us as we heard have a measure of faith that was given to us by god but that faith can be increased that faith can elevate and when we see the fulfillment of things it causes that faith to raise up and not only in the sense of things for like your healing or for your personal victory but if we will look at things through faith if we will look at the events going on in the world around us through faith looking at these events through faith in his word will stabilize you as a christian how many christians are up down up down up down up down and you're wondering why is there no stability why are they not stable it's because they're not looking at things through faith so every wave tosses them everything's taken the wrong way everything is offensive oh well this oh up down up down because there's no stabilizers on the ship but we got to begin to look at things through the eyes of faith understanding that god is going to fulfill everything god said he would do so if we look at everything even in the world through the eyes of faith it will stabilize you people tend to get so shook by the things happening in the world they get shook at the evil around them they get shook at what's going on in russia they get shook by the economy we're getting shook by gas prices we get shook by the sodom condition that's all around us but if we view those things through the word it does not and it will not shake you you say yep that's exactly what the word said was going to happen that's exactly how the word said things were going to be i'm looking at it through this is just god fulfilling exactly what god said he was going to do the word foretold it would be this way so many times we want the rapture we want the rapture it's the end time praise the lord end time message and you look at her why is all this happening what's going on i don't know the thing you said you believed for 30 years that's what's going on that's what's happening there's a world getting into an end time condition because god's word will be fulfilled listen the end times whether you're a believer or not the end times aren't going to be rosy for us it's not going to be easy well i didn't think these things were going to befall as long as we're here things are befalling as long as we're living in this world there's things we're affected by the things that go on it's not going to be rosy but i am looking for their fulfillment therefore i can recognize why i can place them in the scripture and recognize lift up your head your redemption draweth nah so instead of getting shook i'm getting a little bit excited i'm recognizing church it can't be long now it can't be long till our loved ones will appear to us it can't be long until we go into a rapture i'm placing them according to fulfillment all this stuff going on what's it mean brother aaron it means we're one step closer what's it mean it means we're going home soon this world has to be in an end time condition and i feel like and i'll speak for myself but most of us probably felt like that we knew how bad it would be and we knew how wicked it would be and every now we look back and we go man i thought it was bad 10 years ago i thought it was bad in the 90s i thought it was bad in the 80s and we thought we knew but i believe we come to a point where we recognize it is a complete open and bottomless pit and even when you think it's going as far as it can go it's still going it's still sliding it's going further and further brother branham says look at all the televisions and things getting these fictitious things in order it'll come a time i predict that people will be completely totally insane check the world will be the bible speaks of such hideous sites as they show in movies today of some prehistoric creatures eggs that's lived in the earth for so many thousands and millions of years hatch and come forth that's just a minor thing to what's going to happen when hell is open and the devil comes out with all of this mysterious things and locusts with hair like women and teeth-like lines while the world will be completely totally insane it's not but just one degree from it now 1965. brother branham was a prophet so i don't want to see i don't want to say that he didn't see how bad it was going to get but i'm just saying reading that quote in 1965 how much worse do you think it is now he said they were just a hair from being totally insane then where do you think right now look we're well beyond 1977 the farthest the prophet of god could see because of the darkness we're well beyond that time how insane do you think the world is now how insane is it when people who stand for life are considered bigots how insane is it that that you people are considered the oddballs in the world how insane do we have to be when you look at the things being argued about in politics it absolutely makes no sense to a sane person but sanity is quickly becoming insanity because you're not like the people who are insane the world has gone completely mad the world is in an insane condition and yet i want to remind you that if the world is sitting in an end time condition if the world has completely lost their mind if the height of the tree of good and evil has reached it it's apex then there has to be another people on the earth today part of the revelation of the bride tree that has also reached its height of people that is also in an income type condition we're not in a condition for atomic bombs but we're in condition to be taken off the earth we're in a condition marching to onward christian soldier we're in a condition following the message of the hour we are also in an end time condition and i'm thankful to say we're in an end time condition we are in a rapture condition we can't look at it through earthly eyes of of of well how can it be that that we're in a rapture condition how can you say that i see this one struggling and i see that one falling away and and this church up here just split and and this one over here is preaching false things and then this preacher he's attacking this preacher you're looking at it through earthly eyes but i say look at it through the eyes of one who said i will have a bride without spot and without wrinkle i don't know how he's gonna do it but i know they don't argue about it in heaven i know they're not fussing about it in heaven because it's been said it's already done i'm just gonna walk in the fulfillment of it i'm just gonna believe it god i don't know how you're going to do it i didn't say it i didn't make the promise he made the promise he's the one that's going to bring it to pass today hallelujah he said it i believe it somebody is going to fulfill it the things that we look at for the future like the rapture these are not characterless events there are events that someone is going to be a part of that story someone is going sometimes we tend to look at it as just an event it is no event without a people it is no story without a character the acts weren't just acts written about nobody it was people doing the works of god it was people letting the holy spirit act through them and they recorded the acts of those people the rapture is gonna be your story you are the characters of the rapture because someone must play the part someone is going to look at the promises through faith and not through the eyes of earthly eyes and look through eyes of doubt abraham looked away from circumstance abraham looked away from the fact that his body was now dead and he looked to the fulfillment we have to begin looking to fulfill him there had been a word given and abraham knew my god will fulfill everything that he said he began to look at everything through the word of god we have to let the word of god become our filter because if you let your mind be your filter your genetics be your filter or your eyes be your filter or what somebody told you be your filter you'll be so twisted up torn up upset but you got to go back to what the word said this is our filter this is what we're looking through this is what we're standing on this is what i have faith in i don't have faith in this church i don't have faith in anything other than the word of god i don't look to a man because man will fail you don't look to me i will fail you but the word of god will never fail you look to the word of god because it will be fulfilled hallelujah [Applause] don't miss god because we view him and view our circumstances through the eyes of flesh because many times god is in things god is working in things and he's working through situations and we fail to recognize it because we're looking at the situation through hurt eyes or we're looking at the situation through scarred eyes or we're looking at the situation through tired eyes i've been through so much and we're looking at these things through eyes of doubt instead of through eyes of faith put everything through the word bring everything back to the word we have to look at things through eyes that say i know god's word will be fulfilled no matter what the situation you are the royal seat of abraham if abraham can look away from circumstance that's what we're going to do because we will be just like that we'll look away we will look to the promise i don't care how long it's been i don't care how long my son's been out there i don't care how long this sickness has battled i know god gave a word i will stand on the word i will look for fulfillment of the word i will fulfill the word it's time that we begin to look at our situations as actual opportunities for for fulfillment this sickness is an opportunity for the scripture to work my child has left but this is an opportunity for me to kill the fatted calf i'm not saying that we look for these situations and that we're welcoming these situations but what we do is we take these situations and we place them properly in the word and we begin to look for the purpose in our situation begin to find the purpose in your trial instead of giving the devil credit for every single thing the devil did and the devil did and the devil did i'm sure joseph thought it was the devil that had him down in egypt but it was god fulfilling his word find the purpose in your trial oh god i don't know why i'm here but i know if i'm here you're going to take care of me you're going to bring me through it your will will be fulfilled in this situation we don't welcome it but we must find a purpose in it and place in this trial we must begin to look for fulfillment not only for fulfillment in the sense that i want to see things fulfilled but i want to fulfill not just i want to see it fulfilled out there just like i just don't want to see a rapture happen i really rather view it from the inside i don't just want to see things fulfilled i want to fulfill the part i'm called to fulfill i want to walk into fulfillment the time has come for the fulfillment of all of god's word oh brother brown says now you know what the story came out this is lengthy but bear with me what was it years had passed but the time had come for that word to be fulfilled when the season roll around don't you worry the crop will be there that's right and brethren if there ever was a time for the next few minutes now i want to talk to you to your heart if there ever was a time that time has come for the word to be fulfilled it's now the time had come in the andaluvian world for god to show his word made true to the andaluvian people he respected noah the time had come in babylon where they'd laughed god to scorn they made fun of the hebrew children they laughed at them told them there was old fogies and everything they had to be modern but they stayed put god respects that staying put and they had laughed at them throw them in jail done everything to them but finally the time come for god to speak and he showed his power he was able to deliver them from the fiery furnace he showed his power when the time come when daniel was thrown into the lines then the time had come for god to move out and to speak and he closed the mouth of the line by sending an angel into the den with daniel jesus just before calvary the time had come when the proclamation must be signed the time had come when mary was coming from a well that day with a pot of water on her head the time had come for the visitation of the savior and a virgin was was to conceive and bear a son the time was there regardless of what the world didn't even believe it was there right in line with their teaching but the time had come and when the time has come it's going to happen amen the angel gabriel met the virgin and told her she'd be overshadowed by the holy ghost and would bring forth a son and he'd be the son of god never had happen in all the world but the time had come when every jewish woman had waited and watched for the time hoping it would be her but the time come when god made his choice god makes choices the time come when john the baptist was born as a forerunner to fulfill the word of god because he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness in isaiah 40 that there there'd be one several hundred years before he come the time come for john to be born and when the time come john arrived on the scene the time had come after jesus death after calvary the time come that he must die for the sins of the world he died just according to the scripture cause everybody believed that lined up with the word when the time come it must be fulfilled the time come for the scriptures to be fulfilled they put him in a grave they put a seal on the grave they garrisoned a bunch of soldiers a century a hundred men armed around there to be sure that nothing would take place i tell you the devil can put what he wants around you he can put what he wants around your children he can put what he wants around your health but when the time comes there ain't nothing going to stop him i'm telling you the time has come for fulfillment the time has come for healing the time has come for a rapture the time has come that we begin to fulfill all that we are called to fulfill he says for three days he laid there friday saturday sunday but on sunday morning the first easter no matter how many armies was there how well they was garrison the time had come for the word of god to be fulfilled oh i'll not suffer my holy one to see corruption neither will i leave his soul in hell the time had come i don't care what takes place it's going to happen anyhow the time had come and an angel come from heaven the men fell like dead men the grave opened christ walked out victorious over death hell in the grave the time had come and the word that speaks of the groom speaks also of the bride i say the time has come for us to begin to fulfill the things that we are called to fulfill in this last day the time has come and when the time comes there's nothing that the enemy can do about it the time has come for the fulfillment of all things the time has come for the prodigals to return the time has come for us to go in and to possess the land the time has come for a body change the time has come for the dead in christ to rise the time has come for everything to be fulfilled i want to go back to the very beginning now in genesis 3. and we're focusing for a while here on it will all be fulfilled crossing into fulfillment verse 3 it says but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die notice here that the attack is that one word could possibly fail the attack is that it is possible for one word to fail because if one word can fail then what about this word and that one i've never been able to understand that one and if that one could fail then what about this one and then if that one can fail then what about this and if i want to point out where the profit was wrong here then what about here and because of here well maybe i need to have this discussion with somebody no you need to remember that the word of god is true you need to remember that the prophet was a vindicated prophet by almighty god and he brought a message to take you in a rapture that's what you need to remember if one word can contradict another then what about this one and what about this and then it all begins to unravel and then you have no place to stand you have no firm foundation and next thing you know you step off into a bottomless pit and there's nothing to stop you because when you get to the place that you can't believe in one word or this where the next thing it leads you to is there is no god there is nothing and now you're in the bottomless pit over and over and over and tumbling and you have no place of rest but the prophet would say to the believer if god said it that settles it there's your resting place if god said it that settles it there is your resting place i'll tell you today evening like tabernacle that you can hang your soul on every single word that god has spoken it will be fulfilled when the time has come i believe that we are walking in the season of fulfillment and the time has come for the fulfillment of these things and god's not going to let any of it fall he says in jeremiah 1 12 then said the lord unto me thou has well seen for i will hasten my word to perform it i will do what i said i was going to do we're going to take just a few examples now as we slow down and go through these scriptures to drive this point home ezra 1 1 and i'm going to read just going to be brief and i'll be moving quickly now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia matthew 2 15 and was there until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken to the lord by the prophet saying out of egypt have i called my son matthew 2 23 and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene matthew 8 16 when they even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah as the prophet saying himself took our affirmatives and bear our sickness micah 5 2 but thou bethlehem ephrata thou thou thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of these shall he come forth unto thee that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from old from everlasting then you take that over to luke two and one now here's a scripture you can put that back up micah 5 and 2 and it says out of bethlehem though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of these shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel and now mary's getting close to having this child and yet they're in nazareth and if you're reviewing this from the outside going yeah how they gonna fulfill this one i mean they got no reason to go to bed that's a long journey that is a long journey and she's not gonna be happy about it this isn't gonna be any fun and yet then you look over to luke two and one and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed skip to verse three and all went to be taxed every one unto his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child the taxation of an entire nation was to fulfill a scripture from the old testament brother branham would say i bet all those priests were griping and fussing and caesar this and said can you believe these taxes again sounds like my living room can you believe these gas prices and can you believe this and can you believe that and and they're taking this federal tax and they're taking taxes to fix the roads and they sure ain't fixing the roads then they tax my vehicle to drive on roads to make sure my car is worthy to drive on roads that are unworthy took me 30 minutes but i hit home with some of you i'm telling you and brother brown says not knowing all along that every one of those things was just to fulfill a scripture get your eyes off the circumstances quit worrying about the world falling apart around you it's supposed to fall apart and recognize there's a bride getting ready to leave here there's a scripture that says we're gonna go and it has to get us in an end time condition get us there lord do whatever it takes to get me ready do whatever it takes i want to leave here i don't want to be comfortable here i'm tired of here and if it takes my axle getting knocked out on i-20 whatever i just want to go but please don't let my axle get knocked out not recognizing there was fulfillment happening fulfillment of bethlehem brother brown says another thing we want to notice is just at the very time that he had to raise taxes on the people and in doing that it forced joseph and his wife to be forced back to bethlehem god knows how to do things church don't ever forget that god knows how to do things as i said wednesday night i mess up a lot of stuff every time i get my hands in and think i know how to do something i mess things up but god has never messed up one time he knows what he's doing he knows where your kids are he knows the situation in your home he knows and he knows how to fix it he knows and he's taking care of it he knows and he's already on the scene he knows and he's moving on your behalf god knows this morning and he cares and i'm looking for the fulfillment of what he's promised me psalm 78-2 i will open my mouth in a parable matthew 13 34 all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable spake he not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables psalms 22 18 they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my bestie matthew 27 35 and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots look not one word is going to fall to the ground boy not one word is put in the bible just to take up space not one promise is there that's not going to be fulfilled there's just got to be somebody with the initiative that says i'll cross over and i'll fulfill what the promise said i was supposed to the promise said i was supposed to inherit that the promise said that is where i'm supposed to go i'm not going to stop short i'm not going to stop on this side i'm not going to be okay with one child saved i'm not going to be okay with a partial healing i'm not going to be stopping just at justification there is more promise for me there are promise to be fulfilled and i am going to cross over into fulfillment of the word of god god knows what he's doing i want to remind you today that the circumstances are not in control god is using the circumstances to get you where you need to be and to fulfill the promises that he's already written in the promises that he has given every scripture every word everything spoke about you will come to pass everything spoke about you will come to pass but you got to keep your eye on the promise and get it off the circumstance keep your eyes on the word because somebody is going to fulfill it hold fast that which you have fight for it be willing to stand for it because somebody's going to fulfill it others may stop short others may find a good place to stop but i say i want to fulfill what god called me to fulfill i can't really worry about what other people do look i love this church i love these people but it's not for my experience isn't based off what you do my inheritance isn't based off what you do i have to go get the inheritance i have to press into the land i have to press into the promise the other tribes couldn't help that that reuben and gad stopped short they had to press in they still had a land that they had to possess malachi 4 was sent to turn us back to faith to turn us back to the book of acts back to the works that i do shall you do also and somebody's going to fulfill that some people are just going to find out that god sent a prophet some people are just going to accept a new lifestyle make you no different from the amish but some people are going to return to the faith of the original church they're going to turn back to the original grain somebody is going to go all the way back to the upper room experience and walk through the book of acts and create another book of acts i say it's time to add a chapter i say it's time to write your chapter in the book of acts tell about your healing your deliverance your overcoming your salvation your experience with the holy ghost it's time you write your chapter in the book of acts somebody's going to overcome laodicea somebody is going to take the land of the holy ghost might as well be us you've been fighting and you've been journeying why stop short you've gone through all you've gone through why stop short press in this morning press over this morning brother branham says now we're going to speak just a few moments on the authority of god's word every word of god is a written sworn authority it's the absolute right of the believer to accept this as the infallible truth because it's god's word heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away saith the lord it must be fulfilled in its season we are in the season for fulfillment now going back to where we were wednesday god had promised abraham this land and he had promised that foretold the children of israel end up in egypt or in a strange land and served them for 400 years and then they would be delivered and then they would come out with great substance and here we are god has fulfilled his word that he told abraham about his seed dwelling in a strange land for 400 years there in genesis 15 13. and he had fulfilled his word about the nation that would enslave them and then them being judged there in genesis 15 and 14. it's also in this verse in genesis 15 14 where god declares to abraham that they're going to come out with great substance and this had also been repeated to moses in exodus 3 if you look at exodus 3 and 21 it says and i will give this people favor in the sight of the egyptians and it shall come to pass that when you go you shall not go empty i gotta admit you know we all look at things sometimes and we're like how look i know i've been your slave for 400 years but can i have all your gold please okay how about some silver and they just said yeah here take it is it come on in you go through the china cabinet you know i was saving this for my son's college but he don't need it there you go just go ahead it never really made sense to me now i understand that the way it happened is because he said i will give this people favor but i'm still trying to envision it like what was their attitude i thought you'd never ask i wanted to give it to you last week but you didn't come by so i just held on to it yeah fella down there he's super rich i'd go knock on his door i just i've always looked at it and i'm not real smart so that's kind of what i came up with was that that i just told you and sometimes we look at things and we wonder how lord this this would fall under the category of how to me if you're standing there on the outside and you're observing or you're actually there as one of the slaves and moses tells you okay and just go i want all right you you got that neighborhood go knock on their doors ask for their goal that's where my task master lives yeah go there first how lord how is this going to work you've been told your whole life you're nothing you've had everything stripped from you by these people they've been taken and they've been taken and they've been beaten you and you've been told you're worthless you've been told you can't leave you've been told you'll never possess the promise you might look at this and go slaves and great substance don't exactly go hand in hand but never forget how quickly circumstances can change in the presence of god never forget how quick he can turn it only takes one moment in his presence one moment in the presence of god you can be sitting there as centered and then you can be filled with the baptism of the holy ghost one moment can change everything you walk in here sick you can walk out of here well walk in here bound walk out of here free and you might look at it and go how lord i know that guy i know how did that happen one moment in his presence is all it takes oh but my situation's bad this is bad this is bad i don't know how i'm going to pay my bills let me remind you one day ruth was gleaning in the field trying to survive and the next day she owned the field one day she was a poor beggar and the next day she owned it all it only takes a moment in the king's presence it only takes a moment never forget how quickly god can work one moment can change everything one moment old dad was sitting on the porch crying because his son was gone the next moment he's running down that road to greet his son one moment's difference one moment my child left the next moment my child's come home it only takes one moment it only takes a moment in his presence it only takes one moment and everything he's robbed from you he's going to have to give back your help he's got to give it back take it back this morning fight for it this morning it may not come easy but he's got to give it back he says oh you've done this sin you've struggled with pornography you've been in drugs you've been backslidden you've done this you've done that you're my slave you can never be free you can never be rich in peace you can never be rich in joy you can't have your children back you can never have overcoming power and he takes and he takes and he takes just like the slaves they were beaten and took from beaten and took from but you just keep plaguing him you just keep pouring out the plagues you just keep standing and refusing to bow you just keep calling on the name of the lord and one of these days he's going to say i've had enough take your joy take your peace take your children take your rapture and just get out i've had enough in one moment's time get out of my kingdom you are keeping satan from enjoying his kingdom he's sick of you he's tired of you he tells you you're gonna break you're gonna break no sir i'm gonna leave he's gonna get so tired of you he's gonna say take it just take it and go hallelujah take it and go oh church i'm ready to go there's a pool from up there and it's stronger than the pool from below i'm ready to go you know some of the writers looking look into the psalms and they say that the egyptians actually gladly gave them all their riches as long as they promised that they would leave and take the plagues with them here's your joy here's your peace here's everything i took but just go and take some people down and even like tabernacle with you take them people with you just get out i'm sick of the plagues i'm sick of the frogs i'm sick of you casting out my devils i'm sick of the healing i'm sick of you getting the holy ghost when your feet hit the floor in the morning i don't even know what to do with you just take it if you promise to go i'll go i'll have my joy i'll have my peace and i will go hallelujah it says in psalms 105 37 and he brought them forth with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes verse 38 egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them fell upon them now look we know it was god that had done everything but look how god works the fear of them now we know our god is one god and they weren't just afraid of the people they were them is the people and their god he was afraid of a people and their god a people that know their god and will do exploits he is afraid of a people who know their god he's going to give it back and if for some reason satan comes to you and says you really have no legal right to your freedom you have no rights to the joy you have no rights to the peace you still got some reaping to do he want to hold that over your head you owe me give all that stuff back give me a joy back you still owe me you're not really free you still see pharaoh had that epiphany oh they still owe me they took all the gold and silver and my free labor and they they took from me and took me it's funny how quick the devil forgets what he took from you and it took from me they're gonna give it all back church my debt's been paid i don't know the devil one thing i don't know him nothing it's all been forgotten it's all been washed away by the blood of the lamb i don't owe him a thing if anything he owes me he owes me for lost time he owes me wages for lost time he owes me because he held me a slave he owes me because he's still trying to hold some things back from me he's still trying to hold some promises back from him but he can't have him he says you owe me this you owe me the all devil you owe me you still got some things i'm coming for you still you think i've left you alone you think i'm done plaguing you can't do it because we ain't left yet i still got some plagues to pour out on your head i still got some young people that have come to see the holy ghost i still got some devils gonna be cast out i still got some things that's gonna be poured out on you we ain't done yet you owe me 4th century bc there was a group of egyptian representatives who actually appeared in the court of alexander the great this story is awesome demanding that the jews pay restitution for all the egyptian gold and silver they took along with them during the exodus it's funny i thought that didn't happen i thought the exodus wasn't real well according to the court records of alexander the great this court case happened gavia the son of poseisa a simple but wise jew requested the sage's permission to present a defense on behalf of the jews gavia asked the egyptians for evidence that the jews have i'm gonna make up my own word stole and left egypt with the egyptians wealth the egyptians said the crime is clearly recorded in your torah the egyptians gleefully responded it's right there you were a sinner you were lost without hope such were some of you the scripture says liars and adulterers all kind of things it's recorded right there it's in your word he said it's encorted right there in that case kavia said the torah also says that 600 000 jews were unjustly enslaved by the egyptians for many many years so first let us start by calculating how much you owe us whoa glory let's start devil by calculating how much you got that belongs to me my debt's been cleared but there's still some reckoning for you to do there's still a lake of fire for you there's still judgment for you it's time for a reckoning on what you owe me i owe him nothing it's washed away i have a clean slate it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness i owe him nothing [Applause] says they asked for three days to come up with the response and never returned probably a wise decision the egyptians came out i know israelites came out of egypt wealthy they came out blessed and they came out victorious because the scripture had to be fulfilled it was a time for fulfillment every step of the way they walked in fulfillment they're going on this journey and it's fulfillment after fulfillment and even though they come to a great stumbling there at kadesh that didn't stop the word from being fulfilled god just had to use a different generation still the seed of abraham and they were still going to possess the land but he had to get somebody else to do it genesis 15 18 says in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt and to the great river the river euphrates this was going to be fulfilled and once again god had a people god had a people that wouldn't go all the way but he said no this word's going to be fulfilled so he put it on someone else to fulfill it what am i telling you we're in a season of fulfillment make sure you're fulfilling what god has called you to fulfill because someone's going to someone is going to rise up the royal seat of abraham moving away from the physical seed for a minute once again god is coming to people that had become enslaved down through the ages down through the church ages they had become enslaved in a catholic system held them bound with creeds and dogmas of men held them by withholding the word from them that was the main thing they did is they just wouldn't let them have the word they withheld it from them but god moved and luther came out and the reformation began and it wasn't a reformation for the sake of reformation it wasn't just let's correct some things it was a beginning of a journey it was the beginning of a journey to return back to the original to return back to how god started the church i know we say it here and you've heard it before but god started the church the way he wanted it and now he wants the church the way he started it he wants it back to how he started brother brown said it comes back to the original grain is that right and his ministry comes from them reformations back to the original word again the word comes to a prophet and he promised it in malachi 4 and to restore the faith of the people back to the original grain what went into the ground there is here the same someone's going to fulfill someone's going to go all the way back to the original there's got to come somebody church brother aaron you keep hammering this you keep him that's what the sermon's about we're going to keep hammering a little bit longer there's got to be somebody that's not going to stop short and they're going to fulfill all that was promised to them a people willing to cross over the river into the original joel 2 25 and i will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed there is going to be a people that's restored back to before the locust restored back to before the canker worm restored back to before the palmer worm and restored back before the nicean council when rome put their hands firmly on it somebody's going to be willing to cross over let's just say it back to pentecost again cross over back to the original pentecost back to the grain again beyond the shuck beyond the reformation because it's only in that place listen it's only in the place of the original only in the place of the grain again that you can be in position to fulfill what god wants fulfilled in this day you can't fulfill the rapture outside of the original you can't fulfill greater than these works shall you do outside of the original you have to cross back over into the original in order to be able to fulfill reuben and gad and the half tribe of manasseh stopped just short of crossing over they stopped just short of fulfilling what they were supposed to fulfill they were supposed to feel the possessing of the promised land they did not fulfill it because they did not cross over okay but today we're living in a time of crossing over we're living in the day of fulfillment listen it didn't matter that gad and reuben didn't cross over the day before because it wasn't crossing day it didn't matter that they didn't cross over day before that because everybody was camped out waiting for the time but when the time came and it was time to possess it was time to fulfill and they didn't move then then somebody else got their inheritance somebody else was granted their portion because instead of 12 tribes inheriting now nine and a half tribes inherited and the sizes of their land was enlarged your portion is going to be inherited somebody's going to take the rapture somebody's going to believe for healing somebody's going to believe for everything in the word and if you don't it's not gonna stop the fulfillment somebody else is just gonna do it somebody else is gonna take your portion on crossing over day listen it is the time of fulfillment it is the time to cross over brother brown says now what have we adopted today we've adopted other things we've adopted church membership instead of the upper room we've adopted theology instead of the baptism of the holy ghost we've adopted everything else in the stead of the thing that god told us to do because we've listened to the rules and orders of men but when that gospel light shined in the morning over yonder on the eastern country oh it's been a day that wasn't dark nor light it's been a day hazy the sun its power could not be seen a mixed light a hazy day they knowed the sun was shining but the clouds had just put it out of their sight people's had enough faith to say yes jesus was the son of god oh he's gone gone way away we can see enough to believe for salvation but you can't believe all of it they stop short like the prophets when the king come to him like the prophet when the king come to him and ask him for victory get a victory over syria he put his hand on his arms and says strike the floor and he only struck twice and the prophet said why didn't you strike many times you come short god would have given you many victories and i say with this reverence tonight in the church the church has been striking short of what god revealed to them striking short they only struck a couple times we can be free from sin that's good we can have joy that's good but why don't we strike for divine healing why don't we strike for the power of god why don't we strike for the restoration of the gifts why don't we strike that jesus is the same yesterday today and forever while god's got his hand rested on ours let's win the victory over sin and everything that jesus died to free us from the church is striking short they just make a little strike but it don't do no good like we strike just one time two times let's keep striking calvary spelled freedom calvary don't strike short everything the bible says it with everything how do you do it the prophet the seer had his hand on him as long as christ has got his hand on you in the baptism of the holy spirit keep striking god is with you church let's not just strike twice today but let's keep striking and keep striking and keep striking god i won't give up there's still promises there's still more i'm going to strike i'm going to strike as long as his hand's on me i'm going to keep striking not just for justification i thank you for that lord not just your sanctification i thank you for that lord but i need your holy spirit i'm gonna strike until i'm all the way back to the original i'm gonna strike till i'm back in the book of acts i'm gonna strike till we cross the river keep striking young people don't just strike for a jump and shout strike for more don't just strike for excitement strike for more oh you know i love a jump and a shout but just don't stop there strike for more you keep striking till you know you're sealed away he says strike for the power of god strike for healing strike forgive strike for it all don't strike short listen all those things he said individually is good land nobody doubted that reuben and gad stopped in good land there was more the promised land contained it all he's saying he's not telling you not to strike for those things he's saying strike for all of them it's like when people say well we don't need tongues in this anymore because when that which is perfect has come that which is in part is done away with well if you do away with a part of the hole you don't have the hole anymore that's what brother brandon i'm saying don't just strike for part get all of it get every last bit of it reuben and gad stopped in a good land the denominations found some good land there's no doubt they found places to settle they found some words that were truth and they stopped right there and they put a period after their experience and that's where so many are at today even in the ranks of the message they've walked in fulfillment all the way up to the border land of the original but just haven't crossed over they're standing right on the borderland of the original that's not to be judgmental that's just saying come on in come on there's plenty what moses tell them that if they didn't do everything they said they could still have land in the promise come on in the land's good it's everything god promised it would be you don't have to stay out there you don't have to stay on the border come on in water's good the land's good it's flowing with milk and honey everything he promised in this holy ghost land is here there's healing here there's deliverance here there's joy here they're shouting here they're speaking in tongues here there's prophecy here it's all in the land come on across it's a good land enter into this land you're living below your privileges and in that condition living on the other side of the original you aren't in place to fulfill what the bride is called to fulfill reuben and gad actually denied the leadership of jehovah even though they had followed the leadership of jehovah for all those years but by not crossing over they denied his leadership they followed it all the way up to the river jordan but when it came time to the complete giving over to god and laying their will aside and doing everything that he wanted them to do they couldn't do it they followed him through justification they followed him through sanctification they followed the message far enough to recognize the error of the denominations they followed it far enough to believe god sent a prophet they followed it far enough to stay under its protection and to stay under its anointing and its blessings and to find healing and to find deliverances they followed the leadership that far and even so far as going on to say that we've got the holy ghost but on our terms only on terms that we're comfortable with only on terms of well we received the holy ghost because we believed or we got the holy ghost because we accepted the message we received the holy ghost without experience like mary that ain't the original that's not crossing back over into the original at the original they staggered like drunk people and spoke in tongues brother branham says the mother of jesus christ had to go up there and be included in that bunch of people so drunk on the spirit till she staggered like she was drunk on whiskey or something and you think you'll get to heaven by slipping over the church and putting your song book under your arm and walking over every sunday morning and the bell tolls and you sit and listen and walk back you'll never do it you'll have to come that route because that's the only route god ever laid down and ever has we're not going to argue anyway but that's unarguable that's pretty straight and you'll walk it or you won't be there that's even straighter i'm not your judge but i'm preaching the gospel that's exactly the truth the blessed virgin was right there acted just as idiotic as the rest of them did your young people are acting like idiots yes sir i was hoping you'd say that they're just jumping and shouting and acting like idiots praise god prophet says that's the only way i didn't stutter read it just how he said it i'm preaching the gospel that's exactly the truth these men and women every one of them was full of new wine if god ever changed that program put your finger on the scripture for me it isn't there no sir it was plumb on to the end of the age that way plumb onto the end of the bible and it will be the same thing when jesus comes well brother aaron i'ma steal the line that i heard brother danny say what year did he say that in the year that he was a prophet i can guarantee you the year he said that he was a prophet he said there'd be a prophet like rise in the last days malachi 4 given the signs of the days of lot so forth also prophesying for the people to return back turn back to the faith of the first pentecostal fathers turn back to the original turn back to the bible get away from organization and denomination and go back to the first go back to the original pentecost to the original feeling of the holy ghost to the original power of god the word testifies that that will happen it shall be light in the evening time the path to glory you will surely find in waterway the light today buried in the precious name of jesus young and old repent of all your sins the holy ghost will surely enter in the evening light has come it is the fact that god and christ are one god witnesses the holy ghost the holy ghost itself living in us would never affiliate itself in organization you can't organize god he's god what will it do go back the way it was at the first place it'll go back to the beginning back to the original back to where it started from it'll baptize the same way they did it'll teach the holy ghost the same way it did they'll teach the people the same way it did it'll abstain from organization like they did it will have a room for all like they did who will come they'll be clean and holy like they did they'll be filled with the spirit like they were they'll be fearless like they were and the same things that happened to them will happen to these in the last days in the evening light like it was before i don't know how to put it any clearer but we got to cross over back into the original again that's what this exodus is about it brought us out of egypt it brought us out of the world it brought us out of denominations where is it taking us back to the original it's taking us back to the way the church was when god started it because it's the only way you can take a rapture you will not fulfill unless you come all the way back to what god intended at the beginning to the good land the holy ghost land it's a land of deliverance it's a land of the holy ghost it is a land of the supernatural anything that would turn you away from the supernatural is not of god we've got the most supernatural message that's ever struck the face of the earth and we got people denying the supernatural you don't believe the message you may believe god sent a prophet but you don't believe the message that prophet brought satan hates the supernatural he wants to keep you away from the supernatural and so what he'll do is he'll come to put doubts in your mind about the supernatural more doubts about that than anything well i wonder if it really happened in that sister the way she said i wonder if they were really sick because they well they jumped and shouted but i i've seen other people jumping shouting they were lost i've seen this and well i'm not sure those tongues yeah that interpretation i could have made that up testimonies i have found get questioned almost more than any other thing in people's heart it's i wonder if that's really how it happened because the devil wants to make you question the supernatural he wants to make you doubt the authenticity of supernatural events because it's satan's tactic to undermine the supernatural and make these things seem merely a coincidence well maybe maybe the cancer was gone sister atlanta before you ever got prayed for maybe it was just already gone maybe it really didn't have nothing to do with with the supernatural power of god maybe you know i mean she had a few treatments maybe that took care of it begins to make you wonder bends to attack the authenticity of supernatural events because it's his tactic to undermine the supernatural and make it seem a queen it says why because it's the supernatural that's going to take you out of here it's the supernatural that changes your life so if he can make you doubt the supernatural even in the level of healing then how are you going to believe for a rapture he attacks the supernatural he attacks the supernatural over and over oh it wasn't that big a deal oh if he can take you that far he'll make you believe it was entirely false and unfortunately even ministers will spend time attacking the supernatural even though they claim to be following a supernatural message and justice janice and jamborees withstood moses and tried to act like there was nothing to the miracles there was nothing to the power of god that's the job of those that would come against the supernatural what was the intent of janice and jamborees to discredit the supernatural to remove faith in the power that was going to take them out of egypt it was the supernatural that was going to take them out of egypt so let's make them believe that was just a magician's trick people get healed in the denominational church too people run and shout down to upc church all the time it's just emotion it's not it's not god there's people getting here it's nothing special it's not supernatural so they point to the to the powers and they say look we got miracles too they jump and shout too it's only emotion it's only a magician's trick but the same power that turned moses's rod into a snake was the same power that was going to plague egypt the same power that turned his rod into a snake was the power that was going to open the red sea that same power that turned his rod into a snake was the same power that was gonna rain manna down out of heaven it was the same power so they were trying to take that away from them they're trying to rob it from they're trying to point to the supernatural i say don't worry about what they're pointing to don't worry about what they're mocking the same power of god that sweeps through this building and heals our sick the same power that comes and makes you shout makes you speak in tongues the same power that makes you run around the church and dance and do the things that you do it's the same power that's gonna take us out of here it's the same power that's healing our sick it's the same power that's gonna rapture the church i say go ahead and rejoice in it i'm not worried what they say i'm not worried if other have it god bless you but it's the same power and i'm gonna worship in spirit and truth in that power it's the power that's gonna take me out of here so the enemy wants to make it seem like it's not a big deal it is the power of transformation it is the supernatural it is the rapturing power that we have to have it's what's going to take us out of here and we've reached the age of fulfillment i want to be in the place that i can fulfill all the scriptures spoken of the bride in this day i want to be where the message placed me because if i haven't allowed myself to be positionally placed then i can't operate and fulfill what the bride is called to fulfill i can't fulfill the rapture as i've said that's not going to stop the rapture those that have crossed into fulfillment back to the original they're going to take it they're going to have the rapture reuben and gad didn't stop israel from taking the land make a little turn here as we start heading for home let's go to genesis 49 where we started we already read the prophecies and the blessings jacob spoke over his sons i didn't read all of them but i wrote read down through gad and we're going to look at these prophecies and in these prophecies it kind of helps us to understand why they made the choices they made and even the conduct of the tribes down through the generations and the fulfillment that comes through these tribes we're not going to go through all 12 but we see that the greatest blessing by far is pronounced on judah and we know that jesus is the line of the tribe of judah he's the root in the offspring of david says he's the firstborn of many brethren colossians would tell us that he's the firstborn of every creature now nothing is by accident and we've already said that god will work everything according to his will to make his word come into fulfillment that it might be fulfilled and we have established these things in the scripture and judah is the tribe of the firstborn by assignment because reuben lost the birthright the the prophecy very clearly says reuben thou art my firstborn but he lost the birthright he was technically jacob's firstborn but he forfeited the firstborn rights of his inheritance through his misconduct and he lost them to judah you can find this in 49 genesis 49 3 and 4 also in first chronicles 5 and 1. and it is for this reason that the ruler's scepter belongs to judah and we see that in genesis 49 10. he has become the firstborn as it were 49 10 says the scepter shall not depart from judah nor a law-giver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be and he receives the privileges of the firstborn right there forever and when we think of jason jacob's blessings upon his sons we have to realize that each prophetic blessing was not so much upon an individual as it was upon his future descendants it was more intended as a prophecy upon the thousands and thousands and thousands of descendants who would be born into that tribe down through the ages not only was he pronouncing the destinies of these tribes he was pronouncing the characteristics that each of these tribes would develop i'm trying to hold it in for a few more minutes and those characteristics were but extensions of the already developed and displayed characteristics of his sons he could look at the characteristics of his sons and say those that come from him are going to be just like him those that come from this one are going to act just like this one that's why i can look down through time and tell you what they're going to do and tell you where they're going to fall short and tell you where they're going to fail but i can also tell you who's going to overcome genesis 49 3 he says reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power it sounds good next verse unstable as water this is characteristic that's his most dominating characteristic it's the first thing he calls out because thou unstable is water thou shalt not excel unstable makes bad decisions like not crossing over will never excel because he makes bad decisions because he is unstable as water you know family cycles been around a lot longer than what you realize imagine growing up in the tribe under this prophecy every generation after every generation after every generation after every generation you had to be a real cycle breaker to even excel coming out of this tribe as we all have cycles to break we all have things we have to battle don't let it stop you don't look back at your family history and say we failed we failed we failed so i'm going to fail now be a cycle breaker look every age has went down the cycle of revival and death revival and death revival and death but somebody's going to be revival and rapture somebody's got to break that cycle somebody's got to break the cycle when it comes to your natural family be a cycle breaker genesis 49 19 gad a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the last it's like i believe it's the shortest of all the prophecies and blessings i can imagine sitting there waiting on your blessing and what's that mean can you imagine waiting on your inheritance a troop's gonna overcome you you're gonna overcome at the last how am i gonna get am i gonna inherit anything what's going to happen what is actually speaking of if you dig down into it is it speaking of the fact that god is going to become a great military tribe and they were they were fierce warriors but the reason they became such of a great military tribe is because they were constantly attacked they were constantly attacked their entire lineage is that they're in battle after battle after battle and they have to fight off all the enemies all of their days because of their location because they chose to settle outside the promised land they were constantly attacked they would struggle through life constantly attack because they settled short and it says in the end they will usually win most of the time they'll prevail but notice they're fighting battles and enduring raids that they didn't have to fight they're struggling to find victory they're struggling to stay afloat they're attacked on all sides because of where they settled the prophecy saw them there the prophecy was spoke over from you're barely going to make it you're going to struggle you're going to fight yes in the end you're probably going to make it by the skin of your teeth but you didn't have to settle there in the first place you could have crossed over and possessed it all when you had the opportunity and the prophecy placed them there and saw them there the prophecy saw that reuben would never succeed never excel in generation after generation will walk underneath this prophecy as the characteristics of that patriarch of their tribe would play out into a fulfillment in their lives the characteristics of the patriarch of their tribe would play out in a fulfillment in their lives oh surely you see where we're going surely you see where we're going the characteristics of the sons of jacob were passed down into the tribes and the prophecies proved true as they failed to fulfill all that they were called to do as they failed to cross over but there is a people called to fulfill all there is a people on the earth today that in spite of satan's best efforts have followed the message not only to the river but they are crossing over the river i'm not looking to the characteristics of one of the tribes of jacob i'm looking to the characteristics of the lord jesus christ let me tell you about my jesus he didn't stop short he conquered all he conquered death he conquered hell so what am i going to do when i manifest the characteristics of my father and the prophecy that's been spoke over me i'm gonna have it all i'm gonna take it all i'm gonna possess all glory i can't help it i can't help my genetics that's my papa that's my daddy that's what he did he overcame he was victorious the devil offered him land on this side of the river he said you don't got to cross over chili jordan i'll give you the kingdoms you know it's kind of hard to rob somebody with something they're going to get anyway yeah you can't bribe me look what i'm about to get i can't stop short look what i'm about to get i'm about to have a new body i'm about to have a rapture i'm about to have eternal life you got nothing i want you got nothing i want and if you do i'll just take it from you hallelujah hallelujah he didn't settle short that's where i trace my lineage back to where he conquered i'm a conqueror where he overcame i'm gonna overcome because he's my father the word why do you think they can say the works that i do shall you do also how many of us have seen the characteristics of our natural parents in our everyday life because you're going to be like them and the same thing applies in the spiritual there was a prophecy spoken over jacob's son and there's been a prophecy spoken over you the prophecy claims you oh thank you god the prophecy has claimed you satan tries to lame claim to you and says that you're mine you belong to me everything you got is mine but the prophecy claims you as a sea gene of god this prophetic message called your name daddy told you who you are it was a message straight from the throne if somebody else says daddy tells me where i came from i don't really care you wasn't there you don't know and even if you know some of the truth you probably got it mixed up and you don't know all the details like satan's message i don't listen to he's not my daddy he's not my father i'm not listening to it this message called your name this message called you to fulfill everything you saw this message and you said mama that's me that's me right there that's what's calling my name look all i had to do was eat and i was going to manifest the genetics that was on the inside of me jude i'm sorry it is what it is all you got to do is eat and you're going to manifest the genetics on the inside of you all you got to do is eat all you got to do is feed on it there's something on the inside it's going to start to manifest the genetics on the inside of you oh hallelujah just start eating a little more yeah i'm getting a little weak a little worn out just eat you're gonna manifest exactly what you are you're a seed gene of almighty god he is your father he has called you to fulfill it hallelujah i am a spiritual gene well i can't remember being born yeah but my mom and dad told me about it and i believe them satan says i got a claim on you and god says no before the foundation of the world you were mine i might not can remember it but daddy told me about it daddy didn't tell me all about it let me read a few of these quotes as we begin to close now heavenly father as the day is growing dim now the signs of his appearing is at hand we see the church that little handful of elected called out predestinated before the beginning of the world names are put on the lamb's book of life before there was a foundation of the world the holy spirit has sought through the nations and around the world until he's called this little group all the father has given me will come to me all that comes to me i'll give him everlasting life raise him up in the last day the same god that before the foundation of the world called your name and wrote it on the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world has already made a place in glory for you hallelujah what are we worried about what are we going along looking like this well i just wonder lift up your heads the bible said lift up the feeble knee and let the hands raise up that once hung down let him that's weak say i'm strong amen for the gospel has delivered this good news and this morning the holy spirit through the word bringing you the good news that from the foundation of the world god wrote your name in the last book of life and all the devils out of hell can't erase it out of there hallelujah what you're worried about it can't be a race it can't be taken off you are a seed gene of god he knew you the devil never owned you the devil has no right to you you are called to fulfill all of the scriptures who's going to fulfill it all brother aaron you are well who's going to overcome all these things brother aaron you you are going to cross over into fulfillment you will possess the land because you are a sea gene of a mighty conqueror you are part of him that's everything right there brother brown says because the bride and the bridegroom are one she is just a smitten piece off of him there is the masterpiece it was smitten michelangelo could not reproduce that again he could not put it back but god's gonna do it he's going to bring this little bride that's smitten right back to the side of the original word and there he is there is the masterpiece the family back again in the garden of eden church that's why you identify with it that's why it identifies with you because it's who you are it's what you are it's who you are well how do i know because he told you how do i know because it called your name because you feel the pull because there's something pulling you harder that direction than there is something right here i heard brother ron say something last night that so thrilled my heart he said for the believer this is as close to hell as you're ever going to get hallelujah for the believer this is as close to hell as you're ever gonna get because he went to hell for you he conquered hell for you now you don't have to go this is as bad as it's ever gonna get for a believer but i'll tell you something about we're going it's going to be glorious it's going to be eternal it's going to be back home again in eden with our father hallelujah but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light check in other words brother branham says john you know who i am i'm the high priest that's true john i have need to be baptized of thee and we've got to fulfill all righteousness and i have need to be baptized of thee now to fulfill the word of god because all the words got to be fulfilled and we are the lights of the day and it's up to us to fulfill all this and i know that your righteousness and your desire is to fulfill the word it's becoming to us we are the lights the light of every age should do the same thing we know what's got to be fulfilled you who are spiritual and know the word of god you see what god has promised as we walk in the evening like church we got to press harder than ever before we got to press into that land of fulfillment it's getting harder and harder brother brown says the word don't always come easy the fulfillment don't always come easy but we got to be willing to press in the musicians can come as i finish this we are claimed by an eternal word to be the final serpent bruisers the final serpent bruisers we are the very instrument that god will use to fulfill all that was written in the new testament i hope i was able to get it across today we're not just looking for fulfillment we're looking to fulfill we must go and fulfill i got a few quotes i'd like to read they're just too good not to read now the only way to be a to live a life worthy is to let christ and his word reflect itself so perfect in you till god vindicates what he said in the word for christ died that he might present himself before god a sacrifice and return back in the form of the holy ghost to reflect himself through his people to carry on his work reflecting himself through you to fulfill his promised word in these future days like john the baptist heard brother brown tell stories in a way that don't come from one's imagination come from one who saw it like john the baptist heard when he heard christ come and christ walked out into the water and john said behold the lamb of god nobody else saw it but he saw it that light coming down from heaven like a dove and a voice saying this is my beloved son and whom i'm pleased to dwell in he saw it coming and jesus walked out into the water emmanuel before a preacher that was supposed to be a radical walked out into the water before the people and said i need to be baptized of you john said lord i have need to be baptized of thee why cometh out of me both of them eyes met one another a prophet and his god amen i would love to stand and watch that see them stern deep said eyes of john peel down and find them stern deep set eyes of jesus second cousins to one another in the flesh jesus said john suffer it to be so now for thus it behooves us we're the message of this hour it behooveth us to fulfill the righteousness we're the message of this hour it behooveth us to fill feel righteousness brother aaron i'm not so sure i can make it i know you're gonna make it you've been claimed by a prophecy it's not reuben's prophecy it's not a prophecy of god i descend from the lord jesus christ himself the royal seed of abraham the royal seed that will not fall we are the message of this hour and he's called you to fulfill all he's called you to cross over into fulfillment he could have called billions and billions and millions of other people he could have called important people he could have called presidents and governors and princes and he called you he called me he could have called anyone but he called you he said they'll fulfill it they'll do the work i've got confidence in them you say i've got confidence in my god he's got confidence in you it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness but what about this and what about that the world's falling apart god's words gonna be fulfilled he couldn't stop jesus from fulfilling every word that spoke of him in the old testament and every word that speaks of the groom speaks of the bride he can't stop you from fulfilling every word in the new testament you say i'm supposed to fulfill everything in the new testament all of it that applies to jesus and his bride brother brown says now for nearly 2 000 years god has been again making him a masterpiece because he struck him to get a piece off of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect masterpiece that he struck at calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the new testament that's all he fulfilled the old testament now it's the new testament another piece to be fulfilled see the new old and the new and old is husband and wife see and it taken the new it taken the old to foreshadow the new christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece in the making will you stand together with me you masterpiece of god you bride of jesus christ you that is called to fulfill all how am i going to do it look what daddy did just keep eating just keeping you can't help what your genetics are you can't help what you've been called to be you're going to cross over into complete and total fulfillment which is complete and total victory church there i'm sorry there's just so many incredible wonderful quotes from spoken words the original seed and from masterpiece and it has so many more i'd love to read but i want to tell you this brother branham had a vision and in that vision he saw the bride come through he said it was a lovely group but then he says that the voice spoke to him and said now the church and as it comes through it's a church from every different country and and i'm paraphrasing allow me that liberty plea please and he said he was heartbroken at what he saw he said this is the best that i could do this is the best that i could do this is the best that all the preaching and all the ministry could produce the church has fulfilled that part of the vision that part of the vision is fulfilled he says but the bride must come into preview again back to the original you say i see struggles and i see hardship and i see this and i see that i see a people fulfilling the preview of the bride i see a people fulfilling that part of the vision i see a people walking in step with onward christian soldier i see a people that the message you are the creation of this message this message spoke you into existence you wouldn't be here without this message you are the vindication that this message is true somebody's fulfilling the last part of the vision and here she came a holy group an overcoming group a victorious group a group called to fulfill the vision you say i'm struggling i don't make you not bride brother branham saw that and he said get back in line just get back in line this morning oh i've gotten out of step that's okay get back in line there's grace here there's mercy here fulfill the vision that god has
