Prayer we ask the Lord to witness the ceremony here today father as we bow before your throne of grace we want to thank you for your many blessings to us the blessings of God that has watched over our lives that has brought us to this moment to this time we thank you Lord for the symbolic representation of this young man and woman that represents the soon coming of Jesus coming for a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish we thank you Lord that they have lived through to that representation and today Oh God stand before this congregation now to be solemnly united in marriage for now and through eternity we asked your blessings upon them today as they share their love with one another and speak their wedding vows that will bind them together their hearts are bound and now Lord in contract they will be married and bound together and love through out their lives and we ask that your grace would just overshadow them today and bless us in your presence and be the witness that is here today along with these others assembled witnesses for it's in Jesus name we ask it a man I'm going to read from Ephesians chapter 5 said submitting yourselves to one one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husband's as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be subject to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so men ought to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes even as the Lord the church but we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones and for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband marriage is one of the oldest institutions it was ordained of God from the earliest ages for the first marriage was performed by God himself in his great Cathedral the Garden of Eden and God chose the mate for his son Adam by his own power of creation and with man and mind God made a counterpart that would be loving and sweet and kind how God must have expressed his own desires as he fashioned and formed ever line and curve of Eve's body from the rib that he had taken from Adam's side this lonely God was expressing himself through his own creation the scripture says he brought her to the man not that God calls out in an audible voice that names are mates but the Christian knowing that a mate is a reflection of one's true self must select them a mate that matches God's word because as a child of God they too are to match God's Word what a wonderful thing it is when two believers come together as they have today to reflect God's plan in God's great desire when God looked upon the loneliness of his son he said it's not good for man to be alone I will make a helper that is suitable for him so he took from the man a rib something that was close to his heart a portion of his own spirit and nature to make a wife for Adam surely God was looking far way down into the future when he himself would lay down his own life so that the necessary elements of water blood and spirit could come forth from his body there on the cross in order to make from that a bride in the Genesis account the woman was taken from the man and so she was a byproduct of the man not in any way was she an afterthought or any way inferior to the man but she was made from the man as butter is made from cream one is not better than the other but each has its own unique qualities God made the man masculine in the woman feminine and the roles are not reversible nor exchangeable the woman was not taken from his feet for the man to step on but and neither was she taken from his head for her to rule over him but she was taken from near his heart for him to love and to become one flesh with there is absolutely no doubt that God's bride comes from the very heart of God in this beautiful text that we have read from the Apostle Paul it describes the spiritual unity that exists but christ and his holy bride every bride and groom is to reflect the same in their union the Apostle Paul called it a great mystery that was hidden in the union of a man and a woman as he said this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church and these words from Paul we learn of the unfathomable of of Christ for this sin cursed race and the pristine purity that his atoning death has obtained for all people for how else could be we a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish this text presents the duties that each one of you will bear in your relation to each other as husband and wife how you treat these duties will not only determine the degree of happiness you enjoying your marriage but also the eternity of eternal destiny of your souls in all of life the Spirit will direct you to the word Jeremy as a husband Christ expects you to be the head of your wife and this headship is neither despotic tyranny nor selfish servitude but rather it is to be a loving guidance that has at its core true love it's not the love of physical attraction or the love of fond communion but rather sacrificial devotion just as Jesus had for us and yes the bible does teach that the woman should obey her husband this is all throughout the New Testament into the Bible principles but this should never be because of a man's brute strength whereby he lords over her with angry demands but this must come from a god-like and christ-like character that is worthy to be default that followed true leadership has never do what I say do but not what I do true leadership is my live the example life that is worthy of the gospel even the great Apostle Paul realized this when he said follow me as I follow Christ as a husband you were to love your wife as Christ loved the church Jesus gave up everything for the church he suffered he endured hardship for the church he forewent what was his own personal interests and pleasure for the church Jesus died for the church Jeremy when you were tested as a husband and no doubt Satan will be certain to test you in this regards many times in the years ahead you must remember to look back to this example the example of Christ the bridegroom of the church and draw strength in encouragement and direction from him and furthermore Jeremy as a head of your new family Christ expects you to exhibit leadership in your home when while the book of Proverbs chapter 31 indicates that a good wife is one that husband can safely trust to manage the home and nurture the children it does not absolve you as a responsibility to lead and guide your house authority resides in the head and just as Jesus has the ultimate authority over the church so will you over your wife and children with authority though comes accountability it will be your duty to see the spiritual physical and emotional needs of your family are provided among other things you will be responsible to see that your house serves the Lord you will be responsible to see that your children honor their parents and are obedient you will be responsible to maintain an adequate resource for their financial needs and Sadie the pattern and example for wife is the church like a woman the church submits herself to her Lord not in fear but in love she is overwhelmed by the sacrifice made for her and the blessings bestowed upon her therefore she obeys Christ and calls him Lord and even as Sarah did Abraham and say - you are to obey your husband and Satan will tempt you as well there are many voices in the land today that will encourage you to rebelled against this authority and to pursue your own way the call of the world will urge you to become an independent woman but now that must melt away is the two of you become one when those times arrived you must remember the joy and reward that you possess as a child of God comes to you only as you submit to Jesus so the joy and happiness of marriage can only be realized when you submit to your husband encourage listen and follow and respect and follow him another attribute of the church is that you must clothe yourself in purity even as you committed to do as a Christian girl now for many many years the church that Christ will claim for his own and is upon his return is a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing Paul said that he had espoused the Corinthian church to Christ as a chaste virgin and since a young girl you have prepared for this day and therefore you have kept yourself pure and this continued fidelity to your husband will contribute much to the success in your marriage and in like the church the woman cannot let her head be turned by the fashions of this day and the trends of society so that your beauty is only skin-deep but continue to display for your husband that thing within you that is an incorruptible ornament which is in the sight of God is of great price truly your husband is just responsible to be pure and chaste and holy as you however your character will do much to draw your husband closer to you these words of the Apostle Paul are essential to the success of your marriage charity or love some suffers long and is kind charity info in Viet not charity is bonnet not up itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil it rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices and truth if beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never fails well no one doubts your love to each other today those of us have been married for some time know that there's that it's yet nothing compared to what it can be and should be there will be a day when passion will wane there will be times when tenderness will be tried what is it that's going to sustain you in that hour it is love not the love that is felt or aroused but loved that is learned so with these things in mind and these admonition let us complete the marriage vow the Bible says that marriage is to be held in honorable and that is to be esteemed and respected our regard for our bonds of matrimony rests entirely in the person of Almighty God because it is he who ordained it is he that governs it the book of Malachi states that is also he that witnesses the oaths that are taken in marriage so Jeremy and sadee you stand together today as the children of God redeemed through Jesus Christ is it your purpose to establish a home that is truly Christ centered where the Word of God is read and obeyed a home that will be welded together by prayer in which the Holy Spirit is your consonant guide is that your intentions and yours so I'm going to ask you now if you will please just join your right hands together Jeremy Sadie has given you one of the most sacred things under heaven a woman's life and a woman's love it is so sacred brother Branham would equate it to being the next best thing to receiving the very Spirit of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost you may bring her great joy or you could cause her great sorrow it is not what you bring her in a material way that will make true happiness because riches without love it's nothing the gift without the giver is bear the practice of those virtues as a husband that you've shown as her lover will keep her heart one to you you are to be true and loyal patient and sickness comforting in sorrow and forsaking all others keep yourself only unto her as long as you both shall live Jeremy will you pledge to keep these promises Sadie this man Jeremy is to be your husband on your life your love and devotion he will lean for strength and inspiration he's going to look to you for encouragement for cheerfulness and confidence no matter what the world may say about him or think and people may forget him lose confidence in him turned their backs upon him but you must not may your love and your life be an inspiration that will constantly lead him to greater dependence upon our Lord Jesus Christ Sadie were you pledged to do so then I will require a token that this covenant will always be kept do you Jeremy butts take these Sadie Roncalli to be
