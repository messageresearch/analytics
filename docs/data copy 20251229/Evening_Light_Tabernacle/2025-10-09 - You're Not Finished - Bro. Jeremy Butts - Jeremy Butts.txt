========================================

[Music] When I feel like I can't make it. When my world's falling apart. When I feel forgotten alone with a broken heart. When I question every promise and doubted every prayer. It's in the silence. Somehow I know you're there. I almost let go. Then you told me the truth that you're not finished and you're not done. You made me a promise that I would overcome. [Applause] You speak to my valley. the answer to you and every mountain in my way to set you. Cuz you're not finished. [Music] You're not finished. Even in my weakness, you still have a plan. When I'm in the darkness, you reveal your hand. [Music] Your heart was meant for evil. You turn it for my good. And you give beauty for ashes just like you said you would. And I want to let go. I remember your truth that you're not finished, that you're not done. You made me a promise that I will overcome. You speak to my valley. I answer to you. And every mountain in my way said you cuz you're not finished and you're not finished. You with me in the shadow through heavy win my battle and you never turn away and never stop calling my name. Breathe on what's been broken. restor. You speak to my storm and your voice to come the crashing waves. Cuz you're not finished and you're not done. You made me a promise that I would overcome. [Applause] the street to my valley. They answer to you and every mountain in my way you cuz you're not finished. [Music] [Applause] You're nothing. [Music] [Applause]
