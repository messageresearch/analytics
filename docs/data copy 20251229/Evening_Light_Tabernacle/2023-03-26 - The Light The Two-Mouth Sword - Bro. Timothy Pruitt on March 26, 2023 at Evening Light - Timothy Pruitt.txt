for your glory and for your honor we ask you to Jesus name [Music] amen let's turn to Hebrews chapter 4. verse 12. amen kind of like David this morning I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord I enjoy being in his presence and with his people amen if you're a visitor here with us today I pray you're blessed and feel welcomed as well amen Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12. it says before the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword Pearson even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit of joints and Morrow and is a deserter of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen we'll let you be seated hey actually been up a little bit down in my body this week and feeling much better today but I wasn't able to be here Friday night brother here and speaking on the church age studies and but I got to streaming and I have to say I was I was blessed amen and amen if you missed it and it's open to anybody it's worth coming to it's the word of God amen his word is uh there to touch us in our lives and we saw the Spirit of the Lord move in a Bible study and and touched many hearts and many lives and you know I think we never should come to the point or the place to where we think we know it all but every day we ought to be looking for more of him I I believe God can use one verse for for a long time and open it up over and over and over to our hearts and our lives and and and and and I know as human sometimes we kind of get uh puffed up in our our our degrees of the of the message or the Bible but I believe we ought to always be looking for more of God and more of God in our hearts and and this morning I'd like to take again out of this scripture but I'd like to speak on the light the two-mouth sword two mouth sword actually if you look at the two-edged sword there as it would as you would look into the the word it actually means uh I can't pronounce the Greek word but it means having two mouths therefore has two edges we could also look but we know where the word of God Is Spoken amen is not you know the sword that we have today is as I get into this and this thought and we're going to speak about the hand that holds the sword but I want you to when you think of that it's not a certain sword or a physical sword that we're handling this morning but a spiritual sword and so is not that we as as Israel or others of the Bible would take a physical sword invite a physical enemy amen we have a spiritual sword but it'll fight our spiritual enemy that we face in this time and this life that we're living in and so when we speak about the hand that holds a sword the sword in our day is actually held in our mouth and so it's the mouth mouth that speaks and and we can read about it in Revelations 1 and verse 16. he said he had the right hands seven seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and also in Revelations 2 it talks about these things saith he that hath the sharp sword with two edges so it's a sharp two-edged sword or a two-mouth each each Edge representing a mouth the sword was not held in the hand but is held in the mouth it is the word of God words that are spoken that have great effect upon on our enemy a word that has power and is able to defeat the Devil and every one of his attempts to stand up or block the promises of God now the sword of God it cuts both coming and going up and down and in and out in other words in any situation in your life if you'll use the word of God it will do great a great harm upon your enemy it will cause him great a conflict or great hurt the word will cut when it's used it's sharp it's able to cut any disease it's able to cut out any Spirit of hell it's able to come against the powers of Satan and defeat them by the spoken word of God the Bible must be put in action by your lips speaking amen the word of God you know was spoken before it was written but now it's written in order for it to be spoken amen so it's not good enough to just have a Bible as you would lay it on your coffee table or on your on your book by yourself beside your bed and it's a beautiful Bible and point and look at it and even read it but you must take what you read and allow it to come into your heart and by inspiration begin to speak the word of God and when you do it puts something into action it's not enough that God has spoken the word of God and God has anointed men to write it upon paper but it must be spoken from your lips in in order for it to become powerful to your situation amen you know Isaiah 49 and verse 2 said he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword amen so it's not just God's mouth is a sharp sword but your mouth has he made a sharp sword now brother Joe talked about it as he began to take the prayer request that life and death is in the power of the tongue so it has a sharpness to it that can bring life or it can bring death it can bring life to the situation that you're in and death to your enemies or you can use it in such a way that it'll bring death to your children or death amen to that your brother around you but we want to use it and the way God has orchestrated it for it to be used amen the word of God is never something that we should take and use against our brother but it's something that you should take into your mouth and begin to speak against the enemy that's in your life amen and so this word amen is with us and we can read about it in Romans 10 and verse 5. he says for Moses describeth the righteousness whatso the law that men which doeth these things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh come on now and readeth it speaketh on this wise saying not in thy heart who shall I send from Heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall descend from the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what saith it what saith that the word is neither even in thy mouth amen even in thy mouth and in the heart that is the word of faith which we preach or speak amen it's the word of faith that we preach amen it's not a word of faith that we read and say it's a good word or agree with it but it's something that comes on the inside of us and begins to begins to anoint a part of our life and out of our mouth we begin to speak the word of God and when we speak it it goes and it cuts out Spirits it cuts out demons it cuts out sickness it cuts out diseases of every kind and if Thou shalt confess or speak without mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in the heart that God has raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved so to be saved you have to speak amen not agree not just say well that's okay and Nod your head but no speak the word of God that's why it's important when we come to the house of God and the word is spoken that we also amen speak back amen when you're not just a bunch of church knotters and saying yeah that's right but know something is coming out of our hearts and it's speaking back to the word [Applause] foreign God is near it means he's right there ready to help you he's near you or close to hand meaning he's ready to help you at any moment but it takes you speaking the word he's ever present but you've got to speak the word amen he's ever able to help but you've got to speak the word his word is always near it's already always ready to fight it's always ready to be taken off of paper and put into action how by speaking amen the word in Ephesians 6 and verse 17 The Sword and take the Hellman of Salvation the sword of the spirit which is the word of God we all want to read it in a different translation it says embrace the power of Satan's our salvations full Deliverance like a helmet to protect your thoughts from lies and take the mighty razor-sharp sword of the spoken word of God amen the spoken word of God Amen listen it wasn't just enough for God to think let there be light there had to be an utterance that went out of his mouth and said let there be light it's a spoken word or a declaration it's declaring amen this is why Paul said we have the same Faith according as it is written I believe therefore I have spoken we have believed therefore we speak the word of God is like a sword that has two edges it's cutting both ways and is doing terrible damage to the enemy amen as we read this for the Ephesians calls it the sword of the spirit which is the spoken word of God this word means this word of God is actually from the Greek word Rima which means or it's something that's spoken clearly or vividly or an unmistakable terms and undeniable language so it's not something that you just mutter to the devil but he knows what you're speaking he can clearly hear what you're saying amen it's undeniable language that is spoken that goes out of your mouth it is a spoken word you know here's an example of rimma or a spoken word you're praying about a situation and and suddenly a Bible verse Rises up inside your heart and at that moment you're consciously aware that God has given you something to stand on and clang for your situation and therefore you receive the word that come out of the mouth of God it's dropped in your spirit but it can't stay there it has to be spoken the word of God was so sharp that it'll cut right down to your questions through your intellectual abilities through your natural logic and enlarge deepened within your heart and all of a sudden amen it begins to germinate there and it begins to rise up out of you and you begin to speak it and release the power that's on the inside of you Hallelujah you received a word that come right out of the mouth of God drop right into your heart and God now is speaking it through you well he has no lips on Earth but our lips right amen so it takes us amen as a vessel and so the word come out of the mouth of God next it has to come out of your mouth and when it comes out of your mouth it becomes a sharp two-edged or literally two-mouth sword one edge of the sword came into existence when the word of God come out of his mouth and the second age comes into existence when it comes out of your mouth and it'll cut coming and going it'll cut coming up and down or backwards and forward it doesn't matter when it comes out of your mouth it's going to inflict harm on your enemy that's why the enemy is trying so hard amen he don't care if you believe it he just don't want you to believe it enough to speak it and then when you speak it amen light comes out of your mouth and it goes against the darkness that's trying to stand up against you and it begins to fight against it and it begins to push it back that's why it's important when we come to the house of God we speak the name of Jesus it ain't just enough to believe the name of Jesus you got to speak the name of Jesus because in the speaking of that name there's power over every devil there's power over everything that would hold you when you speak the name of Jesus something begins to happen when you finally rise up and you speak the word of God the moment it comes out of your mouth the second Edge comes to the blade nothing is more powerful in the word that first comes from God's mouth and then your mouth amen amen nothing is more powerful than a word that comes from God's mouth and then out of your mouth you and God have come into agreement you're on the same blade amen an agreement releases Mighty power to your situation this is why he was saying to patman's Vision don't fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I am your heir to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I've not come to bring fear and failure but love courage and ability all power is given to me and it's yours to use how am I going to use this power you speak the word and I'll perform it I can't tell you how many times in prayer lines you know you want to get people to confess things and I'm not even necessarily talking about Sin but that's that's an important thing that is important thing to do is to confess and make those things right but to confess amen first they're a child of God just a few days a few months ago I was in a prayer line and you know and I understood later that the sister came from a church said they were taught that sisters to remain quiet and not say anything because it's what Paul said and so they were even in church they made it down to the point that we're in church they can't even say Amen they can't be vocal they can't say nothing what is that that is the devil trying to clamp down their freedom and trying to make it to where they came experience the release of the power of God in their life and so in this prayer line I didn't know who she was didn't have no idea of the situation and I said sister and she come up asking for prayer on a sister a certain situation I said see I can pray the prayer but unless you confess that God's going to do this for you it's not going to do you no good because I could see there was a hindrance there and she went to speak it and it couldn't come out of her mouth I said you've got to speak it and she would try and it wouldn't come out of her mouth and finance your hand went up and I said don't put your hand over your mouth you've got to release the power of God for your situation amen that's why there's power in confessing the word of God it's not just believing it but confessing it speaking it letting it come out of your mouth amen for your situation but you never could and she went out just as bound as she ever was so this is where I want to bring it to us is why the devil tries to clamp down on our amounts he tries to clamp down you heard it last Wednesday night our response he tries to clamp down on that because he knows there's power in that response for you amen what if Hattie right would have never responded and she just nodded and said yeah okay yeah no there was something that come out of her that's nothing but the truth and brother Robert said standing in that powerful anointing what anointing the word that came out of a little woman's mouth God gave her her two sons Jesus would try to teach us this in March or Mark 11 chapter 20. in the morning as they passed they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou curses is withered away and Jesus answered said unto him have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whatsoever shall say whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he thinketh I thought a little curveball whatever he readth whatever he nods to no whatever he saith [Applause] he saith therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them it is the words that spoke that moves mountains it's not good enough just to believe it you have to speak the word of God and that moves the mountain in your way listen your Mountain knows your voice and he didn't say go get a preacher and have him speak to it or just the disciples could speak so do it what I read said whosoever do we have any whosoevers in him in here this morning whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed now he didn't say I was going to remove in one moment it does sometimes it's a miracle but many times it's healings and and it looks like there's just a maybe not you can't even hard to see a trickle of sand he said but if you'll stay right there and what you have spoken God will perform what was said it's the word that spoke it's it has to be an utterance it's speaking the word that gives it the sharp edge to cut through and remove mountains of fear and mountains of unbelief mountains of sin and things has held you amen it takes a spoken word what is a word a word is the manifestation of a thought it is the expression of a thought is that right before you say anything you subconsciously you think it before you speak it now some people's a little faster at that it's what you call having no filter yeah it's just something comes but they had to still think it they just didn't allow that thought to sit there just a nanosecond before they said it amen but listen brother random talks about he said you have to see that your motive and your objective is right and he said when that is right and you see that you're standing there looking at a mountain and this mountain has no right to be there come on now that mountain has no right to be there in your life it has no right to stay there over your children over your situation but listen you can allow it to stay there as long as you look at and say well I believe it's a mountain I believe God said I could say something but it never comes out of your mouth in the beginning was the word and as far as we could go back but before the word was it was a thought and a thought was made manifest he thought and then he spoke and then it become the spoken word amen the word was made manifested Jesus no wonder when he came off the hill that night and he looked around the tree for food and fig tree and there was no food he said no man eateth from thee and he went on his way and the next time they come back the tree was withered the mind in the beginning was a thought before it was a word and it expressed Jesus Christ the same one was expressing that word again it was a creative word of God it had power over nature it had power over every circumstance he had power over every situation every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form and if received into a human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized in the Bible it'll bring it to pass how powerful could the church be the Bible said let this mind that was in Christ be in you as a man think in his heart so is he and God said let there be a world before there was a word it had to be a thought and God in creation created the word by thought first and then he spoke it and if that same spirit that said let there be light and there was light Let There Be trees and there was trees if that same one it's in you and in your mind not your mind but the mind of Christ how much more could it say Let Me Clear My Voice how much more could it say let them eat no cancer [Applause] glory to God I wanted the devil to hear that real clear let there be there bit sir and it would be gone let the blind eyes be open and it'll happen he said well my church don't believe that well get a different Church that believes the Bible whosoever says to this mountain he said well that was Jesus wait a minute he said have faith in God for verily verily I say unto you whosoevers if you shall say to this mountain be moved and plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say will come to pass you'll have whatever things I'll saith you shall have it what power has been given to the Church of the Living God you can ex now you can express it by mental conception but it had first because to become a real revelation of God and see and you see it before it happens do you believe it and you express it in word form and then that word takes hold and it becomes materialized a thought expressed what kind of people should we be foreign holy spirit that has used so in body has empowered you that you don't use your own thoughts and you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion oh but the holy spirit is used so build into your thoughts and you be in God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church should we be what kind of people would would even like Tabernacle be this morning so filled with the presence of God until you don't even use your own mind you don't even use your own thoughts but you're led by the spirit of God I believe there ought to be people like that led by the spirit of God and they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God and then when the human element goes out and the spirit of God takes these vacancy where you emptied yourself out he will fill it then your thoughts will become words and your words will become materialized that's when the church is in his power I believe it's on the road right now that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from themselves that they don't see themselves they don't have they don't have no thoughts of their own their thoughts are moved out and they refuse the things of the world they move in the spirit that live in the spirit they walk in the spirit moving under the unction of the Holy Ghost see your words can change your atmosphere it can actually change the atmosphere around you your words your words can produce an atmosphere of unbelief or it can produce an atmosphere of faith your words can produce an atmosphere of sadness or it can produce an atmosphere of happy and glad your words produce that come on now your words by the power of your tongue right now you can produce an atmosphere around you of Faith to believe all things are possible and God come down and materialize what you've been looking at and wondering about for 20 years God can come and do that in just a moment by the words that comes out of your mouth it can produce such an atmosphere around you amen why is preaching so powerful because it's words being released not just the words of a mortal man but the words of almighty God through the foolishness of preaching is an expression of God's thoughts be released in power no other Spirits have to bow when the word Goes Forth because it's being spoke your testimony can change your atmosphere you want to change your home start changing your words well I want to change my husband I want to change my change your words yeah I know that hurt I'm just preaching to you the word may not be what you want but it's what it is I want my home atmosphere to change well it starts with you and your words I want the situation to me to surround me to change well it starts with you and your words have power in them spoken words now you know it your testimony changes your atmosphere when your Mountain tries to hover over you and casts Shadows on you and say it's impossible with how big it is and how impossible it is and and people have tried to move it before what you need to do is look at your Mountain and start stop testifying how big your mountain is quit testifying of your sickness and what's wrong with you and what this doctor said and that doctor said quit testifying of that start testifying of what God did for you it'll change your atmosphere and all of a sudden it'll go from unbelief to Faith amen what you need to do is start looking at that mountain that looks so tall and so high and so wide and so impossible to climb so possible to get past you need to start telling that mountain do you know what mountain I serve a great big God and he ain't found one mountain yet he can't conquer he ain't found one impossibility that he can't make possible he ain't found one situation he can't handle he hasn't found one sickness that he can't heal he hasn't found one sin that he can cure tell the mountain how big your God is start using the word let me ask you this morning is the mountain bigger or your God bigger depends on who your God is amen but if it's the god that said let there be there ain't a mountain too big [Applause] when you said Mountain be moved and it still stands there you say well it didn't happen oh it did happen it did happen when you said mountain move maybe one little insignificant looking grain of sand turned over and started to roll down the hill out of the hundreds of billions and billions of tons of sand one little grain moved but it's begin to take place hallelujah it's began to take place you hold that Faith until you see that mountain disappear Thou shalt say in thy heart disease move from my child disease move from my body in the name of Jesus Christ and don't doubt [Applause] and right from the good germs right there the good germs will take on new armor oh my them good cells in your body they'll get strengthened when you begin to speak the word of God they'll take on new armor and they'll get new weapons and they'll get a new strength to fight the enemy he's defeated because Christ has taken him down to Calvary and stripped him of everything he had therefore we're not speaking a defeated word we're speaking a word that'll defeat every devil we're not speaking every right weak word we're speaking a word that's strong enough that's powerful enough that's great enough to move any mountain but it comes down to this this is quite incredible thought he says in the parking me in church age he said I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word that's in our midst that kind of strikes deep don't it if we're really impressed we get impressed by a lot of things in this life get impressed by whatever this one can do whatever that was done but what are are we sufficiently impressed with the word is he a big enough God is he truly the champion of champions is he truly able to come and move in your darkest moment and change everything just in just a moment yeah yeah I'm impressed with him enough to know he can do that listen we get impressed by mountains we get impressed by a beautiful landscapes we get impressed you know you go to the Grand Canyon to get impressed you go to Great mountains of the Alps you get impressed by their beauty but who made all of that the god that called you the god that spoke your name he planted a seed over there and thousands of maybe millions of years past let there be light but he had a seed laying there at about two years 1900s or two thousands whatever it was all of a sudden that seed that was laying there for thousands of years a word began to speak out and he had enough confidence in his word just as much as he said let there be that he didn't care how bad the climate was he didn't back care how dark it was he didn't care how much drugs and alcohol and spirits of every kind he knew what his word went forth it's going to come to pass so he allowed the devil to create his own Eden he allowed him to bring all of his spirits into this realm and he said hey devil you can do all you want to do I'm still greater you can wall up the walls you can make mountains so high you can pour concrete over my sea but when my light begins to shine they're gonna come out they're going to come forth and they ain't enough Devils that can stop them did you hear the word this morning they ain't enough devils in this world that can stop a child of God from coming forth to what God called him to be foreign maybe we need to change our impressions to be six significantly or greatly impressed by the word that's in our midst listen we're not speaking the words of a mortal man there's been great men that spoke great things they've made great speeches Abraham Lincoln's Paul reverse John Paul Jones great things that we hold on today I've just begun to fight that's a great word I like using that but there those men they lived and they died and you couldn't get them here today to speak another word they're gone they live their life some of them that spoke great things were actually terrible men but I'm not speaking to you about a mortal man this morning and taking mortal man's words and speaking them I'm talking about are you significantly and sufficiently impressed with God he came as a man he died as a man but he rose again and his word is still has the power in it to do everything that he said it would do it's not a mortal man it's not a man when he dies his word has no more power anymore this God's word still has power therefore we can have confidence that this is this is the confidence we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petition that we have desired of him so what is the will of God there's only one way to know his will and that is the word he says in lamentation is three who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the Lord commanded the knot there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it but you can't ask for it unless it's in the word well that's great comfort to me because healing's in the word salvation for my children is in the word amen situations overcoming depression is in the word it's all there we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word you can't separate God in the word they're one now the word he is Left Behind on the printed pages is part of him when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said that his word was live but what exactly is he I am the way the truth of life if any man not have the spirit of Christ is none of his there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is and that's exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes a word into his heart and places upon his lips why that's the same as deity speaking that's the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man if the church way back there in the third age had only held on to the revelation of the Living Word in their midst the power of God was not a faded like it did in those dark ages and right today when the church returns to the word and faith we can and we can say without a doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be intermissed again laughs now we're I'm gonna go to a very familiar scripture Revelations 10 and verse 1. and something has been fulfilled in our day amen and I saw another Mighty angel come down from heaven clothe with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as a son and his feet as Pillar of Fire a lot of light right there a lot of light and he had in his hand a little open book or book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice oh there had to be an utterance cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and we know what those seven Thunders are they're the revelations of the Seven Seals that God has given in this day and when the seven Thunders had other their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice a voice from Heaven saying let me seal up those sayings which the seven Thunders uttered and right them not and the angel which I Saul sat upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever excuse me for me who created heaven and the things that they're in and the earth and the things that are therein and the Sea and the things that are therein that there should be time no longer so this God has spoke into existence the land the sea everything that was in which sufficiently impressed with this God but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel seventh Church aides seventh angel and when Easter begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he declared to his servants of prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth on the sin upon the Earth and I went into the angel said give me the little book and he said take it eat it take it eat it and it will make our belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of their hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey but in my belly it was bitter and then he said unto me thou must prophesy again so it wasn't just good enough for the seventh angel to say it to speak the words that God had uttered but that he John as a as a type of the Bride had to take the word eat the word and then speak the word there's power in speaking the word now we know what was given in this time that we're living in this message that we received is literally the king's sword it came in a prophet's hand and it came down in his hand he said he looked at it it was a glistening and Shining and he said I wonder he said I was always scared of Swords he said I'm so glad I didn't you know I'm gonna be honest with you I'm glad too I didn't live back in the days when they had swords and they fought with swords I just you know if I got to die give me a bullet let it be over with but slice me up and dies me up no thank you foreign do you understand the the the wounds that you can cause upon Satan's kingdom because God's given you a sword and you can slice them and dice them this morning you can cut it from hither To Yonder it's a king's sword and he said a king's sword he said no thee King sword not just a king that lived and had a kingdom and he died and he don't there's resemblance of things now and there's buildings left in his honor and you can go look at no no this ain't a king that just died this is the king that died and rose again it's the king's sword amen the word that'll defeat the enemy not just a sword of a king but the king the king who stepped out on nothing and created everything a king who stepped out on nothing and it created everything the king who spoke and light as a sword went out and it cut away Darkness and it broke the stronghold of Darkness that was upon the Earth he had faith in his word therefore he spoke it and had come to pass and this king's sword when you take it into your life and it comes out of your mouth it's sharp enough still yet today to cut every devil to cut every sickness every torment Spirit off of you that's why I've seen it right in the midst of preaching the word Empower being spoken and it'll go right out to where somebody is being tormented by a spirit you go and all of a sudden they'll realize I'm free [Applause] I'm free just has to speak it of the word the preaching of the word went forth it cut it out of my life [Music] he has faith in his word it will accomplish that what is sent to do therefore we must allow his mind and his thoughts that are higher than our thoughts thank God they're higher than our thoughts and they bet that thought of God be what comes out of our mind now we know but Bram talked about the hand of faith she talks about how strong it is not again a literal hand that you're holding a sword this morning but it has to be faith instead of the hand of faith is strong enough it'll cut a little hole through Darkness and it'll say by faith I'm saved that's a great cut but then if it'll all the stronger that hand is to yield the sword then that's all it can cut but if it's a strong hand it'll cut Plumb through everything the devil's put there and it'll make every promise of God shine forth in the power of his resurrection if it's a strong hand of faith the sword is plenty sharp it's plenty powerful it's plenty able it just needs somebody that'll use it it means he's somebody that picks up the thoughts of God and reveals them by speaking the word of God now the word will cut in there if there's enough harm behind it to push it in it'll find a place it'll find a place to cut if you just get a strong enough arm behind it the sword picked up an arm of Faith grip it tight hold on to it walk into the face of the enemy he says how can that uncircumcised devil ever stand in the presence of the Eternal God so you take the sword of the presence of the Eternal God and every promise that belongs to you and you pick it up with that hand of faith and you walk forth if you say I need healing cut it out Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if you need salvation every promise and the Bible is mine he'll do it he said what does the spirit fight with the Holy Spirit fight with Sensations feelings no no Lord knows our feelings that give up on us real quick and we don't always feel God around us what does a Spirit fight with it fights with the word Glory feelings no word word word word let's fight with the word the spirit of God walks right up to the devil and says it is written it is written and the devil starts moving back you take the sword which is the word of God he said brother take the word take the spirit let the Spirit come to your heart and say open up your mind and say Thy word is what's true he said you do this sister Thy word is truth Lord I ain't got I ain't going to pay no attention to how I feel what anybody else says self says I'm stopping up I'm blowing out every one of my Avenues has stopped up all the frustrations all the doubt all the unbelief I've ever had ever feeling all the sickness I ever had everything I had I'm blowing it all out and I'm coming right down to where you're at with the word and I grabbed the faith of God and the sword of the spirit and I say thus saith the Lord and then scream Hallelujah [Music] thus saith the Lord hallelujah then cut every enemy that's in front of you can we do that this morning take the sword of God and cut that old spooky Spirit that's made you feel all down cut it away with the word of God our strength is the joy of the Lord is my strength wow I heard a devil scream right there somebody's grabbing the word of God get away from me get away from me whack and you cut him with the word whether it be a demon whether it be sickness whether it be whatever whatever disease take the word and pull the sword and whack the first time and if it doesn't move whack again and if it doesn't move whack again keep whacking and whacking and whacking until you can see the light of God shine it upon the promise for you Hallelujah keep yourself out through that old Shell of sickness cut your way out and say hallelujah where's the next one that's the battle that's a true soldier of the cross knock every enemy out there's enemies that's trying to sit upon this service darkness is trying to come in but there's real soldiers here this morning it's going to push past sickness well I don't feel good well I don't either without feelings ain't got nothing to do with it amen it's the word of God and the word of God is true I don't care if you feel good or you don't I don't care if you're happy or you're not I don't care if you got joy in the soul of your of your spirit your spirit of your soul I don't care if you're just so sad and you're so down and depressed the word is still the word and it's still the truth it doesn't matter what you feel this morning or how bad you feel the word of God is not dependent on you coming to Sunday morning and feeling like I feel good to be here this morning sometimes you don't sometimes you'd rather be at home sometimes you'd rather be over on an ocean somewhere or doing this or that but this morning you picked your old body up and you put clothes on it and you got in your car and you came to church why because the word is the word and the word's still the truth no matter what I feel like no matter what's around me no matter what it looks like it's still the word I need some soldiers this morning that'll grab the sword of God and go to whacking at the Devil I could have it this morning I could have it this morning I can hide my joy this morning I can have everything God has for me this morning why why Hallelujah I see light coming through I see Angels coming through that hole you just wax glory to come the darkness is trying to hinder but there's some soldiers here my king deserves a fresh stray a Pentecostal Waters and I don't care if I got a fight through 16 miles up and listening well I got that one where's the next one that yard got that one where's the next one some of you this morning need to pick up your sword and make that depression devil's head roll across this floor and then you go over there and you get that old head and you say look at here look what God has done Hallelujah where's the next one Hallelujah where's the next one Abraham had to whack his way all the way through every kind of doubt and we're supposed to be royal Seed of Abraham yeah well I don't know about pulling swords we're trying to be peaceful I ain't got no desire to make peace with the Enemy because you know if you make peace with him you give him a Lynch inch he'll take a mile I asked Joshua those people that does that deceive them you know why they got deceived because they didn't go to the word they took their own feelings their own thoughts what they thought these men came with uh uh their you know moldy bread and though all their skins had made where they looked old and they'd come from a far off place and we've heard what your God will do and how great he is and we want to make sure that you don't come to we ain't nowhere close to where you're at we're way over here instead of Joshua going to the word of God they had the word of God in their days called the uroma thumb and they could ask the questions and it would have lit and it would have told them exactly what the devil was saying but they failed to go to it they failed to question the word of God and they allowed their feelings and what they saw take precedent over what the word of God and they made peace with the Enemy and that peace began to afflict them they found out they live right next to them right in their own promises right in their own place right where God had given them and they failed it because they didn't use the word [Applause] amen how many times have we allowed ourselves to make peace well I'll tell you what brother Timothy every time there's a little movement in the church and I get excited I tell you what the Devil comes on me after that and he can bring such a nervousness upon me and he hurts me and he does this and all next week I got all kind of troubles whoa you know what that tells me you need to whack a little harder you need to whack a little longer you need to whack to that Devil's Head comes off and when he comes at you on Monday morning you already have your sword out listen I ain't promoting watching movies but you know I've seen a lot of westerns in my day and them old Cowboys gunfighters what'd they do they didn't sleep with their gun over there in the corner no no they didn't sleep they knew there was somebody especially somebody after them they didn't put it away over there no no it was right there an easy grabbing distance this is why David said I've heard Thy word in my heart it's an easy grabbing distance now when that enemy wants to come at you during the night you start speaking the word you hit him between the eyes with a double barrel shotgun and you unload on his high quit allowing him to come and ruin your night's rest amen you'll show him the in the morning or during the night about two or three o'clock when he comes to torment you I want you to pull all those covers back and say devil I don't come to you in my name I don't come to you in my strength but I come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I got a word here and this word will defeat you Anytime Anyplace under any condition doesn't matter if you caught me sleeping doesn't matter if you call me or without a wish it'll still defeat you no matter where I am amen foreign all the way he had to chop all the way to the promised son he had to chop he had to whack at it and whack at it and whack at it until it cut itself through then he'd say where next Lord move your tent up here and you went and built an altar there got up there and Satan come and said I'll tell you this ain't the right place I'll stay right here Satan get off my ground Hallelujah the Royal Seed of Abraham why you know it's it's the same promises the same God amen amen when death comes up and tries to take you it's coming up I'm coming up your sleeve give way Jordan I'm crossing over cut your way right on through the darkness into the promised land amen what is it the Royal seated that's full of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Field Church filled with the Holy Ghost Royal seed by the promise not by sensation but by the promise of God they'll stand with the word of God and chop their way through screaming Hallelujah like a chicken and an egg what if he's afraid to pip at it what if he's afraid to Peck the egg what if the little chicken inside the egg little bird was afraid to hit that eggshell what if he heard a sound on the outside said don't hit that shell you might hurt yourself but in the nature of that bird tells him Peck a hole in it knock a hole in it let all those outside voices say all they want to days of Miracles are passed you're going to hurt yourself you're going to get in the fanaticism you need to pack against that denominational shell that wants to wall you in that only God does so much and God has so much power and there's no more laying hands on the sick and they recover there's no God don't do that no more baloney my God my Bible that God's word says he's the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] if he once was God he's always God [Music] well I know I know how it is that devil wants to come at you in a servant say don't don't get too crazy don't pick against that don't pick against that shell why is he telling you that because he knows if you ever get out you ain't going back in hallelujah what you need to do is start pecking with all that you got how do I do it with the word of God Satan get out of here I'm coming out I'm not laying here no more I'm not sitting there no more I'm not the devil's grounds no more I'm picking my way out this morning I'm not a chicken I'm an eagle [Applause] back against the wall and he's pushed up against that shell but he just starts hammering against it and hammering against it and hammering oh my God he hammers himself enough to all of a sudden his wings can come out oh Hallelujah I hope somebody can get a wing out this morning [Applause] get another Wing out this morning amen the way you can fly into the promises of God that Devils want to put a shell around you and say you can only go so far and you can only be so much and God's only called you so much and you're only be this and no more well you can worship but just don't you know just go out to the desert there and worship and come back I was hoping there'd be a few more swords in that not today Satan that needs to be more than just a saying on your computer or on your cup that needs to be words you live by [Applause] because them words have power Satan wants to come on a Sunday morning say well today you're just going to have just as calm service we're just going to have just a few moments of of that just some singing in a few words of a preacher and then we're going to go home and we're going to have some cups of coffee not today Satan today is my day of victory today you won't be around you've held me up but today I'm coming out of here today I'm walking in Victory not today Satan you need to get up on Monday morning not today's Satan Tuesday morning not today Satan this is my day of victory Hallelujah oh come on keep picking against that shell God's wanting to give some of you some real Victory this morning the devil's held you in a shell of complexes a shell of fear then oh if I do that what they gonna think about me let them think what they want I got the victory this morning glory to God in the highest glory to God of the highest some of you need to start worrying less I want what people think about you and more about what God thinks about you what's causing that chicken to pack there's an atmosphere on the other side that's drawn him out of the shell and that pretty soon that atmosphere on the other side gets greater than the atmosphere on the inside and it causes a stirring on the inside of you and he starts using the word of God that's how I'm coming out I'm coming out I'm going to experience the holy of holies I'm going to experience a Pentecostal blessing I will experience God for myself [Applause] what smash that thing some of you made your complex you're idle smash that thing let's lift up the word of God this morning by his stripes I'm coming out of here I'm not going to live in this place no more he said well I need healing praise the Lord healing's for you healing's for me this morning the promise is yours but if you ever get it you're not going to get it easy I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan Satan captures your health you're gonna have to go right down to Satan and say give it back hand it over give it back hand it over I come in the name of Jesus Christ the possessor of heavens and earth and I am an heir to this you're not I am your name's not on it my name's on it it don't belong to you it belongs to me give it back you took my child you got her mixed up with the wrong boy the wrong girl I claim them that's right I claim my children I claim my brother I claim my sister yes Satan you took them from God's house coaxed them out there but I'm coming after them I claim them in the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] how can you do that because I'm an heir it belongs to me it was given to me I can claim anything that God has promised me how do you enforce the claim by speaking the word [Applause] it's mine I'm going to tell you right now let me say a few promises and let's see who will claim it the promise is unto you and your children the joy of the Lord is my strength he's the Lord God that heals All to Jesus that's it start claiming the word of God and speak it and say devil it's mine it's got my name on it it was wrote there before the foundation of the world [Applause] it's mine I'm an heir to all things it was given to me I can claim every promise [Applause] how do you get it something you've done nope there ain't none of you in here that's worthy of all that I'm not brother Branham no all the prophets Through the Bible none of them was worthy of that we was born in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world doing what oh speaking that was unplanned thank you Lord speaking lies so we've been good about speaking lies speaking what the devil wants to say to what the devil's been speaking in our ears there's some people that have spoken a long time I'm lost I'll always be lost I'm no good I'll never be any good but all one day while you was in that lost condition down there in that chicken yard you had a voice from another round son you don't belong there come out of her my people come out of the sin come out of the unbelief come out of it I'm telling you this morning there's a boy speaking to you saying come out walk out of the jail cell walk out of the shell you're not a chicken you're an eagle Satan tied you up down there but there's a word this morning that's releasing you [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord heavens and earth will pass away but this notice that's got my name on it [Applause] Glory it'll never come on somebody it'll never pass away it's mine from now through eternity [Applause] Satan cannot hold it as long as you go into him with the scriptural authoritative word with faith and say lay it down it's mine Satan you lay it down you took it for me but you got you give it back because this morning I'm serving notice on you oh and it's not a notice that I have said it's a notice that he said but I found out you hid it from me and you try to keep it tied up in courts but the judges spoke on my behalf and he said hey Timothy your name is wrote right here your name is wrote right here there might be people that tries to cheat you out of houses and teach you how to land and try to hide it that your name wasn't on The Inheritance but in God's word it's a voice that speaks this morning it says your name has been found on his and word [Applause] hey man Hallelujah I'm feeling good y'all understand if you want to but I ain't done God's word will come to pass if you say to this mountain and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass he said when you go to the devil and you begin to speak to the word the word to him he said that don't just get him started that gets him running um lay it down because I've come with a scriptural Authority I am a believer what did Abraham do first in order to do this he had to lay his faith upon a solid rock Foundation of God's promised word look the only thing he had was a little when he went to go deliver a lot he had just a bunch of servants maybe a dozen maybe a few few men up against maybe a thousand men wasn't soldiers they were servants they were Cattlemen they were sheep men they were herders there's some old rusty knives they'd picked up somewhere but Abraham wasn't looking at a rusty knife he wasn't looking at a shield he was looking at his faith laying upon the word of God that what does it that's what does it that's what does it your faith laying upon a written word of God how are you going to fight them when you get there it's not up to me it's not it's up to me to lay my faith on what God said that's mine I'm going after what belongs to me he said when people that's sick can see that the sickness is just about over right then Oh Glory when a sinner can see that you don't have to sin that's a powerful thought a lot of people they sin because they have to sin that's a pitiful shape when you say you have to sin but when you realize you don't have to sin no more there's people that can stand up and curse and laugh in your face and call you an idiot and everything else willfully Center see there's no hope for them but the man who does something constantly they don't want to do he steals and he don't want to he lies and he don't want to he he does things he doesn't want to he doesn't want to be a sinner There's Hope for him if he can let if he can let him see the truth come up to God's promise and lay your faith on that walk out there to the enemy he just simply can't hold it no longer that's all because it's yours he just simply can't hold it no longer that's all because it's yours I read that again the enemy he simply just simply can't hold it no longer at all because it's yours Abraham said I'm an heir this belongs to me everything in this land belongs to me why because God said it did now we're heir of all things we're heir of all things the Bible just said just got through saying so here we're air of all things everything we don't possess it yet but it's ours I don't own us an inch of land but all and but it's all mine it's all yours belongs to the people the church the Believers the bride of Christ owns every Speck of it Russia's fighting for United States are fighting for it this one's fighting against that one that one they call us crazy just sit still you own it this Earth was not created for Satan and his angels this Earth was created for God's people just sit still you own it it's going to fall air to it let them fuss blow up one another it belongs to us we're the ones that'll get it they'll never even think it but we do who would have thought that a little poor man up there with those little skinny bony cattle on top of the hill owned all of it all of Palestine belonged to him yes sir so when it came to a place that Showdown came God proved to him to be with him he took that little handful of men and went out there and slaughtered every one of them and brought back his possession he laid his faith upon God's Rock promise that's what it takes he didn't build another Foundation he didn't go join another organization he laid his faith upon a promise he marched out there Rusty sword and not Rusty sword made no difference to him his faith was laying on a promise and when you come forth to be prayed for if you want salvation if you want Divine Healing no matter what it is if you are a Believer you're an heir to every promise so lay your faith upon a promise and March forward and say Satan give it back give it back it's mine don't let him Bluff you he'll stand there sometimes but he has to give it back that is your inheritance and you have the authority because you are an heir to it we see let me go back here he says after the battle Who come out to meet him Melchizedek the one who had given him the word his word he got the Victory and now he returned back and he had fellowship with the one who had given him the promise oh his word will become something new to you whenever you get once you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you say well I can't see these things I don't believe in shouting I don't believe in spoken speaking in tongues I don't believe in Divine Healing it just shows you don't got the victory but one time because it's in the word now I know man tries to take it out but who cares what men does it's God's spoken and he's the same yesterday today and forever it's God's word that promises and we believe it because we're in there therefore I'm an heir of Divine Healing I'm an heir of Joy I've got a right to be happy amen well so what makes you so happy I got a right to be how do you know because I'm an heir to it I'm an heir to happiness I'm an heir to Joy I'm an heir to peace I'm an heir to eternal life I'm an heir to the Holy Spirit I'm an heir to every every evidence is God I'm an heir to the authority of God who made you that not me he did every one of you is an heir to the same thing we are an heir to a throne he that overcome it shall send with me in my Throne as I am also overcame and set with My Father Strong I'm at heir to all things not just one thing all things everything is under your feet even death itself hell grave everything is under your feet are you in the air to even like Tabernacle no but I'm in there to All Things both seen present future to everything I am an heir to it and every sin and wickedness has been put under my feet by the grace of Jesus Christ he rose on Easter morning triumphed over death held on the grave and made me an heir and said wait younger and I'll give you the promise and his anointed authority of servants said the promise is unto you and to your children to them that are far off even as men as the Lord Our God shall call I'm an heir can I say it like this but Justin why are you sitting here this morning because another heir took our position and she said I want my brother back I don't care what the devil's done what he's trying to do I want him back and I want my family together what was that that was more than a 16 year old voice that was a voice spoken in faith and said I want my brother back and that voice went forth out to other places out past amen 5 46 White Oak Road down a little Trail cut through some bushes down through some Woods all the way over there on bowling drive down in a little bedroom laid another air there was a seed laying there that the devil had tried to cover up and say it was impossible for him to serve God it wasn't for him didn't matter what the devil said it was what God Said didn't matter how much the devil tried to put on him is what God Said at the beginning and God said Justin your name's on it but another Heir took her position and spoke the word of God and it went through the Realms of the Darkness and Light fell upon a bed what was it it was a sword drawn by a little 16 year old girl and said I've come to take my brother back [Applause] come on now if he'll do that for another one won't he do it for you won't it come if you'll take the same Authority and say Satan I come to you in the name of Jesus Christ this mountain that stands before me it'll not move by my might it'll not move but my spirit but it'll move by the power of almighty God [Applause] and that sword come down in that room and he goes and change fell off and that seed got up and it got in his truck and it came on a Wednesday night and fell down an altar the same night with just in a few moments of that girl's prayer don't ever think your words don't mean something well brother Timothy I'm just going I'm just going through stuff so much I just wish I could die you got it wrong you can't die you died years ago but you're going through so much what you need to do is turn that power that's on the inside of you towards your enemy quit putting it towards yourself and put it towards your enemy and say Satan you take your hands off of God's Property that's a Son of God that's a daughter of God he belongs to Jesus and I invoke the name of Jesus Christ this morning amen because there's power in that name there's power above every situation and I am an heir to everything that he has bringing it down to this last moment said it like this in a prayer I now challenge the devil to a debate in other words I got some things to say to him Satan you are aware that you are whipped Amen Let me let me just put that today Satan you are still aware that you are whipped you have no legal rights my Lord Jesus Christ stripped you of every Authority you ever had when he died at Calvary and he took away sin and sickness you are nothing but a bluff and this morning I'm calling your bluff I'm calling your bluff you know that when the Lord came to the tree he cursed the tree and the next day it was with her and our lord said unto his disciples how faith in God before you say use this mountain be moved and don't down your heart but believe what you said it shall come to pass and you can have what you said Satan you know the scripture on that Oh my he knows and I have just taught this people that God is in them has that not worth been taught this morning and if God is in them and they speak to that disease and say be away from me and don't doubt their heart right then that disease has to leave for why Jesus Christ said so so in the name of Jesus Christ come out

out of them let me say it this morning Satan you've held them long enough you've held your people in Chains of complexes long enough you put shelves around them you've held them down and you said it
