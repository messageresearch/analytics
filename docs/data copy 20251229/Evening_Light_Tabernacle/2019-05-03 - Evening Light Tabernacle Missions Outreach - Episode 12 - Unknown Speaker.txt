========================================

hello everyone we are the ministry team at evening light Tabernacle we're so glad that you joined with us again today and we trust that you'll be blessed and you'll invite your friends to come and join with us and share this on Facebook or wherever you're listening to this today we've been talking about the changing of dispensations where that the dispensation of the law ended to go into the dispensation of grace or the dispensation of the the Jews and it turned into the Gentiles today we want to carry that a bit further as we discuss this and we was talking about how the end time will be a process a dispensation of the fullness of times when everything is wrapped up and you will find that even in Christ in that day the Jewish dispensation would come tune in is it would all be wrapped up and finished in Jesus Christ amen well we have the angel of God appearing to Zacharias and the visitation of the supernatural and how that the supernatural began to work and and angelic visitations and prophesies began to be fulfilled and light being shown the description one thing about this was that Israel was a barren woman she had not brought forth this promised child the Messiah you know as Isaiah's prophecy had said unto us a son is born unto us a child is given his name will be called Emmanuel and also it says in Isaiah that the government would be upon his shoulders and so now the government the very law would be fulfilled in him as he shouldered the very law of God and fulfilled that law right the word fulfilled Jesus made it a statement in Matthew I believe it was he said I did not come to destroy the law but I came to fulfill the law many times people look back at the Old Testament and they say they disregard it all together that's the Old Testament and this is the new but Jesus attitude was not to disregard the Old Testament and it's at all Jesus quoted the Old Testament Paul quoted the Old Testament Jesus was specific I didn't come to destroy the law I came to fulfill the law what would that mean what do you think that would mean if anyone has comments on her well I think that he would take the very very scriptures and things such as would just name a few just you know that he would be the Lamb the sacrifice he would he would also implement a new Sabbath rest which would be the Holy Ghost he would he would fulfill the feast actually he would literally do this that is his crucifixion and so on like that um but you know I as we're speaking about this let's go back in our mind about this woman Israel she was under expectation and she she had was pregnant with the word a seed a word that it said that she would conceive and bring forth a messiah to the world and she had been expecting this for many many years and yet seemed to be just a barren woman there was another woman that was in this era of time her name was Elizabeth she was a barren woman too and she had never had a child and the Bible said in Luke 1 that depth Zechariah that he went in as the custom of the priests office to burn to incense before the Lord and and the whole multitude of the people were without during the time of the incense now so you got a woman here Elizabeth who is barren and you got a people who are barren and both of them are prey and there's been many many prayers but it looks like you know God's forgotten his promise it'll never happen I'll always be barren you know all of these were the thoughts that were going through their mind and God's answer to that was to suddenly appear to Zechariah and reconfirm the promise and say you're gonna have a child and not only that but Israel is gonna have a child and this child this child that Israel will have will be for RAM by the one you're going to have right and this will be John the Baptist and he will go forth in the spirit and the power of Elijah and so it goes to show you exactly the very plan of God in great details how that in this dispensation as the gospel goes in that he's going to forerun the first coming of the Lord with Elijah the prophet and he will do the same at the close of the dispensation as we're under expectation again for the Messiah for Jesus to return back to the earth again he will do it by also sending Elijah the Prophet wonderful alright so we don't want to miss the cone of the Lord I don't think anybody wants to miss though so you have a people the Jewish people who were well studied in Scripture I mean they they knew the scripture and as you mentioned in the last session when we spoke you said that it never mentions the first coming even being a mystery that they knew that he was to come they knew that Elias was the first come that the disciples asked Jesus we thought a lot and Elijah would first come so this work the common knowledge as it were so what caused the people to not recognize John's ministry and what calls them to not recognize Jesus being the fulfillment of the Messiah if to us is so obvi looking back and if they knew the scripture so well and he came and fulfilled everything to a tee what caused him to miss it I think you have to look at the attitude of the people if you go to Malachi 1 and you look at the end of the Old Testament the scripture says the son honoureth his father and a servant is Master if I then be a father where's my honor and I felt and now if I be a master where's my fear saith Lord of Hosts Oh priests that despise my name and you say where have I despise thy name you offer polluted bread upon my altar and you say wherein have we polluted thee and that you say the table of the Lord is contented if you offer a blind for sacrifice is it not evil if you offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now until the governor will be pleased with it or accept that person sale or host notice they begin to offer what they don't please God their attitude was not to bring what they knew please God but it was what they felt like well we'll just do it it's a custom we're gonna offer this and you find this is at the end of the Old Testament that relieves our Pro lose us into the New Testament the own coming of the Messiah the Son of God and you find there their mentality was that we don't really care so they had become lukewarm even in their traditions yeah absolutely actually the Malachi talks somebody said you made a poor Fame thing yes if you look at that word profane it means to be made common to become common to be just you know that no longer is a you know all for the lamb a spiritual thing but just you know out of duty you know I'm with you I'm just gonna go take whatever I got and you know they used to have to have a blemish of a land without blemish or that spot without you know and to take it up there and now they're just taking the taking the lamb the seek and we see and offering so here God here it is you know so could it be that they didn't even maybe with lip service they did but they didn't even truly expect fulfillment of the scriptures that they claim to believe well I think it had come to that that they really in their heart was not expecting fulfill anymore they had they had just their faith had just really died within them and they were a faithless generation yet on the other hand that we're giving lip service right saying oh yes the Messiah will come and we're looking forward to just like today just as we're looking for Jesus to come in the moment and and living what are you offering yeah what's the sacrifice which synagogue had it right so wherever we get a group of men we're always going to have a group of opinions and the Israel is a nation who had one law and one God was very divided in their beliefs yeah and so everyone had a different way man has his own way God's ways are not our ways so God at the changing of this dispensation he sends the spirit of Elijah to prepare the way of the Lord because the Lord has a way the man has a way right churches have a way but God has a way and he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness preparing the way of the Lord and his message was repentant yes yeah because in order to come to God we must repent of our own way our own expectations and come God's Way yeah notice and I think it's more than just a repentance of sins of saying Lord I'm sorry for being a sinner but I think I think it's also a coming cleaning from man's traditions and man's ideas and a repentance a turning back to the Word of God Lord yes yeah we found here Malachi 4 and verse 5 says behold I send unto you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and notice what he's gonna he's gonna turn to hearts yeah he sees their attitude he sees ur neglect but he says he's going to turn the heart of the father's to the children and then the heart of the children back to the father's let's not come and smite there's with a curse so God's even telling them at the end of the Old Testament that I'm gonna see in you a prophet I'm gonna send you Elijah and his job is to turn the heart of the fathers in the heart of the children back to the to the Word of God praise the Lord well we're talking about the lame and blind sacrifices and whatever today I think it's it's the same thing that we can find today in Christian Christianity that there's become such a lukewarm this and I take whatever I have to offer you to God right you know so we bring in rock and roll we bring in our own entertainment and worship of other gods and and incorporate it in with Christianity and and we offer sacrifices with blemish or you know or yeah I can't come on Wednesdays and I'll come when I feel like coming and when I can get them when it's convenient when it's convenient for me and and the scripture cried out against those blemished sacrifices and John comes out and cries out repent yes but you're dealing with the proud people of people that to repent is to admit I've been wrong true and now I feel like you run into that in today's Christianity what'll I need to repent for I'm it I go to church yeah what do I need to repent for I you know me and my mama and my family's been going to this church for 50 years with Christians and so there there is a stiff-necked nough says it were as he you know refers to him in the Bible a stubbornness to not to not want to repent and not to even look into the Word of God I mean to even really look into it to see what it actually says about our day and our and for this reason people are missing their day of visitation my heaviness you find a revelation 3:15 John is speaking but he's speaking under the anointing of the Holy Spirit he says I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that that worked cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I was spew thee out of my mouth he's speaking to the Laodicean Church if you go back and you study the histories of Laodicea Laodicea was a very rich city they had they had a medical school they had things that they very industrious they Laodicea was and had to travel routes one was East and West was north the label Cielo was at the junction of his where they meant and so they had everything but there was one thing that label to see a lot they had the wealth they had the medical school they had industry but they didn't have water supply and so you find it here he's telling them I would that thou wert cold or hot so there were Springs that would come from aqueducts there would be hot springs that would come down by the time they got to label to see it they were lukewarm they were good if they were hot because it was used for medical purposes there was another one that flowed in then it was cold and it was another nearby city and it was good for refreshment but notice he said I would that work cold because it's refreshing or hot because it could be used for medical purposes but because you lukewarm you even got your you don't got to wear your you know your cooled off and that word means spewed out of my mouth means you make my stomach sick and I can't contain it right and so he just spews it makes him sick and that's what they would do to make somebody vomit up and that day they would give him lukewarm water and so Jesus is tell them you're say you're cold I mean you say you're rich you're increased with Goods you got all this they were more concerned about what they could produce than what they were the Word of God and we find that same aspect in this day and age we have so much knowledge so much wealth so much everything but we're not concerned about the Word of God and we find the people that's not hot nor cold goodness talk about the expectation or maybe the lack thereof but you know as you said I think maybe in the previous episode there was somebody God always has somebody somebody that's expecting somebody that's holding on somebody that's believing no matter what the situation is there's been 400 years if it's been a thousand years it's been 2,000 years somebody's gonna be expecting you know it talks about in Luke 2 he talks about that and there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed to him by the Holy go he was should not see death before he'd seen the Lord's Christ my goodness so somebody was looking for him you knew it was apparent and I believe in this time as bad as it is and his horrible disease and and like you said all the things that's going on there somebody that's really truly expecting amen it's been revealed to them been revealed to them and and they believe with all of them and then for the consolation and this was the old man don't matter what age you are how you know how you are what you are is it's holding on in faith believes God's gonna fulfill it the sense he appears to those that believe yes and so you have people say well we don't see miracles we don't see this he don't and then there next thing is he don't do that anymore we're right there you show why you don't see those things you don't believe yes miracles are for believers God moving in our midst is for believers right it's not for people or sitting back who says he don't do that you're right he's not gonna do that for you if you're not expecting and holding on with all your heart true which is why that's gonna be necessary there'd be a restoration in the end time to turn the hearts back right to the faith of the fathers and it turn us back to believing again yeah so you had a lukewarm Jewish Church as it worked and in Jesus Christ in the flesh walking amongst them doing signs doing wonders and there were but there were those that caught it there was and Jesus really gave us insight to the spiritual condition of that Church of that day I mean we you know he's only has a three and a half year ministry but the Gospels is the response of the religious community the believing Jews when Christ came he as you had quoted to me recently he came to his own yeah yeah and his own received him not and it gives us insight to the spiritual condition of the church Jesus pleading search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but isn't that label to see you who were it shows him on the outside of it not absolutely trying to get back in and we mean it you know said it and then turns and says if any man if anyone what open the door I'll come in every opportunity yes and and the Jewish people were given every opportunity yes so there was great grace that was being poured out in a day just before judgment struck a man named amen and so the Jews would actually go into 2,000 years of great tribulations and stress upon a people because of rejecting their Messiah and not seeing their day and their hour and their visitation so you know this kind of brings us up to the end of this session today or we have been talking about the ending of the Jewish dispensation and how it would then begin a new dispensation a new order of divine order where God would do a work in a people and he would call out a church for his namesake and we'll be talking about that in our next session as we talk about how that the law came to its end as Jesus would fulfill it and we are in another day of fulfilling a description hey god bless you on thank you for joining with us today thank you for
