========================================

foreign it happened so long ago and I cried out for Mercy then I pled the blood of Jesus [Music] forgive my sin but I still can't forget it it just won't go away so I wept again Lord washed my sins but this is all he'd say and what's in what scene that's as far away as East is from the West [Music] and what's in one sin it was gone the very minute to confess this it was buried in the sea of his forget [Music] s hardest thing you'll carry is a load of guilt and change we're meant to bury it so give it up in Jesus name our God is slow to anger quick to forgive our sins [Music] under the blood he'll never bring it up again till say what's in what's in this is far away as the East is from the West oh what's in is [Music] oh it was very name the sea of forgetfulness [Music] Lord please deliver me from my accusing memories nothing makes me weak this way then when I hear you say [Music] Watson [Music] what seems there's far ways East is from the West oh what's in what scene it was gone the very minutes you confess oh it's buried in his sea buried in the sea buried in the sea all of his forgetfulness and we can all say thank [Music] you for the great [Music] and though [Music] [Applause] with all your heart [Music] me for the grace that you you have given [Music]
