========================================

[Music] You are peace when everything around me is crumbling. [Music] You call me on the waves, then calm the sea. You are a peace. You are hope. When I have drifted far away [Music] from, I know that you'll be waiting down the road. You are home in the heartbreak, in the hurting. I will trust you in the waiting. You are always who you said you be. Consistently. [Music] [Applause] Oh, you are light and I am walking through the darkest [Applause] night. The word is there to guide me every time. You are alive in the heartbreak, in the hurting. I will trust you in the waiting. You are always who you said you be. In the breakthrough, in the blessing, I know you are never changing. You are always who you said you'd be. Consistently. There's joy in the morning, beauty in the burning. Only you were able to redeem. Mercy in the sunrise, breakthrough in the gray skies. Only you can help my eyes to see. Oh, there's joy in the morning, beauty in the burning. Only you were able to redeem. Mercy in the sunrise. Breakthrough in the gray skies. Only you can help my eyes to see. In the breakthrough, in the blessing, I know you are never changing. You are always who you said you'd be. At the mention of your name, you're close to me consistently. [Music] [Applause]
