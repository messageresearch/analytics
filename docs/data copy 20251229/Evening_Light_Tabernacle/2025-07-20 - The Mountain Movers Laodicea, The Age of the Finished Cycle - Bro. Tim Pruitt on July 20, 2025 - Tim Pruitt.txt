Brother Aaron, why don't we go to the Lord in prayer? Let's go to him this morning. Heavenly Father, we count it such a great honor this morning to just have this opportunity to come before your throne, come before your presence, Lord. And we just want to stop right now and invite you to take complete control, Lord. We just want to ask you to come in, Lord, and begin to deal with every situation, deal with every heart, Lord. Lord, we know you're the need supplier and we just thank you, Lord, that you you've never once left us alone. Lord, your word promised that you'd never leave us and you'd never forsake us. And Father, we can testify this morning that that word is true, Lord. Lord, your word is always true and you've always backed it up and kept it. And we just thank you this morning, Lord, that your hand of protection on our brother's life, Lord. We we thank you for your hand of protection on on all of us, Father, as we walk through this life, Father. and Lord, the evils that we face each and every day. And yet, we've always found you, not only beside us, but Lord, leading in the fight, Lord. And we just come to praise your name this morning. Lift it up, Father, because you deserve it. You're worthy of all glory and worthy of all praise. And you are the name above all names, Lord. And and I know there's coming a day when every knee shall bow in every tongue. But Lord, I want it to be today, Lord. My my knee is bowed to you today. And then and we're here to confess that you're the Lord of our lives, Lord. that Lord that we give you everything and we just want to ask you today if there be a place that we failed you. If there be Lord areas in our life not completely consecrated, I pray you'll forgive us of that, Lord, and just draw us closer today and increase our faith, Father. Lord, like the man said, Lord, I believe. Help thou my unbelief, Lord. I I want my faith lifted up this morning, Lord, more than ever, Lord, to the level of the promises that you've given us. Lord, we know your promises are true. We we know your word is true and we just invite you today to come and speak to us. Lord, may our worship please you. May it be a sweet sound in your ears, Father. Lord, I just pray today, Lord, for every need that was read across this desk, Lord, that that was turned in. Sister Janice, Lord, and that that need and brother Jason Tagard and him and his son, Lord, and Lord, for Lillian Wear, Father, Sick, each one, Lord, you took stripes for those bodies, Lord. Lord, you promise that you're the healer and we believe it. We've seen it manifested in our midst and we ask you once again to go on behalf of these needs, Lord. And Lord, I know every person here has needs, Lord. I have needs and I'm just asking today to speak directly. Father, may you anoint our pastor to speak today to step aside and Lord, may you speak today to us, Father. May the words, Lord, find a good ground today. May we not reject it, turn away from it, or harden our hearts. But today, Lord, may we allow it to take root in our life. Lord, I pray for brother Timothy and brother Joe, both out today ministering. May you use them, Lord, for your glory. Anoint them, Father, that that your kingdom will be lifted up. We love you, Lord.

And Sister Vicki, nice to have you back in church after being um infirmed there for so long. And the Lord is now bringing a restoration. We thank the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wednesday night, we saw Sister Lisa here. So, we know the Lord's working, doing things, and his grace is abundant, his protection upon you. Brother Peter, God bless you. Thank you for coming today. And and uh he's already professing he's healed. So, Amen. After being in the emergency room last night after losing his car, uh we just pray that God will help help him. Now, you know, life kind of throws some disappointments along the journey, but uh the Lord is gracious and helps us in every situation, and I know he'll do that for you today. Amen. God bless you as we worship the Lord together. And uh we're going to be today we're going to be speaking on um Leodosa the age of the finished cycle. And um and as you know we have been speaking on the mountain movers which is from Zechariah 4 and7. Who art thou oh great mountain? Thou shalt become a plain and the headstone shall be brought forth with shoutings crying grace grace unto it. And I believe there's a lot of grace in this age. &gt;&gt; But for our service today, we're going to be looking here at Revelation 3:14. And it says, "Unto the angel of the church of the Leodysians, write these things, say the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would that thou work cold or hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth, because thou sayest, I am rich, and increase with goods, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. And then he continues right on saying um I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried it in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raignment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes is that thou mayest see. As many as I love I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous therefore and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will suck with him and he with me. To him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne. Even as I also overcame, and am sat down with my father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. Then we're going to go to Revelation 4:1. After this, I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was as it were, of a trumpet talking with me, which said, "Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be hereafter." Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. I believe there's a people within the Leodysian age who are the overcomers within the age. It'll be this age that sees this headstone that we just read about from Zechariah. Jesus Christ will come to the body and um it will be by grace that she will overcome because God's great favor is upon our lives. Now the seven church ages um uh you know are the seven churches rather that were addressed by Christ in revelation. They were gentile churches located in Asia Minor and these churches are not merely meant to be historical but they are prophetic and dispensational. And each one were unveiled a phase in the mystery of God's redemptive work among the Gentiles. Now I want you to understand uh the book of revelation is our book. It is for the end time people and it is our message and so many of these things which were symbolic in the scripture are now made known in this last day. And so God would actually write things in the book of Revelation that would um be in symbolic form and he wouldn't really just totally clarify his plan at that time because he left it to the last days and it would be then revealed to the end time people. Now God did this on purpose. He knew his coming would be ages later. Seven in fact, seven ages later. And so he actually wanted every person in every age to go down with it expecting the Lord to come and watching for his appearing. &gt;&gt; So he wanted everybody to be in a state of readiness. &gt;&gt; In fact, with his um coming, he always uses the word watch. So watch is associated with his coming. And so we're living in a rapture hour and is a time of watchfulness and and so um it's a time where there is an unveiling or a making known of God's redemptive plan. He's letting us know where we are in time and where what he has been doing through the ages so that we could of course have a even a greater level of expectancy than other ages have had. Now, of course, as we mentioned that these um about these churches um and and there's things that we want to point out about them as brother Brandham tells us in the Ephesian church age. Now, I think there's something else you ought to know. The seven churches were addressed by John are in Asia Minor and they're all gentile churches. Now, this is a very important part. He does not speak to the church at Jerusalem, which is mostly Jewish with perhaps a few Gentiles in it. The reason is that God has turned from the Jews to the Gentiles. And thus the whole of the church ages, all seven church ages is God dealing with the Gentiles and calling out a Gentile bride to himself. And that makes the church ages and the fullness of the Gentiles the one and the same thing. So whatever God does for the Gentiles, he will do it in these seven ages. Now, this is going to be important especially as we come along into this Leodysian age so that we will know and identify the hour that we're in and know um that we in other words prepare us that we can be watchful in this hour &gt;&gt; instead of just slumbering on thinking that time's just going to go right on because we are now at the end of the ages. So notably the church in Jerusalem which was primarily Jewish in its early days is not mentioned and there's all of these seven or gentile churches and this uh mission was intentional. It was by the time of John's writing God had already turned to the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name's sake. You find that in Acts 15:14. Thus, the entire span of the seven church ages represents God's dealing with the gentile world, specifically with his gentile bride. And when the Leodysian age ends, the gospel again turns to the Jews. And that's where we are. As you can already see, it is poised to go back there the as we have received the last message and the Jews are now back in their homeland in order to receive their Messiah. Right? So, and and so we're we're right here at the time where it's about to turn to the Jews, but it has not yet. God is still finishing up the time of the Gentiles. That's why we are still in the Leodysian age. And this is why the church ages and the fullness of the Gentiles spoken of in Revelation or Romans um 11:25 are one and the same prophetic timeline. And just as a church began with a spiritfilled bride at Pentecost, it will conclude with a spiritfilled bride. washed in the blood, filled with the spirit, clothed in the revealed word of her day. So I want you to understand it's like the planting of the wheat. It begins with the grain, it ends with the grain. So we are here again at a completed cycle or the finishing cycle. So, as you're seeing this, we're we're going to understand again from brother Brandham telling us the seven church ages set forth in in Revelations chapter 2 and three, it takes in the whole span of the fullness of the Gentiles or the whole time which God is dealing with the Gentiles under salvation. When the gent when the Leodysian in age ends, there will be no more Gentiles saved. As long as the Leodysian the seventh age is going on, there are still opportunities for people to in the Gentiles to be saved. Then it will turn back to the Jews. And we're living right now in this. And I want you to notice these two quotes. the it's very clear the seven church ages represent the fullness of the Gentiles. God's dealing with the Gentile world are confined to these ages. He he does not deal with the Gentiles out of this prophetic timework or framework. It is um within these ages that God calls out a bride from each generation, a people for his name to be united with him. So God will have a bride out of every generation or every age. Now in every age, God will address both the true and the false vines. This is very important when you're reading the about these seven churches or you're reading our part of the book of in the book of revelation of the leodysian age. You see he's not addressing us completely as the bride. He's also addressing the false vine. He is speaking to both of them. Though there's only one message, it comes through the messenger to both groups. And the spirit speaks to them as if they were one church. And that is why the letters to the churches in Revelation are directed to a singular body. Yet within that body are two distinct spiritual seeds. Remember now as as the son of man went to sew the seed, he swed the good seed, right? And then his enemy came and swed a tear and he said, "Let them grow together. They're all going to be in the same field. They're all going to be under the opaces of the same church that will all be in the same framework of the of the church. And Jesus will address both of them as though they were his own." Now you might ask why does God even refer to the churches including the false vine as his churches? Well the answer is sobering is because these individuals are in name Christian &gt;&gt; and they profess Christ. They assemble, they worship, and they claim the promises, but they do in vain. As Jesus said in Mark 7:7, "How be it in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines and commandments of men." So these are nominal Christians, believers in the flesh, but not of the spirit. You see, they bear his name, but not his life. They belong to the outward church, but they're not part of the body of Christ. The true believer, by contrast, has been baptized into Christ by the Holy Ghost and made a living member of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So yet, even so, it is God's divine order now that the wheat and the tears grow together. And the false is not to be uprooted prematurely. God allows them to continue all the way to the end. So you're going to see two vines in every church age. And this is important in this age to know there are two vines and they're both coming to maturity in this last day because this is the final climax where the harvest of all of it comes. Now, so you see um there God will let them grow together until the harvest and then their time of binding and burning will come but not yet. &gt;&gt; Right? It's important to understand that these church ages consist of these two vines, one true and one false. The true bride, the true bride, listen to me close, the true bride in the Leodysian age is not the Christ rejector. Amen. The one who shuts him out, the one who leaves him knocking on the outside is the false vine, &gt;&gt; not the elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is she who is lukewarm, self-sufficient, void of the spirit. She's the one that says that Christ says, "I'll spew you out of my mouth." Declaring, "You will not speak for me. You are not my voice. You are your own voice." &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's not so with the true bride. She hears his voice. She opens the door. She welcomes him in. &gt;&gt; And well, while the false church boast of her riches and need of nothing, the bride of Christ humbly receives what he offers. &gt;&gt; You see, he offers gold tried in the fire, white raignment to cover her. Isab to see clearly in a deceived generation. I want you to know God makes provision so there can be a victorious bride in the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. He the church that he started out with when he said on this rock of the revelation of who I am, I will build my church and he said the gates of hell will not prevail against it. I want you to understand the bride in Leodysa does not go down in defeat. She leaves here in total victory &gt;&gt; now. So you see she overcomes the spirit of the antichrist because she walks in revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that revelation is supernatural. It's not intellectually. It comes from a new birth that allows him to understand spiritual things because you can only understand spiritual things by the new birth. Jesus said to Nicodemus, you know, you must be born again in order to see or understand the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; So you see, it takes a new birth in order for us to see or to understand. So it is not an intellectual understanding or knowledge or learning. It is a revelation that must come from the new birth which is the spirit. Now the eyes have the spirit of course removes the smoke of deception. And brother, there's more of it than ever in this last day. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 9 depicts that the a great star falling from heaven. Notice a fallen star. He's given permission or a key to open the bottomless pit. And when he does, all the smoke of blinded delusion comes out. &gt;&gt; And of course, it it permeates the age and it permeates everywhere. is it taints, you know, the um everything. It gets in every crack and crevice of humanity. &gt;&gt; And you see, but the is of the Holy Ghost removes the smoke of deception so that we can see the word clearly. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for Isab? &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, she the bride does not blend with the system. She rises above it. She reflects Christ. enough the culture around her. &gt;&gt; She is not lukewarm. She's on fire with the life of the word. &gt;&gt; Now this Leodysian age that we have read about. It is being the first age is the very hour that the rapture will take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the age that Christ calls his bride to come up. You see, she is lifted. She is lifted from the lukewarmness from the compromise from the self-satisfied religion of Leodysia and but not physically removed from the era immediately but spiritually separated. Amen. Awakened by the voice of the final messenger. That's what I'm telling you. His his his fan is in his hand and he is thoroughly purging his floor and he has taken even you as the bride of Christ and separating the chaff from the grain. &gt;&gt; Understand that even you should say Lord let your spirit flow through me today and separate all the chaff out of my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remove it all Lord because none of that can go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now this is why the the promise to the overcomer in Leodysia is so powerful and so significant. It says to him that overcomemeth &gt;&gt; will I grant to sit with me in my throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is that? That is the bride's reward. &gt;&gt; And her reward is union with her husband king. &gt;&gt; Amen. is not at the end of the future era, but it's the close of this one. The rapture occurs within Leodysa, not beyond it. &gt;&gt; And until that moment, the bride is here in this Leodysian age, but not in his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Until the rapture, the bride re remains within the framework of Leodysia, but not conformed to it. She is under the influence and the ministry and the message of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; And that seventh angel calls her out and awakens her and prepares her for the coming of the bridegroom. That's what this message is about. &gt;&gt; Our end time message is about awakening a people. Not letting you go on in sleep and slumber, but awaken you &gt;&gt; where you can see clearly your day and your hour. You must recognize your hour of visitation. &gt;&gt; Remember, she hears his voice. She trims her lamps. She anoints her eyes. And she makes herself ready. &gt;&gt; I want you to get it. You got something to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You got something to do. You got to make yourself ready. &gt;&gt; Examine the fire in your life. &gt;&gt; Examine whether or not there's oil. &gt;&gt; Examine examine your life and and and rub this. Get the sleep out of your eyes. &gt;&gt; Rub eyes out in it. &gt;&gt; You're going to need an abundant supply of it &gt;&gt; because smoke after smoke is coming from every kind of direction that you can look at. I mean, look where I mean, it is so smoky. You can't they can't even tell a man for whether a woman is a man or a man is a woman. And they can't even call them what they are. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; We're we're in a day and hour where there's confusion everywhere. And it's because of the smoke of this society, of the lukewarm age that we're living in. But God has given you eyes &gt;&gt; so that you can see in this hour that you will not be a blind le oysia &gt;&gt; but you will recognize your day and his message. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to get it. The call that says come out of her my people in Revelation 18:4 is not about leaving geography or time but about leaving mixture, leaving compromise, leaving spiritual death. It is a call to separation, sanctification, and readiness. &gt;&gt; Come out of her, my people. &gt;&gt; To be clear, the call to come out of Leodysa is not a call to leave the age. For the bride is not yet removed from Leodysia itself, but rather from its spirit, its systems, and its deception. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? And when we're caught up to meet the Lord, then she is removed from the age &gt;&gt; and from its judgment. &gt;&gt; She is raptured at the climax. For while the age spirals toward apost apostasy, the bride ascends into glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she is clothed, she is refined, she is anointed, and she is united with Jesus Christ on his throne. The rapture will take place in the Leodysian age. You are in the age of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bradom tells us this in the as before he leaves just days before he leaves and that where he says we find here that Enoch was the seventh from Adam which was a type of the church ages. All the rest of the six men before him died but Enoch was translated. Enoch was raptured. the seventh showing it's the seventh church age that takes the rapture. Now there's no doubt we are in the seventh church age. We all know it. &gt;&gt; Now there seems to be a bit of confusion today as to whether we are in the seventh church age. And you say, "Brother Tim, why is that even important?" Because if you if you teach this incorrectly, you build a platform for these eight day messengers. And also, you know, you you you allow people to to believe there's another age and to be led out from under the seventh angel in his message. &gt;&gt; So, it's important that we understand that there are no more ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are in the last age. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the age that the rapture takes place. Now again um the seventh age church age it's the seventh church age that takes the rapture all the other six died but Enoch was translated because he was not found God took him. Isn't it wonderful that even in the book of the beginnings in the seed chapter of the Bible that God maps it out &gt;&gt; and he shows that the seventh one from Adam &gt;&gt; will take the rapture. Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him. What was it? He was prophesying of you coming. He was prophesying of your age. &gt;&gt; You are in the pro the prophecy of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Enoch represents you. &gt;&gt; Now, so you see all the other six ages went down to death, but Enoch was translated for he was not found for God took him. Enoch raptured was a type of all the rest of them dying. But the end time bride will be called out. The rapturing without death will be called out of the seventh church age which we are now bearing record of that age. Oh my. Let's dig in deep real deep. So you know to me this is very important. &gt;&gt; It's important one thing to go back over some of this. I know maybe to some of you you want to yawn and say this is hoham. I learned this many many years ago, but I'm telling you right now, we got we got new people that are just now hearing. &gt;&gt; We got people that have been here for years that are just now hearing. &gt;&gt; So, you know, today I pray that it'll open up your understanding. But we are now bearing record of that age. &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that thought. If you're lukewarm, wretched, blind, and naked, then you are bearing witness to the false vine that exists within Leodysia. &gt;&gt; This bride will not be lukewarm. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may claim the name of Christ. You may claim the message. You may claim Evening Light Tabernacle is your home church. But your life is testifying against you. You see the very condition of spiritual poverty and the blindness is the evidence that you belong to the vine that has rejected the word and shut Christ outside the door. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Tim, in a message church, yes, sir." &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham said, "And how can I overcome?" He said, "That old rotten log laying there in the very source of life." And he said, "You can sit right in the church where the spirit of God is moving and the and the Holy Spirit is flowing and rock twice as quick. &gt;&gt; It's important that you keep that life." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, but if your faith has been purified, &gt;&gt; is if if it's been refined by the fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you have been turned back to the apostolic faith of the fathers, then you are bearing witness of the true vine &gt;&gt; in this final age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many is bearing witness of that vine? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh yes, sir. That's the gold tried in the fire. A tested, proven, enduring faith. Amen. It's not a man-made religion, but it's a spirit-born revelation. And that kind of faith identifies you as a part of the overcoming bride, the elect who has heard the voice of the last messenger and turned back to the word. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful hour we're living &gt;&gt; again. If we look here, so no, now notice Enoch the type here. He's also typed in the seventh church age. Can you think of it? The seven church age. Notice at the sounding of how many believes there's been seven messengers for seven churches. Oh, we all believe it if we believe the Bible. If we don't believe the Bible, of course, we don't believe it, but there has been. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many knows that's in Revelation chapter 1, the last verse? said. Then he goes on to tell us that that we're living in the seventh church age. And when the Bible said that this seventh church age, when the messenger of the seventh church age begins to sound this message that the mystery of all these things that's been twisted up down through the age would be revealed in that time. Here we see it. the son of man coming among his people and doing exactly confirming his message as he said he would do. Here we find it in this last age now. So I want you to get this. The son of man Christ is revealed in the leodysian age. &gt;&gt; This is where he's revealed now. And the seventh watch like the seven like the seven watch one of them of of one come. He didn't come the first watch, second, third, fourth, but in the seventh watch. That was Enoch the seventh which was translated. And Noah being a type of the remnant of the Jews is to be carried over. Look at there. Noah even types the Jews &gt;&gt; because he goes, they go through the tribulation waters &gt;&gt; over into the millennium. So you have the whole thing, the whole picture, the whole thing mapped out for you right there in the first chapters of the book of Genesis &gt;&gt; where he lays the seed of what he's going to do in the end time. &gt;&gt; Right? He will have an Enoch who will take a rapture. He will have a Noah who will go through the tribulation. &gt;&gt; And those are the Jews and they will cross over into the millennium. Now, so Noah being a type of the remnant of the Jews is to be carried over. Now, the Bible in the Bible time talking about watches, the nights were not divided into hours in Bible times. Now, we're going to look at this for a moment because we're going to talk about the watches of the night. And and in ancient time, the Jews originally divided the watches in into three. And so we see the first watch with sunset to 1000 p.m. and second watch 1000 p.m. to 2 am and third watch 2 am to sunrise. But when you get over into the New Testament, you will find it talking about a fourth watch. And that's because they were under the Roman system. And under the Roman influence, they had this four watch system that they adopted. And there were segments of time from from sunset to sunrise. And the and during this time, the sentinels would would keep guard. And and while the while the world lay in darkness, it was really important to have watchmen &gt;&gt; that was watching in the night &gt;&gt; because you never knew when the enemy came. And and it was that in the final watch in the New Testament which was the fourth watch before the dawn that Jesus came walking on the water. So he come there and for deliverance remember brother Brandham preaching testimony on the sea and whatever and how we're there in that in that in that very time where some have went off without him and others he's in the boat but he's asleep &gt;&gt; right and it's condition of the end time well it's in the last what or the leodysian age that Jesus comes to deliver walking on the waters &gt;&gt; amen to deliver us in this time uh you know that where it's the darkest hour before before the light. Now night began when Jesus left the earth. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to get this because since the departure of the son Jesus Christ the church was plunged into darkness. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So we have been in a time of darkness. for now 2,000 years are seven churches. &gt;&gt; All right? So, the church has been there. Now, when when he when he he left the earth, it became dark cuz he is the day star or the sun, &gt;&gt; right? What is the day star? &gt;&gt; Let the day star rise in your heart. Remember that in the Bible? What is that? That's the sun. It's the star of the day. It's what brings the light of the day. Now, he's the day star, but the church is depicted here as candlesticks &gt;&gt; or lampstands, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you don't use them during the day, &gt;&gt; use them at night. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he left, the church became God's light on the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as Revelation 1:20 explains, the seven stars of the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou saw us are seven churches. So the the candlesticks represent seven ages and the seven stars or seven angels are messengers. &gt;&gt; So there are seven messengers. And of course, excuse me, it's during the night when the the sun is absent that you see the stars come out. &gt;&gt; So, it's nighttime and there are stars out. Specifically, there are seven stars. &gt;&gt; Right? And there are seven lampstands. So, seven lights in the heavens bearing the the the light of God down to the earth, shining back upon the earth. They're really no light of their own. They are reflectors &gt;&gt; of the sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the sun is absent, but it's shining on them and they're shining back a reflection of Christ back on the earth. So, what was Luther's message? Justification. What was that? A reflection of Christ. What was sanctification? A reflection of Christ. What is his message? A reflection of Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So you see as we see now then the our night of this church ages is not divided in four watches or three watches. It's divided in seven watches. &gt;&gt; Okay? Because there are seven church ages. So this night watch is divided in seven watches. And each age had a &gt;&gt; watchman, &gt;&gt; had a messenger, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he would warn of the coming dangers. &gt;&gt; And he would tell what hour it was and the relationship of of the light of the sun and he would reflect back God's glory upon the earth &gt;&gt; bringing God's message to his people. &gt;&gt; It's all laid out in the Bible. See, we have been in this time of darkness. And and now prophetically, we're living in this last watch or the seventh age. &gt;&gt; It is the very edge of night before the rising of the sun of righteousness. &gt;&gt; And that's what prompted our messenger, our watchman to preach messages like shalom. &gt;&gt; What was he a watchman? And he's saying, "The morning cometh. &gt;&gt; The night is still here, but the morning's coming." &gt;&gt; Right? There's another day coming. Shalom. I'm already saying good morning, church. &gt;&gt; Because the light is about to dawn. We're in the last days. Good morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, that yep, even peaked over the horizon. But here he's coming out announcing the coming day. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's telling the time. &gt;&gt; He's telling the hour that we're in. Amen. And he preaches other messages like it is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're about to enter into a new dispensation. The the night is coming to end and the sun is now rising. &gt;&gt; Ain't that awesome? Where we're living at. Amen. The Now, the term watch doesn't just describe time. It speaks of responsibility. It speaks of vigilance of those who stand in the night and look toward the east for the first light of the sun. &gt;&gt; And long before the day dawns and the sun comes up, there appears and the morning star in the horizon. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to understand the morning star, you know, is most commonly referred to as as the planet Venus and it always appears in the eastern sky just before the dawn. And often when the night is still at its darkest, seem like just before dawn, it gets the darkest ever. &gt;&gt; That's the age that we're in. &gt;&gt; But in that time, the morning star appears. in the eastern sky and then this luminous celestial body. It it serves as a harbinger of the coming day as a sign the night is nearly over &gt;&gt; and the sun is about to rise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen, this is how it works. Naturally speaking, as we said, the morning star Venus rises just before the sun, often visible at the coldest, darkest part of the night. &gt;&gt; Amen. You notice it usually reaches its coldest temperature just before dawn. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's it gets the darkest ever just before dawn. and its brightness and that morning star pierces through the lingering darkness and it acts as a signal that daylight is approaching. That's naturally. Now the sun isn't visible yet. The appearance of the morning star though means it's close. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The night cannot last much longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now Jesus said in Revelation 22:16, he said, "I am the root and the offspring of David, I am the bright and the morning star." &gt;&gt; So we know who the morning star is. &gt;&gt; So Jesus as a morning star, he appears before the full dawn of the millennial day, before the sun rises in full glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now his coming through the word revealed through the the revealing of the word the Holy Spirit is poured out and the bride is awakening. It is like the morning star signaling the eternal day is near. &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand the revealed word that we've received the Holy Spirit being poured out in this last day. &gt;&gt; The awakening of the bride, &gt;&gt; it is all like the morning star. signaling that that um the eternal day is near. The morning star ministry in the bride rises while it's spiriously dark before the world recognizes the day is breaking. Now it is said by Peter and he said um you know where where or excuse me it's it says by in in revelation where he says Jesus said I'm the root and the offspring of David the bride and morning star. Let's go to the next slide now. And and second Peter 1:19 says until the day dawn &gt;&gt; and the day star rise in your heart. You see that's what happens to you. &gt;&gt; You see you you you're you were sometimes darkness &gt;&gt; but now you are light in the world. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What happened there? There you're darkened soul back as midnight. There came a dawning of a new day &gt;&gt; and the sun rose in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And what's it do? It dispels the darkness. It gets rid of the shadows. &gt;&gt; All the the evils of the night is gone away. Sin, it's darkness. It's wickedness all flees away when the light dawns in her soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You take a woman like the woman at the well there so dark, so black. Amen. And and her predestinated sea so hidden. Amen. And covered up with sin. of prostitution and life of even religious doctrines and things that covered her up until she was black as black could be. But the same one at the beginning that said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; Amen. Had a divine appointment for her life. &gt;&gt; And he had a need to pass by her way. And that day dawned within her soul and she could say, "Come see a man who told me everything I did. Isn't this the very Christ? The light had dawned within her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to men and women today that light has dawned within your soul. You are no longer darkness anymore. Sin has vanished. The works of darkness has fled away. You are new creature in Christ. Hallelujah. Evil spirits can't hang around anymore because you are a living vibrant testimony of the day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that means till the day dawn that means a personal revelation of Christ before the rapture. Remember that's what the new birth is to you. It's a revelation of Christ personally to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so before the day of the world sees the son return in judgment, the son of man reveals himself just before Sodom burns. The bride receives this light first. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why God sent you a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You receive the light first &gt;&gt; before it ever dawns in the millennium. You've already got the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That dispelled the darkness &gt;&gt; of the past ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so the bride receives as like first a forast of the coming glory before he appears to the rest of the world. So the book is opened, it is seals removed, exposing the errors of the dark night of the ages and revealing the true Christ of the revealed word. So the morning star heralds the morning. It says to those watching, hold on. The night is almost over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, that's the message from the morning star &gt;&gt; to you today right here in Leosia. No matter how dark it is, &gt;&gt; hold on, my child. &gt;&gt; Hold on. Joy comes in the morning. Amen. The darkest hour means dark. It's just in sight. It won't always be darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the light the light has sprung up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there the morning star comes out heralding. Now remember it's Venus, you know, in the natural, but in the spiritual Jesus of course is that morning star, but it it also represents the messengers. &gt;&gt; And here is it shines his message. It is because the sun is approaching that it gets so bright. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know the reason we've had the bright day of a of a message in this day, somebody help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is because the light has shown upon a messenger who beam back a message back to the earth saying it will not always be dark. &gt;&gt; The ages will not be perpetuated. There's not another age coming. You have received reached the end time. You are here in the last days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so in this time of darkness, the m morning star is rising in the hearts of God's elect. It's the word in power manifesting itself among us with raptured faith. Amen. It's and and when that star rises in full manifestation, it won't be long now until we're caught up and the day breaks eternal. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I look around and I see aged ones among us. And I'm getting into that bracket myself aware that I'm older now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not old, but older. &gt;&gt; And as we approach that, we've been along the road a long time. Amen. We've waited a long time. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know, friends, joy lays just ahead. &gt;&gt; Don't give up now. &gt;&gt; Don't lay down your sword. Don't get weary and welloing. &gt;&gt; Press the battle more than you've ever pressed. If you've ever fought, fight like you've never fought. Put every bit of energy, everything that you have into this last battle because we are here before the breaking of the day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham tells us about the seventh watch. It's the watch of the resurrection. Oh, listen now. The hour we're living, oh God, the world is falling apart. There hangs in the hangers bombs. It hangs the things to do just exactly. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, we're here. It's a dark hour. &gt;&gt; Sodom is about to burn. The church is ready. &gt;&gt; She's sealed in, ready to come. &gt;&gt; There will be a big outpouring of the spirit. Yes, sir. To grab that church and take her into the skies. &gt;&gt; Say, "I ain't expecting nothing, Brother Tim. Open your eyes. get under expectation. &gt;&gt; There will be a big outpouring of the spirit. We're in it. &gt;&gt; That's him moving among us. That's him healing our sick. That's him dealing with the lost. That's him calling those that are prodicals. That's him. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is he doing? It's his outpouring to grab a church and take her into the sky. This is the final burst of the latter rain culminating in a lightning charge of the chains of the body &gt;&gt; because see the church the word the bride and Christ's ministry is where in his bride which his body the celestial I meant to say the supernatural body of his or on the spiritual body on the earth his spirit is in there living his life right out until him and the church becomes one in the wedding. See, they become one. He takes them just a little minority in the last day. And then all those virgins that slept down to the age they all rose. &gt;&gt; Now, that's on the seventh watch, &gt;&gt; the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to get it. The re the resurrection takes place &gt;&gt; in this age. &gt;&gt; You are in the age of the resurrection, &gt;&gt; the seventh age. Amen. So notice he said at the last or the at last end time le oysia at that end of when that little just a little group of them went in. But it brings all the resurrection of those who died in their ages living to that word that was ordained of God preached to happen in that day. &gt;&gt; Oh my, what an hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. My goodness. All those virgins about to rise. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is he saying? Arise and shine. Thy light has come &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brethren, we're not in decline. &gt;&gt; We're where the Holy Spirit is being poured out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where he says, "The glory of the Lord is risen upon you. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee." Oh, talk about it now. We're glorified with our soul. But wait till that day when we get glorified bodies that match the glorified soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the prophetic timeline of the gentile church of the seventh church ages, night fell when the sun, the day star departed the earth. And when the sun goes down, the stars come out. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You don't see them out now. But when you when the when the when the the sun goes down, stars come out. &gt;&gt; And when the sun left, when Jesus left, stars came out. &gt;&gt; The seven stars, the seven messengers were set in place, one for each watch of the night to hold forth the word in a dark world darkened by sin and error. &gt;&gt; Think about what I'm saying. Brother Brandon would preach it like this. Watchmen, what of the night? &gt;&gt; You see, that's what we wanted to know. Where are we in time? &gt;&gt; What is the enemy doing? What do you see? Oh, watchmen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. God gave us a prophet with an eagle eye in this day that could all look all the way back and trace him all the way down to the ages, all the way down to now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What an age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; The seven stars of the seven angel messengers of the seven churches. You are the light of the world, said Jesus. &gt;&gt; Neither do men put a light a light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick. &gt;&gt; He puts a he takes his light, sets it on a candlestick. &gt;&gt; Not only did he say, "I am the light," but he said, "You are the light." Yes. &gt;&gt; And if his word is in you, bearing record of itself, then you are the light of the world. And I want you to know, we are the light &gt;&gt; in this time of darkness. &gt;&gt; The seven golden candlesticks, his elect church, each burning in its appointed age, have given light through the long cold night of the church ages. &gt;&gt; And now we have come to the final watch. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're the light in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're the light in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham talked about this in souls in prison now. And he he said and he likened you. You sisters where they look and why you got that little bun on your back and here you are what them long skirts and unpainted faces. And he says you know that they don't think she's anything. But he said, "You just remember this. &gt;&gt; You just remember this. Just like the moon holds back the tides." &gt;&gt; And he said, "It can't. The tide can't come in or go out without eternity's head." &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "So are you, little sister, holding the wrath of God off this earth." &gt;&gt; But you're not going to be here forever. &gt;&gt; You're about to be lifted up out of here. And when it happens, chaos will will come upon the world that we live in. Sin, darkness, unbelief will take its toll. &gt;&gt; Now, so we've come to the final watch, the seventh, the last, the darkest. But this is also the watch of the sunrise. &gt;&gt; Son of man revealing himself &gt;&gt; for you that fear my name. How many fears his name? &gt;&gt; How many reverences him? How many loves his word? To you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise &gt;&gt; with what? Healing in his wings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, the rays of that light that comes up in the morning and you see that comes up like rays for coming out moving the darkness back. What's it doing? Bringing healing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's dispelling the darkness. the fears of the night. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, are you with me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. During the night, you were there and you were looking there at that old ghost on the post and you were there all worried and scared and fearful and afraid. Amen. But when the light shines, it shows it ain't nothing but an old coat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It dispels the fear. It takes away the darkness. Hallelujah. It causes you to rise in faith. It brings healing in his wings. &gt;&gt; Healing for the sick soul, healing for the sin sick body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, you that fear my name. Do you know that's the first verse of Malachi 4. It's actually the second verse. To you that fear my name &gt;&gt; shall the son of righteousness arise. &gt;&gt; What did he do? sent Elijah the prophet to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers. You see, rising with healing in his wings. And this very watch, the bride watch, the midnight hour, a cry has gone out. Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go you out to meet him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it's the hour of awakening. You you know you were awakened. &gt;&gt; What happened the you see the moment when when the watchmen are crying from the towers warning of the approaching dawn and return to the bridegroom for his bride. You were awakened by a midnight cry and the day star was rising in the hearts of the elect. And the light of full restoration is breaking on the horizon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. friends, the world will get darker and darker, but not you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your light, your your life is about to get brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter. Amen. And the glory of the Lord rises upon you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the church that you are part of. Not a fallen church, not a wretched church, not a blind people, but an awakened people. A people who know their God and do exploits. A people who are called for his name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The seventh watch is not a watch of despair. It's the watch of transition. &gt;&gt; The very moment. The very moment when the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; The living bride shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the full redemption of the body takes place. That's the hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; And friends, all of this happens in your age. &gt;&gt; It all happens in the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; It's the seventh watch. And we're not waiting for another watch. &gt;&gt; The night is almost over. &gt;&gt; And we're not looking for another star. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, there's been a lot of stars out there, but they're falling stars and they're foaming out their own shame. And &gt;&gt; you know, this one over here, he's the apostle to bring clarity to the message. Here, this one over here, he's the teacher to to to say what brother Brandham couldn't say. And all the we we're not looking for another star. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the final watch of the night and the dawn is near. &gt;&gt; Can I say let our hearts be stirred? Let every lamp be trimmed for the son of righteousness is rising. When Jesus comes for his bride, the long night of the Gentile church ages end. And the times of the Gentiles will be over. &gt;&gt; That's when it will be brought to pass the scripture. Let him that is filthy be filthy still. Let him that is holy be holy still. The Gentiles will be locked forever &gt;&gt; in that state. &gt;&gt; No more grace. &gt;&gt; The gospel turns to the Jews. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see, but you are not of the night. You're all children of the light &gt;&gt; and children of the day. We're not the night nor of the darkness. So it says, "Therefore let us," now here's our admon admonition, "let us not sleep as do others, &gt;&gt; but let us watch &gt;&gt; and be serious, &gt;&gt; be sober, &gt;&gt; be sincere, &gt;&gt; be dedicated, &gt;&gt; this is the trumpet call to the bride in the last hour. We're living in the final watch of the night, the last moments before the dawning of the eternal day. &gt;&gt; While gross darkness covers the people, the bride is not slumbering. Oh no, I hope you're not one of those that just keeps hitting the alarm clock. Shut up. And it'll sound again. Shut up. Let me sleep a little longer. Reminds me, you know what we do so often. You know, we don't want to we don't want to hear the alarm. We don't want to respond to it. &gt;&gt; We want to sleep on a little longer. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of you have been hitting the alarm. &gt;&gt; Turning off the voice &gt;&gt; that is calling on awakening. It's &gt;&gt; time, friend, to listen to the voice. &gt;&gt; Get up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll be too late one day. &gt;&gt; You will miss your hour of visitation. &gt;&gt; You see, the night is filled with spiritual slumber. Churches are sleep informality. Souls are intoxicated by worldliness. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. The hearts are weighed down by apathy. Sleep has blinded the eyes. It's drowsiness making them lukewarm. It's the condition of the last age. And Jesus warned us of it. &gt;&gt; I want you to see his sobering warning. Take heed to yourself lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfing and drunkenness. and cares of this life so that they come on you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. &gt;&gt; These words from Jesus are not addressed to the world alone. These are words to his disciples. &gt;&gt; Notice what he said. Take heed to yourselves. He's speaking to his disciples. to the church to those who profess to follow him. It's a warning of spiritual dullness. &gt;&gt; It's a hearts that are weighed down and is not necessarily by just sin, you know, in its obvious form, but excess, &gt;&gt; distraction, &gt;&gt; indifference. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? Amen. &gt;&gt; A great burden, the prophet said, of the last age is the pressure of riches, self-living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, in this Leodysian age, this scripture right here takes on a very piercing re revelance to us because Jesus describes Leodysia similar. He said, "You're rich. Increase the goods have a need of nothing." Now, our temptation is different than other ages. Other ages, you'd proclaim to believe in Christ, you would die for it. &gt;&gt; You would be taken to the stake. I mean for owning a Bible, for translating the Bible, &gt;&gt; they were burned, &gt;&gt; killed, tormented, tortured. You see, they were tempted by the pressures of persecution &gt;&gt; where they were burned at stake and their families tortured and starved and they faced hunger and tribulation. They literally ran for their lives. But this is not where we're tested. &gt;&gt; This is the age where our test is in a different area. &gt;&gt; It's the age of excess. &gt;&gt; It's an age of abundance. is a age of endless entertainment &gt;&gt; of information and information overload. &gt;&gt; You know how it is. You got to know what next thing did Trump do? What's Israel happening now? What's happening there? What's happening the the stock? Is it going to crash today? What? You know, it's information overload. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And we're caught up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yet with all, you see, we're we we're And then we get self-reliant, you know, yet with all this complexity and advancement, it's really marked by a spiritual apathy, a lukewarmness &gt;&gt; where that the hearts of many are overcharged. Look at that word, overcharged. They are burdened, bloated, and dull. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Pay heed to yourselves. This is personal. He didn't say, "Watch what the world's doing." You watch yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Watch your own heart." In an age where everybody is looking outward at politics, at news, at social media, at global events, the real danger is within. &gt;&gt; The slow hardening, &gt;&gt; the quiet drifting, &gt;&gt; the unrecognized wake that settles down on the soul. And the first thing you know, you're overcharged and heavy, drowsy, dulled, spiritually dullled. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Brandham said, "Christ the mystery. Why do you hunger, church? Why do you thirst? It's the father trying to reveal these hidden mysteries to you, &gt;&gt; but you let so many things get it out of you. And he names all kinds of things that we allow. Your hearts be overcharged with sobriety. Surviety means indulgence, gluttony, not just with food now, although there's plenty of that, but anything that satisfies the flesh and numbs the spirit. &gt;&gt; This age is is saturated with pleasure. Yeah, we, you know, saturated with comfort and luxury. &gt;&gt; Even now we we want to go to the best camp that's got the best facilities &gt;&gt; because why? We've gotten used to luxury &gt;&gt; and we let that elevate over spiritual things &gt;&gt; endless options that we have for self-satisfaction. &gt;&gt; Even good things become dangerous when they dull the spiritual senses. &gt;&gt; It's not just evil that overcharges the heart. It's excess that does it. Let that sink deep in you. &gt;&gt; This is what aligns us with the scripture that says lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. &gt;&gt; You know what? What does that look like today? Entertainment &gt;&gt; instead of prayer. &gt;&gt; Camp meetings for social purposes instead of true conc consecration. &gt;&gt; Emotionalism instead of the Holy Ghost. eloquent services and empty altars. &gt;&gt; And a God who's spoken of but never enthroned. &gt;&gt; You see, loving the idea of God but not the demands of his word. &gt;&gt; Loving the blessings but not the brokenness. &gt;&gt; They want revival but not repentance. They're content with form, but the power, the transforming, correcting word anointed fire is denied. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the tragedy of Leodysia. I'm rich. I'm increased with goods and I have need of nothing. You see, they're satisfied with their buildings, their music, &gt;&gt; their brands. &gt;&gt; I'm in the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or subbrands. I'm in Peruia or I'm in Thunders or I'm in &gt;&gt; Return or I'm in Third Pull or I'm in Open the Word. I'm And they're satisfied with brands and programs. &gt;&gt; But Christ is on the outside knocking, not raining. You see, that's the condition of the Leodysian church. &gt;&gt; But there's another church in Leodysia. &gt;&gt; And she's not in this darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. She has revival &gt;&gt; because of repentance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. She has a love for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Having put away the deeds of evil. Come on, somebody. You say, "But I love him." Well, then keep his commandments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To you, his commandments are not grievious. &gt;&gt; You love to obey him in his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not satisfied with just a good church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're not good satisfied with just a good preacher in the pulpit. &gt;&gt; Amen. A good sermon now and then. &gt;&gt; An emotional high. You're not satisfied. You There's a deep calling into the deep. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want more, God. I want more. &gt;&gt; I want to experience you in a greater way than I ever had. Don't let this be just another servicemen. &gt;&gt; Let this be a time where it's a real true meeting where I meet with you &gt;&gt; and my life is changed in your presence. &gt;&gt; Overcharged hearts weighed down. The heart is heavy, dull, sluggish. Ah, not because of outright sin. Good moral people, nice people, good neighbors, but too much of everything else. &gt;&gt; The soul becomes numb and distracted and unable to feel the urgency of the hour. And I fear more than anything as the delay goes along, as men say, the Lord delays his coming and we're in a time where of waiting, I fear more than anything that we become numb, too interested in staying here &gt;&gt; rather than our eyes on leaving. And this is a very spirit that causes the foolish virgins to slumber. &gt;&gt; They're drunk on the world. &gt;&gt; They are and and they're just spiritually drowsy &gt;&gt; and they've become too lazy from the comforts and and and from religion without power. You see, and the Bible said of drunkenness and and it's not just literal intoxication, but of a stupified numbed condition, a soul that is no longer alert in Leodosia, where people are intoxicated with entertainment and drunk on self-love and dull from, listen to me now, dull &gt;&gt; from repeated exposure to truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Without response. &gt;&gt; And when this happens, two things happen. &gt;&gt; First, the Holy Ghost becomes grieved. And then the conscience becomes seared and hardened. &gt;&gt; And first thing you know, conviction is hard to find. &gt;&gt; And I want you to hear this. It is it is possible to be so saturated with religious noise that the still small voice of God is drowned out &gt;&gt; and the cares of this life. Did you see that? Legitimate responsibilities of life, work, family, finances can weigh down the heart if they're not balanced with spiritual priority. &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't have to make you fall. &gt;&gt; He don't have to push you out into drugs. &gt;&gt; He don't have to make you commit adultery. &gt;&gt; You see, he only has to make you busy. Satan, Satan just chokes out the word, not by persecution, but by cares. &gt;&gt; Leodysa is a distracted age. It's It's not hostile. It's just indifferent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Kids were It don't care. That's right. &gt;&gt; They're numb. And so he says, "So that that day come upon you unawares." &gt;&gt; And this is a tragic results. The coming of the Lord catches them off guard. And the people who should have known, &gt;&gt; who saw the signs, &gt;&gt; were so weighted down, they lost their alertness and they quit watching. &gt;&gt; It didn't come with warning for them. And it it came as a a trap, a snare, sudden, unexpected, for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the earth. And let me tell you, this is global. This is not just happening here in America. This is happening around the world. &gt;&gt; You see, no one is immune to the spirit of the age and and the snare is not persecution. Oh, we we often worried about that. &gt;&gt; Get our backpack ready. you know, store up some food. We're going to be that hunted, persecuted little group. The snare is not persecution. &gt;&gt; It's comfort, &gt;&gt; pleasure, spiritual laziness. &gt;&gt; The very ease and prosperity of Leodysia is the trap. And the enemy has disarmed the church, &gt;&gt; not by fear, &gt;&gt; but by lulling them to sleep. But to the bride, Jesus says these words, "Watch." &gt;&gt; Watch ye therefore and pray always. &gt;&gt; Come on now. That you may be accounted worthy. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's somebody going to escape the things that are coming on the earth. &gt;&gt; But How are they going to do it? By watchfulness and prayer. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, it's time we bring prayer back &gt;&gt; into our lives. &gt;&gt; Communication with God and fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; That sweet abiding at communion. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the bride age is not about apathy. It's about an awakening. &gt;&gt; So, I'm in the bride age. Then you're awake. &gt;&gt; Amen. You you you have you have cast out the the the slumber and the works of darkness. &gt;&gt; It's a season of vigilance of keeping the lamp trim. It's a the the your oil is full and the eyes are on the eastern sky. &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking spiritually here, not literally. &gt;&gt; You with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because to our eyes beyond the eastern skies mean we are looking for his coming. &gt;&gt; We are seeing his glorious appearing. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are reflecting and receiving the light of the morning star. &gt;&gt; We're walking in truth and in the light and there's a flame that's burning high. &gt;&gt; And while Leo to see a boast of wealth and spiritual bride pride, the the pride humbly recognizes the need for Isab. Amen. &gt;&gt; For revelation &gt;&gt; to see what others can't see. &gt;&gt; Do you realize you see things others cannot see? &gt;&gt; Amen. Things are revealed to you that others it's never been known to them. &gt;&gt; You are you have been let in to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God where to others it's not given. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we ought to be on fire then. It ought to light our hearts &gt;&gt; that God has chosen us of all people to reveal his truth to us &gt;&gt; to make known the hidden mysteries. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. The bride sees the need for Isab revelation to see what others cannot see. She hears the knock at the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. She opens to him. &gt;&gt; She feeds at a table &gt;&gt; that's got a seven course menu. &gt;&gt; For all the seven seals are open. &gt;&gt; Come on. Did not he invite us in this age. Open the door &gt;&gt; and I will come in and I will s with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen church. He provides the bread. He provides the wine. He provides the party. He provides it all. He's got a whole seven course menu. All you got to do is open the door. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say open the door. Let him in. He wants to bring He wants to suck with you. He wants to bring you into fellowship. &gt;&gt; He wants you to bring you into love relationship. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. She feeds at the table of the seven seals eating open book. The revealed mystery of Christ in an age when the whole world all around us is caught in this entire time snare. &gt;&gt; And the devil set it for us. But God gave us a way out. You're going to escape. &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; the snare. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you this morning, you're going to overcome Leodysian spirit. &gt;&gt; You're going to overcome the lukewarmness. It's not going to drag you down. No sir, you're going to defeat it. You are an overcomer. You are not called to defeat. You are called to victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to &gt;&gt; You're called to rise above it. Not live entangled in the cares of this life, but anchored in the hope of his coming. &gt;&gt; Have you spiritual appetite for the eating of the book? &gt;&gt; I hope you've been feeding. Have you been Have you appetite for the previously sealed mystery truths? You know, they're not sealed anymore &gt;&gt; and they're not mysteries anymore. &gt;&gt; Eating the book means taking or receiving the full revelation personally. &gt;&gt; This is what you are commanded to do. After the seventh angel sounds, you are told to take the book and eat it. &gt;&gt; Right? I &gt;&gt; I'm quoting you Revelation 10. You are familiar with that, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, as you're then then eating eating the book means taking and receiving the full revelation personally, not not just hearing it, &gt;&gt; but consuming it, digesting it, and then becoming one with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it become an action in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it's sweet in the mouth. It's full of glory and spiritual delight when it's first received, but then it becomes bitter in the belly because of the responsibility, the burden that comes with that revelation is heavy &gt;&gt; and the weight of a divine calling &gt;&gt; and like rich food. And I'll tell you, the food we got is rich. You &gt;&gt; said, "Brother Tim, sometimes you're preaching over my head. I'm trying to I'm trying to preach something to you for you to reach toward &gt;&gt; to get out of your shallows. Get out of off of the surface, to get down in the depths of the word. Go from the surface to the depths." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. So, I preach things to challenge you &gt;&gt; to believe. &gt;&gt; To believe for the impossible. &gt;&gt; To realize the mysteries are for you. Don't sit down and shut you shut down your ears and say I'm not going to get this. Inspire you. &gt;&gt; This is the reason it's given to call a bride in this last day. &gt;&gt; But like rich food, it'll set heavy on the stomach. &gt;&gt; The depth of the word can just like that if it's not rightly handed handled. There's too much. Too much without action &gt;&gt; can lead to lethargy and to drowsiness. It'll cause the soul to slumber. &gt;&gt; People get so full. Brother Brandham warned us of this. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, he said he he even he even said uh to to the the time that he saw so many miracles &gt;&gt; that he said it was like a baby there. that was he he heard about in the store. Maybe he saw it. Whichever one, I don't remember the details exactly clearly, but he saw talked about a baby in the store and the mother was going to the store and she was rattling keys and rattling bells and and trying to show it things and and all of a sudden it's dawning on her said, you know, I I I my my child, there's something wrong with it. I show it things that ought to attract a little baby like this. But he just stares in space. And he said, "God has done so much &gt;&gt; in this generation until people stare in space. &gt;&gt; No longer attracted &gt;&gt; by the things of God." So watch what he says. We need an awakening, &gt;&gt; a realization of where we are in this hour. Because you can get the rich food of the word and if it's not rightly handled too much without action, it causes leth lethargy and drowsiness and the soul to slumber. You know how it is. You've ate and it's heavy on your stomach. I got to get up and walk around a bit. &gt;&gt; I've ate too much. Maybe that's why you hit for the door so often during church. &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, that was free. &gt;&gt; Take it or leave it. But nevertheless, you know, it gets to the point where this is a danger when the church feasts on revelation but then fails to prophesy again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The true revelation has to live. &gt;&gt; Come on. It has to stimulate. It has to put you into action. too full, too satisfied, too content to move, to indulge with the knowledge of the revelation without putting into action. And faith without works, without action is dead. &gt;&gt; And just as natural food makes one sleepy, rich revelation without obedience can dull the senses and silence the commission. &gt;&gt; But the instruction is clear. We have been told to prophesy again. &gt;&gt; Remember Leoa, you're not talking for me. &gt;&gt; I'll spew it out of my mouth. &gt;&gt; You no longer speak for me. &gt;&gt; But then to a bride, he gives a book and that book is unsealed. It is open. And he says, "So you speak &gt;&gt; prophesy. &gt;&gt; Prophesy, son of man. Amen. These bones shall live. Prophesy the wind will come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride in this final prophecy, she'll have the wind of the spirit. &gt;&gt; There will be bones come together. Amen. Those dead men will live again. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? People that's been asleeping dead in the pew for years and years and years will rise. Why? Because the bride will prophesy again. Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you, be part of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't just eat the book. Be part of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Let it speak out of your life. Let it speak boldness. Let it speak holiness. Let it speak the joy of the Lord. Let it speak the shout of the king. Let it speak with dance with with a praise, with worship. Let it speak. &gt;&gt; I say, let it speak. Oh, little pride. Let it speak. We have hate it. We have consumed it. Now speak it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You must speak. You must declare. You must act. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Tim, I'm receiving the word. My loved ones coming back." Then speak it. &gt;&gt; Quit talking the negative stuff. Quit looking at the darkness. You are the light. Be the light. &gt;&gt; Shine the light. &gt;&gt; Speak it. &gt;&gt; My child is coming home. &gt;&gt; My loved ones are going to be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got enough of the lamb. I've got a big lamb in my house. &gt;&gt; I've got enough lamb for my children. I've got enough lamb for my grandchildren. Amen. And here in this time of darkness, when there's a knock on the door, I know they're coming home. I'm about to hear sis come in the door and say, "I come home, mama. I've come home, daddy. I've come home to eat the lamb." &gt;&gt; Oh, sis, you can't come in like there you are. Like you're dressed. That's all right. I'll put off those works of darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll put that off. Amen. Oh, the taskmaster of sin took me out. And there, while he had me out there, he took and cut off my hair and painted my face, made me live like a and dressed like a harlot. &gt;&gt; But oh, I've come home, mama. I'm knocking on the door. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I'm coming under the token. I'm coming back home. What about that boy? I've been in drugs. I've been in alcohol. I've been in tobacco. But I'm coming home. I tell you, it's home time and come. It's home timing. Coming time right now. He's timing. &gt;&gt; He's appearing among us. He's healing the sick. He's casting out devils. He's saving the lost. He's moving in his church. &gt;&gt; And there's a bride under the token. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; The very purpose of consuming the book is that the bride might be the voice of the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; There's somebody living that must call the dead. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Exactly right. The first that went down will be the last to come up. &gt;&gt; The la the first church age will be the last to rise. And the last church age will be the first to rise. And the last that we buried will be the first that comes up. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it'll be you, the bride's voice, that calls the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't mean you out here waving a wor some kind of wand in a graveyard. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about your life matching the word of the hour and being a voice in this generation. And when he lives out his voice in full boldness and upright, the dead in Christ will start appearing among us. Oh, I'm looking for that appearing. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for that appearing even this morning. May he appear among us &gt;&gt; in his power and his glory &gt;&gt; and bring the saints with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The revelation must be a living prophecy. We're not called to be spiritually bloated with knowledge. We're called to be voices, &gt;&gt; to prophesy again, &gt;&gt; like the first church did, saying what the messenger of this age said, declaring it before many people's nation, tongues, and kings. The bride has eaten the book. She has received the mysteries. Have you done it? &gt;&gt; How many have embraced them? &gt;&gt; How many loves these mystery truths? &gt;&gt; Amen. We've received them. But now you must move. You must speak. You must shine. You must warn. The sweetness, the sweetness that you taste must become a voice, a witness. &gt;&gt; The heaviness must become a holy burden &gt;&gt; to put the word in action. as he said to Ezekiel, "Son of man, eat this roll and go and speak." To eat and not prophesy is to fall asleep under the weight of the revelation. &gt;&gt; But to eat and rise again with fire in your bones is the call of this hour. &gt;&gt; The bride must not be found resting in truth, but running with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is your time to run. &gt;&gt; Amen. The more light you receive, the more responsible you are to walk in it and speak it. Thou must prophesy. &gt;&gt; Thou must speak the word. This is our commission since Leodysa spewed out of his mouth. We've been given a word and we're to digest it and speak it. Proclaim it. Then let it live. &gt;&gt; I say let it live. &gt;&gt; I say let it live. It'll cast out devils. &gt;&gt; It'll cast out the drugs, the alcohol, the tobacco. It'll cast out the distorted life and the adulterous spirit. It'll cast out the spirits of fornication and pornography. It'll heal all the sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. It will fill with power. It will transform lives. &gt;&gt; It will seal unto the day of redemption. And it will keep you in the hour of temptation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like the prophet Jeremiah said, you remember Jeremiah, he grew weary and sometimes we grow weary. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, I've preached for now 55 years and sometimes I feel weariness. We may grow weary and we may even want to stay silent. And to be honest with you, I've wrestled all week on this sermon because sometimes things aren't easy to preach. So we may grow weary. We may even want to stay silent. But this word that I've eaten, it's too alive. &gt;&gt; It's too powerful, &gt;&gt; too burning to keep inside. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Jeremiah said his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shot up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay. He said I got tired of trying to keep it quiet. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way I feel this morning. I'm tired of being quiet. &gt;&gt; It's time to be the voice. &gt;&gt; It's time to speak. You say we believe in the third pull. Well, then speak. It's the hour to speak to your mountain. Your mountain must hear your voice. &gt;&gt; That's the testimony of the bride in this hour. She's eaten the book. She's received the revelation. And now it's fire in her bones. &gt;&gt; We cannot remain silent. We burn with a holy fire. Consumed by the word, compelled to speak. Listen to me now. We're in an age where it's risen of so much. And what what gives that rise to hoarders? &gt;&gt; Hoarders. &gt;&gt; Some of you are hoarders. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You got one, two, three. I mean, you can't even keep all the stuff you got in your house. &gt;&gt; Come on now. you you've had to rent all these rental buildings and everything else because you're harder. &gt;&gt; And all it's doing is costing you money. &gt;&gt; Oh, it ain't doing you one bit of good &gt;&gt; and you just keep paying the bill on it. &gt;&gt; You're hoarders. Uh, you know, some people gets to be so hoarders that they can't even they they there's even just a little trail that they get &gt;&gt; right down through their house. &gt;&gt; They live in that kind of filth. &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you, this bride is not called to be a hoarder of revelation, &gt;&gt; but a voice to this generation. &gt;&gt; The spirit and the bride must work in unison. What she is eaten, she must now speak. What is burned in her bone now must blaze from her lips. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; It don't do any good just to keep it down in here. It's got to come out of your mouth. It's got to be an action in your life. It's not It is not the hour to fall asleep at the table. That's right. &gt;&gt; How many times have we seen pictures and little videos of babies sitting there and they get full and and first thing you know they're laying down right in their plate of food. &gt;&gt; It's their sleep at the table. &gt;&gt; This is not a time to sleep at the table. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the hour to rise from it. Empowered, instructed, and on fire. &gt;&gt; The book is now open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every promise is yours. Come on, church. Amen. When when Abraham was given a land and he said, "Here's a border." He went around from place to place to place to place. What was he doing? He was walking in every place and claiming that place as his own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you the book is open. You can walk. Go claim your divine healing. Go claim your lost loved one. Claim salvation for your family. Claim Come on. Walk through the land. Amen. You'll barely see what's in the book. &gt;&gt; Discover it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And expand your borders. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Expand your borders. You've been where you are too long. &gt;&gt; You need some elbow room. &gt;&gt; We had to do that here at Evening Light. We had a place that were in the country I was satisfied with. I was happy with it, but it got where, you know, uh we we were landlocked. We couldn't expand. &gt;&gt; We couldn't fit in that building today. &gt;&gt; Why? We had to expand our borders. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you, God's wanting you to have more than what you've had. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not the hour to fall asleep at the table. is the hour to rise from an empowered instruction on fire because the word the book is open and the word must be eaten and now the bride must prophesy again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to bring this down real close. But we you see, but we're not of that order. &gt;&gt; We are of the day. &gt;&gt; We belong to the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know some of you as I preached it just got droopier and droopier and droopier and droopier. Now I'm trying to get you back up. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to point you to what we where we are. We're not of the false vine. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We've been warned and we have taken heed to ourselves. &gt;&gt; We have listened for the bridegroom call. We have been awakened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We belong to the day. We belong to the light. That's right. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom call has wakened us out of religious sleep &gt;&gt; and said, "Go you out to meet him. &gt;&gt; Leave the world behind. Trim your lamps." They make them burn bright. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said, "And then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps." &gt;&gt; Now, you see, in ancient times, oil lamps had a wick that had to be trimmed regularly. So the flame could burn clear and strong, not dim or smoky. A neglected wick would flicker. It would smoke and yeah, it'd eventually go out. even if there was still oil in the lamp. And just like trimming that charred part of the wick, &gt;&gt; the wise virgins cut away the flesh to burn out remnants of yesterday's fire. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; That's something you need to do today. Trim those burnout remnants of yesterday's fire off. &gt;&gt; It's time for a bright shining light. &gt;&gt; You can't live on the remnants of yesterday's revival. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Charred beliefs of the past burn over stumps must be cut off. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't rely on past experiences or emotions, &gt;&gt; but you must daily examine your lives. &gt;&gt; Repented and remove everything and anything that would hinder the brightness of the flame. The Bible said in in Corinthians, he said, "Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of of God." I want the musicians to come. I don't know, maybe you can play that song. How long has it been? I just feel to play that this morning. You see, the flame must be maintained. The revelation kept alive. A trim wick burns better when there's fresh oil. &gt;&gt; The wise virgins had oil in their vessels with their lamps. The Bible said the wise also took oil in their jars with their lamps. You see, they had a refilling coming. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you this morning, even in your life, &gt;&gt; wherever you are, and I'm even talking to myself, there's a refilling for you. Amen. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; The wise virgins maintain their walk in the word and in the spirit. They're not content with formal religion, but they're feeding on present truth. They're keeping their understanding clear and their hearts burning. The word is a lamp unto their feet and a light to their path. [Music] Don't be drunk with wine, which is excess, &gt;&gt; but be filled with the spirit. Trimming the lamp was a sign of watchfulness, readiness. The foolish virgins had oil at one time, but they had neglected their lamps. The little splash of baptism they received at a at a camp meeting wasn't enough because they never got connected with the source of life. [Music] You can come here today and get a real high in this service, but it's not enough &gt;&gt; unless you get connected. &gt;&gt; Connected to the source of life. You see, they become satisfied where they are we're at. They let their experience burn low, but the wise knew the hour was late, and they stayed vigilant. And the Bible said, "Blessed is the servant whom the Lord when he cometh shall find doing so." She's prepared. [Music] The trimming of the lamp represents the final preparation of the bride before the coming of the bridegroom. I wonder, could you trim yours this morning? Could you trim yours? Does your lamp need something trimmed off? Is there something you could surrender? [Music] It's the time where ever predestinated soul is called to cast off the dead works. Fill their vessels with the oil of the spirit to keep that flame of revelation and love burning bright. This is not the hour to coast or to sleep a rest on your past reputation. It's the hour of watching and trimming. Behold, the bridegroom cometh. That's his call this morning. [Music] &gt;&gt; Those that had oil rose up and trimmed their lamps, made themselves ready. Well, I'm one. Brother Tim's got oil. I've got the Holy Ghost. They're the ones who rose up and trimmed their lamps &gt;&gt; and got a refilling. The others, the oil had run out. You see, they had got just some little Pentecostal shout or dance or camp meeting high. and it didn't last. But those who really had oil in their vessels, they had a refilling coming. &gt;&gt; How many can say, "I have the Holy Ghost. I have oil in my lamp." &gt;&gt; You're blessed &gt;&gt; because you have a refilling coming. [Music] You can experience him in a great and greater living way &gt;&gt; than what you ever have. The danger of this hour is not just deception but spiritual drowsiness. Too many are asleep with their open Bible, asleep with full tape libraries and other message paraphernelia, sleep in churches, even sleep under sound preaching. And they're lulled into comfort, unaware that the harvest isn't ripe and the judge is at the door. Let him deal with your heart this morning. How long has it been since you soul in your heart in secret? How long since you prayed? How long since you stayed on your knees till the light shown through? How long has it been &gt;&gt; since your mind felt steady? How long since your heart no burden? Can you call him your friend? How long has it been since you knew &gt;&gt; that he came? &gt;&gt; Let's sing that verse over again. &gt;&gt; How long has it been? Since you saw with the Lord, maybe you just want to get up out of your seat. &gt;&gt; Your heart didn't see. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Lord, here I am." How long since you separate? How long since you stay &gt;&gt; on your knees till the light shone through? How long has it been since your mind felt at ease? How long your heart knew no burden? Can you call him your friend? How long has it been this year? He care for you. How long has it been since you known by your bed and pray to the Lord in heaven? [Music] How long since you knew that he'd answer you? and &gt;&gt; they want to dedicate their lives to him. &gt;&gt; They want to make a full surrender. &gt;&gt; May it be God &gt;&gt; today in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Has it been since you woke with the dawn and felt that the day is worth living? [Music] When you call him your friend, how long has it been? You knew he cared for your children. We have dedicated our [Music] glory &gt;&gt; with the Lord. and told me [Music] how long you pray. How long since you stay on me till the light sh through? [Music] How long has it since your mind felt at ease? How long is your heart? [Music] How long has it been?

[Music] I asked the dear Savior what he had purchased when I count [Music] all my past and all my problems. He said that he would provide every need supply. He's got every need supply. [Music] Healing cleansing sweet peace inside. Every need supply. Amen. [Music] He's got everything need supply. [Music] He can file [Music] every [Music] sweet I really want to see. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, it's Jesus. I really want to see. More I seek of this world, the less it means to me. And is Jesus I really want to sing.

And I was on the verge of getting over [Music] the strength within myself. It just wasn't. [Music] &gt;&gt; Something keeps holding me. and give me [Music] helping me faithfully to overcome life. [Applause] He's guiding me constantly. [Music] Every day I see It's a reality me [Music] before me. this temp [Music] to steal away my faith.

Overcome thy tri [Music] guiding me constantly. [Music] giving me victory. It's a reality. Jesus is holding me. [Music] Oh, and Satan lay before me.

[Music] So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. [Music] All that I have is a hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] I know it's not much. Nothing else fit for a king except for a heart singing. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] All my words fall short. I've got nothing new. How could I explain? [Music] I could see as I [Music] go My name Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. Amen. God bless you. We we come this afternoon with our with our brother Luke and he he's informed me that he is 10 years old and I said that's a perfect age to be giving your life to Jesus. You know, we encourage young young people to give their heart to the Lord as as soon as possible before the enemy can come and get a hold of it and scar it up. And you know, the scripture even tells us Jesus said, you know, to forbid not the little ones to come unto me. Let them come. If they want to come, we don't want to hinder it. We want to encourage it and say, "Give your heart to Jesus." Amen. And and so he's done that. He he's he's repented and he said, "I've given my life to Jesus." And we believe we believe that the Lord is going to come and be in his heart and be in his life and go with him all the days of his life. We're not just doing this out of a tradition, but we have a promise. &gt;&gt; And we believe that the Lord's going to watch over him all the days of his life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so my brother Luke, we're going to put your hands right up here. There you go. You know the drill. Good job, buddy. The Lord sent me into the world and he and he told me to baptize those that believe in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. And in obedience to that divine command, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To be in the house of the Lord today. Amen. Well, as our brother Andrew leaves us in another song of worship, you can consider yourself dismissed. We love you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Oh, these are the days of Elijah declaring the word of the Lord. [Music] And these are the days of the seven angel righteousness being restored. And though these are days of great trials, of famine and darkness and sorrow. Till we are the voice in the desert crying, prepare ye the way of the Lord. Behold, he comes riding on a cloud. Shining like the sun at the trumpet sound. Lift your voice is the year of jubilee. out of sight until salvation come. [Music] These are the days of a single trials becoming. These are the days of your servant David rebuilding the temple of grace. And those are the days of the harvest. The filling wide by your word. And we are the laborers in your venure. The word of the Lord. Behold, he comes riding on a cloud, shining like the sun. at the drunken sound. Lift your voice. The year of jubilee and out of silence till salvation come. [Music] There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like the whole riding on the cloud. Shining like the sun at the trumpet sound. Lift your voice. Hear our jubilee out of sight. God bless you. Behold, he comes riding on the cloud, shining like the sun. At the trumpet sound, lift your voice. It's the year of jubilee. Out of science till salvation [Music]
