your people god you're you're having your way in your people you're speaking through your people you're living you're talking you're walking lord and god today we pray lord that you would come in a mighty way lord may you just help me get myself out of the way lord and may you speak to our hearts today and may you minister to the little bride lord this part of it father and lord may you just continue now lord to heal the sick touch those that are needy today lord help me now lord to surrender myself to you may i get myself out of the way this morning may you bless the words that are read everything that's said and done today lord met me for your glory and your honor and we'll say thank you for it in jesus name and the church said amen you love the lord this morning amen certainly counted an honor to be here today i certainly didn't know i was preaching but uh here we are and and so god knew that brother ron texted me this morning he said it was an ordained moment of god you just didn't know it and i said okay thank you amen certainly to be here and uh glad to be here and be with brother timothy and brother tim and part of the watch the couple get married and and just pray god's blessing be upon them know her ever since she was a little girl and she grew up into a young lady and and you know what but that's the way the church has done the church was young at one time it was immature at one time and brother branham said i believe it was in 1963 it was an infant bride but if we ain't matured since 1963 we're in trouble but i declare today that the bride is a mature lady she's standing on her feet she knows who she is [Applause] amen so we better read before i preach amen just thankful that the presence of the lord is here today galatians chapter 2 in verse 20. [Music] galatians 2 and 20. paul's speaking he said i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me may god at his blessing today you may be seated if i could today i'd like to speak for a few moments on uh we have the devil's answer [Applause] and apostle paul here says the life that i now live so paul's telling us that he lived a different life at one time but now he said it's not me that liveth but it's christ who liveth in me and actually that is an identification of the token in your life is when it's christ living in you that's what god requires for us to have in this day is the token to be applied and when the tokens apply listen it actually if we could actually get it in our minds this morning we can't hardly express it with words but if we could get it into our soul this morning and not just our ears we could see the guarantee of it that it is our guarantee and it would actually cause the church to relax not get lacks but to relax in the presence of god knowing that god has everything in control for we are personally identified in the headship with him huh and brother brown said we have the devil's answer to his question [Applause] amen christ is risen he paid the price abraham and he's raising up the body he said no he's not raising up the body he's already raised up his body the literal body but he's raising up this body this body is going to be a manifestation of the word of god this body will be an acts 2 church the devil can't stand it the devil can't stand revelation he can't stand it brother said that's what he's howling about that's why he's got all of his wickedness going look at that look at the condition of the world today wickedness on every hand wickedness all around us but let me tell you god's got a body he's raising up he's raising up a body in this hour that will walk and talk and be a manifestation of the revealed word of the hour i can't fight with a codom amen that's what his scheme is all about today but his scheme has been revealed in this hour listen apostle paul i believe it was said we are not ignorant of satan's devices it has been revealed in this hour we know what the devil's up to and we have the answer for the devil listen he's trying to track this one and side track that one and cause this one to be afflicted in her body well tim i was just thinking of brother ron while ago right before you prayed for him we got the devil's answer well tim said we're looking for the key we got the answer we're just waiting for god to get it listen it's already in his word we just need an inspiration to strike somebody listen we need inspiration to strike our homes we need inspiration to strike our families we need inspiration to strike our personal lives [Applause] get the revelation it's not you that's doing the living but it's christ in you the hope of glory lord god let me get myself out of the way let me realize the headship has come down two have been made one huh you're supposed to be one with him we've seen that happen yesterday in a wedding but we have been married to christ the word we have already been espoused to him listen church we're not going to the to the marriage he said we're going to the wedding supper we are married right here to the word and if you can't be married to the word here how are you ever going to be an expression of him [Applause] [Music] why is the expression of the husband the husband would even be an expression of the wife if we could say it that way he's reflecting her she's a reflection of him he's a reflector of christ and a man is known the one here but the man is known by the wife he chooses that's why god chose you because he's known by whom he chooses he chooses mighty men of valor he chooses mighty gentile wires he didn't choose some little pansy down here that was afraid of a fight but he chose somebody who's been ordained in this hour to tear down satan's kingdom somebody's going to rise to the occasion somebody's going to be victorious might as well be you hallelujah that's not me that's living to you that live within me we got his answer it's not my idea it's his power it's not some emotion we love emotion but it's his word stimulating i us people say well they're just too emotional getting people all worked up go ahead well pray tell me what a ball game does what do you think they were doing in atlanta last night don't all y'all act so perfect like you didn't see part of that last night i know some of you did it was on in the lobby of the motel wasn't it brother everybody's going [Music] we've come to the house of god this morning to raise war huh you want to talk about a child we're going to give the devil the word this morning by his stripes we are already healed the devil has nothing on this bride we have his answer blue devil [Applause] what god bless brahman said what god in christ manifested he gave that flesh and that blood that in the blood might come to life yes and the flesh be redeemed that god in this redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day so god wants to take your redeemed flesh and manifest his word as he did when jesus walked the swords of galilee glory don't you see where that places you at with god it places you in a standing with him that you are now justified amen you never did it in the first place and if you're justified he can't even judge you he already judged you in that body that was already judged glory to god just like you take a drop of ink and you put it into a bucket of bleach glory you don't find it anymore it goes back to where it came from and when your sins because we were all born in sin shaped in a nickel we all needed a savior you might have been born part of this church you might have cut your teeth on the pew so to speak here in this church but you still needed a savior you had to be burned again of the spirit of god and once you take that and you ask god to forgive you he puts it in the sea of his forgetfulness and it goes back on the head of the enemy hallelujah and when a man is truly redeemed and he's a predestinated seed and he sees it and he accepts it his sins are demolished nothing else can be held against him god completely forgets his sin glory to god and now we are sons and daughters of god amen well justin i'll be a son or daughter of god someday when i receive my adoption i already received it i'm just waiting on the fullness to take place until these bodies are changed but i've already received my pacing in the kingdom of god i don't have to wait to be a son of god i am a son of god [Music] and now we are already redeemed huh already you see where you stand this morning you're not defeated right right amen you're a mighty gentile warrior bro jason i don't feel very strong this morning can you pray you have the ability to cry out to god lord jesus i need you i don't care if you're five years old you have power you have a standing with god it don't matter if you're 95 or if you're five when you are a son of god you're a son of god and once you've been redeemed you've been redeemed and it don't matter what the devil tries to tell your young people there is no weapon harmed against you that will prosper there is no weapon that can tear you down there is no pornography there is no lust there is no homosexual spirit that can pull you under and pound you i'm telling you there is a power here today to set every demon power to flee the headship is here that's not coming someday oh brother jason we could just recognize who we are let me just ask you when are you ever going to take that quote and get it out of 1965 [Applause] and bring it here to 2021. listen the prophecy was given for a purpose is that the prophecy might be fulfilled it might be made manifest you people's going to wear me out today i better keep drinking gatorade the hit ship's here he said christ the risen lord he's in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was you catch that he's in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself that's the devil's answer he's hearing the same power manifesting himself that he ever was that's the devil's answer oh is he manifesting himself in brother tim yeah but not only with an aaron yeah but not only brother joe yeah but not only you you can walk up to the devil you got the authority to tell the devil to leave it ain't just a preacher that's got the authority but any blood pump baptized seed of god has the authority brother to tell the devil to leave he comes to you in the middle of the night please amen when you can't get brother tim on the phone you can't get timothy you can't get these other brothers you gotta speak [Applause] i'll take you out in your sleep you can't have me till god says it's my time you might send me through afflictions only if god allows it amen i'm here to manifest one that's jesus christ i'm not here to manifest me i ain't got any power brother i'm saying i ain't got it he said the policeman hadn't got any power he just got authority i don't have any power on my own but i believe we have the authority this morning by the word of god and the spirit he's revealed in this hour we have the devil's answer [Applause] that's why brother branham when brother wade dropped dead could say life come back that's why when a baby been dead for 15 hours in mexico that's why i don't really matter the condition right now so much of that little nine-year-old girl oh it hurts it hurts the family terribly but in the eyes of god she could be going 15 hours she's brain dead already i don't know how many hours but i'm here to tell you there is a man that can turn the light on this morning and bring life back in that body the handship is here it's not us doing it that's the reason the little sister here i'm looking for i talked to her yesterday i can't find there she is that hair huh i remember the youth camp brother tim i stand at the front of the line with you brothers and she brought those little hair pins in her hand she said i want to wear these again not i want to i'm going to wear this again she had a positive testimony listen stand up just a minute sister if you don't mind i walked you walked by me and i seen that long hair and just a few years ago there was no air that's because you can be seated but that's because the life is in the body now hallelujah he's manifesting himself in his body now that's why we could pray the brothers could pray and hair would be restored it was her glory that's the reason sister elena butts could be sitting up there and jump down and run around the church and be healed of stage four lung cancer [Applause] that's the reason we had a brother sitting in our church a couple years ago and he's sitting over there on the side playing a guitar he was on two thousand this is gonna sound insane two thousand milligrams of oxycontin a day he could not put his clothes on in the morning he had nine back surgeries he couldn't hardly move and he was sitting over there and brother jewelform he was preaching he was down here praying for somebody and i just walked down the platform and i just glanced over at him never had a thought in my mind about him condition or nothing he said brother jason when you looked at me something spoke in my heart it's over now his doctor done told him you quit 2 000 milligrams of oxycodone a day you'll be a dead man he went home he told his wife he said it's over she goes what's over he said i'm healed she said what are you talking about i said i'm not taking no more of that medicine she said the doctor said you're going to die but god said i'm healed listen it was in the body he quitted cold turkey hallelujah that's been several years ago that's the reason these things can happen among us that's the reason god is among us [Applause] that's the reason regardless what your need is it can be done today i claim what you pray for me won't go with him today i clean allergies be gone today i claim that an autoimmune thing begone today listen i claim it in the name of jesus how do come you claim it brother jason it's my god-given right it's my inheritance well healing's just for a temporary thing i know but it's still the children's brand glowy i just feel to tell something here we were all sitting around at brother tim's house when sister karen had went on to be with the lord and we were visiting something supernatural began to happen in the room where the ministers were settling i was sitting next to brother jeff and brother ron was telling the supernatural happening that it happened over there and it had to do even with sister esther and and with the greater esther you probably know the story and i was sitting there and something rose up in me and to be honest i got a little nervous and scared really i didn't know what to do but i felt the speaking tongues but i just held it and then i got to feeling terrible so i text timothy and i told him and i and i i told him what i thought it was and i just he said i believe he'll go back over and start talking brother jeff again it'll come back and i brother ron went to lay down so i just dropped him a message just to be praying for me because i felt that i greet the lord and god is my witness i went back over there and i sat back down my brother jeff again and finally the conversation come up and i began talking to him i said brother jeff how's your job going you know just trying to make a conversation well i don't work or i used to god made it away where i can be in church all the time and i said you know god will honor that god honor me even if he made less money god blessed him but even if he made less money you'll put god first god will honor that amen and i said god will honor that and then it just kind of hit me and i just began speaking to it i said you know i don't know maybe i'm trusting god still here against sister as for another child she lost the child i said but you know brother branham told us about that i said and sister karen is went on but i said i have no doubt when sister karen walked up to the gates that there was a little girl boy whichever it was greeted her with little anymore about 21 years old come up and greeted her and said i hello mavi and sister karen said who are you i'm jeff and hester's little girl there was a spirit dropped down in that house i'm here to tell you today saints god don't miss it when god speaks it god's word will be performed [Applause] don't think brother ron didn't have some tormenting nights don't think sister esther and brother just steal the devil still don't tell them god's not going to give you a child let me just tell you something we are here in this day and in this hour to be ambassadors of jesus christ we are representatives of the king of kings and the lord of lords and these things can still happen because the headship is here i know they have one on the other side but we're looking for one on this side [Applause] timothy texted me said you don't know what just happened there's two or three others in the family that had miscarriages too just imagine the reunion took place they got to see their grandma but at that point it became their their it became a sister to them in a way if we could say it like that but they still yet knew it chefs are brothers and how's all that happening sharon rose new brother bradham and she said hello daddy don't tell me he's not the same yesterday that damn forever i declare to you today that same lord jesus is able today to rise up the dead he's able to heal bodies he's able to do anything he wants to do because the headship and the body has become one unit and that's why sometimes we open our mouths and words come out and we don't understand what we just spoke right but god knows but it's by inspiration that we speak and brother adam said you speak it by inspiration it's the same as deity speaking so god in his church is one christ in you it's god's great revelation we're even bearing his name his name is jesus the name above all names the anointed one the prince of peace the mighty god the everlasting father but i tell you today it's anointed a body in this day and it's proving it's manifesting god like that body did listen church and that body redeemed every one of these bodies it's risen it's paid the price and he said we're redeemed or the fruit redeemed let's start acting like we're redeemed let's relax in it he's already done it huh see the cares of later we see a cloud our eyes god gave you that desire that was prophesied of you and your wife sister candace huh god's still in the healing business we got the devil's answer he can't stand it we have caught the revelation of the last end time hour and it's not just god sent a prophet that's part of it we believe that but the prophet brought us a message he brought us something to become listen church he can't judge me for i've already been judged and if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done there's a body of christ standing on earth today and alive that is redeemed that's not afraid to proclaim he still heals he still brings the backsliders in he still restores the loss brothers my children are all wayward and they're all out in sin commit unto god and the prophet of god said the same faith that saved you yes sir you know the rest of the quote save your children so this morning we can stand justified in his sight because we are his victory we come forth in the last day of his glorious gospel proclaiming it his victory he died for the purpose that we could be proof of his victory and when we see him coming down in this hour we're not talking about 1960s we appreciated that brother tim was there in the meetings he took us by life tabernacle this week a lot of supernatural things happen in that tabernacle but we're looking for supernatural things that happen in these tabernacles we're not just looking for a tabernacle made by hats we're looking for something to happen here lord we need you to come this morning and god you begin to live among your church when he's living among his church that is his victory [Applause] bro just sometimes i don't feel like i have the devil's answer you got it if you just know how to use it huh it's here the answer's here listen it showed it couldn't keep jesus in the grave and if it can't keep jesus in the grave it can't keep you in the grave it won't keep sister karen in the grave it won't keep my mom and daddy in the grave but there will come a morning when the trump of god is sound and those that are dead shall rise and those that are alive and remain shall be changed [Applause] hey devil i got your answer some morning between 6 and 9. well jason what time zone we don't know that's why you be ready [Applause] six and nine in america are six and nine in africa don't matter it's gonna happen between six and nine one morning he's gonna come we're gonna go meet him in the air but before that he said we meet our loved ones here so somewhere or another in that time praying we're going to begin to see our loved ones yes one of these mornings i believe i may even be laying in bed and maybe it's five o'clock in the morning and there all of a sudden i feel a presence and i look beside the bed and there stands my father or that stands my mother let me tell you i'm gonna know something's on it's go time then boys hey listen they can holler and scream and talk all they want but when i see i'm fixing to be changed glory to god there's going to be a shout rise up in me well there ain't no grave gonna hold this body down [Applause] well jason how can i be sure of that same thing this morning have him down on the inside of you let him seal your life this morning amen well i've heard this message all my life until i'm sick of hearing it i pity you i've heard this message all my life and i still love you and when i begin to listen to even the prophet of god preach hey i like all these preachers but they're not my favorite i love them i love to hear brother tim i love to hear him two hours some of you may not but you're still here so you must like him somewhat i love him i love to hear the depth of the word but i love to hear i love to hear any anointed man of god preach but let me tell you the most thing i'm looking forward to is not to wake up in the morning and hear one of them preach i'm looking to wake up in the morning and hear come up heather i'm waiting to hear the call i'm hearing it now through the word but i'm waiting for my body change [Applause] brother aaron i'm waiting to where i wake up one morning my shoulder don't hurt anymore these gray hairs and all the my bald spot brother tim it's coming back my wife said honey you're getting thin on top i said i ain't lost a one there's one thing you got to make sure that you're calling an election amen make sure you're born again listen george don't just don't just don't maybe think you're born again well just and i think i have the holy ghost we're living in an hour where it's not a time for thinking you have the holy ghost you need to know you have the holy ghost you need to know you're sealed by the power of god it couldn't keep jesus in the grave it'll not keep us in the grave because we're already potentially raised in christ how because we we're separated from unbelief to the eternal word of god which is him listen to what brother rham says excuse me christ is the mystery he says the church is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the holy ghost that baptizes us into the body that recognizes only his body his word denominations are never touched message isms will never touch it false doctrines are never touching tapes only will never touch it two souls will never touch it seven thunders are never touching we're already in the millennium i never touch it i i'm telling you i told the church so if we're already in the millennium i'm disappointed but i'm here to tell you this morning my soul is at rest but my body is still growing so i'm waiting for that great millennial day [Applause] so all your false doctrines will never touch it only the pure word of god been brought to you by a seventh angel message a messenger from god sends down a revealed word puts it into the hands of his men huh denominations of fail never touch it he said because it's a revelation it must be spiritually revealed listen if it was ever spiritually revealed we wouldn't had all those people left there and believe the sign but it never was a revelation to them most of them actually felt like brother branham was god because when they realized he wasn't they fell when they realized he was still yet a man and a man could say things wrong he could accidentally misspeak he could maybe even exaggerate what he said but when it came to the word when it came to the revealed word there is no man that would stand against him in that day amen and the only reason they rise up today is because he ain't here and most of them won't even stand up to a god-called man today they go behind behind a keyboard somewhere hope someone's watching this morning listen we've got your answer you missed the revelation of the hour you thought the revelation was god's and a prophet but you missed the prophecy it's part of it but you didn't have a complete revelation so you missed the devil's answer you missed the revelation but this there wasn't eve before that failed huh she knowed it she knew it but she failed and this one knows it and she won't fall what a prophecy brother tim this eve won't fall how come she won't fall she's predestinated not to fall she cannot fall she must manifest the word of the hour blessed is the man whom god did not impute sin to projection that's just the preachers and the prophets that's his people i've heard ministers take you know and use the word of god and use the scripture and say touch not mine i don't want to do my prophets no harm amen but then a prophet of god comes along on the scene and he goes but you are the anointed people so it's not just a preacher it's the people listen i know better than you are matter of fact i'm a servant listen but here's the thing we are all in this together there's no big eyes there's no little use we are all children of god we are all bought by the same price some may have a gift another one don't that don't make you anything but more responsible and as god was in christ christ is in you what god did in christ christ does in you what signs god did in christ christ does in you so when christ walked the shores of galilee and he walked by and he healed the leopard and he healed the blinded eyes and he raised the dead the prophet of god the bible even tells us all that was in god he poured into christ all that was in christ he poured into the church so then somewhere these things has got to be in the body and let me just tell you where you won't find them in a cold dead morgue well jason we don't worship like you do in your church i don't really care how you worship and so long as you worship well brother justin we don't want to get out of the water the holy ghost won't get out of order listen but the same prophet of god also said oh we're afraid to get out of church or he goes you need to once in a while so maybe you'd get saved [Applause] huh let's say all of what he said let's not hold back and pick our favorite quotes out and then and do away with every move of god you cannot do that if god is there he will move [Applause] so all that god did the signs that god did in christ christ does in you and jesus said that that day you will know that i am in the father and the father in me and i knew and you in me so we have the devil's answer it's not me that liveth but it's christ that liveth in me it's not me that does the works but it's christ that liveth in me then when the revelations comes forth then it's i'm in you and you and me there is a harmony between you and christ and it's the holy spirit pulsating living in you matter of fact brother branson is showing a personal vindication of the word because he's living in you we have to have that moment to where our lives become changed you have to be born again it's a must in this hour brother said without it you're lost signs of the messiah no matter how good you are cain was as good as abel worshiped the same as abel built the church the same as abel made a sacrifice the same as abel and god rejected him because he didn't have spiritual revelation he said what was right jesus said upon the same spiritual revelation he'd built his church excuse me and the gates of hell could not prevail against it so where is he at he's here you've seen me you've seen god come down in a service you've seen god do the impossible you've seen god do the miraculous right here in your church you've witnessed those things we all have that believe in the supernatural move of god we witness god moving we see things happening two weeks ago i was sitting there and i was preaching and and it was one of those services that wasn't real gentle you know you it was kind of correction i don't like to have to preach those but sometimes you do there was this young man there who was had come with a girl and she was backslid and she brought this boy he'd been coming for a while and he just sat in church and she was gum i'd preach away and he'd chew his gum but two sundays ago was kindly different i was preaching away and he's right there with me following me tuned in everybody i don't say everybody else but several other people commented that brother was tuned in this morning well after church i just went and sat in the truck i was wore out one sitting the truck he'd come knocking on the window brother jason will you baptize me i said brother have you repented yes i have i said i'll be glad to baptize you in the name of the lord jesus listen church you don't ever know how god's going to move on a person we don't ever know how god's going to bring somebody in it's beyond our understanding sometimes but when god moves he moves [Applause] we want to see god manifesting himself in the body and then when god manifests he goes a vindicated word and his body is his very victory that's the reason of his death that's not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to help preach to the souls that were in prison his flesh only died when he was raised up again and quickened which means made alive excuse me his flesh which was his body and that's the word it's been laying dead for years but it's gradually begin to come in the reformation so now they're beginning to come life to it again it begin to grow a little in reformation but he says now she's standing up on her feet it went through a time where it was dead for years then the luther came and then a wesley came and then an isuzu street came now zuzu street ain't the original pentecost that was only some gifts supernatural movements happening gifts restored and things of that that wasn't the original pentecost the original pentecost still hadn't come yet but then it come up to grain time it come up to seed time it come up to this time and now there's a bride standing on her feet in this hour [Applause] [Music] well if i had time to go back and pick up those dry bones brother tim says i got plenty of time in his time i got plenty of time thank you go back and look at the dry bones there was a valley full of bones and the prophet ezekiel come up there was no skin on them there was no sinus on them they were just laying there they were separated the legs wasn't connected to the hips and the hips wasn't connected to the back everything was separated the head wasn't connected to the to the spine it was all a wreck and the prophet the word of the lord speaks to the prophet son of man can these bones live said lord thou long know us yeah he said i'll tell you what you do then prophesy and he begins to prophesy and when he prophesied the bones began coming back together listen brother johnny didn't get brother elle's hip if they would have been there you got your own hip he didn't get brother elle's head or you didn't get his head amen huh you understand but you each come to his own body it each came to its own possession and then as it begin to come to position now they're just lifeless still yet and he said oh son of a hand prophesy again they begin to prophesy again and the sin use begin to came and the skin begin to come and it was a great army but they still didn't have breath oh son of man can these bones live thou don't know us lord then begin to prophesy again and the wind began to blow and it come in here and blew life into them and there arose an exceedingly great irony glory to god i think about another group of bones that were in this thou this day church bones the devil thought he had us all devil thought he had a whip back there when they began to die down through the church ages and then luther began to speak things begin to happen reformation wesley speaks pentecost comes but they still ain't got life yet they got what they thought was life but they didn't really they had never really yet been burned all the way with the word [Music] and then all of a sudden in this hour god begins to use a man to speak the word and breathe the breath of life risen i'm here the headship has come and he begins to preach all these sermons to us invisible union why we are not a denomination jezebel religion he goes down the line he begins preaching he's saying the seals doubt become open and brother branham said my bible become a new book and he caught the revelation now it was more than just a man now the mighty angel had descended and when the mighty angel descends he breathes life into a bride that was stale that was cold that was locked up in denominations that was locked up in message creeds [Applause] brother jason we're perusia well god bless you i'm a christian well i believe this god bless you i believe all the message well i got no i'm not interested in your slant i'm interested in one thing what's the pure revealed word of god your slant will never produce a rapture there's one word that'll produce a rapture that's what's been revealed by the mighty angel in this day and hour it's not an idea it's his word it's not a thought it's the word revealed who's it being revealed in me and the word began to be prophesied in this day and hour christ beginning to be made manifest in his bride and that's why demons can be cast out that's what the devil's howling about we got his answer that's why youth camps and some of the special meetings and someone ain't in special meetings demon spirits will cry out in people and they'll challenge god i'm getting somewhere i'm trying to anyway i feel like i'm just getting started and he'll challenge and let me tell you it won't work in an unconverted channel you'll never make the devil moved in an unconverted channel there was a showdown one day between god and satan jesus and satan they had a showdown two great forces brother said satan come with knowledge he knew the word but he was unconverted so he couldn't do anything with the word but perverted but jesus already knew who he was so when satan would come to jesus with the word jesus was the word he knew who he was satan questioned who he was what he did in christ he's gonna do in you jesus knew who he was you better know who you are and if you're sleeping this morning you're going to miss it listen the devil's trying to rock you to sleep and later we'll see you we need to shake ourselves this morning this is not time for the devil to rock you asleep we get so caught up in things we're missing the very manifestation of the word that's happening before us i asked my church the other day i said how many times how many of you have looked at your screen time check your bible app versus your facebook app we're lacking we got our priorities messed up satan's sitting here oh i get them caught up in this and you still may be a christian i'm not saying you're not a christian but the devil robs you of what you could have all the time we spend on facebook insta book or insta book whatever it is face gram insta book we'll get it right what we've learned snapchat twitter whatever we get caught up on those things we miss what god's trying to do you could instead be listening to the word of god i'm not saying you can't have time for natural things that's not what i'm saying but when it becomes your priority listen this message should be your priority we're getting ready for a rapture and in case you hadn't noticed it's really close and i don't say that in a creepy joe biden way it's really close he's here elijah's gone he's with us today how much longer is god going to strive with man how much longer is his spirit going to be here i hear you guys preach all the time same thing over and over and over one of these mornings you're going to pull up the evening light tabernacle to hear brother town preach on the opening of the word for the 754th time it's not the same sermon you're going to pull up to here and preach and he's not going to be here you're gonna i don't know how you're gonna get in the building because i hope the deacons ain't here to open it you're gonna wait for somebody to come open the door and ain't gonna be nobody you're gonna check facebook to see if they announced it or no private announcement on facebook and then you're going to get to looking around i better call moms if she's coming to church mom don't answer then you're going to wish you to listen to brother tim's 750 sermons huh you're going to want you to listen to brother joe screaming at you to the top of his lungs and going airborne off out through the congregation man he come to my church this year he we have a banister around the front rock wall shamgar he was but he almost messed up we didn't tell the church that he flew back over the wall and there's a monitor speaker sitting there and he cleared it but barely and he didn't jump over again either you won't have brother joe screaming at you you won't have brother aaron preaching at you you won't have brother timothy preaching at you and you'll wish you to listen that day because the god they were trying to teach you about and preach to you about had taken on flesh in their flesh and they was trying to get you to see the light of the hour and say listen you can live above that you can live above pornography you can live above makeup you can live above cutting your hair you can live above those things but jason the message ain't for me this message is to him who believes it well jason all the seals ain't open the prophet of god said they're open to them who can believe how many believers we have here [Applause] got a few make believers or unbelievers there everybody didn't raise your hand how many believers we got here [Applause] all right stay with me i'll use brother tim brother ron's phrase are you with me i'm not gonna be much longer we'll parachute like brother jewel in a moment god's trying to get our attention satan was wondering if it was really god or not is this who he says he is jesus knew who he was so he could stand still and when satan goes it's written in the word quote now the book of psalms jesus could quote him right back out of the book of psalms because he was the book there was a difference satan knew it up here but jesus wasn't so when the devil comes to you and tempts you and tells you it's okay and says oh surely god won't do that though you better be the book brother tim years ago preach the sermon the people of the open book we are the book satan quoted the same word he goes to church every sunday he goes every wednesday he knew it by knowledge jesus knew it by experience in revelation for he was it jesus knew his adversary so no matter how much knowledge you have it'll never make the devil leave it'll never cause you to be victorious you'll never overcome a single thing in your life just with head knowledge [Applause] but until it becomes a manifested revealed worthy howard and it drops down to the inside of your soul you will not be changed we have a young man any young man he's older than i am he's 55 or 56 he smoked for almost 45 years he was coming to church still smoking how's that the close of the service almost something changed in the building and i was actually dealing with a man's sister trying to i didn't call her out but i was just telling you can be free you know drug addiction something struck me and i looked over at him and i said and he won't mind me using his name as a testimony i said brother richard you can lay those things down and never pick them back up this morning but if i was you i'd stand up and tell god i'm never picking them up again i'm not never going back that way again listen you got to take a step toward god that man jumped up out of his pew he said i promise i promise i promise that was two years ago last september not only that but he was living in adultery at the time and god delivered him of that also [Applause] that's because the headship has come down and united with the body and he's raising a body up it wasn't me it was his decision i could have told him all day he needed to quit smoking but when he told god i'm done with this devil revelation struck his heart makes a huge difference it's got to become leave the head drop down into the heart you can plant us how can you plant a seed if it's growing and not manifest what it is you plant a seed of the enemy it'll grow if you water it it'll manifest you plant the seed of god it'll manifest and jesus said these signs shall follow them that belief and david said lord i've hid thy word in my heart i've meditated i meditate on it day and night they're written on my bedposts and everywhere jesus said your name's engraved in the palms of my head how are you ever going to be forgotten i feel like i'm on an island this morning although he's still in the boat with you he has never left you he will never leave you nor forsake you and jesus defeated satan upon faith and knowing who he was what about this predestinated bride of christ now you got the word seed in you absolutely brother jason then everything that god promised to put in his church is here we're not waiting for anything else to come brother brahm said it's here everything he promised brother tyler's here everything you need if you're struggling everything you need is here it's already brother man said even the rapture is in you once you receive the baptism of the holy ghost everything you have need of is in you right then so now i'm gonna read you a quote as i'm trying to slow down just a little everything is in order the holy spirit has been given the seed has been sown the evening lights have been shining the sign of sodom that jesus promised is here malachi 4 has come a predestinated church is now standing on her feet we know who we are i like his next words old devil oh devil see he's getting ready to tell us oh devil you better watch out now there's a bride here who's recognized who she is he goes how's satan going to stand against that excuse me how is he going to stop that from growing how is he going to stop them signs from following it you could throw him in jail they've already threw her family in jail didn't work too well for him it was about midnight paul and silas brother philip i don't know why i just thought of you when i thought of paul and silas brother phillip might have been down there at midnight sitting in a cell somewhere not physically spiritually he was in a sail and he looked out one day and saw a water tower because he always was a son but he got some amnesia but one day the water tower caught his attention let me tell you that's because he's a seed of god and every seed of god has their moment of recognition i have a seed [Applause] paula silas is sitting in jail about midnight wait why don't we sing a song i'm talking aaron because me and neither here one can sing i don't think so we begin to say about that time something began to happen in the house a shaking began to happen chains were up on us but we begin to praising god listen church i don't care what kind of trouble you're in this morning if you begin to praise god chains will begin to fall around you circumstances are beginning to drop around you your enemy will become to begin to change he'll begin to back up because you know who you are you know who you believed in you know who you're trusting in you know where you're going [Applause] back up devil chains fell off of them you imagine ladies over playing at the house one night and peter's down there in jail and they're praying for his deliverance and all of a sudden the angel of the lord takes him out of the jail sets him on the outside he gets on the outside he begins processing what just happened well i'm gonna go over to their house he knocks on the gate let me in hey the young lady i believe it was lydia runs through the door she looks out she hears the voice it's peter she forgets him at the gate runs back into the house and tells him peter's outside no way peter's in prison but we're praying for his deliverance why are we surprised when he's delivered when you ask god for something don't be shocked when it happens be excited about it run and tell others about it he's the same yesterday today and forever so you can lock it up in prison you can't stop it brother caleb was in prison over in china didn't have bibles didn't have anything started leading muslims to christ because when you become the bible when you become the message you don't have to have a book we appreciate them you don't have to have a tape we appreciate them but you have to become the word manifested and made flesh yourself and when that happens nothing is impossible they've rotted in jails they've was fed the lines they were sold asunder they were jerked to pieces but you can't kill this you can't kill the revelation you might kill the man but you can't kill the spirit the spirit of god lives on brother ram says they might hush my voice but or hush me but the spirit will live on listen and in this day the spirit's still living where here at evening like tabernacle very christian tabernacle that happy valley wherever it may be jesus christ is still alive and well and everything's in order the world's in order for jesus to come back it's ripe it's close very close something's about to happen people are nervous they're scared i told the church back home i said hey don't be scared don't be afraid of what's happening in the world we'll be excited the natural man gets the mastermind he's american you don't like what's happening but the spiritual man on the inside is looking at the revealed word of the hour i am if i am who i say i am then this mess out here shouldn't shake me [Applause] because i got the devil's answer world's in order time shaping up he said church is in order seed's been sowed and right here in the last days a predestinated church knowing where they're standing so will the seed the holy spirit in the church and then he says satan be careful be careful satan you're picking on the wrong people you're picking on my brother ron spencer right now you better watch out don't you remember how many times you've already been whip picking on that man well you've picked on him and picked on him hey there ain't nobody that i know been through more than him maybe there is i just don't know but let me tell you every time the devil's picked on him he's lost and now cancer's picking on him cancer's a loser i said cancer is a loser the devil is a loser satan be careful this morning you've chose the wrong people to pick on we know we are the bride of christ [Applause] you better watch it you're going to fly into one of us you're going to hit that 100 billion vote wine like you did when you flew into jesus brother and some of the devil flew into jesus he hit that 100 billion vote line and it sends his feathers he said he fell back a lot quicker than what he can he said because the line was energized it had dynamo in it but satan's line had no connection [Applause] hallelujah and if he's the same in the church as he was in jesus christ he flies into brother ron cancer he's had it a lot longer than he ever knew years maybe didn't know it secret silent killer so satan thinks secretly came in through maybe a spot on his arm or his head or whatever it might have been and he comes in trying to secretly take his life without him recognizing it but the same god that was sitting there when you and brother donnie prayed for him in his house i had no idea they was praying for him in his house i'm sitting in my office and i look up my window and there's an eagle sitting in a tree and i'm studying and you know i started studying on eagles in but something come to me tell brother ron remember what i told him i will use you like never before i sent it to him immediately they had just been praying let me tell you it's not me it wasn't them it's christ and i declared if god takes him today he's used him like never before god has kept his word but we're believing for deliverance [Applause] so satan be careful we got your answer it's not us that's living it's christ in us it's christ then brother ron it's not brother ron doing it we all love him and we're all holding him up let me tell you don't quit praying for him it could be your prayer that'd be the key to set the devil a fled i don't care who it is in the body of christ keep praying for the request this morning keep praying for we don't know what god might do for this little nine-year-old girl all i know is he's more than able hallelujah i had a brother one time that was down in prison he was in a lion's den huh he was thrown in a lion's den for worshiping god and the little king come the next morning oh daniel has your god been able to deliver you you want to talk about an impossible situation a den full of hungry lines daniel said o king my god has sent the angel of the lord and he has guarded me from the lions and there is no harm come to me listen to the king's decree take all the men take all the devil and his little limbs and take them and bind them up and throw them into the den of lions [Applause] our god is able he's sitting here this morning morning to give us the very desires of our heart satan hates revelation but we love it musicians come this morning with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail against them what a promise this morning you see where we stand this morning it's christ that lives in us he's the one doing it he's the one that comes in the sermon he's the one that heals the sick he's the one that saves the lost he's the one that gives the holy ghost no man can give it to you no man i can't give you revelation but god can and when god gives it to you no man can take it from you you love him this morning let's stand and give god praise this morning well god is good all the time he puts is [Music] god is good [Music] all the time still for us [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the [Music]
