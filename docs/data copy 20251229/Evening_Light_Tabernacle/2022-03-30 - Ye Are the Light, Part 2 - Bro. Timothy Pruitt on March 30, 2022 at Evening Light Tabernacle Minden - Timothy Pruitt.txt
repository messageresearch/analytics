we've heard your voice we've heard your call lord we're looking forward toward meeting you in the air lord and the saints that have gone on lord what a day that'll be and it's all because you live it's all because there's an empty grave lord lord that you broke the seals and you walked out of that tomb lord to show your living god living throughout eternity lord we thank you for these things in jesus name amen amen let's turn to matthew chapter 5 and verse 14. also john chapter 15. amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen i'll bring you greetings from uh brother fred mullins and and uh the assembly there in south carolina we was away ministering this weekend there and uh brother fred had had a stroke and had been under the weather for quite a while and the doctors had told him he couldn't get in the pulpit for a month so we went there to help him and and put her shoulder to the wheel and he said to be sure and tell you hello from him and the church the life tabernacle amen he said he'd love to meet us sometimes amen so let's let's just look here at matthew chapter 5 and verse 14 ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bush but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that you may see your good works that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven also john chapter 15 and verse 5 says i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing but if a man abide not in me his cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you amen god bless you you can be seated like to speak to you again on you are the light amen my voice is a little bit weak so amen i'm going to try to try to help me tonight ye are the light you know it struck me back there in the office as i was looking over these things and the lord just kind of put it in my heart to look at it again and i looked at i began to read ye are the light you know and i i feel like this was actually more than just words that were written written on paper but jesus was actually saying as as he did as god would say in the beginning let there be light but it was actually a word that was spoke that created lights to a generation lights that would hang in light so as he would there on the day of creation he would speak let there be light in the sun as we've seen it today come out after the storm and it's still hanging there today stars that we watch at night and moon different things amen and no matter what no matter what the devil would try to do he couldn't stop the sun from shining he can't stop the stars from shining they'll shine as long as they are predestined to shine for destination to shine and so will you god actually spoke you into existence amen jesus and his words with these i believe these are creative words he said ye are the light so he could not make that statement unless there would be lights to be to be made manifest and this is what your brother brandon would talk about the spoken word amen coming into the bride he said in very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed unto each came forth in this designated decreed season and as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bribe and though she is effeminate in she is also called the body of christ and so it's very apparent that she ought to be called that for she's preached she was predestinated in him came from the same source what was eternal with him and now are manifesting god in a many-membered body whereas what god was once manifested in one member even our lord jesus christ but now he's manifested in many member bodies amen and so but all coming from the same source or or from the same power or for the same place amen we're not connected to something different than what he was connected to amen as we went through it it's depicted there in the golden candlesticks were all coming from that same place and so god's word would go out let there be light and so the light would go forth into every generation because god is not going to allow satan to have at all dark and all black until it's time to leave here and there's no more spoken word seed left upon this earth and then true darkness will come upon this earth as seen before the creation of the sun it's spiritually speaking but amen god has spoken amen and so through the dark ages through the times through the seven church ages he spoke it there would be light they would manifest they would come forth amen no matter what the doc the devil tried to do how he tried to stop it he tried to saw him asunder he tried to burn them he tried to murder him he tried to put them in prison their lights would keep shining he could not put it out and so so as we saw it all down through the ages and we come in the time that we're living in god is going to have a light upon the earth the devils are going to try to put it out they're going to try to uh force it out they're going to try to do everything they can to extinguish it but god's word amen will not amen will not we'll always be fulfilled it can't be stopped it's unstoppable if there's anything upon this earth that is unstoppable that is the word of god satan's been trying to stop it for thousands of years and he hasn't succeeded yet and he will never succeed because god's word will always fulfill and always come to manifestation and so god is going to have lights and brothers we spoke last time on this amen brother brown would say there was a stream of life here amen and down through there's a bunch of darkness and all the gayty and that's partying and carrying on it's a lot of darkness he said but every once in a while you'll see a light burning he said that's a born-again christian amen that's even in the darkness there's still light now we know light shines greatest in the dark and so god would so design this time that we're living in amen it'd be so dark it'll be you know but he said but he said in his word in the evening time in the dark time amen when time seems to be getting away it shall be light and so it's spoken words god is actually speaking you into existence in the time of darkness god is actually speaking and lights are coming on in darkness just like it did when the sun came and the stars came god is speaking it in this generation just like you did in paul irenaeus wesley martin luther all the way down god spoke and lights came on god spoke and lights came on god is still speaking and lights are still coming off amen lights are still being illuminated amen and satan is trying he's bringing all of his forces he's trying everything he can put it out he's trying to disqualify he's trying to bring it down and say it ain't real but lights are still coming off because you cannot stop the word of god god's word will be fulfilled now you know we were all preplanned by god hallelujah nothing happens by chance so therefore you're not in the time that you're living in by chance amen god knew you would be here matter of fact he pre-planned the time that he would turn the switch on he pre-planned the time planned it for many generations so that you could be here tonight that's how much god thought about you listen well you're not an afterthought you're a pre-planned thought you're not just a side thing and god said oh i guess i'll have somebody no he's been planning you he's been bringing you to this place he's been wiring it up for thousands of generations and bringing this one to this one and what was he doing he was bringing the wires together he brought grandpappy to grandmama amen daddy to mama he was bringing the wires together because he knew i have to have lights in this generation i have to have light so god so men can see god manifested in flesh like they did 2 000 years ago so you're pre-planned for many generations amen you're not just an afterthought hallelujah the devil wants to make you think you're an after a thought and or nobody thinks about you and nobody cares about you but god thinks about you he thought about you before the foundation of the world that's rejoicing that's something to rejoice about right there amen when the devil's speaking and you're here and tells you don't nobody thinks about you nobody cares about you you need to turn back to him and say god thought about me that's why i'm here tonight god pre-planned my existence he wired up he wired it all that i can't be here listen the devil tried to extinguish some of your own back forefathers that if something would have happened to them you wouldn't have been here but god was watching over a seed god was watching over a light he had said ye are the light so god will say no that one okay that cannot happen right now because i got a seed coming through there i got a life coming through there it has to come through amen maybe it was in a war i mean a bullet almost took them out or a ship almost sunk whatever it was but god said no it can't happen right now i got a seed coming through there god's been thinking about you if you get nothing out of this service tonight that god has been thinking about you and if god thought about you and pre-planned your comment he's got the prep the preparations for you he's got enough power to take care of you [Applause] there's enough power in the sending station to make sure your light don't go out [Music] he pre-planned you think about it you're in the gene of your father you didn't he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him at that time but you see that you were put in a bedding ground the womb of your mother through holy wedlock and then through the process of the birth you became became a person expressed in the image like your father that's the only way you can be a son or a daughter of god because you have been you have to have eternal life there has to be an expression there has to be a lighting as we talked about last time a lighting of the candle the match has to touch the wick if it don't touch the wick there's no lights amen amen so there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life but the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule and you were nothing but the manifest and now you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god amen you're expressed after his word has come in you his life has come in you for what to light up this age to light up this age you are expressing god's life in you because now you are a son or daughter of god amen you're not you're not you're now made you're sitting in this church amen because your duty is to express god to this nation to people to the neighborhood where you associate you're led to let your light shine you're here to express the very light of god as he was a light 2000 years ago now you are his light today and you're illuminating and and you're pulsating with life wherever you are god knew you would be here man whoever you are god knew you would be here because you had you have wasn't his genes or his attributes you had to be if you air if you got eternal life then it always was eternal life and god before the foundational world knew you would be here and no matter what the devil tried to do to stop it he couldn't stop it no matter how try hard he tried to put it out or cut the connection generations ago he couldn't do it why god said no i have that light it has to shine just like the sun let there be just like the stars let there be i must have stars in laodicea that has lightened up the world to show i am still alive jesus was the fullness of god made manifest he was the fullness of the godhead bodily therefore when he came to the earth he was manifest in the flesh you were in him because he was the word and the what beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us therefore you walked with him in him because you were in him when he was on the earth you suffered with him you died with him you was buried with him and now you're risen with him the manifested attributes of god setting in heavenly places already raised resurrected a new life setting in heavenly places all that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in jesus christ i want you to understand when brother talking about those lights going down there they're not just randomly there no they have been placed by the power of god they have been put there for a certain purpose for a certain time listen you couldn't come 200 years ago that wasn't your time but you came in the age that we're living in and god has illuminated your life in the darkest of times and now you can shine the brightest [Applause] we are those attributes of god therefore we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed not a denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed into the hour that we're now living see martin could not express the attributes that we express he didn't have the light that we have amen because that was in the beginning the corn of wheat that had been put down into the ground there at pentecost it had to go through all the stages amen to where it would come to greater revelation you know at first when you put something to ground you cover it up how many has ever planted a garden you plant it there and you forget what you planted now this ain't god this is talking about human god don't ever forget what he plants amen but humanly speaking and so there ha it starts breaking forth and at first you're like is that grass or is that a what is that i i remember you know when as a kid dad always had a garden and uh so i uh my job to go out there and help him hoe he's like you know i i just for you know example here something like this would go on said you know you get this whole road you can go fishing with your buddies dude i'd get that hoe and i'd go to hoenn and he'd stop wait a minute you're going too fast you you're going to get the real plants and it began to show me what was real sometimes you couldn't tell the difference but you let that grow a little bit and it begins to manifest itself it begins oh that's a corn planter that's a tomater that's whatever amen oh that's just a blade of grass let me take that out that old bermuda that's what that is let me dig that out by the roots i hate that stuff it begins to manifest itself and god has allowed things to manifest he's allowed it and some of it looks like light but it's not light it looks like truth but it's not true it looks like it's real but it's not real but you let it grow a little bit it'll show you what it is you let it come up a little higher it'll show you what's truly on the inside why do you think we got people leaving the message because they growed a little bit and they've expressed who they really are therefore why you got people that still with the message because they growed a little bit and they're expressing who they are hallelujah this is why jesus would say you can't tear it you can't pull it up right now because you you'll pull up the wheat with the tares but let them grow together then we can tell who's what martin could not express the attributes that we express because they didn't have the light that we have amen you see the whole brother i'm talking about this he said the whole program the whole church of god is built upon divine revelation jesus said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven what was the revelation of who he was upon this rock the revelation of jesus christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he was what he is now the bible expresses it's growing in the bible to full stature therefore if the corn of wheat of christ had to fall in the ground so did the bride have to fall in the ground through the dark ages any grain that goes in the ground must die or it'll never repro reproduce itself and the great church that he established on the day of pentecost by sending the holy ghost had to suffer martyrdom go into the dirt into the earth and the dark ages so it to bring forth again in the age of luther and on down and come on out to full stature of the bride of jesus christ for this last day therefore the bride in the rapture will come forth and there is because there is that is all pre-planned by god and it's all backed up hallelujah amen from the beginning he knew every man every place who would sit all about it it's all been pre-planned god knew it would be so i wanted to give us confidence in the time than the atmospheres that we're living in this is all pre-planned by god news flash it ain't pre-planned by governments they're all in control you say well satan's got them all in control who's he controlled by god's working and about for a certain time in a certain end amen to bring a burning of this whole world amen but thank god we've been pre-planned and the pre-plan let me give you a little idea on the pre-plan before this world burns we're leaving here that's pre-planted by god god pre-planned our our time to come he pre-planned the time we was going to be here and he's pre-planned our future he said you're not going to be in the burning the tares are going to be in the burning you're going to be in the rapture the gathering of the garner and to the garner amen that is who we're blessed that is our pre-planned moment so what are you afraid about not only that he's going to prepare a place that when we leave here he's already got us pre-planned over there hallelujah amen it's all prepared just like even this night is prepared just like this hour's prepared he's prepared it he's fade a table he's got enough plates for every person that's going to be there i love that i've used it before and we'll use it again he knows how many plates to put out he's not got one too many or one too little he's not going to have to holler at the angels and say angels i forgot about that one bring me another plate no it's already prepared and plea pre-planned matter of fact i've already got a name card in my place hallelujah and i want you to understand there's nobody else that can take my place there's nobody else that can take your place it has been pre-planned by god and go the other side neither is he gonna have to take a setting from the table and say well they didn't make it i tried and they didn't make it no if you've been prepared or pre-planned by god to be here and to be there your table is set your place is set your napkin set your forks there whatever is needed for the dinner god is not worried about you not being there he's already made a way and you can line every devil up and he'll not stop you from being there he'll not keep you from being there my name's already written he ain't got enough power to smudge it off [Applause] your hour is prepared it's pre-planned hallelujah now the vine so we've read about the vine the branch the vine doesn't bear fruit the branch bears fruit the vine gives life to the branch to bear fruit and jesus said i am the vine you are the branches therefore the branch is energizing the life into the br or the vine is energizing the life into the vine the branch is energized by the life of the vine therefore jesus has no lips tonight on earth but mine in yours amen he has no eyes but mine and yours he has no hands but mine and yours and he energizes us anybody ever been energized i think i asked this again but i want to ask him one more time who's ever grabbed a hold of a 120. somehow he's fooling with london plugs plugging something in got a little crosswalk energized hey man you you're something that something reacted on the inside of you something moved you couldn't help it it just wasn't it just was an action that caused a reaction it happened and he says the vine is energizing the branch and yet we've got branches who claim to be connected to the vine and there's no movement in them there's no response in them they sit dead as a hammer and they say they're connected they're not energized you get energized there's life inside of you there's something responding there's something going on there's something happening hey man you can call it emotion if you want to call it emotion but i call it something that's real it's about as dumb as grabbing a hold of that over there and saying that's all that's all just emotion it's something that's causing the emotion you big dummy if i got a hold of that over there and i i got it wrong got all the wrong wires and i went to a place where i wasn't supposed to touch talking about electrical plug and when i grabbed a hold of it or you know stuck a fork in it like a dummy whatever amen and it got a hold of me and i started screaming you because i just emotion that's all that is just worked up a motion why don't you get a hold of and see what it is you grab a hold of and stick your finger in there and we'll see what kind of what it is you'll find out it's something more than just emotion it's more than just me over there hollering and carrying on and jumping and trying to get free from it it's something that's got a hold of me there's something that's charging me and it's moving my muscles and it's reacting something's happening if you're being connected to the vine it energizes you it's more than just an emotion there's something that's causing it there's a power that's surging in the body you can call it emotion all you want to and when sister atlanta jumped out of there and that that seat sitting up there where brother george hamilton them are and she ran around this church and the man of god brother tim said maryam your enemy is dead you can call that emotion if you want to but tell me it was an emotion that took all the cancer away if it was i want it if it was just emotion that took the cancer i want it but it was not just emotion it was a power of god she connected into a source and it lit up her life and light came into the body and it drew back to darkness and said darkness get out of here hallelujah [Applause] something that caused the reaction the branch is energized by the life of the vine so if you are not energized if it's not something happening something moving something working it ain't got to be just a shout or dance or a run it's a life policy he energizes us brings it through us oh through us brings it through us oh i thought i thought we just needed to see angels that'd be wonderful to see angels but i don't have to see angels to know they're here with my two eyes they don't matter it matters not i know they're here because the word said they're here amen god brings the energy the power through us he's not working through angels he's working through human flesh hallelujah is christ working through the branches of his church he said listen he's no eyes but mine are yours no hands but mine and yours he energizes bringing forth his life he brings it through us whether it's preaching the gospel by the lips or seeing vision by the eye whether whether it's whatever it is laying hands on the sick it's christ working through the branch of his church every office literally electrified by his presence electrified why would he use that word electrified electrified by his presence now he would make a statement in the fundamental foundation for faith he said why what did christ redeem us for did you ever think about that why did he why did why didn't he just make the atonement make you the atonement and say now there's no need of giving him deep powers listen to this there's no need of making this man a son of god there's no need in doing that i will just ask him to believe it write his name on the book of heaven and that'll settle it but he gave us these redeemed blessings the atonement that we might operate the work of god in other words he didn't want you to just look like a light bulb he didn't want you to just look like a candle he didn't want you to just be like a robot and your name's already there and it's already happened it's already there no he wanted there to be something happening on the inside of you that the same life that was two thousand years ago can now walk off shores here in laodicean age right here in the darkest time that this life can come forth he said there's no need of giving him that there's no need to make him a son of god i'll just write his name down and that'll settle it but he gave us these redeemed blessings that we might operate the work of god by the energy of the holy spirit therefore he would say i am the vine ye are the branches the vibe don't bear forth fruit but the branches bring forth the fruit but the vine with all of its energy and all of its power can't produce it it can't listen to this it with all of its energy and all of its power it can't produce life unless the branch is willing to receive the energy so you can have a nuclear power plant right out there and it can have all the power in the world to light up this whole state of louisiana but if there ain't somebody that go run some wires over there and hook it up it's nothing but a bundle of power that's worthless and if god has all that to you just a bundle of power and you ain't never hooked up to him and his life ain't pulsing pull satan through you and giving you energy to work the works of christ lay hands on the sick cast out devils if he ain't doing all that through you what what good is he he's a god of history he's a god over there in that little box over there that just sits over there and that's all he does is right over there right over there there's god god wants to meet more than just right over there god wants to be more than just right up there god wants to be connected to a body he wants lines that can positive and negative be put right into your life to where your life all of a sudden energizes with the power of the holy ghost and no longer do you just look like a light bulb but there's light pulsating through you there's light moving through here there's energy pulsating and things are happening and demons are being cast out and you're working the works of christ see god is dependent on you as a member of his body to bring forth the fruit now you can look you can interchange these really fruit or light he's depending on you to bring forth the light he's dependent on you to bring forth the fruit if he's dependent on you if if he's dependent on us let's open up our channels amen let the holy spirit come in and energize us and free us from all fears and doubt revivals come somebody said the power is only given to the apostles i'm not in historian but i've read much history church history and i've never seen a time in all the history of the world where there was ever waves of the holy ghost that ever struck the church without a revival but what signs wonders and miracles following god healed the sick and he will continue to do it in every age where people and churches are willing to let loose and let the holy spirit take control of their beings if they're willing to let god move got to move if they're willing to let god heal the sin god will heal the sick if they're willing to let him pulsate through their life god will pulsate he'll pulsate in somebody's life just like he pulsated in david's life when that faithful that's a surge of pulsation come through him when he heard that giants challenge and he heard him scream out send me a man that'll fight send me somebody and he's like who is this uncircumcised devil and something began to pulsate on david why he had been connected to something it wasn't just connected to some dry eyed confession he had had the anointing all been poured over him there was a connection made for him and he had a connection his pulsation began to happen he's like what is this how long are you going to let him talk i've heard enough i'll go fight him got too many saws got to all the ecclesiastical garments and they look like light bulbs but they don't light up devil make the challenge they run back to the tent pull up the computer and try to find a quote about it god wants more than a quote he said well he said that what can do more for jeffersonville is thousands of lived voices live voices in other words people that's real he said in a walk up to the devil and tell him just as sweet and humble as they can be just tell him have authority over him you know what some of y'all need to do you need to walk up to that devil just as sweet as humble as you can be say you're going to hell because that's where he's going he wants to tell you you ain't got no good future well you need to start telling them just as sweet as humble as you can be you're going to hell you're going to burn you're going to lose you're never going to win do you understand what he's telling you actually applies to him he's trying to tell you what belongs to him and put on you what belongs to you you're never going to win you're never going to make it you're going to die there's gonna there's gonna be an end to you god don't care that belongs to the devil let's tell the devil there for a minute you're not gonna win you're not gonna live you got an end you got an expiration date your time is coming you're almost over with amen you might as well shut up and go back to where you came from [Music] hallelujah god wants little voices got too many sauls they're too scared to call prayer lines they're too scared to have altar calls because they're afraid to face those demons we need some davids need some real men don't preach the power out of the church preach it into the church connect them to the old new testament got too many people as we said last sunday they want to wire in an emergency stop button i had to use that again that was too good just one service it want to wire it right in with their creeds and dolphins and they want their little emergency stop button saying hit it when the motion gets a little bit too much and things begin to move too much and they they want to hit it and how did it get there by their creeds by their dogmas by their own ideas and they stopped the working of the holy ghost and they hid it so much to where the holy spirit don't even move no more but there's a way to bypass that thing matter of fact jesus bypassed it it was men that wired it back up but it came back in this hour again and he bypassed it he took it out and said we don't need no stop button we need the spirit of god moving in the body we need to flowing through every limb through every avenue after every place amen we don't know if there's a channel clogged up unclogged let the holy spirit go to moving and god will move it read this part last sunday but they talked about brother brown talked about in the reader's digest read an article he said well i don't know i can't find that article well you wasn't there anyway why are you worried about it i believe what the man said he was there so here not long ago they took an x-ray of a man praying for a sick man and found out a ray of light coming from one man not all of them but for one man's hand reflected a ray of light when they placed a piece of lead foil beneath that man's hand he said i guess you read it for yourself apparently they did because apparently nobody said they didn't in england they turned the healers they caught them loose in all the hospital and there was 80 percent more healing done by divine healing than medical cures had performed it reader's digest picked it up it was in newsweek and reader's digest they find that there's a ray of light when this man sincerely not knowing what they were doing put his hands upon a man and prayed in earnest prayer they was putting the x-ray down and found a light coming from his head god knew what he was talking about when he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but it only works if you've been connected to the light amen because if you hadn't been connected to the light that demon would tell you paul i know jesus i know but who are you amen but if you've been connected to that light he knows what that light is he knows where he's come for from he knows because he was there himself at one time lucifer he knows what he's speaking of the bible so he said i want to see the church pressing that place where it can come like god wants it to be amen is that what your desire is he said when god was made flesh and became the messiah then if he we can yield ourselves to become the anointed like he was we become messiahs little lights little lights that's what the church supposed to be lights little anointed ones hallelujah little anointing was carrying forth his light unto all the church ages sometimes it goes completely out then it comes back on again god's anointed another one god's messianic church if messiah means the anointed one means the kingdom if the church is anointed by the same messiah spirit it's become a lesser but still a messiah because it has his light and if it has his life it has his power it has his glory and it has his dominion because it's reflecting the same thing so it is messiah and how reflects him in his kingdom and his demand the trouble today we've organized it we've organized the church to death we've got the organization instead of the messiah light he's saying like this we've got russell lights and proselytes all other kind of lights now we got messagites but what we need is messiah light what the church needs to do this today is the light of the messiah hallelujah that is true god called messiah god called us he placed us he pre-planned us we become kings and priests in the god like jesus was a god was god's high priest we are also a priest jesus god in fullness dwelt in him shine forth the expression of god to a world for god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and as god was in christ reconcile the world himself god comes into the church and anoints himself some messiahs little lights the same things he did in his church he wants in this church i quoted it the other day but it's worth quoting again brother brother henry greene said god started his church like he wanted it now he wants his church like he started it the same power he had in his church at the beginning i'm saying it like that because he was here he defeated demons and everywhere he went if he could get somebody to believe they left now they wouldn't believe he couldn't do many mighty miracles of scripture would say but if faith would arise in their hearts and light would begin to boom out what was it faith began to pulsate demons begin to i don't like this something's happening you ever seen yeah yeah i hate them thank god we ain't got them but you ever seen roaches i ain't go ask who's ever had roaches but i've seen them different places you come in there in the night flip on the light that's why i don't stay at a hotel 6. they leave the light on for you and there's a reason that's a good one right there amen they might be with 69 tonight but they ain't worth it but anyway roaches are attracted to in the dark they come in the dark you can come in flip flip a light on mice rats every kind of vermin come in the night why because it's where they're comfortable with demons find themselves dark places and they're comfortable in dark places and dark souls are meant but all of a sudden the word can begin to pulsate and light begins to beam out and it's ascending station and it's searching is there some receiving stations is there is there it nope it's not there is there one over yep there it is and it starts pulsating and this receiving station starts pulsating back hallelujah it begins to pulsate back what's it paul say it's reflecting the light that's coming from the sending station hallelujah and it's picking it up and as it begins to pulsate and it gets brighter and brighter demons start running amen this is what god wants his church he wants his church full of lights why do you think he said that they're the cage of every unclean and hateful bird because there's no light it's darkness the demons are comfortable in the dark the same things he did in his church he wants in this church the same power he had his church becomes his dominion he's king over the dominion we're kings and priests offering spiritual sacrifices of god the fruits of our lips giving praise to him oh my there you are messiahs messiahs little messiahs little anointing anointed off of what the main one anointed off the great one oh my he said when jesus was on earth they could deny him be a messiah because he could not deny him being the messiah because he did the signs of the messiah the jews was blind that's the reason they couldn't see it see it signs that's what's the matter with the church tonight is blindness they also a world that may not see it because the god of this world has blinded their eyes with a glare jesus went about and did the signs of the messiah and the people blasphemed him and they blasphemed the great anointing when messiah how much more they call will they call them of his household of the kingdom beelzebubs and whatsoever more holy rollers holy jumpers something another a bunch of emotionalists always got a scandal name for it because it comes from the devil and they called them of his household he said man more than they if they called him that what would they call them of his household but still it makes just the same he said now brother branham jesus has a assigned a messiah how do we know what was a sign the bible said that when the messiah come he would be a prophet and show signs scripture teachers knows that moses said the lord your god should raise a prophet over me he performed those signs showing himself amen he told the woman that she had five husbands and and the one she was living with she said sir i perceived our prophet we know that when the messiah comes he will tell us all things he said i am he that speaks to you and she ran into the city and told the men and i said come see a man who's done those told me the very things that i've done isn't this the very messiah jesus said himself if i cannot do the works of my father and then believe me not if i claim to have the anointing and don't do the works of god because i'm anointed by him i must do the works well that goes for the messiah that goes for the messiahs that was the messiah for the messiahs the church here it comes john 14 12 he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he do maybe also the messiahs the representation of the messiah on earth that's why he would say in mark 16 go into all the world preach the gospel these signs shall follow the messiahs he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be down and these signs shall follow them to believe how far to all the world to who every creature oh i'm so glad how are you ever going to rub that out how are you ever going to rub that out how you ever going to rub that out men have rubbed it out i mean brother branham talked about it and that woman that her son was off and she wrote and said he had she had a terrible sickness remember the story and he comes home and finds her well and she's he's like well mom you told me you was really sick and pointed dying you know they didn't have communication like we got today she said he said what happened you found a good doctor she said no i found a little mission down the street they came down here and they went according to mark 16. they anointed me with oil and prayed the prayer of faith amen lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover and he said mama we learned in seminary school that wasn't anointed she said well that's amazing if god could do that for me with an unanointed scripture what could he do for me with an anointed one hallelujah amen but i'm here to tell you it's all anointed the power of god the bank of heaven is here to back up every promise all he needs is a heart to believe a light a receiving station that says yes lord i receive it yes lord i believe it yes lord it's my yes lord right now [Applause] so i wonder where people that don't believe in signs and wonders fallen believer said how would you ever read that in history of church and think it ceased with the apostles so i read in the night seeing fathers nice and counseled all the ancient writers i could think of reading his looks too bad from many other ancient books all the way down to the early catholic church down in the first 600 years after christ irene and saint martin columbia all of them every one of them saintly men they preached the baptism in the name of jesus christ they preached the remission of sins they preached speaking in tongues they raised the dead they healed the sick signs and wonders followed them plumb onto the dark ages through the dark ages they there's been a little more minority all the way down that kept shining the gospel light what was it messiah's one holding forth the representation of a messiah kingdom jesus never failed he did just exactly what he was commissioned to he came to establish a kingdom and he did it and that kingdom will not be moved though all hell has helped me we shall not be moved we spoke on that like this last sunday night on two kingdoms one that can be moved and one that will not move because he said all heaven and earth will be shaken amen he talks about in hebrews of a kingdom that will be shaken but also a kingdom that will not be shaken hallelujah we're seeing it right in our generation right in our time people the winds of doctrines winds of of unbelief winds of fear winds of this blowing through and shaking people off amen off the tree and shaking them loose amen why because it was dead to begin with but there are some that will never be shaken the kingdom of god comes in the heart by the power of the holy ghost it brings god's spirit upon the anointed church to perform the same signs and wonders as he did to prove that messiah is king of his kingdom he said oh i feel like shouting some of myself right now you see what messiah is messiah is the kingdom of god anointed once them anointed with the same spirit he was anointed with it goes down to the dark ages different ones that died and he says now you don't have to die to get this he said you have to spiritually die but you don't have to physically die the inside is where god gets in control of you and he presses him forward himself forward and you don't let any root of bitterness hatreds malice strife things that'll block up the channels just get all the meanness and the superstition all the unbelief out of you and every time you move out in unbelief god steps right back moves out that little unbelief god will step right in and take over move it all out he told joshua everywhere the soles of your foot have set i'll give it to you and tonight as we enter into the kingdom of god's kingdom amen god's kingdom taking out all the philistine unbelievers all the amorites all the malachites and whatsoever more throw it out of us like we did and take possession when they say days of miracles are passed you say you're a malachite get out of here if they say there's no such a thing as seeing vision you amorite get out of here if they say amen there's no more for you amen you philistine you get out of here hallelujah if they say there's not going to be a rapture you never get out of here if they say you're not going to make it satan get behind me i've already made it my life has been illuminated by the gospel of jesus christ [Applause] you're pressing then and he said from that little button you're taking over the fibers of you spreading out that little button of light when it's illuminated by the eternal seed of god a light bursts forth in you and it begins to spread out of your body taking over every fiber moving on to every place to get to such a place be going down here my we find here this is familiar but i'm going to end it with this wisdom versus faith he said if jesus defeated satan upon the faith knowing who he was he was a predestinated creature pre-planned are you ready what about the predestinated bride of jesus christ do you believe you're predestinated the predestinated bride of christ the church the word seed with everything god promised to put in the church it's right now it's in it now hello somebody it's in it now everything is in order the holy spirit has been given the seed's been song the evening light is shining the sign of sodom that jesus promised us here malachi 4 our predestinated church oh devil oh devil church of the living god here and on tape too i'm glad he included me in that one here and on tape two do you know where you stand do you know that you were called of god the holy ghost reigns in your heart every word of god is real to you oh brother how is satan going to stand against that how is satan going to stand again how is he going to keep that from growing how is he going to keep them signs from following why you could throw them in jail i don't care what you do they rotted in jail they just fed the lions they were saw the sunday they were jerked in pieces you can't kill it a church that's predestinated those he foreknew he called those he called he justified and those he justified he glorified and those he glorified predestinated he said and now in the last days seeds have been sold everything's in order the world's in its order can we say amen the time shaped up the churches and order the seeds the evening lights hello the evening lights the signs that he said as it was in the days of sodom an angel of god the holy spirit coming down moving performing the signs like he did the amalekite four promised he was sinning and we see all that right here where where where amen amen amen amen do you love him oh sure right here in the last days a predestinated church knowing where they stand sowed with the seed of god and the holy spirit in the church satan be careful oh did you hear that he'd been trying to tell you be careful he'd been trying to tell you you're not you're just going to make another mistake even trying to tell you what you got don't last satan be careful hallelujah because his bride is illuminated with the same power he was illuminated with and you know what the brother branham said when he hit him there on that day at calvary he said he hit about a hundred million volt wire and it shocked satan to his core and he realized oh i hit the wrong one hallelujah he said but the same power is in the bride [Applause] satan be careful you're not dealing with some denominational church you're not dealing with some denominational chicken you're dealing with the seed of god eternal life on the inside of them here i'll just read it what did satan do when he met jesus he flew into him with all the ecclesiastical force he had i knew the word also and flew into him i know the word also flew into him he said that's all the denominational dust that he had we threw he we throwed it out onto him but it didn't have any light did he ever fly off he came off a lot quicker than he flew on satan be careful come mess with the seed of god you'll fly off a lot quicker than you flew on come mess with the son of god who's been born to the spirit of god the same power energizing his life you'll fly off a lot faster than you flew on he hit that hundred billion vote wire he sends his feathers he came off of him he came out of him because that wire had bolt in it now and then he said remember satan has a wire too but no matter how nice copper the wire is if it ain't got no life it's dead it won't act might be the same wire but it has to be energized from a dynamo it has to be an energy flowing through it it has no but here's why i don't have a connection that's the reason it'll work though in a predestinated vessel that's the reason the work word will work where it's connected connected to where with the nomination no sir that's a dead socket having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof but we are connected with the word which will never pass away it can never it can be will produce the same power that he had that's where it's connected to not hooked up to some organization but hooked up to the same dynamo he was hooked up with it works there because it's hooked up to the same word and it'll work here because it's hooked up to the same word therefore to still open the eyes of the blind it'll still heal cancer it'll still heal every kind of sickness it'll still save the loss the worst among us it'll say the worst sinner because it's got the same power and the power is what we have been connected to let there be light ye are the lights so white say in zechariah 14 6 and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not a day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light let there be light this word these words are exactly as he spoke it let there be light there shall be light that's why we come to this darkest of age and you can look down through there and it's still poop down through louisiana all the way up through the states east coast all probably all over the world different golf countries because he said he'd have a bride out of every tongue every nation every kindred today there's light shining in japan and they're pulsating they're pushing out the darkness ye are the light let's buy our hands if you hadn't been connected to dynamo if his life is not surging through you i'd say you better get connected you say well i don't i don't i don't need church stream is good enough you're not connected his life is in the body and if you're not connected to the body to the branch you're not connected to the life you can look like a light bulb all you want to look like you can look like a message sister you can have long hair dresses if you ain't got the light of god paul satan in you you're no more than just an amish or a mennonite some kind of religious garbo brothers you can have a certain dress you can look a certain way but that light ain't pulsating through you we're no different than anybody else but he wants to connect you tonight started out this way how many say lord i want to be connected to that source i want to be connected lord i wonder how many would just lift your hand say god i i got some clogs i need to work out unclog my life move it out lord yes father lord jesus see the hands lifted all over this building lord you know the needs and the situations oh god we're coming to a time there's gonna be a gathering of all these lights and they're gonna be drawn to a meeting in the air and this place will go into utter complete darkness thought it's dark enough with the lights that we have what's it going to be like when there's no more light what's it going to be like when the last predestinated seed is taken off this earth darkness i don't know if we can imagine how dark it's going to get lord i don't want to be there i want to be one of those lights that are pulled out of this dimension into the other draw as father by your power and
