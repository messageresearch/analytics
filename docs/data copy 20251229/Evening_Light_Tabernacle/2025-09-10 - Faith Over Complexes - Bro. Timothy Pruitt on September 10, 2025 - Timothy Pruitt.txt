If you have a visitor next to you, I want you to turn around and tell them, "Welcome to the house of the Lord." If you don't, tell your neighbor, "Welcome. Glad to be in the house of the Lord." [Music] Amen. And if you've been in the news today, it hadn't been good news. But if you've been reading the good news, it's still good news. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I don't know about you.

Oh, when we are gathering in. Oh, wash my soul and free from all sin. Oh, how shall I and how when the redeemed are gathering? [Music] Hallelujah. How many is looking forward to that? Amen. That's more than just a story, but it's thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. Let's turn our Bibles to First John, if you would, chapter 4. Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord and come to worship him and to hear from him. Our God is a good God. Amen. Let's just bow our hearts in prayer go to the author before we read the word. Father, we just come to you, Lord, today once again. Just asking that you'd come and and speak to our hearts, Lord, and minister to us, Lord. That you would just come and touch our lives, Lord, by your presence. The service, Lord, by your presence, Lord, each person gathered here, may they be touched by your presence. We pray. Lord, we commit this service to you. All that be said and done for your glory in Jesus name. Amen. Excuse me. John chapter 1 or chapter 4 and verse one. Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone in out into the world. Hereby know ye the spirit of God. Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God. And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you've heard that it should come and even now already is is it in the world. Ye of God, little children, and have overcame them. Because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Amen. God bless you and be seated. like to speak to you on faith over complexes. Um just looking at this first part of this scripture on beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because we know that every spirit is not of God. Amen. There's evil spirits that are working in this world and very prevalent in the world that we live in. And and we know how spirits are. They evil spirits they come and they try to attach themselves to weaknesses in our flesh. Just like you know cancer that's how it starts. It finds a weak cell and and it enters into that weak cell and begins to grow from there. And so spirits come and they try to attach themselves to weak places in our in our lives and whether it be in our human spirit or or wherever that that's where they try to come there. You know, a good adversary is not going to come and try to attack you at your strongest position, but it's going to try to find the weaknesses and the places there that no doubt some have been passed down through generations. And just looking at this thought on complexes or this word on complexes, it says they're caused by a combination of factors including childhood experiences such as upbringing or abuse or neglect or environmental factors like social status or or physical and even mental limitations. says these early experience create deepseated beliefs often unconscious unconscious of that influence thoughts and behavior and sometimes as a defense mechanism against feelings of shame, fear or inferiority. But you know as I said there's many times that even childhood experiences and we'll we'll go into the word on this and quotes on this childhood experiences you know negative experiences in your childhood such as neglect or or or abuse or or or constant unfavorable comparison to others or you know can lead to feelings of being inferior or having a low self-esteem and it causes a complex to come in your life. Amen. other things are around living in certain environments, certain homes, certain things that happened in your childhood and causes you to have disadvantages, you know, maybe being treated poorly by your parents or or your peers or and it begins to develop a complex inside of you and and you know, whether they be real or they be perceived physical or or mental things, they begin to limit you and what you're really called to do. And then we know what our real true calling is not to be just a good human or to be a good person or to be, you know, to live a good life here upon this earth, but our true calling in this life as as a believer is to be a Christian to to live for him. And I believe that's what our life should be about. And you know, that's exactly why the devil is constantly trying to limit us in our abilities to live for him. Amen. Amen. to cause us to pull back, to cause us to bring ourselves in and hide behind a certain thing or or a certain mechanism in our body that that's been passed down or we've learned through life, through situations. You know, the complexes according to a certain man, complexes are a collection of repressed or forgotten emotions or desires or memories with a strong emotional tone that influence behavior without conscious. Amen. It influences you even when you're not even thinking about it. Or maybe that thought of what happened is not even there. But it has constantly influenced your life and it causes you to have an emotional impact. And complexes often arise from intense emotions like shame and fear and trauma. And it creates a pattern of thoughts. And those pattern of thoughts become a pattern of behavior. And that pattern of behavior becomes your life and how you look at things and how you how you view things, you know. And then that's very important that we we realize how are we really viewing things. It ain't my view or brother Aaron's view or brother Tim's view or anybody else's view. We should be looking as Jesus Christ would look at things. How he would view things and how he would look at things. So we see that these experiences and feelings can consolidate consolidate into a core form of thought and behavior and that influence will come and bring you into a place and how you will interact or how you will be or how your social life will be. We see it happening. Now, I want you to understand, you do not get a complex by the word from the word of God. You do not get a complex by the blood of Jesus Christ. You'll receive love. Love. Amen. You get love. Not a complex, you know, not that I'm a little bigger, somebody else, or a little better, or I know a little more. No, I just got I I want Jesus Christ in my life leading me and guiding me. Amen. That's exactly what the word of God is for. It's to lead us and it's to guide. And that's why the devil is constantly against us. That's why I think it's a kind of a paradox that he would come and set up things even today, you know, for real funny things like grabbing the wrong microphone or getting the wrong key. What would happen if you would have a complex from that? It would begin to to uh operate in the and and and change the whole the whole service. Amen. Because if you would operate, well, I made a mistake or I did this wrong or I made this D and then before you know it, I might as well just quit. I I ain't got no reason for being here. I might as well just give up singing. I I might as well just give up preaching because I I grabbed the wrong microphone. But listen, God, that's how Satan wants to come and operate in that. But I'm not looking in those eyes. I'm not looking at my failures. I'm looking at a calling God has placed in my life that regardless if I grab the right microphone or the wrong microphone, it changes nothing. &gt;&gt; Regardless if we get the right key or the wrong key, it changes nothing. It's about worshiping God. It's about living for him. &gt;&gt; But see, people live under these things and and it's been passed down through situations or life. You know, brother Brandham talks about he's asked a question. He said, "When a person realizes he has an inferior complex or some sort of complex, how can he overcome this? Should it be if he was only child caused this from his early youth?" So then maybe that's what they had. You know, maybe they was the only child and they're trying to figure out is this why I got this complex. But he said, here's his word. Take exactly the opposite. &gt;&gt; Try the spirits. Amen. Take exactly the opposite. If you're always wanting your way and you're that little brat that wants to always have everything your way, turn right back around and give everything you got the other way. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. If you're selfish and you want to hold everything, then start giving away what you got. Do whatever. Just go the vice versa. That's the way to overcome anything is the antidote. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen. That's exactly if you're if you're stubborn, go the other way. &gt;&gt; If you're inferior, Amen. move the other way. &gt;&gt; Don't go too far the other way or you'll come superior. &gt;&gt; There is a middle of the road. &gt;&gt; That's where we want to be. That's what the word of God is. Amen. And so he says, you know, another person asked this question about speaking of stubborn. He said, "Brother Brandham, I'm saved and I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, but how do I get away from a stubborn spirit that I can't seem to break away from?" He said, "Well, my Christian brother or sister, whoever it may be, many times you find people that's got stubborn spirits. It's usually a complex that's caused this. Either they have inherited from a mother, father, uncle, aunt, grandmother, grandfather, somebody like that. And if you trace it back down through their life, you'll find he said, "I've taken this by experience under discernment because I met cases on the platform, thousands of those that had that spirit, the first thing you know, I trace that spirit back by discernment and find that there was a granddaddy or a grandmother or somebody back there that you inherited by nature." Stubbornness is not of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be like, "Brother Joe do Joe." Brother Joe, I started ducking here. Stubbornness is not of God. Now, the only way you can get away from that is you have to have faith to overcome that. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are a Christian. You're a son or daughter of God, whoever you may be. You'll never be able to just stand and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke it. That's just like tantalizing a rattlesnake. He's laying there ready to bite you. If you'll just ignore him and walk away, he can't hurt you. But when you feel that you got that stubb stubborn spirit, lay that thing on the altar and believe that believe God that the thing is dead and you'll never have it no more and go on and don't pay no more attention to it. The thing will leave you. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. You'll get away quickly. That would be my advice. How to overcome it. We overcome the devil by faith. &gt;&gt; Not just rebuke it, rebuke it, rebuke it by faith. Walk in the word of God. That's not who I am. It was handed down maybe through generational curses. Whatever it is, you can put whatever you want to. It may not be stubbornness you deal with tonight. It might be pride. It might be arrogance. Amen. Complexes that are laid there. It might be a superiority complex that you're greater than everybody. It might be in for you. Whatever it is, we are not to walk according to those spirits, but according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; And the only way you overcome it is by faith. You lay it down and you walk away from it. And sure, it's going to try to rise up, but you just keep walking. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said even, you know, even I'm thankful that the message that we have, Amen. the the word of God that we have now, if you don't understand what we're talking about, we believe that God sent a prophet in this day and and and you can see it in the scriptures. If you'd like to talk about it, we'd love to talk with you about it. But Amen. I believe I'm I'm so thankful that our prophet was open enough to tell us about his own humanities, &gt;&gt; that he also dealt with complexes. you know, he he got a complex because he got to a place that he felt like nobody wanted to hear him preach anymore &gt;&gt; because it went from the great meetings of divine healing and and thousands would come and cuz you know they really wasn't really he was only part of it. They wanted to see the can I say it this way in the magic show. &gt;&gt; Amen. That people could get out of wheelchairs and and people would get get you know be lame would walk and all those things that had happened. And when that started to go and he started to move towards that third pull and that third phase of his ministry and started to preach the word and start I mean not in all way but you know what I'm saying the truths of the word and the word came open and he began to stand there. Amen. Friends walked away and people that had been with him walked away and this one trying to tell him why you preaching this why you keep preaching about women and their makeup and their hair and all. Why you keep doing all that? If you just preach the healing that would bring the crowds. And he developed a complex because now his meetings were getting smaller and the pressure was greater and things were happening and it caused him to want to go completely off the field. Caused him to want to go into a place of hiding. Amen. He said, "I'll just be like one of the Old Testament prophets. I'll go up into the mountains and I'll grow a beard out and when the word of the Lord comes to me, I'll come down and I'll say, thus sayaith the Lord and I'll go back up into the mountains again." But that wasn't what God intended for him to be. God had called him for a different platform and a different way. Amen. And so he we know the story. He goes there with his boy his boy Billy and they're going up into the wilderness and they stop and he's had these thoughts in his minds and these plans. He's done planned it all out. This complex has gotten so big he's already moved into the wilderness in his mind. He said, "I'll just trick my wife and I I I'll just take her up there and she won't even know." And he's got all of these plans out of a complex. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he's sitting there and getting a little breakfast at that little diner that morning and this big old mountain man is sitting over there and he let out one of them mountain man sneezes. My kind of sneeze. Sorry, but I don't understand anybody. I I don't understand that. It don't work for me. I'm sorry. I something handed down from my papa. I guess my papa butts. you. He was over in the next house and he you knew when he sneezed, you can be in your house in bed and you can still hear him. This man let out a big old sneeze. He's like, "Ah, that's a real man." About that time, these two other little fellas come walking in, little bummed looking guys walking in off the street there and his boy looks over there and says, "Daddy, that looks like you." It was Uncle Fletcher. Uncle Fletcher. He said, "That looks just like you and Fletcher, boy. He said he just looked at that and he thought, "Wow." And he got back and they got back in the car and said, "Let's go." And he got back in the car and the word of the Lord came and the word voice of God spoke and said, "If you'll carry out your plans, you're going to be just like them, &gt;&gt; a bomb." This is where his complex was leading him to. This is where his complex was driving him to to be a bomb. That's why we got to try the spirits that try to rise up in our lives and realize, are we being led by the spirit of God? Or is it some other spirit that's trying to rise up and cause me to not be who I'm supposed to be? Cause me to be just a spiritual bomb that I have no rights. I I have nothing. I have no no I have no inheritance. I have nothing. He gets up to his church and he begins to talk about it. He says, "Pray that God will place into my hearts that something that I lost there in that complex." It's so easy to build a complex. He said, "I had an interview the other day with brother Wayey sitting here sitting here present a good man but built himself around the complex another kind of complex did the same thing. Brother way, you can so easily do it. You just get a little some little, listen to this. You could just get a little something in your mind and you keep thinking that way. &gt;&gt; But then he says, go back and check it with the scriptures and see if it's really right or really wrong. &gt;&gt; Search the scriptures. Try the spirits. Amen. See, yeah. You know, don't he said, don't lose the feeling of the people. You must remember they're not made out of sawdust. They're flesh and blood. Human beings with a soul. Pray for me all of you if you will. And it goes on the ne that night. Amen. Now, we know what happened at the end of that service. Brother Weey would fall over dead with a heart attack and God would raise him up. It is the proof that brother Tim's a witness to the very his wife telling the very details and all these things. Hey, listen. This he said then that evening he said this morning when making my confession of having a complex I referred to brother we as also having a complex which is certainly normal among all people &gt;&gt; among all people he said but so a little further down he said so I say that in honor of Jesus Christ who is the same God when this morning I'd preached at length way over my time tired worn and there and he said he he he either got tired or when I spoke he talking about brother way now he either got tired or when I spoke of having a complex Not just to mess my brother up, as we'd say. I was making my confession of having a complex. And I guess if I He said, I guess I'll ask this audience of people, how many here knows you have a complex. Practically every hand would go up that you might know, Brother Way, just let let me show you whether it's discernment or not. How many knows that you got the a complex? Raise your hands. Look at here. See, but I don't know if that shock of me saying that to brother way, talking it, talking it like that and saying it that he thought I might rebuke him or something. But then when he heard that, he fell into this condition. But praise God, he brought him back. &gt;&gt; So here here one is confessing his pro his problem. Another one is res. Brother Brandon would say in a different place. He resented what I said. &gt;&gt; And he fell over from a complex. &gt;&gt; Listen, we don't understand how deep these things sometimes can go into our life and how effective they can be. Amen. You know, it's another story here. Brother Brandham talks about a boy. He said, "I was called in on a scene. A little something going on. It was a fine young man. Very fine young man was going with this little girl. Fine little girl out of fine family. A lot of fine people, right? Sound like Christian people. And this boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of idea and he just walked away. Did something wrong to the little girl much as promised her to do certain things, then didn't do it instead ofizing like a gentleman should do. It just wasn't in him to do it. And the father and mother called on the scene and said, "We would desire to know what's wrong with our boy." He said, "It's not easy to do sometimes, but you must be truthful and honest." The boy was a Christian as far as a believer. He had repented, been baptized, had his position among the believers, but had not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. No matter how much he thought he had, &gt;&gt; we heard about that Sunday, right? &gt;&gt; You thinking you have it and having it is two different things. &gt;&gt; You might be able to try to say you have, you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion, but unless you your life is vindicating what you're professing to have, you don't have it. No matter how many emotions, how much jump, run, sensation, speaking in tongu, shouting, whatever you lay upon, that's all right. I believe in all that, too. But unless your life copes with your testimony, then you don't have it &gt;&gt; because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are. Just like the fruit of any tree tells what it is. By their fruits, you shall know them, Jesus said. But anyway, his mother is a German. No reflections on the German, but there's a strain in that family. They'll sit and you can talk to them and they'll just stare you right in the face. They got it. this girl's sister, mother of this boy, her sister. I come down the streets many morning. Young lady be sitting in the yard. I say, "Good morning to you." And she just look at me. I'll stop and I'll say, "Just fine morning, right?" She'll just stand and look at me. Just intelligent woman. I said, "Come on, come up see us sometime." She just stand and look. Her brothers are the same way. Father and mother that way. No reflections on the Germans because I'm gonna get on some other people too in just a minute. All right. Give me just a m. But let me tell you, there's a lot of Germans in church. &gt;&gt; You can say, "God is good." And they'll just look at you. You can say, "Amen. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever." They just look at you. &gt;&gt; You can say all kinds of that. What is it? It's a stray that's been passed down. It's a devil trying to rob them of their blessing. &gt;&gt; Come on now. And here here he said, "Now the boy is strictly an Irishman. Oh boy. Moody and hightempered and highrung. His whole family is like that except the ones that are converted. &gt;&gt; So that tells me that if you really receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost as we heard Sunday, it'll rewrite your life. &gt;&gt; It'll rewrite your nature. It'll rewrite everything about you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, there might be family strains that are in this building that's been passed down by generation by generation. Listen, let me tell you, going to a shrink is not going to help you. Going to a psychologist is not going to fix it. But if you can get to Jesus, &gt;&gt; if you can get to that spirit of God and it come on the inside of you, it can do more for you in just a few seconds. The father this father and mother both Christians filled with the Holy Ghost. They brought this young man up in the way of the Lord. But now he's 17, 18 years old something along there. Very fine kid been a model boy at home. So mother's family lives close to a fine church, but do you think they'd ever come over? No. And they know it's right, but it's not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning. They won't do it. It's just not in them. Now the genes of the father and this mother is in this boy no matter how much they are converted &gt;&gt; still remains in the flesh of this boy that's been bred down through generations. Therefore the boy has got a complex in him from his mother's family and they are not forgiven. They will not apologize. And that's where that boy stands right now. And he said, 'I said to the father, no matter how much you've raised him right now, look out of your family, all them drunks, fighting, shooting, cutting up, and so forth. Look at your family there, but to your to the mother, they're a bunch of people that just sit there and won't speak, very independent, so forth, irrevant, irreverent to religion. But I said, it's not you. You're one of your uh you're the only one out of your sisters and brothers. You're sweet and kind and forgiving. What does that? You're on the same tree, the family tree. Yet, you have received the Holy Ghost. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the thing you have made you tender and sweet. It's not your people anymore. It's Christ that lives on you &gt;&gt; in you. I said the boy, look at your family practically the man practically all them drunks and so forth. How moody, high-tempered, how strong, but you're not. You're kind. You're forgiven. What is it? You're on the same tree. It's You should have the same genes. What happened? The Holy Spirit is no more who you are or what you are is what Christ is in you. Now the same thing has to happen to your son. &gt;&gt; The same thing has to happen to your son. What has to happen? The Holy Ghost has to happen. &gt;&gt; It cannot be passed down generation to generation. This is what people get wrong. We think sometime we can just pass down an intellectual understanding and if they believe what we believe, they're going to be all right. No, I tell you how they're going to be all right. If they get what Peter got. If they get what Paul got. If they get the same Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Father raised up and said, "Well, my son went to the altar. He was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Water baptism in the pool. I know my son has come to Christ. Said that's all right. That's good. All the outward motions, he might be identified as a believer with believers, but until he's regenerated, born again. &gt;&gt; Somebody say born again. &gt;&gt; Born again. I advise that young man to never marry a woman. &gt;&gt; He'll make hell on earth for her until that gentle, sweet, forgiving spirit of Christ comes in. Then that will be a paradox in itself. And it'll take the very nature of a boy that's been bred between father and mother. Yet in his intellectual, he's trying his best to overcome it. He'll never do it. He'll never overcome it. Christ will have to overcome it. When he lets Christ in, then he's already overcame. &gt;&gt; Then greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. He said, "I've seen critics stand off and make fun and carry on about a Holy Ghost revival, and after a while, God will get a hold of that same man and change him. And here he stands right in the pull pit preaching the same thing that he once hated." Did you catch that? &gt;&gt; Did you really catch that? &gt;&gt; He said, "After a while, God get a hold of that same man and change him." And here he stands right in the pullpit preaching the same thing that he once hated. &gt;&gt; Amen. What did it? &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But you know he says here said you know he said after all these years in the field and around the world getting the people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in at. If you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant spirit ever come around. &gt;&gt; Don't let no malice come. No matter what anybody says, if they're all wrong, don't you ever build up a complex against that person cuz people don't understand sometimes they can get feelings towards a certain person in the church. And if they're not they're not they're not they need to be real careful because some that that feeling can actually not be really towards that person. It can be between before that God &gt;&gt; or aimed at God. You get what I'm saying? Because listen, we got to look beyond the human veils. That's right. &gt;&gt; People get complexes built up towards people in the church and they get angry and they won't worship God. Listen, that is not a That is not a complex towards somebody. That's a complex towards God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't ever let that thing be sweet and kind. Remember, God loved you when you were in sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God loved you when you were unlovable. &gt;&gt; God loved you when you made mistakes. &gt;&gt; God may loved you when you wasn't perfect. &gt;&gt; God loves you even though you're still not perfect. &gt;&gt; And if the spirit of God's in you, you'll love the other person when he's been wrong. Just pray for him and love one another above everything. Love God. Love one another. be humble with God and around one another and then God will bless you. It's hard telling what he will do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But people get things happen in their life as we've talked about. You know, Brother Brandley, this is interesting as an accident at work. This man was going through and says, "You've had a this is in discernment. You had an accident. It's a you were gassed with carbon monoxide gas. Is that true? It poisoned you. It poisoned you in your liver and you had trouble with that. You had trouble with your stomach and you had trouble with your heart and has made you so nervous until you built up a complex. &gt;&gt; But now you're forced that you have to go back to work and you're afraid to do that. You're afraid of that carbon monoxide gas. But it's going to be all right. Jesus Christ you remember if Jesus Christ would tell me who you are. Now you know those things are true, wouldn't they? If he'll tell me who you are, will you accept it and know and go on back and be of good cheer, will you? All right, Mr. Wagner, go on back your road. It's okay. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what was it? It was something that happened and it scarred him. And in that scar, that's where the devil wants to come and attack something. &gt;&gt; That's where he wants to attach things in your life through scars. You may have had scars handed down through from your from your situations in your marriage or or or situations when you was a child, whatever. Listen, that's where the devil wants to come and attach his feelings and attach his fears and to attach his situation. There's only one cure for that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There ain't no medicine that you will ever go down to Walmart that'll ever cure you of that. There's no doctor you'll ever go to that'll ever cure you of that. There's only one cure. That's the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the life of Christ to come on the inside and to put his bomb over the wound and the scars of your life. So you always get scared. Lots of things frighten you now. Dog or something like that. You'll make a noise. You'll scream. One time coming from school, you was run by one, wasn't? Yeah. Yep. And that makes you real nervous and you always feel that when you're upset and you're always deep thinking and crosses bridges before you get there. What happened from a scare? It changed the trajectory of her mind to where now she can't even she's her mind is so changed that she could start taking on problems. She started crossing bridges and always deep thinking. Why? Because of a complex. &gt;&gt; Another one say I see you I see it go way back to a little girl. I see you a little girl. You're running from something. It was something chasing you. It was a dog. It seemed like you was coming from school or something. What? It scared you and since then you've been nervous like all your life. What is it? It's caused from something in their life that they've allowed to lay there and they've allowed to to fester and you know complex. You know people use complexes many times to hide behind them. &gt;&gt; They hide behind them to hide you know to hide behind something usually you pick out something that's bigger than you &gt;&gt; right? You know, kids, little kids, they they don't have that concept, right? I mean, they'll go hide behind this little little post right here and, you know, and they think they're hiding. I remember dad coming to try to find me one day in the woods, and I was hiding behind this tree, but it wasn't quite big enough. You always want to find something that's bigger than you, right? So, you want to hide behind a tree or you want to find something big enough that no one can see you that you're behind it. That no one can see really who you are. And if you're sticking out somewhere, it don't work. So, people make their problems or their complexes bigger so they can hide behind them. So, their real self or their real feelings are never in view. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But we're not to be hid behind a complex. We are to be hid behind the word of God. &gt;&gt; That is a true hiding place. That's the only place you can find true safety. It will not be in your complex. &gt;&gt; It will not be in your fear. It will not be you pulling back and coming, you know, moving. It won't you'll never find true hiding there. The only place you can truly hide is in under the wings of Jehovah. The only true place you can hide is under the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in reality, what you're saying is your complexes is bigger than the word &gt;&gt; cuz it's it's a big it can hide you better. You know, just like Gideon, he was hiding behind something. He was feeling inferior to the enemy. He was feeling that he wasn't big enough and he wasn't great enough to fight them. And it wasn't possible that he could do this. And it wasn't possible. He surely if somebody God was going to use somebody in this day, it wasn't going to be him. It was going to be somebody else. So he's hiding behind a wine wine press threshing some wheat because why? He had a complex. He was hiding back there in feeling inferior to the calling that need the work that needed to be done. And then you know when God I love this when God come the angel come and spoke to him, he didn't call him and you inferior nothing. You he what you doing back here hiding? Get out there. No, he said, "Get in, thou mighty man of valor." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I love when God addresses his people. He does not address them the way they feel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad about that tonight? He does not look at you tonight and address you the way you feel. Well, you sorry, low down, rich. You unworthy, no good for nothing. No, Gideon, thou mighty man of valor. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was another man that was short in statue. He had a complex, Zakius. And what was he doing? He was hiding in behind the leaves of a tree. &gt;&gt; Not realizing Jesus saw him and loved him no matter who he was, what he was, what size he was. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What he looked like. &gt;&gt; Well, I just wish I was prettier. God made you this way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I just wish I had better looks. God made you this way. &gt;&gt; I just wish I was a little taller. God made you that way. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Is he a good artist or is he not a good artist? &gt;&gt; Is he a good sculptor or is he not a good sculptor? Can he make masterpieces or can he not make masterpieces? Amen. This is what he was. And but notice he couldn't hide from Jesus. No matter how small he was or how big the tree was. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, you're not Jesus wants to come to you. Yeah. I don't care how big you built your complex. I don't how I don't care how big that you're hiding behind what you're hiding behind. If Jesus wants to come to you, he knows where you're at and he knows how to call your name. And I believe tonight he knows where somebody's at. And he knows you pulled back and you've been in this complex and he's calling you tonight and that tree ain't big enough for you to hide behind. That complex ain't big enough for you to hide behind. That fear is not big enough. &gt;&gt; Zakius, I'm going to your house. Ephesians 2 and verse 10 says, "We are his workmanship." You know, he took great great, what's the word I'm looking for? Pains. That's the word. To make sure you got here &gt;&gt; from not just two gener one generation ago or two, but from since the beginning of time. Amen. &gt;&gt; He watched his lineages cross and lineages cross and he protected and he kept men in battle. He he he he made sure certain things certain genes was passing through because he had somebody in his mind apparently. &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron, his own grandfather was on a ship that set the Rick record for listing in World War II. Got it out. It was a typhoon. It got out there and set the world world record for listing. Should have went down. Should have capsized. Should have. But there was a man on there &gt;&gt; because God had in his mind there had to be a preacher in in even like tabernacle. &gt;&gt; And that ship couldn't go down if it wanted to. And here sometimes you sit in your complexes and your unworthiness and your unbelief and all of that stuff that's going on not realizing how hard how much God worked to get you here for this moment &gt;&gt; to know that I got a bride in Leodysia that's without going to be without spot without wrinkle without blemish. So I'm going to watch over this one. I'm going to watch over this one. I'm because I got to have her there. We are his workmanship, which means a work of art. &gt;&gt; You know, I I have went through some amazing halls of art. I was there in Paris. What's the name of that place, Brother Joe? That's got all those art pieces. The Lou, thank you. Walk through that. Incredible. And some of them I wouldn't give you a dime for. I like, well, that's interesting. &gt;&gt; But it has to be a masterpiece, you know? It has to be worth a bunch of money to be hung in a place like that. But to me, it wasn't worth nothing. Hey, listen. I I went I went I went to went to where they were standing in line to see the Mona Lisa. I didn't stand in that line from afar. She was ugly from afar. I didn't want to be close to her. I was like, "No, I'm good. I see it right here." Or whatever. I see it. I wouldn't give you a dime for it. But they works of art they call them. People, you know, today can throw stuff on a canvas and it looks like they call it abstract art or something. It just looks like somebody got drunk and crazy and did all kind of stupid stuff. It does. It don't make no sense. And it sells for millions of dollars. But he says you are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; Now there may be somebody in this earth that wouldn't give a dime for you. There might be somebody in this earth that wouldn't care if you lived or died. There might be somebody that wouldn't care if you took another breath or not. But I can tell you the one who counts, &gt;&gt; he cared enough that he gave his life for you. &gt;&gt; That tells me that you're worth something. That tells me, amen, you're worth more than those paintings hanging in the Lou there that I wouldn't give you a dime for. And even if they were worth millions of dollars, Amen. They ain't a There ain't very many people that I know would give their life for them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. Ain't very many people I know it's I want that one. Kill me. &gt;&gt; No. No. But God said, I want that one, and I want that one, that one, that one, that one, that one. They are my works of art. He thought I was worth saving. He thought I was worth keeping. He thought I was worth dying for. And he called me by name. &gt;&gt; I had to break that complex. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I don't have the whole lot of time, but I I I love this scripture. I've read it before, but I I want to get down to a verse, but Psalms 139. Just go home and dwell on that for a little bit. read in the King James, read it in the the other translation, the Living the Passion translation is a really good one and it really brings out the depths of this. But in this scripture, David is going through things and he's he's like and he's going working through all the things in his life and he's like, you know, I got enemies. I got the I can run over here, but I can't hide from you and all that. I can I can bring go into the dark and I still can't hide from you. And he's going down and finally he comes down and he says, "Lord, when I was being formed in secret and intricately and skillfully formed as embroidered with many colors in the depths of the earth, your eyes have seen my unformed substance and your book were all and in your book were all written the days that were appointed me. when as yet there has none, not one of them even taken shape. Before he was even born, he wrote books about you. How precious also your thoughts towards me, oh God, how vast is the sum of them. If I could count them, thou would outnumber the sun. When I wake, I am still with you. But he talks about how that you are fearfully and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; You are a work of art. You are you are God's masterpiece. &gt;&gt; So why would we belittle you know what they did to them? They did it to the Mona Lisa. They threw tomato juice or something on it or they go get these statues and they throw this to to try to tear it take away the value of them and to do all this. Satan tried that on you. But God saw still value down there and he picked you up out of that old dirty slop pin and he started working on you. Started cleaning you up. Smoking fell away and drinking fell away. Alcohol up womanizing fell away. All these things begin to fall away. Situation things in your life and he cleans you out. And you remember that first day when you was clean. Satan tries to come and he tries to bring these spirits back into that vessel and he tries to come against it and attach itself on the outside to make it look dirty and unworthy. Tries to bring complexes when Listen, why if you had a million dollar painting on your wall, would any of y'all go and take some tomato soup and wipe all over it? Take some dirt and wipe all over it, deface it. No, it'd be worth it. It's worth something to you, especially if you paid for it. Why would we allow Satan to come and bring complexes and allow those complexes to come and bring down the real value of what's on the inside of us where we can serve God the way we should serve him where we could worship God the way we should worship him where we could give a complete unhindered freedom to praise him and to glorify him. Why would we allow a complex to devalue that? Listen to what G Philippians 2. I want to read this and amplified. Philippians 2 and verse one. Therefore, if there is any encouragement and comfort in Christ, as there certainly is in abundance, I like that. If there is any consolation of love, if there's any fellowship that we share in the spirit, if there's any great depth of affection and compassion, make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love toward one another, knit together in spirit, intent on one purpose, and living a life that reflects your faith and spreads the gospel, the good news regarding salvation through faith in Christ. Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit conceit and with the an attitude of humility being neither arrogant or self-righteous regard others as more important than yourselves. Do not merely look out for your own personal interest but also for the interest of others. Having this same attitude in yourself which was in Christ Jesus looked to him as your example of selfless humility who though he existed in the form and unchanging exa essence of God as one with him possessing the fullness of all divine attributes the entire nature of deity. Do not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped or asserted as if he did not already possess it or was afraid of losing it. In other words, he did not live through a complex. &gt;&gt; Look at it. He He wasn't a He he he he didn't didn't doubt that he already possessed it. And neither was he afraid of losing it. &gt;&gt; He knew what it was like. He knew what it was to be there. He knew what it was like to be God cuz he was God. but emptied himself without renouncing or diminishing his deity but only temporarily giving up the outward expression of divine equality and his rightful dignity by assuming the form of a bondervant and being made in the likeness of men. He became completely human but was without sin being fully God and fully man. After he was found in the terms of his outward appear in the terms of outward appearance as a man for a divinely appointed time he humbled himself still further by becoming obedient to the father to the point of death even the death on the cross. And for this reason also because he obeyed and so completely humbled himself. God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name. So that at the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow in submission of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth. And every tongue will confess and openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is the Lord's sovereign God to the glory of God the Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. So because that he would refused to bow down to complexes that enabled him to even go and give up his life &gt;&gt; to humble himself even further. &gt;&gt; This is where people can't come to the point of dying out because they're not willing to die to that complex, that thing that has sat there and kept them from going on with God. Kept them from moving another step. kept they always come to that point and go back. But Jesus not living under this complex, he was willing to die. He was willing to lay it all down. And in laying it all down, he was exalted. &gt;&gt; Listen, you're never going to be exalted. You're never going to be in a rapture unless you lay it all down. Many times in our lives, we grow up in situations. We get in things in our lives and situations that causes us hurt for so long. And if we're not careful, we'll turn that hurt towards God and that hatred towards God has been speaking to a young man who had a dear loss trying to find his way. And it's like I I just encourage him. Look, don't don't turn this towards God. God was there to receive your child. This didn't happen because God of God. This happened because of the devil. This happened because of the fall and took him through the fall and where sin entered in. and why we're living under this curse. I said, "But if you'll turn it towards God, if you turn your hatred towards God, you'll never get you'll never get the freedom and the real need and the real things met that you really need." But if you'll turn it towards who really belongs on &gt;&gt; this is where people get they they they come and they get so angry. Why did God allow this? Why did God allow God was God? Why? Sometimes it was done because we got ourselves in some stupid situations. We done it to ourselves. But it's the real blame belongs on Satan. &gt;&gt; I think of Adam and Eve. They never dealt with a complex until they sinned. Then they had a complex towards God and they went and made fig leaves to try to hide themselves, but they couldn't hide from him. God saw through their own man-made things. And God will see through your things every time. &gt;&gt; This is what David read. You go read it. David said, "I can go into the dark." He said, "But dark is light to you cuz you're light. When you come, you're just enlightened my darkness and I can't even hide there. If I go down into the depths, you're there. If I go up in, you're there. All I know is one day all of this stuff that we're dealing with is going to be fixed. &gt;&gt; All I can say is come Jesus come. &gt;&gt; I just I just end it with this thought. Brother Brandham talking about it's one of my favorite quotes. Pardon me for just a moment. So one day we'll see him and it'll not be as we are now, but we'll know how to love him even more. We'll not stand back with even a little fear. Think about that. Not even a little fear because we'll be like him. We'll be more like a rel he'll be more like a relative to us than he is now. We'll understand him better because we're so far away in these mortal bodies. But then we'll have a body like his own glorious body. Oh, we'll know how to worship him. When we see that presence of his being, what he's done for us, changed us, the old back to young, and all the deformed straightened out. We understand stand then why his power healed us. All the questions that's been in our mind. How can he do this? Why did this happen? What happened? Somehow mysteriously, they all fade away. And the knots that's been tied in the back of our minds, will it be this? How could this be? What? Somehow or another, those majestic fingers will just untangle and unravel those knots, and it'll all fade into one big crown of love. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm ready for those fingers. God, I got a lot of knots in my mind and things that I've dealt with and situations wondering why and situations and and then find find myself pulling back sometimes and find myself want to just go back in the shadows. Why? I don't even want to do what I'm doing. Just get out of here. But that's not what God called me to be. That's not what God called me to do. And listen, God didn't call us to be in the shadows. God called us to be a city, a light that is set on a hill. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He called us to let our light shine. And the darker it gets, the more your light ought to be shining. &gt;&gt; God, don't let some complex come, some shade of some complex come over and dim my light, but let my light just get brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter until it breaks into that beautiful day. Then all those knots are going to just fade away. God bless you tonight. Let's bow our hearts. Sometimes we get a complex because we come to him so broken, broken humanity. We feel so unworthy, so been so abused and so messed up and mistreated and so broken. What could God do with this? Well, I just tell you again, as I probably I know I've said it here before, but over in Japan, they use this this method of broken pottery. Maybe somebody dropped their antique that was handed down through generations, worth a lot of money, and they fell on the floor. all broken and shattered. [Music] But those masters take that broken pottery and they start piecing them back together and they use gold. And those pottery pieces actually become more valuable after they're broken and fixed by these masters because the gold that's on the inside of those cracks and crevices [Music] become very beautiful, very soughta masterpieces because of bro being broken but being allow allowing themselves to be put in the hands of the pastor and all those broken pieces be put back together again. [Music] Scripture says, "My people will never be ashamed." [Music] My people will never be ashamed. You might be feel broken this this evening. You might feel so misused and torn. What what what use do I have to God? If you'll just come and just lay yourself in his hands, he'll fill all that brokenness with deity. He'll fill all that brokenness with gold [Music] and make you to a vessel that's worthy for his table. [Music] And your value will be more greater than it was before. Maybe just talk to the Lord. I I'm not even going to ask for hands. I knew this service was going to be a little different. Didn't know how. [Music] I know it's for a purpose. Know it's for a purpose. Lord, I want you to say, "Lord, I'm sorry I've allowed this complex to come up, become greater than you are. I'm sorry that I allowed it to rule my life. I'm sorry that I allowed it to lead me and guide me to places. Lord, tonight I want to move away from this and lay it at your altar. And Lord, I want to re try this spirit if it's not of God. And I want to come back to the one true God and let him lead me. Let him guide me. That be your desire tonight, Lord Jesus. See our hearts today, Lord. Lord, just see sometimes how we allow things to rise up in our lives from our past, past hurts, mistakes, abuses, whatever complexes come and never able to see how truly our worth and never able to operate in the path place that you called us to operate in. Never truly be able to yield our gift because of complexes. [Music] or Lord, because of complexes we look down on other people's gifts. Lord, there's all kinds of things that the devil can come and try to tangle us up in and tie us up. But Lord, tonight, may your majestic fingers just untangle some knots. Lord, as we lay ourselves at your feet, Father, may you just come, I pray, and Lord, just move through this audience and through through every heart here, Lord. You know each heart. Father, they know, Lord. They've tried to hide behind that tree. They've tried to climb up and just get back in them leaves and hide from you. But Lord, today you come and looked up in the tree and said, "Hey, I'm going home with you tonight." Oh God, let us yield ourselves to you completely. I pray in Jesus name. Jesus.
