he's going to have a bride without spot a wrinkle or blemish or any such thing so whatever it takes to iron the wrinkles out whatever it takes to get away get rid of the blemish we got to stand before him spotless you know we are living in a day and an hour where many things are happening and even recent developments that are taking place we all know of the seven visions that brother Bram had in 19 1933 and we know three of them has already been fulfilled it led up to World War II that was concerning mellan and Hitler communism and so on like that and it was prophesied exactly to the dot these have been [Music] fulfilled and um and now we're right here on the verge of the fourth one that is happening right now that shows great advances in science that would come after the second world war it was headed up in the vision something he called an egg shaped car the word AO Dynamics was probably not even known and you know we this week Tesla who leads the way at hands off driving with more than 9 billion miles have been driven with autopilot engaged Elon mus come out and said by 2026 he will have this on the road and it will be without a steering wheel set un an unsupervised full self-driving future is what we want we're talking about just a little over a year from now you know he saw women rising in power and and and the great immorality that would happen in the world and the perversion that has taking place and we are in that hour where it is now Total [Music] Insanity and brother brandham said and I saw a great woman stand up beautiful looking dressed in high highly Royals light purple and I got little parentheses down here she's a great ruler in the United States for perhaps the Catholic Church a woman some woman I don't know her to be the Catholic church I don't know I can't say that only thing I've seen I've seen the woman that was all that she would lead our nation to complete ruination well we have both we we have the one as he said she would be either president or vice president she's already vice president this is her inauguration described exactly Royal purples and Mr Biden the first Catholic President since Kennedy and so they're already there it's already in place I'm just telling you things are in position and and maybe she won't even have to become president maybe this election will it won't even be her but I I just maybe it's they've already done the damage to bring us into ruination what I'm trying to tell you is we're closer than what you think and that we're nearer now than when we first believe whatever the next Vision shows smoke bombs craters all over the land of America and I want to tell you you must get in the presence of the pillar of fire like Moses did and meet God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost it may not be something visible you see you know uh because ever occurrence in the scripture when the Holy Spirit come they didn't always see tongues of fire or pillars of fire but he was still there because the same lifechanging results took place you remember and I'm quoting now from why Christ speaks brother Bram said when Moses met this Burning Bush that word was Vindicated exactly it was the word Moses didn't have to worry what's this voice all about what does this being here because God had already wrote in scripture in Genesis your people will so Jour in This Strange Land and they'll be brought back after 400 years will come back into the country again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet fulfilled now hundreds and hundreds of years before God had said that Israel would so J and be mistreated in a strange country and would stay there 400 years but God with a mighty hand would bring them out and Moses knew this intellectually and I I I just want to say about this we can look and see Israel's in her Homeland we can see she is the burdensome Stone of the world we can see demonic Powers rising up coming against her to D destroy her we see we see alliances being made with with with nuclear uh threats that is being made from Russia and China I'm just telling you you know you know you can connect the dots you you can look and see where we're at in time and the vision has already spoke about where we would be here in this last day Sodom and gamar around us perversion everywhere and so he said you know in this he said he tried to the ECT though intellectual experience with the word to try to bring them out to deliver them because he knew he was born for that purpose he knew the time and the scripture said it' already been 400 years and he said just as now as a man asked me about to come in the Rapture we've lived the time out at the time of the Rapture is at hand and we're looking for a Rapture and faith that have pulled the church together to give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in when we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor and out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a God that can take a cancer that's eat a man to Shadow and raise him up to his strong strong healthy man that ought to give rapturing Faith to the people that when that light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and taken into the heavens now when Moses saw he'd been raised up for this purpose and he had met face to face this God who had made the call and anointed him and identified him said this is your call Moses I'm sending you I'm going to show you my glory and here I am in a bush burning go down there I'll be with you he didn't need a stick he had the word the Vindicated word and it anointed the faith that was in him and it anoints us when we see that we're living in the last days to find out all these signs that we've been seeing taking place as spoken the scripture would take place in the last day all the way from Heaven to the political Powers the nature of the people the demoralization of the world and among women and how they would do in the last day and how men would do and how churches would do and how nations would do and how God would do and we see it laying right here on us oh it anoints our faith it moves us out in great Cycles it separates us from other things of the world and I want to say tonight that but here we are and I just want to say you know where wherever you are in life cycle it's time to move into that Rapture realm into the cycle of the Rapture where that you are changed first from the inside out and where that Faith rises in your heart to believe every Divine promise you know it's a shame anymore where people don't even know what a prayer line is people people never hear speaking in tongues or manifestations of the spirit it's all gone it's all passed we just become theologians and intellectual it's a shame when the supernatural is no longer made manifest among the people but I want to tell you the Rapture will be a supernatural event it will not be an event done by theologians it'll be the power of the Living God and it'll take another baptism of the Holy Ghost that will just search within you and change you in a moment in the twinkling of an eye I'll tell you what we need to get ready for an outpouring of the spirit and say God one more time fill this Temple move in this life change this PR I'm invited to this Pulpit tonight a man of faith brother Ron Spencer his faith has been fried like no other person I know and in this he has encouraged us to believe and to look to a living God and to trust God like never before so as we invite brother Ron I want you to invite the Holy Spirit to your place to your seat and let him speak to you and let's worship God together as we hear the word and let Faith come by hearing hearing the word preached he is here hallelujah he is here amen [Music] he is here holy holy I will bless his name again he is here Len closely hear him calling out let him call your name now he is here listen now you can touch him and you will never [Music] be is here hallelujah he is here [Music] I will bless [Music] his hear him call [Music] your [Music] name touch you you will never [Music] be do you believe that we believe it with all of our hearts could we just talk to him for a moment [Music] Lord there is none like [Music] you One Moment In Your Presence makes all the difference in the world many of us standing here tonight have been in that moment we were many wretched things in our lives but a god rich in Mercy stepped on the scene supernaturally touched Our Lives maybe we had made efforts before to try to change and made vows but when we met Jesus we was never the same now father we've came to this room this evening and we have great needs Lord that many that will watch this father have needs also no man can do that father but you Lord you can take the worst cancer in the world and dissolve it in seconds the worst spiritual conditions and it be over with in just a moment father we're have a faith that that is preparing us that these bodies will be changed in a moment and the twinkle of an eye May tonight we get a glimpse of that moment Lord if we have a deep appreciation for services like we're having here this week for we know without you it would be impossible now we ask you that we can surrender oursel to to you forgive us of our sins our mistakes our failures Lord that whether we're the speaker or whoever We Are Tonight Lord we all could say we have great need and we have an expectation that you would come by our way and you have never failed on our expectation touch us tonight we pray in Jesus Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen God bless you so good to see each and every one of you and so good to be amongst old friends and new friends and I've got to meet some new friends today and we're so glad to see you what a reunion it is one of these days we'll have a reunion not to have to go home and we'd like to thank brother Tim and his family brother Timothy and all of you that have brought us here and invited us to come and and been here with the ray family and wow that's been awesome yes sir and uh brother Tom he's only got a few more hours to pre to preach again and so we're looking forward to that what awesome sermons has already been delivered and and God has spoke to us and last night he dealt with me in a special way and I'm just thankful when he comes by and touches our hearts and amen if you will turn with me in your scriptures to Psalms chapter 27 and verse 5 have a couple more comments but I don't want to keep you standing too long and I love brother Tim I've been one of the greatest privileges in my life to be his buddy I've got many buddies but it's been a great privilege to be brother Tim's buddy and uh I know for many of you that feel the same way and brother Tom's been my friend for so so long and we both got white hair brother Tim doesn't have any but we did something wrong evidently and amen but amen amen you love him amen Psalms chapter 27 is a Rapture scriptures and I'd like to start at verse five for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me upon a rock and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me and therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord here oh Lord when I cry cry with my voice have mercy upon me and answer me when thou sest seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek hide not thy face far from me and put not thy servant away in Anger for thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my

also glad to have brother Chris Morris and and Sister Mary with us they're here somewhere in the building and amen God bless you amen we love you with all of one of our deacons there at home and brother Jeremy and sister April that is with us and they're here almost every year now and so they've made a tradition and it's a good tradition amen and so thank you guys for being with us this is a this is an anniversary of sorts for us as a family last year my daughter was here sister Whitney and she had brought Zoey with us and Zoe was born with a condition that was called a aaia and aaia is a condition to where that there's a disconnect between the brain and the vocal cords and the and the tongue and she would just be mumbling and and we had prayed for her many times and beli for the promise of the Lord and and uh she was seeing some of the best Specialists that there was and they were telling us that she would be in her 20s before she would be able to develop sentences and develop words and and uh brother Tim he had prayed for her and and he one time in a call he told me he said put your tongue put your finger on her tongue and she hated that whatsoever and and so she came through the prayer line last year that this might be a courage to you she came through the prayer line with her mother last year and she left this meeting and when she left this meeting she be to develop words and then devel phrases and and they were we were told that she'd never be able to go to school and she's in her first year of school and doing really well and the other day I was uh I had her I was babysitting her and her brother Isaac both them are Supernatural babies and and so anyway there she was they had been in my office and I was studying for this meeting and they had toys all over the floor and uh that's the greatest trophies that I have as them playing there and so they had toys all over the floor and they had covered the floor and so I told them I said now it's time to clean up uh you can't put no more toys down there's not enough room and so that she they begin to clean up and I went into the I went into the uh kitchen and was getting a drink getting ready to go back to study and she came in and got herself up on the bar stool and was sitting across the bar like this and she said POA I I don't like to clean up I walked over and I put my arms down on the bar in front of her like this and I said you know I've got people at church that are just like you Zoe they don't like to clean up either you know our it's a great joy to enjoy serving the lord and one of the greatest joys of our life and forgive me for taking a minute but one of the greatest joys of our life it is this message works and it's not just good for you but it's good for your marriage and and it's good to raise your children in and you watch your grandchildren grow up in an environment to where that there's love and peace they don't know what a fight is all about and and they don't know what all the world's anxiety is and all the nonsense of the world and and you know they begin to grow up in this and they know what prayer meetings are and they know what singing and and they know how to come to church and get ready and they're ready for what God has for them and I I'd like to say this to you it works it absolutely works tonight I would like to to take a thought on quit never I believe if anybody's got a right to preach that I can I can preach it quit never sister Connie that's here and she's a trooper she has set in offices to we that doctors have talked to us over these last four years almost five and paltic care doctors will talk to us and other doctors will talk to us and and they just don't understand why that I'm not in a wheelchair or not already passed or whatever and they're just thrilled of however is but we've went through those conversations where that they'll talk to us about uh have you come to a decision to where you want to quit taking chemo and you know just try to live a good quality of life and quit fighting always my answer is never quit quit that's right I read a statement the other day it said I I tried to throw in the towel on and God threw it back and said wipe your face off there's more work to do statement says courage is not having the strength to go on it's going on when you don't have any strength I want you to understand tonight that we must fight for life I don't know if you get it or not but we're at the end of the battle and we're living in total darkness according to the world and according to the message but we're living in a spot to where there's Total light but you got to fight for life there was a time to where that they were removing me after a burned and my lungs had been burned up and I was on brother Tim had came to see me and you know if you're wanting to die don't get brother Tim to come pray for you and so I was being taken off of the respirator after I'd been on uh I'd been on it for for about three weeks and they told me that I would die they told sister Connie that I would die and brother Bisal had had called her and said that I would speak next year's meeting at Bible Way camp and when they were bringing me out from from the the unit they were there was a a nurse named Debbie and she was screaming in my ears run Fight For Life you got to fight to live and she was not just saying it in a whisper but she was screaming in my ears fight you got to fight to live tonight I want to scream it in your [Applause] ears I want to scream it in your ears you got to fight to [Applause] live Satan would like to kill you and destroy you and he knows there's only just a few hours left before the Rapture he knows that once the Rapture happens you you're not no more in his crosshairs but while you're in his crosshairs he's doing everything that he can to kill to steal and to destroy and whether you realize it or not you are the most powerful people on the Earth you have heard it said over the last two days that you are the final voice to the final age that's not just something that you think that's something that you [Applause] speak so you're more powerful than all the presidents and the dictators the greatest armors that there is in the world you are Sons and Daughters of [Applause] God and that has even more power than even the angels of the Lord that's right because you are Sons and Daughters of God the word of God placed on your lips has power to move mountains power to cause demons to flee Psalms chap 23 and verse one the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want and he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures and it res and and he leadth me beside of the Still Waters he restoreth my soul and he leadth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake and here's where we are y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil this is a powerful words I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies and if we can just say it you are the light pressing against the darkness and the reason it's getting so dark is because your light is so [Music] bright thou anointest my head with all and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever don't never let that last statement just be a statement that just comes across your lip it's going to be a commitment the devil will try to to get you out of church but I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever Give the Lord a good hand right there Isaiah chter 41 and verse 10 says fear thou not for I am with thee for I am with thee when your best friends can't be with you he's with you be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen ye thee yay I will help thee y I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness the scripture says for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind we are like Israel we're fighting for our land you just can't set nonchalantly by you got to fight for it in Israel most people are there or have to be engaged in the Army every one of us here none of us here are [Applause] spectators none of us are spectators listen every one of us have a skin in the [Applause] game every one of us have skin in the game we're not sitting at a tennis match looking backwards and forwards cheering when we want to every one of us sitting in our services every one of us has got a fight yes sir you fight when you get up you fight all day long you fight when you go to bed every one of us in a battle that's why we've got to feed on the word of God like never before that's why we got to pray and prayer is like an atomic [Applause] bomb Israel is fighting with enemies on every side throwing bombs at her trying to destroy her sacred spots with a promise by their enemy to drive them in the sea but I got news for you don't bet against [Applause] Israel don't bet against Israel because God chose them you like Israel has bombs falling on you in every side but I want to tell you don't bet against this bride she will overcome she is an invincible Army those are more than just good words to say that's what he said we are that's what we [Applause] are I am what he said I am we fight battles every one of our battles are in different spots they try to divide our attention they try to take our energies mind battles are constantly going on whether you've been a Christian a week or all of your life trying to derin your Revival but I want to remind you tonight and it may be simple never give up brother Ron but I'm just hanging on you got the wrong idea it's not you hanging on he's hanging on to [Applause] you I want you to understand we don't even have a white flag we don't even know what surrender is we're constantly ready and on the Mark I got my War clothes on I'm I'm ready I'm ready I get out of the bed ready what about your fight brother Ron it's in the background listen cancer is not my life if it hangs around until the Rapture I don't know where themselves are going to go but this body is going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye brother on there are times to where that I feel like I can't go on anymore well you're this this you're the why this sermon is about every one of us has had the urges to quit every Champion where they're a runner or where they're a boxer every one of them has felt fatigued in their body to where they can't take anymore even Jesus himself prayed in the garden let this cup pass from me brother brandom come to a spot to where that the pressures of the people had driven him to a spot to where that he would like to go to the mountains to become a Trapper that had always been his dream it was pressure that was driving him there pressures from every realm fighting demons every way even fellowshipping with the angel of the Lord having the greatest Mysteries being revealed through his lips yet he felt the pressure and being with your grandfather was contemplated going there and stay it even to the point till God had to have a conference with him and on his trip back home he had to talk to him and and tell him and even show him a man depleted in his body to where that you know he looks so old and and even remind him if you carry out your plans your wife will leave you children will leave you and the final statement is where we never want to get I'll leave you every one of us have had friends that seemly was going to go all the way come on and they came so far come on they came so far and just the least little thing tipped them over the edge and they walked away I don't never want to get there and say that I was a quitter every King has felt like quitting even the great Lions will sometimes surrender soldiers have got so tired in the battlefield until they just wanted to go home they felt it even the greatest Victorious people has felt the urge to quit but I want to tell you as a predestinated Believers tonight failure is not an [Applause] option that's right I've said this to you as an audience I've been sick before but I made it I've been broke broke before but I made it I've been brokenhearted before but I made it I cried all night long but I made it I've been betrayed but I made it I've been Ling on but I made it I've been destitute but I made it I've been rejected but I made it if you can look around left and right I'd like to say this to you you're looking at people that's been through a lot of things but we're still standing oh brother Ron but I you know I don't know that's not much I want you to know hell has used every resource that they have they have dispersed every demon that they can to stop you from coming to this service to stop you from praying to stop you from reading your Bible to stop you from listening to the voice of the prophet of God they did everything that they can to try to stop you and you're still standing I want you to understand this as a prophet would say it Satan cannot take your life until God is finished with you there is nothing that can happen to you unless God permits it there is no evil can come unless God permits it and it's for your good he said God wants somebody who will not give up and a winner never quits and a quitter never wins that's what your et's word says you've got to stay and call things and call it right before Satan now we must understand that we are all in this contest and a contest is a test of strength I got news for the devil tonight he's in a bad room if he has showed up and rode with you in the car this is not a good place for him to be at now brother Brandon says this he said now you're here to fulfill it just walk unconscious of fear walk walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of Unto the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention I love this to the left or the right hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you yes sir just keep on Walking with God Enoch one day walked like that and you know what he done he walked all the way home with God and he got so far up the road yeah he's our type he got so far up the road and you know what he did he walked all the way home with God he got so up for the RO he didn't want to go back anymore I'm at that spot I'm at that spot I have came so far up the road I don't want to go back no more walk with God the doctor says that you're going to die walk with God the doctor says you can't get well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath by the Covenant that he give you that he would confirm it just walk with God now watch what he says you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you'll go through the pr patches over sharp rocks over Bluffs and down over hillsides and up through the mountains and over Waters walk with God you say brother on here you are getting ready to preach a sermon and going to have a prayer line and you got for stage cancer walk with [Applause] God I hope that I have been a representative and an example an example that this message works in the darkest Valley of time this is not Hollywood folks there's a lot of bad days but walk with God get up get out of bed walk with God you don't have to be a whiny box you don't have to give the devil voice of how bad that you feel God's greater than cancer he's greater than tuberculosis he's greater than paralysis he's greater than depression are you with me my God is greater brother Ron I'm I'm I'm I'm disappointed in the journey that I've got to go through he's got to have somebody that he can [Applause] trust he's got to have somebody that he can trust with the trials of life that's right so that he can send Satan into outer Darkness that's right and if Satan could only realize that his torment against you and you overcoming the torment that he's put on you and you're still standing and you're still testifying and you're still walking it's only sending the devil into outer Darkness you are God's witness you are God's testimony I got a people that's an invincible Army that can overcome anywhere any place under any [Applause] condition brother random said the devil hates me and I know he hates you too and he's my enemy but as long as God is my friend I don't have no fear of him I just drive right on him right on back and take the word of God and move him right on back out a place that he thinks he's a holding he hasn't got no strongholds he's absolutely legally defeated in every [Applause] place the devil has a a got no legal right at all no word he's just a devil a password that's all he hasn't got no legal right to any man that accept the promise of Jesus Christ he's whipped can you say that with me he's whipped he's whipped in sickness he's whipped in disappointments he's whipped in everything he's whipped in death he can't scare me he can't scare you that's all he is is a big old Shadow I want you to understand brother Isaiah God has taken our case Hallelujah sometimes your condition is to the point to where that doctors literally decide who will is a specialist enough to take the case then you're honored you're honored to walk in before that doctor and he will begin to work on you and but they're still practicing Physicians but I want to tell you the greatest doctor that there is is in this [Applause] [Music] room he has never lost a case he doesn't have a fou called [Applause] defeated are you with me now I know this is simple but are you with me our God has never been defeated [Applause] it looked bad as David was going down off of the Hill for Goliath it looked bad for those thousand men that come against a man with a Jawbone in his hand if you're thinking it look bad for Samson or it look bad for David you got your pictures backwards it looks bad for your enemy we can talk about David we can talk about Samson but I want to talk about you it looks bad for your enemy that is attacking you God has dispatched angels to watch over you you're better protected than the president of the United States of America sir they have security lapses and then it takes some weeks to figure out who missed the point my God has never missed the point you are guarded by Angels brother Ron I don't know about that listen to the prophet of God as they take Baby Moses and put him in a basket and they pitch it with tar and they place that baby baby in a crocodile infested water and God dispatches angels 10,000 of them to line up and down the mile and then he says DAV you get on you get on this basket and as he goes down through there and the crocodiles come up against him you take your foot and push him back down and when he gets in Whirl poles you get him out of those whirl Poes of life God is no respector Purp and when you get in trouble whether you know it or not God is with you he's got Angels taking care of you brother brandham said this and this is good for me and brother Joe he said I was going into a football stadium one time and I've seen a little little thing on the wall that has always struck me and it said this it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight that's in the dog Hallelujah that's what it does if you're a big dog and you're just a coward you'll get whipped anyway but if you're a little puppy and you got a lot of grit you could put the enemy running anytime it's a size of God the god of Heaven that's in the heart and he's a big God George Washington was persistent at Valley Forge all the odds was against him and the enemy was across the river but but after an all night in prayer and the American soldiers with no shoes on their feet about one-third of them had shoes and they crossed the river at Valley Forge through the ice and three musket bullets went through his coat but he had an answer from God and there was no of him backing down nothing could stop him then he crossed it because he was persistent he had heard from God I want to say this to you we have heard from God we will take a rapture we will overcome this age it's not an if it's not a might or a Wonder it's God's word it's his promises he thought it he said it and thus shall it [Applause] be I want you to tell your neighbor I cannot lose can tell your other neighbor I cannot lose tap the neighbor in front of him tell them I cannot lose [Applause] come on I want you to start saying it so much until you start believing it if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you in my name you'll cast out death who's going to do it you're going to do it you're going to believe it you're going to say it the words is going to come across your lips there's nobody behind you to do it it's your turn it's your fire what are we waiting on it's your [Applause] fire you are here for a purpose God just didn't make you and build you and make you so tall and so wild and your hair color a certain color and your eyes a certain and build you and make you a certain way just to see if he could do it God built you sent you armed you commissioned you that you you Julie you you would [Applause] overcome not you and a thousand more it's not you and a milon more [Applause] you you got to be determined if I'm the only one in this state I'm going I'm not looking left or right or who's going to make it or who ain't going to make it or who quit I've going a m you traveled here from Saskatoon and told told me last week that you come for this meeting to have a supernatural experience with God and no doubt the devil wored in your mind over the last coming weeks that of he he wasn't going to meet you here but God keeps his appointments that's right that's right don't you just stand and give the Lord a great big praise tonight God met him last night brother Timothy showed us a man that came here with his with a heart condition and the Word was said I didn't even know it but the word was said that you came for more than just coming to bring a table but you came for a heart operation and we all stood here with Witnesses listen I know what's sitting in doctor's appointments for hours all day long I know what that's all about you say well brother R sometimes these Services get long Tred doctors tried doctors there's many times that we spend eight and 10 hours a day brother Tim has never preached that long he might try and sason I was sitting with ulcerated stomach all the way from my all the way through my system ulcerated we saw all the x-rays saw all the test I was ulcerated all the way through this was a few years ago it was a precursor to what we fight today I sat there as brother Tim spoke at the end of the service I said you know I've sat in a lot of doctor's appointment but today I sat with the great physician in that moment of prayer God healed me all the way through my system I have not taken another stomach peel ever since then brother Ron but you went and got prayer last night did you hear the man say if you ask the king don't ask him for a chicken or a duck ask him for a th acre ranch so the king is here in this meeting and I ask the king that he would heal this cancer and bring organs back to life again my God is more than able he's more than able brother Bram said God doesn't make anything that perishes milk perishes bread perishes I'm not talking about you brother Derek perish I pray that one day I'll be able to drink coffee again and eat bacon again and eat eggs and enjoy it again cuz I'm going to get rid of chemo so that should work out out real well God is eternal and therefore this life that we live now in is only reflecting what is ahead of us the real one that cannot die the body that cannot perish the life that cannot be taken and therefore the scriptures is right when it says that we have everlasting life we have eternal life we can never die Karen puit did not die she's more alive now than she ever [Applause] was she will never have a gray hair again and when she dances is all over the streets of Glory she doesn't get tired today and believe it or not we're going to see her in a few days and we're going to have a body like her body I've warmed up now we just preach the scripture says in James chapter 1 and verse 12 Matthew don't get nervous blessed is the man that endureth Temptation when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised on to them that love him Luke chapter 9 and verse 52 and Jesus saith unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God Romans chap 8 and verse 31 what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us that ought to make your F Faith muscles roll up [Applause] there every little boy only under the age of 12 years old roll that arm up there just a little bit okay 15 18 roll that arm up there just a little bit my little mother when I begin to get a little older old and started getting some muscles my mom would always raise her arm up there and roll and she had a muscle about that big my mama would stick the pen in my balloon and say when your arm gets bigger than my arm you got a WR to brag I'd say on the other side under her her robe or some big old arms under there Faith muscles I'd like to say it to you if God be for us sister Elena God's for [Applause] us if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with us freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God as God elect it is God that justifi it's as though you never did it in the first place we're not a bunch of Catholics that have to pay for our past sins it's taking care of brother Ron but I will s you back it's over forget your past it's under the blood of Jesus Christ it's done [Applause] amen who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died ye rather is risen again who is even at the right hand who maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or par of Sword as it is written for thy sake we're killed all the day long and we're accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us I don't understand more than conquerors okay Muhammad Ali trained for months he would train for months to get ready for a thought and Angelo d d would be in his corner and Muhammad Ali and many of his fights would do the Rope of dope because he would get tired and he would back off in the ropes and yeah and they asked Angelo dunde says what did you tell him during the fight he said 'I never had to tell him how to fight he already knew I just had to remind him of who he was that's what I'm doing you got the armor God's on your side we are just standing here telling you who you are [Applause] and you're an invincible Army and Satan stands powerless before you when you recognize who you [Applause] are Muhammad Ali would on the general occasion would leave the stadium in a suit patched up get into a car and someone would drive him to his house the check we'll just say figuratively was in his pocket and we walked through the door there stood his wife she never fought she never trained she never put the boxing gloves on but she was a recipient of the check [Music] [Applause] you didn't have to go to Calvary you didn't take no Stripes at P judgment Hall but you're standing here today brother BR said I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve God tell the [Applause] devil don't know what to do with him am year of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you brother Ron I just wish I felt that way okay you identify yourself as the weak weakest Christian in this place the devil's beat you around and you've come to a spot to where you're actually starting to listen to him and he's told you that you're we you're the weakest one here I got a quote for you when the weakest of Christians go on their knees the kingdom of Hell shakes don't forget who you are my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory and mind and firmness that the power of Christ May rest upon me Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength this is your shot all right he giveth power to you he giveth you the strength and to you that have no might he increaseth your strength [Applause] stupid devil but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength yeah they shall Mount up on wings like an eagle that's they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint don't forget to walk don't forget to run and definitely don't get forget to fly they say that there is only a couple of birds that picks on Eagles and these birds will come and land on their backs and peck on their head now an eagle can either take it or fly into the heavens because those birds are not built to fly where like an eagle can fly that's the reason we come to church and you feel that little gritty Spirit trying to get around you just start [Applause] flying just start setting your wings a little bit just start lifting up into a Heavenly [Applause] atmosphere when I fall he lifts me up when I fail he forgives me when I am weak he is strong when I am lost he is my way when I'm afraid he's a he's my courage when I Stumble he steadies me when I hurt he heals me when I am broken he mends me when I am blind he leads me when I'm hungry he feeds me when I face trials he is with me when I face persecution he Shields me when I face problems he comforts me when I face loss he provides for me when I face death he carries me home he is my [Applause] god brother Brandon was standing one time and there was a a dead little boy on the side of the road he was mangled by a car run over him by a bicycle it was a horrible scene but brother brandom had seen this scene before he'd seen it and he tried to walk away a couple of times and the Lord would turn him around and he you know he he knew something was recognizable about the situation and he asked them said has he been in the meetings has he been in the prayer line no no says there's just something about it and finally he remembers to go look in the fly leaf of his Bible and there's the vision he has seen him before and he's seen him this is a little boy this is a vision that he's waited on now brother brandham recognizes more than a green shirt I'm in the vision and there's nothing can stop it that's right that's right I want you to think about it every devil in hell is watching now you heard it last night Jesus is making his way before the tomb every devil in hell is watching he's watching for the event to take place he's preached incredible sermons he's fed the 5,000 he's turned water into wine but he's getting ready to call a Man From Another Dimension a man that is fellowshiping with Isaac and Jacob and Abraham he's getting ready to call him by name and bring him from that place to this place he's going to have dinner with him hallu you see Lazarus has got a dinner appointment He's on this stage tonight folks he's on this stage God's got an appointment He's going to set at dinner with his friend but he's got to go get [Applause] him and the devil's doing everything he can he's got the critics he's got the scoffers he's got them all set up none of them can stop it they cannot muster enough unbelief [Applause] oh they can try to create an atmosphere of unbelief and doubt and fear put up every Scarecrow in the world but when he speaks Lazarus by name get ready for dinner I don't know what we're going to have but get ready for [Applause] dinner I can see brother brandham shut the car door and that little boy don't know it but he's going to play tomorrow he don't know it but he's going to ride a bicycle tomorrow he don't know it but he's going to go running tomorrow every critic in the world arms Soldier sir standing there and the devil with all of his unbelief and criticism cuz brother brandham said if he's not off the ground in just five minutes call me a false prophet where's the believe the sign there oh it's easy to scream 60 years later but where was you there that day listen you hang around long enough you'll find an empty church here and you can make fun of us and you can scoff at us you can call us holy rollers you can say all bad names against us hang around a little while in a moment in the twinkly of an eye we're going to take a half a step this way and a half a step that way h I believe it I believe [Applause] it brother Ron that's a big brag we got big [Applause] God we got a big God when job was sitting there in all of his condition and all of his friends were criticizing him and even
