to speak as you want to speak to touch hearts and lives God we love you father with all of our hearts we love you Lord we thank you for these opportunities to worship you and spirit and truth thank you Father for this time in Jesus name amen amen turn to the book of Acts if you would Acts chapter 24 amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen good to be with God's people amen amen Acts chapter 24 and verse uh 14 said but this I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship I the god of my fathers believe in all things which are written in the law and in the prophet and having hope toward God which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the Dead both of the just and the unjust amen we'll let you be seated i' kind of had this thought for for some time just pondering on it thinking about it but i' like to speak to you on the way which they faith in the way that they call heresy I think there a very much a key in this scripture that they call heresy amen heresy is an opinion that's profoundly at odds with what is generally accepted uh it's an inheritance inherence inherence to a religious opinion contrary to church Dogma it's a a descent or de deviation from a dominant Theory or opinion or practice uh you know sometimes we we think because the majority accepts something then that's just the way it should be or that's what's true but you know when you go against that what majority thinks then you become labeled amen and you become uh you're given a name honestly it's not necessarily a good thing always to go with the majority because we know as we can look in the Bible uh there are plenty of examples God's number was hardly ever the uh uh the majority it was always the minority uh there was Abraham and Sarah that was called out there was there was Noah and his children that was saved in the flood it was a very small number but compared to what was there upon the Earth and you know as we heard you know that wonderful message brother Michael Ray spoke about the words and they say you know because they say it does not mean it's right or true amen just because somebody says it does not mean that that's true but you know the devil from the beginning has tried to make the people of God Amen to uh to look like The Crazy Ones you know it's amazing in this hour that people who live a Christian Life who have Christian values who who hold to certain standards in their life they're actually we're actually looked at the people that are crazy to this world and and people that can paint their hair blue or put all kind of metal in their ears and their face they're the normal ones that's that's qu that's kind of insane if you ask me but you know the devil has always put that kind of thing upon the people of God he attached it to our Savior when he came upon the Earth he tried to label him as be elub or or or to try to throw smut on his birth and call him an illegitimate child you know he always has done that and he always will so the devil is constantly trying to clamp down upon us by calling us different things and different names you know calling us holy rollers or Fanatics or whatever amen you know brother B would say it like this he said I've never seen a Holy Roller yet he said that's a dirty name that the devil put on the church there's no such a thing as a Holy Roller no such a thing is an organization that that's called Holy Rollers they call anybody but they call anybody that believes in Holiness holy rollers and with but without Holiness no man shall see God so you see where the E essence of it comes from in other words it's something that the devil tries to put a tag upon the Church of God because you dress a certain way you act a certain way or you live a certain way amen but that that doesn't mean that it's so just because somebody said it he said but I I've sell the seven se's I I've never seen a Holy Roller yet that's just a dirty name that the devil tacked on this Holiness Church that's all no such a thing as a Holy Roller 969 different denominations in Washington DC recorded now now it's somewhere in the 40,000 denominations they call it you know it's just a slang name but like they did to Paul the way that they call heresy the that's the way I worship the Lord the way that they call crazy the way that they call crazy out there all that bunch of people that's screaming and hollering and carrying on the way is that that is the way that I worship the Lord is what he told the king Agrippa he said that's right that's the way I worship God and the way that they call crazy the way that they call heresy now he said well I would like to shake his hand this morning and say Amen brother Paul I'm standing with you amen almost 2,000 years has passed but we still have that heresy going come on did y'all 2,000 years have passed but we still have that name going we're proudly still worshiping in the way that's called heresy in the way that people call crazy and lunatics and you done lost your mind it it's quite a flip in the world that we live that somebody that just wants to live a certain way and dress a certain way and act a certain way amen by what the Bible says is called crazy amen but you I'm I'm proud to put my shoulder with Paul and say I worship in the same way because as he said I believe all things that are written in the law and the prophets all that's in the Bible I believe it no matter how it makes me feel may it maybe it tears the hide off of Me Maybe it lifts me up but if it's in the Bible I believe what the Bible says amen and so amen there was a there was a girl brother brandom talked about talked to in Oregon one time and and she said you know your party over there there a bunch of strange kind of people and you know you know they're the ones that's going to be in heaven I wouldn't want to be there and I said well you don't have to worry much unless you change your attitude amen you don't have to worry very much about that she said but all that screaming and carrying on I said now wait a minute you worship Mary so I'm I'm assuming she must have been a Catholic you worship Mary and the Virgin Mary before God could ever put the wedding garment on her she had to go up to the day of Pentecost and get so full of the spirit of God till she staggered like she was drunk and you are not coming in any way less just remember that yes sir that's what you call the mother of God if if the Virgin Mary had to go to Pentecost or what you call heresy or Heretics and get the Holy Ghost before she could ever go to heaven you'll not get in on anything less just remember that she said oh that isn't so I said do you not believe the Bible here it is Mary was right with them in the upper room she got so full of the spirit until she danc on the spirit she acted like somebody was drunk you think you'll get to heaven on anything less you'll never do it you'll never do it so why so that makes me understand why the devil would want to put a smudy name upon that experience Amen on that experience of receiving the Holy Ghost he wants to call it fanaticism he wants want to call it emotion he wants to call it every kind of name why cuz he knows that's your ticket to Heaven amen not a dance not a shout but to have an experience with the Holy Ghost and when you have that experience you might shout you might dance you might speak in tongues you might stand there and cry you might not be able to do nothing but throw up your hands but you'll know from that moment you have been changed that something is coming to your life and you're never the same again but here's is you know and he said but that's what people make fun of he says she danced like that she spoke in tongue she acted like somebody was drunk you think you're going to get to heaven any different way the people make fun and they call that a bunch of idiots Paul said in the way that's called heresy that's crazy a heresy a Fanatics crazy well we are called that because a Supernatural is so much different from the what is carnal of the world that's right amen we know the world can the world that's carnal man cannot understand Supernatural things so if they can't understand it they want to just call it whatever they want to call it but Paul said to Agrippa I'm not mad I I'm not crazy as you think I am but in the way that's called heresy I worship the god of our fathers that's the way I do too I like that he says that's the way I do too I like that he said I would like to join in hands with Paul I would like to be on that day when he he's robed in the righteousness of Christ when I see him crown I want to have that same kind of robe that same kind of crown I because it's the same kind my Lord wore Hallelujah that's the reason I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of God unto Salvation And The Gospel came not in word only but in power and demonst rtion of the Holy Ghost that's the way of the Gospel is that's the way the word is the word made manifest in our hearts excuse me after Pentecost when these people received the Holy Ghost man was forced to make a decision is that of God or isn't that of God is that of God or isn't that of God and what they say they're drunk that's a bunch of Heretics they're a bunch of crazy people they're in delusion but Paul Saidi not mad I'm not crazy but I worship my God in the way they call heresy and what they say is the way I worship my god brother B said how could he say that or why would he say that he said out the Easter seal he said because he had the Easter seal he had he had been there when something happened I'm glad to join hands with him today in heart and say Paul why we have to preach the same word Paul preached we have to baptize the same way Paul baptized amen they want to call it heresy because you baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come on they they want to say you're crazy it's the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost but it's not what the word said it's not what the Bible said it's not what they did in the first church amen and so he said he spoken in such a way the words he said if anybody else if an angel from heaven come and say anything else than what I have said let him be a cursed so who's crazy now those that are saying what Paul said are those that are saying something different than what Paul said amen amen he preached Divine Healing he preached the power of the Resurrection he preached that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever he preached in visions and powers and manifestations of the spirit followed him you have to have the same message you have to have the same thing not a theology not some church doings but the power of God Pentecost the same seal amen amen the Seal of the Holy Ghost ghost God's true Easter seal amen it's your birth rights it's the credentials that you pass from death into life it's God working through you the same way he worked through Jesus Christ amen why because you receive the same experience you know stop here for a moment having a little trouble with my throat but I I I told this before but I I always think about it many times I've thought about about it and what I'm speaking about Heretics I remember being in in in Czech Republic and going down into a cave and seeing all the beautiful formations a beautiful cave way down taking this walk brother Danny steeman and brother Bogden I believe was a brother's name that took us down there and uh we walked down and we got to this one room and it was just total just everything is plain it was nothing there it was nothing hanging from the ceilings nothing coming up it was just in you can see Smoky looking stains on the ceiling and and the lady was talking in her her language and the guy that was taking us through and brother bog was translating and I knew she was saying something that I I wanted to hear and so I asked him I said what what's what's she talking about this room what's so important about this room I this is different than any other room that I've been through and she stopped there and she actually she actually was because you know CCH Republic is I don't know Poland I know is about 90 something per Catholic and Czech Republic's pretty close and and so there's a lot of CA Catholicism there and she said you know uh she said this this this is just this is nothing to see here this is just where Heretics had Church go ahead and man I I almost had myself a fit because I realized if she's calling this a heretic That's my kind of people amen because they had they tried to do whatever they had to go into a cave into hiding whatever they had to do for the gospel it was going to do it amen they had to die they would die if they had to give their life they would give their life and they call that a heretic because it did not come according to their own dogmas to their own teaching to the way they thought it should be or how they thought it and then maybe the majority of the world thought it should be like this and it's gotten that way I mean c Catholicism is one of the biggest uh biggest religions in all the world if not the biggest but just because it's the biggest does not mean it's the rightest it does not mean it's the one that you should follow after because amen Jesus said narrow is the way and few there be that find it amen and wide is the way amen that leads to destruction and many go down that path and we see them going one right after another after another after another and here we are amen with our our our Holiness and our righteousness upon us and it ain't a man-made Creed it ain't a man-made Dogma right amen if any of you sisters are wearing dresses amen because you think it's a dogma and a Creed and a a religious Duty amen you might as well go get you a pair of pants but if you're wearing it out of a love for God and for his word and what his word said amen that's what it's all about amen if you're wearing things because you think it's a Creed or this is the way it's got to be no it ain't the way it is it's the way God said it is and if God said it I believe it that's right people want to call it heresy they want to call you crazy and call you whatever they want to call you it doesn't matter what they call you that's right it only matters what he called you sir amen they can call you every kind of smudy name in the world but as long as he said you're his son and daughter what difference it make amen but you got to have the same message the same thing not a theology not this this is not theologies this is not Church doings we had that couple one time come to the old church you know and they thought that this was must be kind of like the Amish you know it's a decree from the head Bishop that all our sisters wear dresses and she tried to talk to one of our sisters I I think it was Sister Atlanta maybe but tried to talk to one of them and and said you know we we just get brother 10 him to not preach like that or something may you know maybe maybe we could you could all wear pants and she what the sister said well I it ain't because brother Tim preach it or don't preach it it's what the word of God says and so I remember I I remember just one work day amen we had there and they was trying to be a part and so they come to it or she came to it and and and she came up and showed up in a pair of pants she'd been wearing dresses at church but she shows up in a pair of pants and she gets out and she's looking all shameful and she said you know my husband my husband's an idiot she said she said he he told me there ain't no way them ladies are up there working and dresses said that's just a show at church you go in your pants they don't care that's every one of them going to be in pants she said and here I am the only one but why she could never understand that it wasn't just because somebody said or or or or or a bishop said or or some kind of R ruler said it was because God said it's not just a way called heresy it's the way called Holiness amen God has put it in our hearts and our lives to live the way that we live and I'm thankful for that as I I was talking about you know Sunday as just some thoughts been in my heart because you know you go to different thanksgivings and Christmases and birthdays or whatever you get around some of your own family and you're thinking man is this really who I came from or this really who I'm part of and and you know you get you look at all the stuff they got going on and the way they look and all that kind of stuff and you're like wow how H how in the world you know the only reason why you still have a sane mind is because of the grace of almighty God that's TR otherwise every one of us would be going straight to hell with everybody else amen but God rich in Mercy amen saw fit that we could hear from a voice from another real and realize it's the voice of God speaking to this generation and it ain't nothing to be ashamed about we got to have the same it's it's the credentials that that Birthright that that that change it's the credentials that you passed from death into life and God is working through you the same way he did Jesus Christ because that's these signs shall follow them that believe go ye into all the world after after Pentecost after the Seal of Easter was given of the Resurrection what was it the life that was in Christ amen was raised up come up and quickened with his church lives in his church to do the same things today but you know he says he says in another place he said I I get among Christians sometimes who claim to be sainted men and women of God and ashamed of that testimony they're ashamed he says to say Amen they're ashamed to sing the songs of Zion they're ashamed I I like to get he said I like to get among people who's not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ that's right I'm happy to be identified tonight with people that are not ashamed you know you think about the world and the way they're going listen they're not ashamed to live the life they live they're not ashamed to be transgenders or this that and the other Mar men marryed men women they think that's normal anymore they're not ashamed of they put it out in your fa if they are not ashamed how come we can't be ashamed we don't have to be ashamed of what God has called us for in this generation to be a light to a dark World amen sister you don't have to be ashamed if you're out there in the workforce you don't have to be ashamed of your dress you don't have to be ashamed of your hair it's not because some preacher said so it's because God has ignited a fire on the inside of [Applause] you we don't have to be ashamed of it we don't have to be ashamed of this church people's called this church all kind of names we ain't got to be ashamed of it just because they said some name they call they call it all kinds of stuff they they call it they can say whatever they want to I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed to stand in this pull pit I'm not ashamed to preach to you tonight I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen because I know what it done for me he said see something has happened he said he said though it seems like heresy but yet they're not ashamed something has happened it means more than life to them it is life it's life eternal because they have accepted God's substitute they have accepted the lamb amen who was worthy to be slain before the foundation of the world we realize it's not our Holiness it's not our worthiness it's God's holiness it's God's worthiness it's God who placed us where we are so why should I be ashamed of it he said I like this kind of singing he I was back there praying for some of the people a few moments ago they've been brought in and said this not being a prayer service just to speak I was back there praying for them he said I could hear songs and I I could hear the Clapping of hands and he said my I seen some of them even get so full they run up down the floor and they call it dancing in the spirit he said the first time I was a Critic of that when I seen Pentecostal people dancing in the spirit I thought what is this must be a bunch of nonsense then I got to reading the Bible and found out dancing in where dancing in the spirit is and the devil copied it and put it in rock and roll and stuff but the real genuine dance comes from God well I mean if he can say that about dance can we also say the real Genuine Music came from God Amen it didn't come from the devil it came from God yes sure the devil perverts things and he makes it into his own and puts his own twist to it amen but it came from God abolutely but people got so ashamed of things they can't even have drums in their Church can't even have certain instruments in their church and if you're not careful you get right to the Church of Christ or brother Brandon would say the Church of Christ and he would go socalled so-called Church of Christ amen because why they put God completely out of it you know first time and I he said I looked that I thought it a bunch of nonsense but I saw it was there and and I saw that a dance was victory when David slew Goliath little boy by come dragging his head of this giant to the city and the people saw him yeah it caused them to dance amen why because they had the victory when Moses crossed the Red Sea amen and took the children of Israel on the other side and maram picked up the tambourine and began beating and dancing in the spirit he said if that ain't an oldfashioned Pentecostal meeting I never saw one in my life the trouble was with me I didn't have enough Victory yet but when you finally get that victory and the token of the blood of Jesus Christ comes upon you he said I remember David the great psalmist of the Bible when he' done something this great thing he was given Saul's daughter and here she was some kind of self-start self- style so-called believer and the Ark had been gone for a long time and here it came back the word was coming back to its rightful position to its rightful place and Pa and and David couldn't stand it no more it had been been exiled long enough it had been tied up long enough it had been sealed up long enough but the seals had come off and they were coming back to his right position and David got excited amen he couldn't help himself why cuz he saw the word coming back he knew what a restored Ark could do for him and the children of Israel oh Hallelujah if that ought not do something for us when we in this hour have seen a restored word come back with full power and full manifestation and the full Holy Ghost and the full anointing and the ability to heal and deliver and set free amen it ought to do something to our hearts when we realize the word that we have today the book that we have today is not a Clos book it's not probing at it no more it's not wondering what this and wondering what that is amen it's the open Word of God and we have the right to rejoice in what God has done for Our Generation because we know the value of the word in our midst we know what the word can produce it can produce an overcoming life it can produce a healing in your body it can produce salvation for your children that is the word loosed in our midst David singing But the daughter Saul's daughter embarrassed by that man's actions course David responsible if you know like that watch this it's my response too anybody want to peep in from the window that's where she was watching from peeping in you know she went to partake her apart she's peeping in and like look at all them people dancing what they crazy bunch of Heretics Holy Rollers we we're better than that we're growned up now you you're so gross up so old your bones are so creaky you can't even get limbered up again in the presence of God you're growed up all right you growed up into an old stag moaning and groaning when the presence of the Lord comes through because you don't want to move cuz you're too growed up go ahead and Peep in the windows this is what she was doing she wasn't a part of it but she had something to say about it well I'm ashamed of you for what well you're supposed to be a king you're supposed to hold yourself a certain way you're supposed to be the Bride of Jesus Christ and you're supposed to do certain things certain way it says who what denomination says that what headquarters says we got to do that says who amen here he was she was embarrassed and God cursed that woman with a curse she couldn't bring forth seed no more hello we got to be careful with our attitude towards the moving of the spirit don't we and be careful what we label it and what we say about it and what we you know because if we ain't careful we can blaspheme a real move of the Holy Ghost amen I I love how brother Brandon put it at one time when he talking about that about them girls dancing and and turning this church into a Tav he said I wouldn't say nothing about it because I didn't know if they might be right and I might be wrong take a lot of humility to be that kind of person amen well I just got to say something no you don't just got to say something Amen Let God prove who it is but he cursed her and she couldn't bring forth fruit amen of the king Lage no more amen later she would actually come forth and bring if I remember the Bible writes she would bring forth a son but it wasn't a son of David it wasn't amen the king's lineage could no longer flow through her she could do something of her own making she could make her own way she could make you know make believe all she wanted to but she could not bring forth the true seed of God and this is what is happening this day people have made fun of the Holy Ghost they've made fun of the move of the spirit they've called it all kinds of names they've driven right out of their assemblies to where there's nothing left but a bunch of dead sticks somewhere amen why and they cannot no longer bring forth the seed of God sure they can have a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof it's the world that's a world we living in she was embarrassed we don't have to be embarrassed I'm not AAR embarrassed a bit about God called musicians no no I'm not embarrassed at all about God called singers I'm not embarrassed all amen of what God has done in our generation what God has done in this church I'm not embarrassed about it I'm not ashamed of it but you know it's a paradox when God made so-called heresy all this noise shouting praising God speaking in tongues people who's despised and rejected called idiots and Heretics it's direct quote is a paradox when God the great father of all the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who chose a bunch of Heretics to bring Salvation to his church a bunch of Heretics to bring Salvation to his church instead of the well-trained ecclesiastical theological system that is a paradox but you know people God's people have always been viewed as crazy by the world those that around them is like you're nuts Abraham why are you leaving you got a good job job you got a good house you got a wife you got you got it going on man you got good salary you you got a good you know 4 401K why are you leaving cuz I Heard a Voice what this voice said it said to come and follow me it said to come into another land well what's in this land I don't know what's in this land how what he just said go with him and so I I believe what he said this voice spoke to me and could could you imagine that you would look at that and you're living next door to Abraham and you're like man this guy's nuts look he's got it all he's got a four-bedroom house he got all he got a he got enough donkeys and cattle and this that and the other he got all kinds of stuff he's crazy right where's he going going wherever this voice leads me it sounds sounded crazy and it just gets crazier and crazier his story if you look at it and on the outside around because there there sometime after he starts hearing the from the same voice that he's going to have a child and he's past bear childbearing and he's dead and dried up and his wife is dead and dried up and it seems impossible yeah and to the world it is impossible listen amen the doctors might think you're crazy for believing in the impossible possible but if God spoke it to you you better hold on to it until it happens cuz if God said it it's going to come to pass God told Abraham when he called him said I'm going to make you a father of Nations well that sounded pretty crazy from where you see the dust count to count the grains of sand see the stars count them you'll outnumber them what could you imagine an old man 75 years old and a woman 65 going down shaking shaking and in their and their agid shaking like that and it's down to the doctor said Doctor won you get the hospital ready now we're going to call you any night you know why we're going to call you why cuz we're going to have a baby I mean wouldn't it be wouldn't it be humanly understandable to call that man crazy I mean to look at him it's not it's impossible do says oh yeahuh soon you know as soon as they got got to a phone they said well you better go after that guy something wrong everybody that everybody that takes God at his promise is considered by the world crazy to many people you're considered crazy for even believing in a God to many people you are considered crazy for ever believing that this body is going to become young again and the dead in Christ is going to rise all I I I've had I've had this reoccurring dream happened again I believe it was last night or the night before almost the same thing maybe some things a little different but twice i' I've dreamed of the body change I've dreamed that I was just walking along and I happened to glance in a mirror and I realized hey things are different and I'm begin to realize in my feeling and in my dream I could I felt no pain in my body and it was and I just begin to run with all I had screaming to the top of my voice and I begin to see others and I begin to recognize amen them coming I I didn't recognize him at first but soon just after a little bit I began to dawn on me well this is so and so and this is so and so and this is so and so and I would wake up that's happened to me twice listen that's going to become more than a dream that's right they can call it crazy they can call it what they want to as I've said before one of these days you're going to call me gone amen one of these days I'm just going to vaporize out of here and be gone not by a nuclear bomb but by the bomb of the Holy Ghost amen it's come and fill my heart it's going to overtake this body and change every cell in it amen it's more than just a hop so story it's more than just a maybe it is Theus sayth the [Applause] Lord people can call it crazy if they want to call it crazy it's foolishness to the carnal mind amen faith is crazy to everybody but God and the one that's got the faith yeah there's things maybe you're believing for that I might think wow that's crazy but if God's giv you the faith to believe for it believe for it everybody that takes God at his promises is considered by the world crazy bunch of crazy people praise the Lord in the way is called heresy the way I worship the god of our father heresy means crazy we know it's foolishness to the carnal mind faith is crazy to everybody but God and the one who's got the faith I I've said that again on purpose every faith is crazy to everybody but God and the one who's got the faith cuz when those two omnipotence meet something has to take place Paul as we said was standing before grippa said I worshiped this way that's called heresy that great intellectual scholar had come to that place the way called heresy he used to one time think it was heresy that's right he used to be on the the other side matter of fact we know his story he was on his way to go throw a bunch of Heretics in jail but on his way he met that light yes he had that same experience a light came down over him amen it changed his name from Saul to Paul amen and made him the SE the first church M Church age messenger amen and here he was on one side a great intellectual scholar nobody could out argue the man the man was well versed h learn he had done all kinds of of learning at the feet of Gia but he said I have counted all of that as dung that's a pretty sharp word dung I don't know if some of you city Folk know what dung is how mean I ain't going ask worthless refuse nothing compared to what God has right if we can ever come to that part in our lives when we realize this world is nothing but worthless dung it's dogs vomit that's what it essentially is compared amen if if you can put it in English words and the worst thought thought of thing you can describe amen that's what the world is compared to the things of God but yet they people want to call me crazy cuz I want to choose what God has instead of what the world has I want to choose a life amen to have a wife that will stay true to me and children that will serve God Amen a home that that loves the Lord and things amen instead of a home that's tore up by drugs and alcohol and every kind of demon spirit that wants to have its way through that house listen that's not that's not crazy that's right that's real true sanity Amen to choose a house that can have the Holy Ghost in it that can have angels visited that can have healings take place and deliverance take place and salvation take place a house that the light can follow after and fall into you know uh I get amazed at this world and how their minds are so Twisted to where they can look at things so weird so their sin is so clouded them and so they this it's actually it's actually showed there in the Book of Revelation the smoke that comes out of the pit smoke has blinded people that's what it does we got a couple of firemen in here you know a smoke comes up and it gets in your eyeballs it ain't comfortable your eyes start watering you start trying to close them blink them and pretty soon you can't even open them no more because of the smoke that is there and taking you over and this is what the smoke is coming out of the bottom of this pit and it's taking people's minds and it's filling them with bitterness and cursings and sin of every kind until their eyes are so closed up that they couldn't see God if he was standing two foot in front of them that's right and it's only getting worse that's right you know people all happy about Trump you know Trump is brother Mike where was just bringing it to my attention again I heard it just today Trump is actually setting up the most Catholic cabinet ever hello somebody and that's supposed to be normal that's supposed to be great for America where are we at when the one the the that sits on Seven Hills is now sitting in America in her government in her cabinet and so infiltrating everything and that's supposed to be the new Norm that's supposed to be okay that's supposed to be make America great again it will not make America great again America will never be great again not because I said so but because a prophet said so she had her time to accept the Lord Jesus and she turned it away and from that time she's fell off and she'll fall off into a burning that's right so don't get your hopes up and Trump coming back in that's only a temporary thing and it can be just very temporary as I said before you know we we think well I was talking to brother Wayne about this too and people get all these ideas of about visions and how it should be and how it would be and how it's going to be and how and sometimes Visions can come to come to pass and might kind of look like it may not be sure of it and the whole time it was the vision well I thought it was going to be this way well it doesn't really matter how you thought it was going to be it matters how he thought it was going to be the point is amen whether she's the woman in purple or she's the woman that come into power whatever amen whether she is or whether she's not be ready that's it make your calling and election sure make sure that amen that your your your your anchor is tied to the right place and your and your Sals are set in the right direction amen make sure the direction that you're going is the right direction you know I don't know I can't get off of it this world thinks we're crazy for living a clean life they think we're crazy you for not smoking not drinking not doing drugs not womanizing they think you're crazy as a young couple if you hadn't Kissed before you got married or went further than that if you got before you got married they think you're crazy because you you know you come to church on a Sunday every Sunday what Wednesdays too are you crazy it's it's getting that way it's getting more and more people are falling away like never before from religion of all kinds amen they think you're crazy amen for raising your children to believe a certain thing to believe a certain way and to operate a certain way and your house to operate they think you're crazy and in this day you got to have more faith in ever to stay in the way that they call heresy because all the world is against you it's against the fibers of the family I I mean you know when they they made it where women could vote and women had rights you know what that was all about it wasn't about women having rights it was about women getting out of her place in her in the home now I know it gets real touchy nowadays because this world has tried to make it to where a man and a woman both have to work amen but a wife's place is in her home that's the Bible That's the word that's the message that's what we believe and there nothing to be ashamed of Amen but they made it that way you know why they made it that way cuz they wanted to have double the tax base and then they wanted to take the mother out of the home home so they can get a hold of the children quicker so they could start move messing with their minds and turn them into what they believe this is the why we're in the conditions that we are now amen because Satan has come against what God has called righteous that's right and what God is called right and what God is called true and he's come against it Time After Time After Time and he shaved it off and he shaved it off and he shaved it off and he shaved it off that's what lay to see it does to you it's like sandpaper that's shaving off against your convictions I don't mean that much no more that don't matter so much no more this don't happen you don't and it's just constantly rubbing on you trying to get you into a place of lukewarmness to World it don't matter it who cares anyhow don't really matter if we do this or do that or we don't do this or do that and before you know it your love for God starts waning and you start getting colder and you start pulling away from the house of God Satan knows what he's doing he' been doing it for 6,000 years but it's important that we have the new birth it's important that we have that that anchor to Hold Us in times of situations that we don't know how things are going to work out or what's going to happen amen and so something Turns Upside Down in your life you still have have a hold there that when you seem to be dangling it's still holding that's right when you seem to be falling it's still holding when you seem to be all tore up inside it's still holy yes sir I I actually preached at a message camp three services and I got told at the end of that that I preached the Holy Ghost too hard praise God if that's what I was guilty of I'll take it at least I didn't preach psychology too hard or theology too hard amen but I preach the life of Jesus Christ this is what's happen amen because people are ashamed of a holy ghost filled life and what it produces they want just enough of God and enough of the world to mix the we're not mixers this is why he called us a peculiar people a chosen generation I've separated people we are not mixers said he said them Scholars that day those Jews fine men their organizations of Pharisees Sadducees rodians whatever they might be all the great organizations Jesus said you're the blind you lead the blind well did Isaiah speak of you you have ears and cannot hear and cannot and eyes and you cannot see because Isaiah said this in the spirit therefore God Of Heaven has blinded your eyes you're doing like Eve did accepting the indivi intellectual side and knowing nothing of the spirit of God but God along holds a key he expresses the same thing in previous scriptures there a while ago amen what does man say that I am that Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of living God blessed art thou Simon the son of Jonah Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you my father which is in heaven therefore no school no Theologian no teaching of the Bible among any school that knows anything about it they can't know anything about it it's impossible them God has hid it from their senses from their eyes the very elected teachers everything it's a personal individual affair with that person and God that Christ is revealed to them and if they say he's been revealed to me then the life that Christ produced here in the Bible is the same life Christ will produ in you that's and there's nothing to be ashamed of that Paul would say it like this he said 'I don't come in Excellency of speech or wisdom declaring you the testimony of God I never said I'm you know I'm doctor so and so I I I but I am determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified that's a good determination right there I don't want to know everything about you I just want to see Jesus Christ Christ crucified and the blood applied to your life as I was here with you in weakness and fear and much trembl in my speech my beseeching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and power of God there is the gospel the power of God the demonstration he didn't say go teach he said go preach that c so our faith amen that we have in this way is not dependent on what some man said or even what you say your faith should not ever to be dependent on what you say or what you think or what your heart feels people can be wrong following their heart well I my heart really likes this young man and this young man's in the world and he's he don't he's not he's not even a Christian your heart's wrong right can't split it however you want to split it your heart's wrong well if I get married to him I can share with them the message and then all will be okay it doesn't is not g well I got this one over here did that and that over there did that and that one over there happened you're not guaranteed nothing you're not promised anything your heart's wrong your motives are wrong your objectives are going are wrong and your end is going to be wrong your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God this is the only thing that'll keep you in this way called heresy because there's going to be plenty of people that's going to make fun of you that's right and they're going to mock you and they going to call you this and say about this about that and well this was say I don't care what they're saying all I care is what he says that's the only one that I'm looking to I'm reminded of that boy that was playing that violin he's playing his his concert he plays it and he just brings the people to their feet with such a passion that was flowing out of him of the song that he was playing and they come to their feet at the end with this big Crescendo and they're shouting his name and they're they're clapping their hands they're throwing their hats in the air and he's looking up at one place in a balcony up in that one place was the man who had tutored him who had given him the instruction who had taught him how to play this violin how to become who he was and it was the only one he was concerned about was getting his approval listen if you start worrying about getting just one man's app one person one God's approval that's right and quit worrying about all the others on Instagram Facebook Snapchat come on it'd make our lives a whole lot more simpler if we only concern our thoughts on what does he think they may call it heresy they may laugh at me they may make fun of me they may make jokes about me they may say all kinds of things about me but it doesn't matter I'm looking up to the one who give me the ability to walk in the way that I'm walking who's giv me the strength to stand where I'm standing who' given me this promise this faith that I could have in my heart to believe these things are possible I'm only looking to him and to no other it'll make your life a lot more simpler let's by our hearts it's a way called heresy but it's the right way sir it's the way called crazy but it's the right way they can call you stupid they can call you you can have friends knock you down do all kinds of things to you may not feel accepted in your life faced a lot of rejection but as long as he's accepted you that's all that matters Satan is always there to try to put that little hurt little pain try to build upon that cause a complex to come from it doubts and fears worry smashed you if Satan comes along and smashes you and bruises you and on that bruise he tries to build bitterness toward this one and unforgiveness toward that one why don't you just let it go right now just let it [Music] go say Lord I'm sorry sorry for holding this against this one [Music] that a lot of times you can get resentment in your heart toward somebody and before you know it is shut down the blessings of God upon your life and ruin you start thinking about all kinds of things you can do to them say to them I don't even know what I'm saying is hurt them but that resentment comes into the house of God and it causes frictions hurts tries to clamp down upon the worship and the moving of the spirit and [Music] tries to bring you into a place of Darkness I why don't you just resist that thing right now just resist it resist the devil and it'll flee from you want to put some Cloud on your family just resist it that might be what they say but that's not what he says about us that might be what they say about me but that ain't what he says about me [Music] they can call me whatever they want to call me as long as he called me his son that's all that matters as long as he's called me his daughter that's all that [Music] matters maybe you just want to say Lord I I have some things in my heart I want to just let go of right now just lift my hand up to you as a sign of surrenderance Lord I just let it go right now in your presence just lay it at your feet there you go resist the devil I just lay it all there Lord I don't want no resentment in my life or no weird feelings about somebody or I said this they said that I just want to let it all [Music] go there was a woman one time saw a man sitting in a corner with dirty [Music] feet he had been called all kind of names she had heard about those names but she had also heard that he was a Healer he was a deliverer he forgave sins something's moved in their heart to go get a Best box of oil that she Spiker or ointment that she could find or could buy and she came and gave her best and laid down at his feet oh yeah people started calling her names do you not know who she is what she's done and how she sinned look at that stinking centner careful which voice you're giving credence to that one's wrong over there and that was done this wrong over here and this look if he knew that he wouldn't he knew all of that yet beyond all of that he saw a heart that was willing to repent willing to get right and make things right willing to yield herself to the moving of the spirit of God and an unction when everybody else had left him with dirty feet she would come and she would wash him with her tears she would have dry them off with their hair and she would annoy them with the oil I love this part right here she didn't have to say one word to to her [Music] accusers but when she got through Jesus knowing what they thought said Simon I have somewhat to say to thee and he took her case and he became her voice to her enemy to her accuser they were calling her a heretic they were calling her crazy they would calling her an immoral woman [Music] what voice will you speak this [Music] evening I want the voice of grace mercy faith in this way called heresy father [Music] really odd I don't know why go down ways that go sometimes not even meaning to not even trying to or pre-thought anything Lord but Lord you seen the hands were lifted up all over this [Music] building Satan wants to come and build resentments in people's hearts towards others lives kill influences Lord bring a hindrances to Services song service and the preaching of the word but Lord today we defy that Spirit of hell we say Satan you take your hands off of God's Property let there be a liberty of the Holy Ghost Lord in every heart and every life Liberation father from the chains that people have put put upon their
