and we just wish they will be able to make it there once again and we pray that birth team can also make his way amen you know it's it's it is only the Lord that can make it possible amen I know it takes a miracle to bring him on the other side but I know the miracle is on the making amen hallelujah so god bless you and before I let you sit down for a while I just want to read the portion of the scripture and you know build a knee I'm just I'm just a simple preacher and don't have my own message amen we just feasting on the message of the hour hallelujah so let's read from the book of Job chapter 23 familiar scriptures start in verse 8 it says here behold I go forward but he's not there and backward but I cannot precede him on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot behold him he hided himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I think when he had tried me I shall come forth as gold and this is what God wants us to be my food had held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips I have steamed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food I believe that's our condition tonight amen his word amen is more important than anything else hallelu Ellis just bar heads in prayer the revelry father we commit everything into your mighty hands Lord you know what we need and you can speak from your throne of mercy tonight we believe God that you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord God you know where we are and you know where we are going because you know where we come from and so by these words that have come from you we just want to share it Lord God amen as we commit everything into your mighty hands bless your people tonight in Jesus Christ wonderful name everybody say Amen amen god bless you amen let us give a clap offering for the Lord this evening amen god bless you you may be seated all right amen and it's a good thing to see my precious friend once again but brother Craig is family back here amen of course but the George winters amen he's shining there at the back amen so we're just so glad he meant to be to be in the house of the Lord and to be one in the family amen you know God is a God of variety amen so that's why he has sons and daughters all over the world and it's a good thing that when we when we meet up and we see when we gather together him and we see the beauty of God he meets and every one of us tonight amen so I just would like to speak about a simple subject this evening about the making of the bride amen so so the making of the bride there is only one bride amen and because there is only one groom amen so you see now in this part of the scripture I want to deal more on on Burstein which says but he knoweth the way that I take when he had tried me I shall come forth as gold Amen you know that we believe that nothing is hidden in the sight of God he knew us before the foundation of the world and because he knew must before the foundation of the world he already knew where we are going amen a lot of people have no knowledge about that we never knew about it until we heard this message of the hour and I believe this message of the hour you know it did not make a sons and daughters of God but this message of the hour made us realize that we are sons and daughters of God amen in the mind of God we were already in him amen and but we come to a point that we realize who we are amen and we realize you know I'm part of this body I'm proud of the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and then I realize then I know how to conduct myself because I have been privileged to be chosen by the Lord before the foundation of the world hallelujah so now listen so in this we see if we talk about job but Birmingham said job the book of Job is the oldest book in the Bible it was written he said Moses wrote Genesis several hundred years after Amen so if this is the oldest book I mean it it it was already in the mind of God and we know this is the old book it contains everything in it so I would like to believe tonight Amen that this book of Job being the oldest of all the books that have been written and is being available according to the profit of of God in this day and age then it contains everything that the whole Bible has because in it you see that's why you see in in in in in job if we're going to read job chapter one up to verse three look at this is that there was a man in the land of Koos whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and eschewed evil and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters his substance also over 7,000 ship and 3,000 camels and 500 yoke of oxen and 500 she asses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East that's chapter one amen and then if we pass forward and don't read the rest of the book of Job and then we we move to chapter 42 which is the last part of the book of Job then we can see there in verse 10 and the Lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the Lord gave job twice as much as he had before then came Durant to him all his brethren and all his sisters and all day that had been a beast acquaintance before and did eat bread with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him every man also gave him a piece of money and everyone an earring of God so the Lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning for he had 14,000 sheep originally 7,000 and 6,000 camus in chapter 1 it's three thousand and a thousand yoke of oxen in chapter one it was five thousand and a thousand she asses Amen so everything doubled in the end amen so if we reabsorb in the beginning and then we make a short cut at the end then we see how God blessed doubly job all right and you know God you know he's the Alpha and the Omega he's the author and the finisher of our faith amen but I believe amen he still is the beginning he is the end but he is the same God in between all right so you see if we don't look at the the chapters between chapter one and the last chapter which chapter 42 and we're just going to look at job but you know God is so blessed you know at the beginning of his life and at the end of his life you know god bless him double x twice of the blessings that he had amen so but looking through you know what I'm speaking about in between we know how job lived a miserable life he passed through lot of things hardships troubles even his friends even his wife and family loved him he was left with nothing eminent and you see one time when when there was a servant of him who came and reported what had happened you know and and the Bible said while this servant was just reporting what happened Amen well he was yet speaking and then another trouble came amen and and another trouble came it came in waves and waves and waves hallelujah so everything gets in there everything all kinds of hardship came to Joe and we don't see that even if we just read the beginning and the ending of the book of Job so now now my point this evening as brother Branham said in a walk and our Christian walk in a walk as a message believer Remenham said God did not just put us in a pipe in one end amen and then wait on the other end and then he said come on come on come out of it and then afterwards when we came out of the end of the pipe and then God congratulated us and then he says God job well done we have not done anything we have not accomplished anything we didn't pass any kind of trouble that way amen but God amen in his in his mind in his full control of everything know from the beginning till the end hallelujah God you know it will let us experience a lot of things in between but at the end we know Amen that God had pre-planned so that in the end we will we will praise Him we will worship Him we will thank him hallelujah and when we overcome all these trials and and the struggles all these kinds of sickness that have come our way that have become our loved ones and then in the end it is it is precious to worship God because of all these things hallelujah and so that's why you know God loves his people who worship Him even after trials I mean I remember Paul and Silas when when they were called by God and they they received the message and they spread the message outside and then people did not agree with them and all this authorities have arrested them and then whipped them and remove all their other clothes and everything and then afterwards you know in the evening time well while they were well they were in in in the inside the jail you know at midnight they still feel the pains but they didn't complain amen but in the evening time you know when when you experienced some kind of a wound and you didn't put any any medical things on that you know you don't put you don't apply anything on there you know it gets so painful amen so the deeper the night gets it becomes more painful but you see in during that midnight amen Paul and Silas woke up because it was dying for them to worship and they prayed and they worship hallelujah and they worship so so hard amen they worship so deeply and so sincere amen that the prisoners that the inside the jail amen beyond the the that the place where they where that means they were not silent in praising and worshiping the Lord hallelujah because their voices went up and beyond the room beyond the jail that they were in hallelujah and so suddenly a man it did not only their boys did not only reach a man the nearby jail house or rooms Amen but it even beyond even it went beyond Rehan hallelujah it reaches and the angels were able to hear them and God was able to hear them too that God was able to send an angel and shook the place amen and so something have happened on that and only so you when they worship God and suddenly you know all chains were broken you know sometimes the the preacher has not preached yet but while we're worshiping God somebody you just come in they come in the door and he feel so happy is there's so much burden in his heart and there's so much things going on in his mind amen but just try to set the atmosphere because our manner of worship and and it brings us in a certain level certain kind of atmosphere hallelujah just before the preaching of the world the hearts are being cultivated just like a dry salt being cultivated and it's open up enemy and little by little the world is ready to be dropped and that makest makes it easier for the preacher to preach hallelujah and so they're changed you know little by little something is dropping you know the the prisoners were being released you know just by the means of prayers and worship people are being released amen so and so these things God you know in his in his mind you know knowing from the beginning to the end as job said you know job said he knoweth the way that I think and that gives me a confidence that God knows everything God knows amen what the road should I take and I have great confidence in him amen and so he said he know that the way that I take when he tried me so trials are being approved by God when God spoke proudly about job on Satan have you tried my son job he got his confidence in job he take pride in him and so now of course were so much familiar with that and then so when when God when God said okay you know you can try you can do everything with job but don't take his life that means even Satan submit himself amen as far as God can approve that means everything that happens in our lives God has approval in it and he has one purpose at the end of the road we shall be like him as gold because God is a deity goddess gold and sons and daughters of God must be at the end shall be like gold job said he said that he knoweth the way that I take when I get tried me I shall come forth as gold amen so because God wants to to give him or to give us his his his nature his characteristics you know people can manufacture characteristics right because you know there are fruits of the Holy Spirit but you know you know now they can produce what we call this these plastic things you know they make and they look like real fruits amen but there's nothing in it all right so you know it looks like fruits look like it looks like grapes looks like it looks like Ming or something but there's nothing to it it's just a manufactured thing you know we can manufacture love we can manufacture all these things all these outward things amen but we cannot produce a Jean wine fruit if there is no Holy Ghost in it but listen when there is the Holy Spirit you don't have to manufacture things and then you don't have to try and then you don't have to put any extra effort in it because the proofs will just come out I mean brother branham's I just think that you know when when the Holy Spirit in there it will just produce amen it will just bear fruits in it the proof will just come out hallelujah so that's why is he now know this is very much familiar we always caught on it the character is a victory it's not a gift amen so we work in it so he said oh is it a man without character can't rain because power apart from car Theresa tonic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even is thrown on the same basis that he overcame and sat down in his Father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes well what pressures are laid up for those who are willing are you willing a man is that what those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation you know perfection comes by trials and sometimes you know you know people you know you want to be perfect there they want to be perfect but if you want to be perfect that means you want more trials in it they said think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials amen I was conversing with Mary Craig in the room and he said you know just like but they had said you know if there is a little church a small church is a small problem you have a big Church you have a big problem but if you have no church you are the problem you should have our own church amen we should realize where we belong Amen which family we should have a home church and an a pastor that we can you know that we can entrust him amen so you see now we all have trials we all we are all tried and chasing the sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God Amen because he said in Hebrews chapter 12 verse 6 for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth but if he be without chastisement we're of all the partakers then he are bastards and not sons so but venoms said this in the Church of Smyrna but he said because the special condition is Smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no true believer free from it this is of God this is the will of God this is the will of the trial sufferings persecutions tribulations this is the will of God I say amen to that because that is what the prophet of God said it is needful why because God wants to see us at the end just like so just like job said I will come like gold in the end so there is no true believer pre from it this is of God this is the willow body this nipple we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it love suffereth long and is kind blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake are you Holly rollers rejoice amen when you are being named when you're being branded in anything rejoice amen for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which are before you and I like this portion the cloud disguised and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval sometimes we question all why did it happen to me the moment I received the message something happened neither our bright skies and still water signs of Islam in approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his lobby's elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world the syllabus yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us or be spirit placing us as sons and now shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself we joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass amen you know we Filipinos are known to be resilient you know you only in the Philippines where you can see people are you know swimming in the flood you know and you know the work is just up here and you can take pictures and their smiling is that by believing what he said and by conducting myself we joy emits the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass that's why we are called oddballs amen so you see we enter into a certain process so this God this our God is the same God in between Amen because God wants us to enter into a certain process that in the end Amen a son and daughter of God will come out and it only comes with with trials and testings and so there must be a way through him so and and people must recognize God's there is no other way you know just like the world you know the denominations they rejoice you know in John chapter 3 verse 16 it said for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but will have eternal life that is something which is encouraging amen but it must come through God's process and you know it it is not just that the preacher lets you feel you're a Christian we must help to pass through a certain process and there is no other process but through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ by justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit and then you cannot be justified amen without passing through that blood and that's why even in the Old Testament God never changed his pattern and then in the Old Testament you know before you enter into the tabernacle you have to pass through you have to to kill a sacrifice and then you have to offer a sacrifice and then you you have to cut his throat and the blood must be spilled amen there is no other way you have to pass through that way and so in the same manner in this generation there is neither one we talked about the rapture there is no other way but this message of the hour outside of the message of the hour we can a man or a woman cannot expect rapture people can talk about it people can expect it but unless they say the message of the hour and then hallelujah the maturing faith will not be produced in them hallelujah so these three stages of grace and we must to pass through all these things and so when brother Branham preached about the state of a perfect man amen and we see only in the message we find it you know when when I shared something about the stage' of a perfect man you know you pray for Myanmar amen and all of course in Japan a lot of things are going on but in Myanmar there's a lot of great that the Lord is doing as I mentioned before you know I have been praying for Myanmar that the Lord will produce more translators in younger ministers you know that will go with us and to go around Myanmar and and spread this endtime gospel I mean in God amen honors our word God honors our prayers because we have no other we have no other desire we're not building any Kingdom and when our passion is only poor lost souls and God is so short a time I mean in my previous trip I mean the Lord gave me but him gave me four young translators a man that can go around go with me and by God's grace we were able to print the church age book and we were able to distribute that and there is a young man a man he came out of the denomination already and Easter has started independent churches and he has under him around thirteen ministers in my previous trip before last amen I was able I was given a chance to share this message and every Monday because you know brother Danny he said his name is but Michael week I stopped going to Bible School and this young ministers you know we have no place to go and so every Monday week I gathered them and so he gave me one slap and I shared the basic things about the message then they rejoice over it and then last last trip this brother gave me all the sessions in one whole day and I presented the message in the whole day three sessions amen and then we distributed the books and before I came home the brother said brother Danny the the ministers are still asking for more books shall I give them okay give them books as much as you can amen because next time when we go back there amen I told them you read this book you study it and then when we go back let's about it I mean I was sharing with the brothers you know there was a brother one of them history he translated for me and then I shared about the original sin and you could tell you while I was sharing the original sin sometimes he stops and said what maybe in his mind you say what is better than is saying about all these things and so when I turned back III went home he messaged me and I showed the brothers his his questions and I poured him with scriptures and everything in the end he said now it's clear there is a Filipino bride I believe there is a Japanese bride I believe there is there's a bright also in Myanmar and we just had to to cross all these kinds of borders a meant to be able to to send you know and share this message this gospel and let God do his own thing there's seeds down there amen this is down there and they just have to to hear the word of God you know but it's also easy that's why sometimes even in the ministry at times you know we encounter some problems we encounter some challenges we're not excused on that you go to Mission you have a lot of problems you know going to missions that just you know you not just desiring that you you have another stamp in your passport amen you go to Mission amen of course in Japan at least in Japan everything is you know everything is good there although everything is expensive amen but you go to you Myanmar it's a different thing you got to Cambodia it's a different thing but it's all missions for God's glory amen but we're not looking on the hardships but we're looking at the end because we know at the end hallelujah their sons and daughters of God the predestinated sons and daughters that will come into open and they will receive the message of the hour hallelujah so you see that's why we don't complain God is looking for believers and not complainers says he just like when God called Moses to deliver Israel God promised them a land which is filled with milk and honey yeah but he never told them but Timothy about the Red Sea about the wilderness no he just told them about you know the land the good land so that's why in the process in Exodus is not this the word that we did tell the in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness you know brother branham said oh this old manna that was out every night why we'd rather have some garlic and leak out of Egypt you see that hurts wasn't ready for the journey if you are a complainer pray about it you're not ready for the journey we should stop complaining amen now when we feel something that is going against what we are expecting look at the end of the story amen look at the end of the story and you will overcome all these things we know at the end I shall comfort us gold as job said amen and when a man or a woman begins to complain about going to church they get so tired of going to church they're not ready for the journey that's right there's something wrong somewhere Amen sometimes people go to church because they feel good but Paul and Silas they didn't feel good but they worship the Lord Amon so it's the God in between now I like this portion he said and Moses because they were complaining and Moses said unto the people fear you now stand still and see the salvation of the Lord you know when there is a problem when there is a something like you know a heavy thing in front of us Amen stand still God is going to do something great expect was something great and and and Moses said and see the salvation of the Lord which he will shew to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever Egyptians giving all kinds of troubles in front of them and here is the prophet told them he meant standstill because for the Egyptians whom we have seen today you shall see them again no more forever glory a man I like to hear that you know you shall see these Egyptians no more but does that mean we're not going to face enemies no no in Exodus chapter 3 verse 8 you shall see no more Egyptians before you your enemies the Egyptians will no longer stand before you you will see them no more forever and that's good but the necks of this chapter 3 verse 8 listen and I come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land and to good land and large and to a land flowing with milk and honey listen no more Egyptians but in the land which is flowing with milk and honey listen how many enemies are facing facing the the Hebrew children to the place of the Canaanites the Hittites the overrides the Perizzites the Hivites the Jebusites no more Egyptians but when you get there you have all these kinds of sites all kinds of web sites amen so you base all these things no more Egyptians forever but there is more enemies down there because it's a land filled with milk and honey and then because when you go with the land that is so rich and that is flowing with milk and honey let me tell you there are enemies down there there will be somebody that will prevent you in going in and stepping into it it's all yours but the devil will try to stop you in there the Holy Ghost is available for everyone who wants it amen and now the devil will try everything hallelujah you will enjoy them there's no more Egyptian when enemies down but eight more is coming hallelujah but tell them come on hallelujah I already saw the ending I saw the ending even just come forward look in between look at the end of the story you shall comfort us gold hallelujah Amen now listen he said to bring them up out of the land unto a good land and a large land who large lands but sometimes people think all we're going to a promised land a large land flowing with milk and honey you know maybe some some people are thinking they will they will find a river or a stream that is flowing with milk and honey no no no no there is no such river like that in the promised land you don't find a stream you don't pray you don't find a brook or something that flows with milk and honey but listen it is a large land it is a rich land that means it is a large and rich land that means you have to work it is flowing with milk and honey you have to plan you have to you know to water the plants you have you have to take care of them so that the cattle will feed on them so that they will produce meal they will give mill hallelujah and the plants the flowers will bloom and the honeybees will be flying out there so you're something to do when you get there you just don't sit down and work it and wait for the stream whether for a river something that that is flowing with milk and honey no that's why even if we have the Holy Ghost we'll continue on working and working and working hallelujah because by the venoms and sanctification set us aside poor service but the Holy Ghost put us service hallelujah amen hallelujah so no rivers flowing with milk on honey amen hallelujah so you see that's why there is no Christian there's no message believer that is lazy we're workers in we're being set aside for service amen when we have been sanctified by the word amen but the Holy Ghost will put us into service amen because we find our place in the body of Christ amen says in Hebrews he said but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation amen it's not just salvation but there are things that accompany salvation in eleven we decided every one of you do should the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end amen so there is always the end of the story and for the people of God the ending is always beautiful don't look in between don't stop in between go through to the end amen so you see in the message I know he said and why does God let problems come god-honest Robel puts bits in his mouth and make it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God that's the purpose amen well as I said we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace or comfort is just beyond River at the end of the story companion piece goes at the end hallelujah so don't complain where you are in right now Amen whatever it is go to the end amen so that's why and see when when brother man and PC speech spoke about the great masterpiece amen and so you see he said him gods only provided place of worship let me read this portion he said now is that seven days what does the type provide the complete seven Church they just happen days why they have to eat it seven days before what before going out and the whole church is from the beginning to the end has to live only on the Word of God of that AIDS amen so you're Roman Creed Methodist Baptist and Pentecostal Creed's are all dead now watch he said for the common sport out of the land of Egypt in haste domains remain that they even remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life is that in paragraph 127 in the beautiful bride of Christ after her death through the Dark Ages by the Roman Empire that she had to die amen so listen amen even if you look at the whole picture of the bride of the church in history amen it felt you know it went down to the grave in the dark ages but because there is light in her even Dairy seed in her you know that was the mistake that Satan did to the scene when he buried the seed amen because there is life in that seed when that was buried under the ground it grew even in the dark ages amen the bride was also also placed in the under the grave a man in the dark ages but because there is life in it there is a seed German de it is it's not you know it's not an organization but it is something hallelujah inside of there is life in it so it come it came out and in the end hallelujah it produced it shows its beauty showing the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ so you see the bride in the making amen and Paul said I have espoused you to one husband see he was also ready looking at the end he was already looking in the last days amen a bride spouse to the bridegroom and he said now he said the bridegroom had to come the perfect masterpiece of God you've all heard my message on that and that he said he's experienced about Michelangelo and he said it's a perfect statue all but on the right knee there is a Nika bout a half inch deep Michelangelo had spent a lifetime of trying to make he was a sculptor and he was trying to make the image of Moses now you know as I have said before you know an ordinary person can look at a certain log and all he sees in that lag are firewood that's how far he can look at it amen but you know there are gifted men sculptors look differently when they look at the log they just don't see any firewood but they look through it amen the scatter can see an eagle inside and when he holds his chisel and his hammer and suddenly he he start to work on it and the Eagle that he sees inside a man little by little it comes into the open it's being revealed what's inside that lock even no people in the world they look at us like our bulls were nothing amen we're not something special but in the side of the greatness is sculptor of all he sees something inside you amen hallelujah and so because he see something inside you then when he start to hold this hammer and his Jesus and he work on you amen and he manifests it display what's inside of you you're an eagle to begin with hallelujah God show you before the foundation of the world but you have to come to a certain process amen so now he sees Michelangelo he said spent a lifetime of trying to make a sculptor and he was think to make the image of Moses back in his mind he had in mind what Moses should look like he had that in his heart what Moses should look like and when he spent his lifetime chisel a little here and rabbit stand back and look at it year after year after year you know sometimes Michelangelo will just visit his work and sit down there and look at it go around it doing nothing and then he goes back just like what job said when I look back I don't see when I look forward he hide himself sometimes you don't feel God amen but you know when you don't feel God that's the time you need to work by faith just like job said he know the steps that I think he's just watching us at times we don't really fill him but his present is always there he's just watching us what she we shall do amen and so Michelangelo will just sit down and spend hours looking and he never moved and the leaps his subject and then go back again and then little by little just do a little thing because he is carefully doing things so that the thing that is in my in his mind will be transformed amen the image of Moses by the bottom said the image that was in the mind of Michelangelo he really wanted to make it real and so at the end of course this the you know we're not they were so familiar with this story but you see that's why when when when Moses finished the sculpture and he was so inspired by the venom said he was so inspired even that he took that sculpture something that is real in front of him it was his imagination was so transforming that image that he felt like Moses was really in front of him so that's why you know he was talking to this image and when he was so upset he was so disappointed he shouted speak any men and so when it was when it was done and it was finished and it was it will be displayed publicly you know and people look at it and everything look at it and you know Betty Burnham said everything every work of God must be put on display it must pass through the eyes of the critics amen before it will be placed in a Hall of Fame it must be you know the whole of critics will pass through it and and and criticize everything critic everything that they will see and remember when Bella Brennan told the story about the door amen and then in the painter painted that door so good and and and the critic said you know your painting was so good amen the color combination the Lighting's and everything you were able to put everything in there as if it is so real but I found something and you look like you forgot it what is that the painter said and he said you forgot to put a latch on it and you know only the painter and the sculptor knows what's behind it and the painter said well I did not commit a mistake that's the main thing in that painting amen because you see you don't see any opener outside because somebody someone inside will be the one to open it it's the same like the lord knocking at the door amen he's not a Gatecrasher he wants you to open up him and he can force his way through amen but he wants us to make our decision amen and so you see in the same thing when when when when Michelangelo hit that and said there was there was a of the leg of that statue amen and so that was because Amen that is what make that work so great amen but you see there is something in this that I want that I want to say amen because peace amen in paragraph 51 he said so we see that he after he made this masterpiece he plays it up here on the earth and put it in the most beautiful place there was in the Garden of Eden he plays his masterpiece the two being one in the Garden of Eden how it must have pleased him that he saw this masterpiece was well he after that we find out that he rested he was so well pleased with his work now remember by the venom said my opinion the masterpiece is the stroke that mark st. Angelo's Moses masterpiece in the monument and it was the stroke that cut the side of his masterpiece that brought out the bride so there was a slash on the side because Michelangelo hear it and he was so moved that when he when he spoke his feet and he strike it and in that portion something came out and it fell off amen so there is a mark here and something is missing and brother branham said that portion just like when when Adam you know his lap and then got caught his side and took his rib amen and that came out the woman and that woman was part of Adam and in that illustration when Moses he and or when Michelangelo he the statue of Moses a piece of that a part of that came out a man and it went wherever it is and he said that part is the bride even and now when God picks it up by his justification this is the portion just like the rim of Adam he makes the bride out of it all of it he makes the bride and his base making another masterpiece which was inside which was actually part of the original masterpiece and there is another you know I byproduct of that masterpiece and that is the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and then so that's the same thing you know when he hears that when Michelangelo he'd better strike the statue amen you are that portion I am that portion and you know sometimes when it is a marble you know it broke into particles you know it goes around you know so just like that's why you know we get a piece you get a piece from Japan we got the piece from the Philippines we get a piece from Myanmar we get the priests from all over the world amen and that piece and then God will pick it up through the message of the hour we will hear the call of God and then and God from then on we little by little come out of it the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen why it's the masterpiece coming into full view so we are part we are a portion in he is our portion glory so he said now then it was the stroke that cut the size of his masterpiece that brought out the bride and now we see them as a masterpiece family in the Garden of Eden how beautiful it was and it so pleased him till he took rest then and I rest but he while he was resting and trusting to his masterpiece his enemy come and found this great masterpiece and by deceit he crawls under the garden walls and he Mar this beautiful masterpiece amen in the Garden of Eden God's Eden he made the Eden so beautiful and he placed there his masterpiece but the serpent Satan amen that Satan crawls in well God while he was resting but God knew everything amen gotten you everything hey man he began he allowed these things but God was looking at the end amen so he crawled amen and he said look what God did a man a seven crawled in God's Eden for six thousand years and and and Satan beard he's on Eden that's why the place the world that we're living in right now this is called by the prophet Satan's Eden amen Satan to the bride in the Garden of Eden hallelujah but in the last days this is Satan's Eden and then God brought again brought out his bride out of Satan's Eden to produce a masterpiece hallelujah and that is now he's making the bride for himself hallelujah in this garden and Eden you know Satan is trying to do everything to make this to make this world beautiful to make this comfortable to make this world convenient everything so that people will enjoy amen you know well you know Satan when he looks at the world when he looks at Jesus there is no beauty that he could desire on him amen and in the same manner the bride in this day no matter how Satan will make this earth this world so beautiful and convenient we cannot see any beauty in it because we're looking for another thing we're looking for the Word of God amen and God you know he's making the bride and he's he's building up building up building up a man one word and you know God we're being called by God in 4000 years after that God spoke a word to a woman right there this is my wordings the word became flesh in a virgin has conceived a man and it was without sex has had happened in the Garden of Eden amen so just right there when when when when God through that angel spoke Mary and Mary agreed and Mary believed the word of the angel is that be done to me according to your word then something happened in her womb Amen so the same spot that Satan through the serpent marred the masterpiece in the Garden of Eden when God came down he went through the spot the womb so just right there in the womb the battle is already finished the battle is already done because that seed in the woman amen the season in the Virgin holds all the potentials but I would like you I would like every one of us to see that inside that word became flesh inside of that gene is the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ himself we did not come from anything else we did not come from any denominational do we come out of there amen but we are a byproduct of that word amen that was being spoken through the stew the true truth to the Virgin Mary and it was in the word became flesh we were already part of that so that we can so in that way we cannot do otherwise because we are part of the world and so when you see the word in your day you cannot resist amen because you're part of them you can recognize it something that people don't recognize because they have not been part of it amen so you see God amen Satan took that you know and in God today in this generation God is placing his bride when we recognize who we are amen and what we are supposed to do amen and then God God's Word can be displayed through the bride of Jesus Christ amen but we have to pass through all this you know God wants to accomplish something in this day and age through his bride and so that's why we realize amen we realized that you know all these things that we come true passed through it has only one purpose and that is to produce the Bride of Christ in us now let me give you example you know during the time you know remember sister Haiti right and God spoke to brother Brennan and the voice spoke to him and he said tell the woman whatever she asked for it will come to pass amen and of course we know the situation they were prevailing situation at that time there was a loved one who was sick amen and Haiti right was so poor and even the Prophet was expecting that either sister Haiti right will ask for you know bunches of dollars and brother Branham had so much confidence that the voice who spoke to him amen it will make it happen and he was expecting he said you know I was expecting that you know that that sick person will just stand up you know and jump because that was being spoken now of course it's a normal story for us but we see how a man or a woman that is fully converted by the Word of God he knows what to ask for even the reason why God has placed us in some different and hard situations because God wants us to see that when we speak we will speak the right thing and God is making the bride for him who can speak the world I think God is the one speaking it because God will speak through him or through her to the bride so God is making this bride to speak the word that God wanted to be spoken just like before the fall when Adam called all these animals all these creatures God entrusted him all these things and whatever Adam named those creatures it was the same name that God was supposed to give with those creatures and so that's why in this day and age God is making the bride so that she can speak what God wants to be spoken we're not going to speak our own but we are going to speak the words that God wants us to speak and just like this woman you know since I read the ride you know he said you know how can I say it brother branham she was so nervous and I could think you know you know can you probably this is the writer I could've told but well but when can you just do it for me you are the Prophet I trust you you can speak whatever God wants but that was not what God said the voice that spoke to brother Branham said say to that woman whatever she wants it will come to pass and that's one thing I want to leave you tonight brothers and sisters that God wants us in the end whatever whatever we pass through amen we're going to speak the same thing that God wants us to speak another that is the main purpose the main theme of God making the bride for him because we are his representative amen so you see now then Amen so he said brother Branham how can I do it just speak the word you know the right spoke the right thing amen of course healing we still believe in healing we still pray for sick people amen you know even in my country even in my church there was I remember a sister and it happened to be she's my sister-in-law and you know he went she went to the hospital and the doctors told her that you know there you have a tumor and that tumor needs needs a surgery to be taken out of you and so she went home that was Friday to pack up and prepare for the surgery the following week but sunday came and we prayed amen and you know the prayer request was was given and we had a little mezzanine back there and she was she was upstairs and you know the pelt I just felt led to call her to downstairs and we prayed amen and so that was a Sunday and that same Sunday evening we brought her to the hospital because Monday that was the scheduled surgery but before she went to this to the surgery they checked everything and they were surprised amen the examined him repeatedly and the doctor said where did you put that tumor here's the same guy amen because God as he's making the bride God is building up building up our confidence in him not on our own but our confidence in him just like job he knoweth the road they men the path that I'm going to take when he tried me he knows that in the end I shall comport as gold amen so we can speak the right thing if we have that kind of revelation and we have confidence in him hallelujah and so you see where did you put those tumor it's gone you know there is a a medical medical proof that that tumor was just right there three days ago amen she's the same God today all right but anyway so since the red light was placed right there he she believed that God can do he can heal her loved one amen God you know now that confidence you know they just speak the properties is there to bring the confidence to bring up the confidence in the level but Haiti right can speak the world and so Haiti right spoke the right thing amen not money amen not but did she didn't believe but she asked for something that is greater amen and this is a burden brothers and sisters that today brother Branham said it's not fair that we have heard this message quite a number of times but there are people out there in other parts of the world that have not heard this message not even a single one single time we have a responsibility amen we have the responsibility and like Haiti right amen I believe she represents the picture of a bride to the fullest that she can speak the right thing and have passion for the salvation of the souls of her children amen and see you see the burden of sister hey Tara you know the heart of sister Nettie right you know so no wonder they were building and you know the what you call this the trustees are so afraid and they're so against that a poor woman like Haiti right should put in something for the building fund and the brother wanted to return part of it and brother branham said I wanted to return the other part but the Holy Spirit spoke to him amen so sometimes we do things just like sister hatred because he she had passion for soul amen she gave something that even hurts her she was so poor and yet she could give something for the cost of the word amen and that's the position that we are in right now we're so tired of this world I'm tired brother Craig amen but I'm not giving up when I say I'm tired I'm not saying I'm giving up amen but I'm tired but I will keep on pushing amen spreading this endtime gospel to the needy amen because that is the main purpose for us to see and find that last predestinated scene amen and he said you know he said he said he look around and all around and she said brother bill my greatest desire is for the salvation of my two boys and that tells a lot and I believe we have the Prophet on the scene he for and I was off the scene but he said you know I see some kind of a scene there that here comes the Prophet and he is he was elevating the fate of the woman just like the bride today this message of the hour Amon is lifting up our fate amen to a seventeen to a certain level brother Branham said even he said now we are he said I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into a sphere now amen well we're moving up into a certain sphere now amen that you know little by little were fulfilling God's Commission amen that God has entrusted to what he said I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into spirit now that's God is going to shake the whole world that's the first time it's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth a human being as anything that you will and it shall be given unto you anything you desire don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled oh it's going to come to pass pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen in this meeting I'm wanting it to happen now that the anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and she will rise to her feet like a mighty marching army the seek will be healed by a word the blind will see the Deaf will hear the Dead will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God we're in the process of it now I believe it's coming soon to pass I believe it will be just exactly that way I believe it's going to strike the Church of God soon and it's going to start a revival that shake the world amen and he said I believe it lujah and he said that you know you know he's on that long time ago amen but i believe we're actually in that sphere now we are in such a rearm where where the bride can speak the mind of God amen and things even we will be placed in such a condition that God will you know we will put our full confidence in God and we can speak things and it will happen not that we are God we're not we're not taking the position of the bridegroom weary we will remain the bride amen but as brother Branham put his trust into a simple woman like Haiti right to speak the thing that she wanted and it came to pass amen so I believe were in that condition we're in that position so God is moving up lifting and lifting up our faith and he said we're moving into that sphere we're moving we're entering into that cycle amen and that's the main purpose of this message of the hour amen Bourbon am Himself said you know the messengers are but example of the aides that they are living in amen so if brother Branham is just an example if he spoke the squirrel into existence because God told him to speak about it and then if that little tiny fish without any internal organs amen could swim back again into life and then through the to the mark of the prophet and in a prophet in the age is but an example for that age what about us hallelujah so all these things all these things that are going on and in a live 7 in her age today is just building and building her faith until God a man will make up hallelujah the full manifestation of the bride in action in this generation hallelujah amen so you see now I mean it happened before and let me close with this thing when when Abraham was called by God amen to offer Isaac you know Abraham did not look in between he believed God he trusts God amen but his mind was limited that even if he killed his own son God is able to raise him up amen but we know that something had happened beyond Abraham's expectation amen but because of Abraham's trust and confidence upon God something great beyond his expectation happened hallelujah so you know he was willing to to sacrifice his own son he was willing to to give his own son kill him as an offering amen but but you know what in the Old Testament you know although those those are ridiculous all these animals that have been killed they just covered since they did not wash sin amen and it never happened you know if there is any man in the time of Abraham that will kill their child to be offered only pagans can do that heathens can only do that but look at Abraham God required him to do something like pagans were doing that was not supposed to be done and believers Heaton's can kill their children and offer it to their gods but God required Abraham to do something and deep Rahab did not question God it isn't I'm not the pagan I'm a believer why should they do things something beyond what I am supposed to do he'd never questioned God but he trusted God so much amen and so Abraham was just right there and he was about to be laid on the altar and you know just like Jesus you know nobody pours him He gave His life and brother Branham said the same thing with Isaac he never resisted when he saw Amen but you know father here is the here is the altar here is the firewood but where is the sacrifice and Abraham spoke the word and he said the word shall prove that the Lord shall provide himself a sacrifice amen and let me close with that and he said you see so when Abraham did that isn't it man you see and that when he said when the question was brought up about Jehovah Jireh she said that's nothing but the truth amen and this is about Caesar happy right but when it comes to Abraham and he said when he spoke the things the Lord shall provide a sacrifice for himself suddenly there was a ram but one is a where did it come from yes you know you can look around and you see it's bear you know no Ram will come to that place where did it come from it come it was the first spoken word spoken by a man of God Abraham when he said the Lord shall provide himself a sacrifice Amen brother branham said you know it came into existence because a prophet spoke of it and it was just so natural because Abraham had so much confidence in God that he could speak things naturally and it came to pass it happened and it happened to brother Branham he said you know it was it wasn't a vision I shoot it I killed that squirrel and not only that I ate it amen so they're just examples in this age look what God is making up the bride look what direction we are going one of the direction we're heading for if we just put every confidence in God that whatever happens in our lives God has something to do with it it is his will and it is needful hallelujah as I : brother Timothy amen you know you just you just pray for us pray

tonight but I just want to speak to you about our building project that we got going on out there in the activity building for our youth and in fellowship building we was able this week to pour some concrete around the outside for sidewalks and and also a porch area that'll be built but this weekend we'd like to do a another work day to try to get this the inside ready for sheetrock in the next couple of weeks or in the next few days actually and so we'd like to get some painting to do get some framing finished frame to finish all the framing that's left to do they think there's some framing to do in the men's restroom and also just a lot of loose ends that need to be tied up and and bundled up there and gotten ready and also so cleaned up and things that needs to take place I'm sure I'm forgetting a few things it's on the list but there's plenty to do and I believe if we can get enough folks we can finish it up in just a little bit and it'll be ready for sheetrock and we can turn the sheet rockers loose to get that done we'd like to try our best to get this building as operative all as possible I don't know how much that how much we'll be able to be as far as Fire Marshal's concerned and all that but at least get it to where we can use it for our have it open because we do have a/c in there as you know when things and we use it for our meetings for the young people to be able to do things and and all of that but I'd like to get as close as possible so we're gonna push this next month to try to finish it up and try to get it ready and open for our meetings so if you could young people especially there's a lot to do for you this is your building and then also any brothers that can help and even sisters with painting there's like I said there's plenty to do and more we got the less time it will take so if you could we sure appreciate it if you could come Saturday Saturday morning we start about eight o'clock if you don't get there earlier that's fine with me but let's get a starting time to get it going there's also something else that's going on that you won't see Saturday but brother mark and brother James and by the Darrell different ones would be working on the outside you know if you'll notice when you go out there there's a pretty good sized concrete slab on the outside south of the building that's going to be for a porch and attached to that it's going to be our playground for the kids and out of that it's going to rise a balcony pretty much or a second-floor up there for basically a porch but if we had to put it outside exit to appease the fire marshals so we're just making it to where it'll also help us out and give us more enjoyment and so we're making it into a porch upstairs and downstairs so plenty of places to hang out and joy and have fellowship together that's what it's all about so anyway we're gonna try to push and get get as much done as possible to get in this building to get it operable so we can start and join it and it'd take a lot of I know I know with this building being open it'll take a lot of pressure off of the different homes it's open so wonderful to open up and let our young people come to and but this whole this whole piece or help some of that so if you could if you can come this weekend if you just stand up and let me know now where we can know how many we're counting on and we're able to come at any moment you can stand up my goodness I want to do it by myself and we need a few more can we got 10 can we get 20 got 20 can we get 30 no anybody that is available we sure

remember as I said brother Danny a man that that work that he does and and his team of people over there the different ministers that goes out they their machines and when it comes to working and into the fields and of the gospel of Christ and they give all they got and it sure is something that a model that we should look up to and and to say hey I believe I can do more also amen so god bless you
