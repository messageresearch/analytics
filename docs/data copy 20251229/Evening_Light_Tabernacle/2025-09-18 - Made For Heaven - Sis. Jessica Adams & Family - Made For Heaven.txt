========================================

[Music] Do you feel like something is wrong here? Like you don't belong here. It's not just you. [Music] Do you look at a night sky full of stars feeling aching in your heart? I feel it too. We might be here for now, but don't forget where we're going. Going to trade this world for a better place. Say goodbye to the hurt and the pain. We'll dance on trees when we get where we're going. See what our hearts have known forever. We were not made for here. We were made for heaven. Oh, do you want to see your father's face to wipe your tears away and all you love? Oh, do you know that this won't be the end? There's so much more than this. We're almost here for now, but don't forget where we're going. Trade this world for a better place. Going to goodbye to the pain. We'll dance on trees when we get where we're going. Going to see what our hearts have known forever. We were not made here. We were made for heaven. Oh, [Music] and the ones we've lost along the way will run to meet us at that gate. Oh, my heart can hardly wait for heaven. [Music] Where has finally lost his name? We will stand in victory and bow before the king of kings. [Applause] We might be here right now, but don't forget [Applause] [Applause] where we go. [Music] We're going to see what our hearts are forever. We were not made for you. We were made for heaven. Oh, we were made for heaven. Don't forget where we're going. Don't forget where we're going. We were made for heaven. [Applause] [Music]
