message that inspires Faith to believe for every promise of God as I was just reading here this in that last couple of days going over a few things about the supernatural gospel that God has sent in this last day how an angel came to a man in a cabin brother brandham an angel would come to him tell him about his mysterious life his misunderstood ways commission him to bring a message of Divine Healing he would tell us the angel would say the coming of the Lord is near that's our message we are here in the coming of the Lord it is a message of healing not just for the body but it would also heal us of our denominational ideas and and the and the theories of man and it would straighten it that those things out and bring a healing to the body of Christ and cause us to be in love with Jesus with all our hearts the angel said nothing with stand before your prayers not even cancer that's the way our message started it came with a commission to pray for the sick to L to to to cast out Devils with which is praying for the sick Healing The Sick As we are here tonight I think about 15 years ago I was commissioned to go and travel across the country to go and visit brother Ron Spencer who had been burned in a horrible fire and he was dying the doctors had given him up there was no hope but I walked into his hospital room and I said I have not come to anoint you for death I have come to anoint you for life we prayed there carrying all the prayers of all the saints had' been praying we carried them in that room with us and God gloriously raised him up to preach the gospel now about three and a half years ago he got the news that that he had stage for cancer and that they only gave him three months to live well we've seen that no doctor nor any devil can put a period to your life it is God who decides those things and God has raised him up and used him for the glory of God to preach the gospel now carrying it around used like never before and I want to just testify tonight that the message that started out with a with an admonition that not even cancer would stand before this truth of this word that we are here tonight to reaffirm that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we got the nation Israel that is under attack all kinds of things that are happening there and you know where the enemy has come in and women and children pulled out in the streets out of their homes out of their beds and killed taken captive all kinds of things that are going on right now chaos you see that's Israel natural but Israel spiritual the devil wants to do the same thing he wants to come into your home and to your family or into your church and drag you out in the streets and haul you away captive or kill your loved ones or your family but I'll just tell you tonight we are at War and we're here to do battle we're here to stand on a Word of Promise God has given us this land and we are possessors of the enemy's gate and we will not back up we will not Retreat we will not give up land we will not let go of One Promise of God but we will see complete and total deliverance and tonight as we prepare for this service where faith will be built testimonies will be given these testimonies are not to glorify of man these testimonies are to lift up the name of Jesus Christ where that you can see that this is not a god of History this is a present God that he's right here now right now in this building to meet your need to speak to your heart to reveal himself to you to fill you with the Holy Ghost to drive out the spirits of the enemy that would be in your life that would be torment us and we're here tonight to do battle my sword is drawn my sword is sharp yes sir he has commissioned us to cast out Devils no no weapon is formed against us can prosper we're the children of the most high God we will drive them back we will take every promise are you ready for that as brother Brandon would be commissioned to pray for the sick he would take this news of this visitation to the bishop of the of the Missionary Baptist Church that was kind of over the churches and he would Mock and make fun of it and said you know it'll never happen you seventh grader take a gospel around the world you you know you just had a dream You' go back to sleep and give a good night's rest your mind is overactive and he said brother Roy Davis if you don't want it got to have somebody that'll believe it I'm looking at those somebody right here that believes it and around the world that are joining in with us right now that believe it we believe that message a little bit confused when the message message was [Music] rejected couple of days later there was a man that got off of a bus and here as he kind of looked around bewildered and brother brandham was there to cash his check downtown in in Jeffersonville it's on a Friday afternoon and he noticed this man get off the bus he come over and said sir said are you a local do can you help me I cuz he he said yeah I said I I I've lived here all my life and he said well I I I maybe you can help me find someone and he said well who is it he said well I had a strange experience I live 200 miles from here down in puga Kentucky and he said last night I had a dream and an angel came and stepped out of a light and said go to Jeffersonville Indiana and asked for a man by the name of brandom and he will pray for you said sir I've been sick for now for 2 years and I can't get over it said then and brother Brandon put his arm around him he said sir that angel met me the other day in the cabin and commissioned me to pray for the sick he knew right then that that angel was at work he would tell the testimony to his own church and that night they would they would sing this song for the first time only believe all things are possible and as he heard that song sung the angel of God Drew near and he knew it was a song The Angel like to hear and they would sing the different verses of it he would tell of this healing and the man came up in his church had been flashburn with welding and his eyes was burned it would be a we almost a couple of weeks before he could go back to work but he walked up to brother brandom said brother brandom I believe that pray for me he prayed for him he went back to work the next day and he was his boss then would come and say boss was Mr Morgan come and said Charlie or you know why are you back to work said I I I thought you would be off for a while you you were burned and he said my pastor prayed for me last night and Jesus Christ has healed me he said you think he could help my wife she's laying dying in the hospital her name is Margie he said I I don't know but why don't you just bring her to church on Wednesday tonight accompanied by her doctor laying on a cot they had brought Margie into the meeting she was barely conscious and brother Bram took her by the hand like the angel told him to with his left hand with her right and he immediately felt for the first time that gift began to work where that he could tell the diseases that was in her body and he said what is this what is she got said she's got cancer and he prayed for her and it stopped the life went out of the cancer and and a immediately a vision came and he saw her as a nurse going and tending to her patience and he said thus say the Lord she will live and not die her doctor protested but you don't know sir her condition we did surgery on her we opened her up from the breast all the way down and said it's so wrapped around her colon and her intestines that she can't even have a bow Movement we can't even get it removed with an enema she's a dying woman he said I don't care what her condition is I didn't say that God did she began to eat she raised up from there she become a well woman but it was from there I want to I want to say to you the very first time the gift worked the very time first time the gift was manifested it was on a Cancer and it was defeated I'm just telling you tonight not even cancer not even the one of the most World wor spere diseases everything has to bow to the name of Jesus [Music] Christ that's how our message started that is Our Roots we are believers that's what we do we believe so with all your heart tonight let's come in faith believing as brother Ron comes if you've never seen a miracle you'll

chapter 6 verse 99 it's the Lord's Prayer and after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen you may be seated Isaiah chter 53 verse 1 not reading it just because it's a tradition or even for redundance but this is God's word it's his prescription and it's his cure sir who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of Dy ground and he hath no form nor cess and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him all right he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as if it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not can you read this with us now surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are [Music] healed Hallelujah Mark 16 and verse1 15 gives us the authority to have a service like this tonight and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe how many Believers are in the building now in my name shall they cast out devils and they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover brother Brandon begins to prayer and he says this and I think it's an incredible prayer Satan you are a defeated being on yeah you have no legal rights to begin with to torment these people you're a bluff and we're calling your bluff Jesus Christ defeated you in his death and Resurrection his blood paid for for his blood paid every price of sin that you coach the family of human race into and now we are sons and daughters again and his anointed spirit is speaking with us this evening and as he did with Adam in the cool of the evening therefore you cannot hold these Christians any longer I adure Thee by the Living God that you depart from these sick people and come out of them that they can go from this building Tonight free from sickness with a faith that's so predominating it'll drive out of their thoughts the in the Realms and in the name of Jesus Christ I commission Satan to leave these peopleall these diseases and the form of a disease which is the devil to depart from these people through Jesus Christ's [Applause] name Hallelujah do you believe it hasn't these last two Services been incredible I just really enjoyed just just sitting and listening as the word has went forth and it's just touched my heart over and over again brother Brandon would makes a statement he said and he swore by himself he said he said listen I'm going to say something faith is unconscious come on he said you believe it he said I've learned that in the years of travel around the world and meeting peoples of all different walks but faith is unconscious you've got faith that you don't even know it right right Jesus Christ no matter if he is in a storm and The gales was knocked in the boat from one side to the other and he was standing in the face of of a mass of demons if he was if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walk right on along just as calm and as quiet as he could be he was simply unconscious of fear anything around him that's right whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he said he he know it was going to happen because God said so notice how he he pairs that he says and if you're here to fulfill it too walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk with Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or to the left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God [Applause] if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on Walking with God Enoch one day walked like that you know what he did he he walked all the way home with God he got so far up the road that he didn't want to come back anymore now he's talking about you too he said walk with God yeah the doctor says you're going to die walk with God I'm living this quote you [Applause] know the doctor says that you can't get well walk with God just walk with God all for God has promised that I'll never leave you that's right I'll never forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath he took an oath that by that Covenant and he gave it to you that he' confirm it yeah just walk with God now you're going to you're going to have your ups and downs don't you worry you'll go through some Brier practice some sharp rocks over some Bluffs down the hillsides up the mountains and over the water walk with God there's so many Hills to climb upward you've heard that old song but how little it'll seem when you get to the end of the road oh don't you love him I think when when Jesus comes it changes the atmosphere of the room when he comes he's always on a mission yeah now he he goes where he's invited and he's come where two or three are gathered he's come he's made a promise to come to you yes now whether you see him whether you feel him whether any of your senses grab a hold of it he's give you a promise that I I've come to this service that's right on and and let me just say this to you he's he's not a doctor like I visit every week a doctor that's just adventuring you know they're just trying to make life better and they're just kind of guessing along the way by their past studies and using certain medicines when he walks in the room he's got the cure to your problems now he knows before you would ask before that that even Satan could attack you he had to get permission from God now just think of where you are and how powerful that you are as a people you're the most powerful people on the Earth that's right they're not set sitting they're definitely not sitting in Washington right but you are the most powerful people on the Earth you're of a god race that's right you're a people of the open book you're Sons and Daughters of God that has been better explained to you than than any people upon the Earth as a matter of fact this is the Golden Age the bright age and you're you're the kind of the end of the end yes yeah you're a people if I could just explain it right that will never need a funeral tell [Applause] it now know they doubt many of you have insurance policies that that might put you in the ground and place you in a certain place but you know I would say that we're not going to use them all [Applause] right why why the funeral home won't be needed they won't have to send flowers come on now are you with me now I'm looking for a rapture I'm looking for him to step into the room more than just to heal my cancer that has attacked my body but he can change this body in the moment of the twinkling of an eye we're that people brother brandom no matter if he was an eighth in Penn Street in his own Tabernacle presence of God dropping or whether he was preaching a an Evangelistic sermon or or the seals or or any of the great sermons the presence of God would drop in the building the atmosphere would change hundreds would even stand outside listening through a radio and they would be listening and they were Spellbound not by the presence of a man but by the presence of the mighty Angel that's right whether it was in report here where it would be where whether it be sermons like on the wings of a snow white dove where the presence of God would just drop where your pastor said as a boy you see our Prophet had to leave the Earth but but the angel of God didn't that's right Hallelujah maybe it would be in the huge fields or coliseums no matter where it was at he would stand there because the angel of the Lord told him that he would be with him he would explain to us that he wouldn't be fearful or afraid because that angel whatever he told him to do that's what he would do just as Jesus would say I can do nothing except my father shows me first you see God had an eternal purpose on his mind in sending a message to gather you from all ends of the Earth people people that are watching here tonight may be laying in a hospital hospital room or maybe like sister Erica Reagan that's that's that's in a hospital now trying to get fluids or brother Joel forny that's in the hospital getting fluids God's the [Applause] answer brother Brandon would use statements like this he is here he would say for years you know I'm waiting on something and he would tell a story and he wasn't just idly just telling a story you know I'm waiting on something and then after a little while he would RAR his shoulders back and say I take every spirit in this building under my control in the name of the Lord Jesus christall we stand here not trying to make ourselves anything though they be great generals sitting behind us and Generals around the world but let me just say we have been commission with the same word and the same Authority [Applause] [Music] [Applause] no one will diminish brother bram's Ministry but we're still assigned to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Hallelujah now he would stand with the patient between him and he would say now you know that there's you feel something standing between you and I you feel that that you're nervous now that won't hurt you that won't hurt you that's him brother Jackie you preached around the world I'll probably get a little tent in heaven and you're going to get a great big castle God bless you for even being here you're a mighty General you're a general of General I want to be there that day when I hear your name called but you know when you're preaching you can feel that sweep of the Holy Spirit move through the room there's just none like him that's right there's just none like him no doubt you've said in many rooms and and and and many services if you've traveled a bit and you just know when that special presence begins to roll in right don't be afraid of that I would say I would say today as we've been hearing about worshiping the Lord we're the people that ought to really be worshiping the Lord if there's anything that we should be doing is giving him praise and Giving Him worship now let me just say God just didn't build you to see if he could build you come on he didn't just make a tree to make a tree he's got a purpose behind having you here hallelujah if I could just have a little conjecture here just for a moment and kind of reach out a little bit I believe that the angel of God was talking about me in that cave that not even [Music] [Applause] cancer not even cancer so here I stand as a miracle of God that should have been dead a long time ago Hallelujah but brother Ron you take chemo well let me just say this you as a doctor told me the other day he says now if anybody ever gives you a grief and says it's not a miracle that you take chemo he says I'll write a letter for you I'll write a letter for you and you can let them know that all these other patients are taking the same team know that you're taking and after about a year they're in a wheelchair if they make it a year he said you are a miracle my friend and we believe it with all of our hearts brother Tim and I was with brother bcll I'm just kind of kind of setting a a platform here for a moment we were sitting with brother Bisal and brother Samuel Ray's house after the meeting and we were sitting and we were just talking about supernatural things and as he would tell one brother Tim would tell a story and I would tell a story and after a little while there was a gathering of people I don't know exactly how many came into the room maybe 50 60 people came came in and it was just people were videoing it and we begin to talk and toward the end brother Ed would the presence of the Lord would drop down and brother Ed would say many years ago I sat at a table like this and I sat with brother brandham at the table and he began to talk about Miracle after Miracle after miracle and we begin to go backwards and forwards and he said just in a little bit he says Eddie hanging just inches from you now is that Pillar of Fire the other night we were in alasas cabin and we begin to talk the supernatural things that we're seeing God do we're living in a book of Acts given time they'd write a book of Acts and we're living this is an action message it's a Liv life that's right it's a Invincible Army that's going forward whether you be in school or whether you be young parents or whether you're the oldest person in the building you're defying the armies of hell and every day that you live is a miracle is a supernatural moment in your life you might think it's natural but it's extremely Supernatural you say brother R I don't know so much about about that listen Satan has swore to destroy you he has did his absolute best to destroy you he stowed every demon that he's got to destroy you but let me just say you're still standing when you roll out of bed in the morning Satan is terrified of what you will do in your house in your community on your [Applause] job we was in brother Wayne's home brother Wayne Lawson's home and we were just speaking of these kinds of things and I don't know maybe 40 50 of us was in the room and so we were sitting around the table brother Ben Erikson sitting on the other side Brother Ray was there presence of God Dro down brother Ray begin to speak in tongues I believe in it yes sir we're a tongue speaking people that's right presence of God moved and brother Ben was needing his his business his pumpkin business blessed I'll tell you that God that comes he don't only make a promise but he brings [Applause] results and he had a bumper crop yeah he cares about you yes sir I stood I stood at the coffee shop this week and I was honored to stand at the ribbon cutting thank you brother Derek before all of the Chamber of Commerce and they recognize there's something special about your place but in this meeting you were spoke to brother Derek if God is your partner you better have big plans how many of you enjoy his cing you see he don't just make a promise he's got the money in the bank to fulfill [Applause] it we serve an unlimited God and when he heals the cancer patient in the world it does not diminish his power one little Iota you may think that you're unsavable that you've send your way your day of Grace but something's got you in the building just now I want you to know there's a God that's rich in Mercy this is not God is not some artificial put on this God is a God that's real but brother Ron I've got all kind of addictions in my life and all kind of situations you let God be [Applause] God but I got a lot of critics and I got a lot of things against me you let God wipe the Slate of your life in brother Jason Jackson's Church there was a man that was invited at a meeting brother Tim and I was there dying of cancer no chance to live never been in that service ever before as we stepped off of the stage and went down to where he was at and prayed for him that man was totally 100% healed at brother at brother Danny stemens brother Bill Herberger's daughter many years ago had one leg shorter than another we pray PR yes and God allowed her leg to grow back out all right listen God can do anything in a tent meeting the little girl in a wheelchair couldn't walk they called me back in and we prayed for that baby and as I felt her feet release yeah no man can do that but we're commissioned that's right and that little girl be to scream I can walk I can walk I can walk you see we're people with a [Applause] checkbook now some of you young guys that you're you're just kind of making a little bit of money along and you know you you understand what a dollar is all about maybe a $100 and you can spend that $100 it goes so quick and you know but when Dad Dad I need a little money and dad says well I can give you this little bit and he'll hand you a little bit and you think i' I'd like to have a little more you know I I'd like to have a little more how many of you guys know what I'm talking about well the god that we serve is [Applause] unlimited the god that we serve is unlimited are you with me and sometimes we do our God Injustice we don't ask him for big things but God is a god of big things yeah now now if you was going to give the king the king of England a birthday present why no doubt you would you would do your best to buy him the nicest birthday present that you could give him might spend the best money that you've got and you would try your best because he's the king that's why we come to a service like tonight we didn't come to worship a ball player here right we definitely didn't come to worship the president but we come before the king of kings and we want to give him our [Applause] best now I'm leading to something there was a woman that heard Jesus was at a going to be at a certain place now no doubt maybe in her mind she wondered why he would even go there but you know because they're going to make fun of him but if I ever going to get to him I want to I want to get the best that I can get and she goes and gets the best perfume that she can get she buys the best she gets all of her all of her money out and she goes to the place and you know you hear brother brandham say says well you know you don't have to spend this much money she knew if I could only get to him that's right that's when I get to him I want him to know that I'm giving him the the best that I can get I don't know how you feel tonight but I come to this building come on yeah my children flew my children flew here and I provided for them to fly they came I'm now going to tell you even my wife don't know this God put it in my heart to drive here three years ago I drove here cuz God spoke to me if you can get to Jesus how that people would drive 17 hours to be in a meeting with brother brandham and some of them would even die on the way there and brother brandham would come to their car yeah and he would pray for them and they would be healed yeah three years ago God touched me I drove 17 hours to this place listen you may take brother Tim as just another man come on now but I don't I don't Jesus lives in that body Jesus lives in these men when I left after 3 days of being here I drove back home I was sicker than I came down but when I got back home God gave me a strength yes and I work every day since that time with these boys they can tell you that yeah let me just say this you I drove this [Music] [Applause] time not to get to a [Music] man I'm not preaching here to get to a man I'm not even here to impress you but if you and I can get to in the room where he's at if we can get to where he's at if we can get to his feet and wash his feet with our tears and worship him I believe that we can leave this building completely [Applause] different you know Satan it must baffle him that here we are a people that fight with our own selves that's right sometimes we have difficulty with with knowing who we are but even he knows if you find out who you are then you become a Tormentor to him you become a live voice that he can't stop there's a voice behind your voice yeah there's a life behind your life your tabernacling deity itself God's in his word amen and when God's in his word Satan's always standing near trying to defeat the plan of God but let me just say this you God has given you authority over every devil in hell Hallelujah Israel tonight is under intense attack their intense attack back and their enemies trying to destroy them with everything that they have but I want to repeat and say this whether it goes globally or not he don't have [Applause] enough I don't care if all the countries go against Israel if God is on your side you can't lose whether it's brain cancer lung cancer sugar diabetes right where the doctor's giving you a report they don't know how you're living in hospice is your next plan let me just say don't believe their [Applause] report I don't care what it looks like it must be baffling to to Satan that there you sit in a service like tonight you walked in one way you walked in one way and you walk out completely different you walked in with cancer and you walk out totally free maybe you've got a six-pack in the car and maybe going to a party later and you walk out after a while and you throw that stuff away never to go back to that party anymore drugs are gone alcohol's gone old friends are gone because a new man came inside of your heart maybe you're saying well brother Ron I've tried over and over and over again I've made Val I've done it over and over again I get so far and then I fall back get so far one night T night like tonight to where you get a hold of something that's real and you'll never go back ever again a haret one minute and a princess the next Hallelujah won't you just go ahead and Say Bo devil hallu what a moment woman thy sins are forgiven go thy way and sin no more Glory Hallelujah brother man said prayer is the key that's the answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings no notice these words there's no atomic bomb or a hydrogen bomb as powerful as pray cuz you're not praying to a dead God and because of you are who you are and your position with God Satan is powerless before you brother R said Satan you're aware that you're whipped you have no legal rights Jesus Christ my Lord stripped you of every Authority that you had when he died at Calvary to take away sin and sickness you're nothing but a bluff and we're calling your bluff and know that when the Our Lord came to the tree and cursed the tree the next day it was withered and our lord said to the disciples have faith in God for if you say if you shall say you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said is coming to pass you can have what you have said that's rightall I want to say something to you many times we live defeated lives come on because we don't pray we want the world to pray but what about you not just a wishy-washy prayer but pray with authority recognizing who you are you're just not just a Time bound being there's an ET Eternal seed with God laying on the inside of you speak from that Heavenly Realm now he says now and now are we are conquerors we're more than conquers we just walk right into it as an inheritance more than conquers now we are dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated I wish I was twice my size he said that I I now maybe I feel twice as good he said we are disputing with a conquered [Applause] enemy Hallelujah I love this poem when I fail he lifts me up yeah when I fall he lifts me up when I fail he forgives me when I am weak he is strong when I am lost he is my way when I am afraid he is my courage when I Stumble he steadies me when I am hurt he heals me when I am broken he mends me when I am blind he leads me when I am hungry he feeds me when I face trials he's with me when when I face persecution he Shields me when I face problems he comforts me when I face loss he provides for me when I face death he carries me home he is my God he is faithful I am his and he is mine God is in control I am on his [Applause] side that means All Is Well with My Soul [Applause] the scripture said no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper every one of us sitting here have different issues that's going on come on every one of us God watches over every situation of your life there are times to which that you can't even utter maybe not even want to tell your mate the Mind battles that you're going through maybe depression is the issue in your life and you're wrestling in the darkness feeling like the world is on top of you that nobody loves you but nobody cares I want you to know God knows how to go into that [Music] cave are you with me he knows how to come to you maybe you think that your loved one is lost and you've prayed for decades that they'd come home precious friend of mine named gido had a son that he was praying for and a daughter-in-law he said brother Ron I prayed many many many many many prayers for them a ceremony was coming up and he was praying about being a part of that and he called me on a special day and he says brother Ron would would you just pray for me that God will be with me I said let me just tell you something youo your prayers will be answered right and Isaiah and her will come home I'll tell you how this works just a week or so ago their son 7 years old was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'd like to report not only they are but there's more of your family getting ready to come in open up the house door they're coming home they're coming home they're coming home Hallelujah brother Ron how do you know that's just adventuring without Authority oh no the same God that spoke to me about too tell them tell him it's going to be all right to be a part of that ceremony cuz they're coming in it's the same God spoke to me this afternoon tell them their loved ones are coming Bo hallelujah hallelujah Hall a masterpiece of masterpieces was delivered last night almost a lawyer stood in the pull pit and took us through the scriptures and showed us our Authority yeah he hadn't heard what brother Kelly said the night before so he comes along and reinforces what brother Kelly preached the night before and as I sat there in that in that seat the Lord spoke to me and said tonight you'll pray for grace you'll pray for grace I did not know the story but you'll pray for grace for her husband the lines were splitting going here and there listen God's always orchestrated you've came thousands of miles but he's in the room and you might think it's even impossible now but God Specializes in impossibilities he has chosen to take your case what about your case tonight remember our God is still the god of Elijah he is still the god that ever was he is still the same God he moves in the same cycle he does the same thing he is the same yesterday today and [Applause] forever one for I'm under Authority and you are having Authority and whatever you say it'll be going just as you say it Lord give me men and women tonight to know that you still are in Authority you have authority over cripples over blindness over cancer over all diseases over sin he is God who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases Hall let's just remind him Satan you cannot take our life right come on Satan you cannot take your life until God has finished with you I live this [Music] quote listen these are more than just words on a page yes sir or words in a in a in a quote these are more than just power quotes yeah but some somebody's going to live it and I stand here more than just an exercise for you God can't take your life until your purpose is finished on the [Applause] earth God can't take your life sister Genie until God's finished and it ain't over it ain't over till God says it's over Hallelujah it ain't over I don't care what the what everybody says about you I don't care what your diagnosis is it ain't over have faith in God oh my how the devil has to recognize the supreme authority of Jesus Christ not me he hates me he don't have to mind me but he has to mind the one that I represent he has to mind the one that sent me here come on listen to him pray Satan you've bound these people you're exposed tonight your grips are lost you have no legal Authority at all Jesus Christ robbed you and stripped you at Calvary and we come as the Church of the Living God and in the name of Jesus Christ I adure Thee to leave every person in the building come out of the people thou demons I adure Thee by the Living [Music] God now we're commissioned to tell him to leave but you got to let him go you can't worship the disease that you're fighting and expected to leave you've got to hate that devil that's attacking you you got to believe this I shall live and not die brother Ron aren't you scared when you preach like this that the devil will attack you you know next week and you'll have a horrible week well I had a horrible Sunday and then the last two nights I've had horrible nights I've got up at 2: and 3:00 in the morning and throw up till 5:00 in the morning but I've been laying the bed and whimper I didn't come here and tell how bad the devil is I come here tonight to report for Duty and to stand here to tell you that our God Is A Healer I am not afraid what don't you say it I am not [Applause] afraid brother BR says Don't Be Afraid don't stay back and say well I I believe the days of Miracles has passed I I don't know don't do that that that don't look like a child of Abraham no matter how far long the promise seems to hold out it went for 25 years yeah but if instead of Abraham getting weaker instead of us getting weaker brother Tim we're getting [Applause] stronger I wouldn't trade trials with brother Tim for all the money in the world but instead of laying in his tears feeling sorry for himself he stands in this pull pit and preaches to you cuz we've got a job to do we're going home together God made a promise and God gave a promise and you believe it I don't care what takes place it's yours fight the devil on every ounce of ground that he stands on on and walk over and take it take the sword of the word I say this you cut his head off God's promises are true there's nothing that can stop them they're God's promise he gave us promise of that just like he did of the in the children of Israel the Pentecost church has come to their Cades Baria are we able can we do it Jesus Christ is say yesterday today and forever can we walk up there and take a hold of the promise and say it's the truth I claim it I own it it's mine God gave it to [Applause] me I'd like for I know you can't see this but God made the promise I want you to say this with me it's the truth it's the truth I claim it I clim it I own it I own it it's mine it's mine God gave it to me God gave it to me listen if God gives you something there's not enough devils in hell to take it away from you [Applause] Hallelujah he conquered every sickness he conquered Temptation when the enemy spit in his face he smoted his jaw he turned to the other side and when they jerked his beard at his face and spit on him he never R back he conquered the Gate of Temptation and he took it so I would say to you tonight as we stand here and we have just told you how powerful prayer is let me just give you a couple examples Moses prayed Satan if you want to pay attention here just for a moment Moses prayed and the greatest soldiers in the world became fish [Applause] food another one of my family members prayed and they had thow him in a lion's de and a pillar of fire caused those lies to sleep for a while and he told that King oh King I'll see you in the [Applause] morning what about your prayer more than now I lay me down to sleep and I pray dear Lord my soul to keep but your prayer gets God's attention yeah I think we should come into a service like tonight and expect to be [Applause] victorious the greatest preachers in the world rehearse to you that you are an invincible Army right that's God's thought about you that's not Willam brandom's thoughts about you that's God's thoughts about you that's right that Satan would be powerless before you but Satan's job is to come into your mind and to try to convince you off of your position but you'll stay in the word of God whether you feel like shouting jumping hanging on the chandeliers are not if you stand flat-footed on the word of God and you take your promise this is mine I believe I want to report to you that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you Hallelujah now well brother Ron but you know we've been preach sermons like this for years but what if tonight's your [Applause] night you see this morning at 4:15 I marked the time and one of my sicknesses going to the to the restroom when I came back into the dark room of brother Tim's he he give us his bedroom thank you brother Tim it's a nice it's a nice mattress you put on there hey I bought a new truck so he could chauff for it around so he gets the fever don't y'all get mad blame brother R somebody wants to buy it for him that'd be good too I just don't feel led to leave in [Applause] mine I got to get home now you're told over and over again that you're an invincible Army and that came from the eternities yeah and you're told over and over again that God gave you a checkbook and Jesus Christ signed it but you got to fill it out you got you got to fill it out now maybe you got a son and daughter that's away from God and and it seems like that there's no way that they'll ever come back I want to tell you I'm one of those guys that was a prodal and I had a mom and daddy that were Believers of this message even turned me over to the devil it worked are you with me but God rich Mercy rewrote the book of my life are you with me he rewrote the book of my life and I want to tell you that this message works I don't care how many critics come along I don't care how many articles are put on the internet it can't stop this you heard brother Wayne talk about in the last 10 years in the last 10 years what has taken place in his life what has taken place his children they moved he's now the pastor of the church there an incredible Church a powerful Church a Living Church you live in that area and and you're not going to church go to that church amen come on you've heard me say before if you're if it's dead find one that's alive I'm talking about more than just the [Applause] denominations some churches are like mors no amens no shouts Hallelujah no music they taking on a Church of Christ tradition I'm not going there tonight but anywhere Jesus is there's a lot of noise yes now let me let me just say how many husband and wife pairs are here tonight husbands and wives want you just raise your hands and maybe in the air hold one another's hand just for a second all right that's really good God bless you sister Mandy can I pick on you for a moment yeah she yeah she just seemed to be beaming back there now Sister Mandy brother Phillip's got all the money in the [Applause] world and you go to town and you buy $252 worth of groceries and you come home and say well honey I bought $250 $252 of groceries today I hope it don't offend you honey we have an unlimited bank [Music] account and she goes and he says honey you don't understand unlimited and and and and you know you know she's got no car she drives by one that's sparkling and just to her laughing she spends $152,000 and she comes home and she says I bought a car today and he says honey you don't understand you don't have to apologize I want to say to you the days of Miracles are not passed Hallelujah you don't have to come with an apologetic atmosphere I'm sorry God I'm sorry poor old pity me you're the wife of heaven and these Sons shall follow them that believe why should we fear why should we be afraid why should we be temped God's handed us though all that's in the book every promise in the book is mine every promise we do not have to settle for less that's in our promise well brother Ron it don't look like it's going to happen well just think about it it's not about what you think that it looks like Abraham looked fatherless but he kept telling what God told him to say come on Sarah looked like it couldn't happen but Satan hang around a little while brother L we got promises we got promises we do not have to live like underprivileged children God says I'll make you the head and not the tail I'll bless you coming in and I'll bless you going out I'll bless you you are the Queen of Heaven on now if you'd have been looking for a while it looked like the tent was empty just Abraham and Sarah but God said I'll make you the father of Nations when he took him out he showed him the sand of the sea can you count him no that'd be impossible so shall thy seed be he showed him the stars of the heaven can you count them so shall thy seed [Applause] be well now we can look back thousands of years and say I'm one of them God said he'd give us our children he'll give us our [Music] [Applause] children are you with me now he said he'd watch over you he'll watch over you I just want to drop a couple more things here you're better protected than the president of the United States of America now think about that just for a moment those guys that take care of the president Eagle One when they take care of him they can only protect him from things that they hear about on the internet are the things that they see but another realm there's demons that try to destroy you and they're in attacked for you because you're Sons and Daughters of God the pillar of fire just wasn't in Houston but there's a pillar of fire watching over you and Satan can see that fire living on the inside of you he can see it and you're his enemy but you are not alone you are not alone God has dispatched angels to watch over [Applause] you Hallelujah I'm going to need a quote brother Ron okay God asked amram and Jose bed make a basket pitch it and place that baby Moses that you know that the angel met you and there the baby is I I want you to put it in that crocodile infested waters all right here's God's sense of humor I'm going to let the devil's Kingdom raise him that's I'm going to let the devil's Kingdom pay for his education that's right but one day I'm going to tell him who he is you may feel like you're in crocodile infested waters it and you may feel so alone let me just give you a glimpse of what's Happening standing on your basket it's Gabel himself and there's tens of thousands of Angels standing on the sides of the river and every time a crocodile comes up to destroy you Gabriel pushes it back down sleep on baby do sleep on hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah rest rest in his promises Hallelujah now in a few days there's going to be some people that walk into the room it's going to be real special because it's in the promise all right it's going to be a brown-headed girl maybe her hair will be at her knees and she'll look like her wedding picture her name will be Karen now this isn't a fairy tale I'm I'm just telling you what the vision says that's right now now people say that you can't have Visions or God don't do that no more but I brought I brought little my little buddy up here a while ago and the devil whispered in my ear for three years Whitney couldn't have children and Davy was crushed in an accident and he couldn't have children but the vision said Isaac was on his wayall listen you you saw it you saw it's little bow tie you saw it you can say I I believe that maybe you didn't see the vision you just heard about it brother Jeremy's here from the church you know the story I walked into the room and they said let me tell you his name I said no I'll tell you his name it's Isaac Jackson Breeden that's right that's absolutely right yeah God wasn't guessing brother Brandon wasn't guessing we're going to take a half a step this way and they're going to take a half a step this way now I'm not going to just guess here for you now some of you walked into this building one way and you're going to walk out another can you give me just a couple more moments your father Joshua I remember I'm going to bring you into you into a public audience we were in Switzerland you've been a Believer for years raised an Incredible family you were standing there as a deacon standing and when I stopped by you as I walked out from preaching I said you're wanting a supernatural experience with God did he do it I walked by you and said that one on another maybe a couple years later God's calling you to preach he's been with you at every service yes if he calls you he will equip you ain't that right we know that's the truth we know that's the truth your father was in the meeting in North Carolina and in North Carolina he had a great burden on his heart we' been in a tent meeting the week before and in the tent meeting he had a great burden and as as the service was coming to an in there was a man that had walked down the aisle and he had crutches and braces on and before even while we preached even before this the sermon was over that man walked to the front about where the edge would be and that man took those braces off and he throwed those things back and he ran back to the back he didn't get to me he got to him that's right and your father had a great burden on his heart because there was a letter in his anti-et case that had a lot of vicious things about it that's right and the Lord spoke from the pull pit gido paid no attention to that letter it's of the devil I didn't know that letter was there but God did in next week Brother G was standing at the end of the service and standing behind the curtain and I never forget this because there was a lot of resistance it didn't hear tonight but there was a lot of resistance to the service and and and there was two preachers that were turning against the message you can't stop God I said if God can't operate out here he'll operate behind the curtain and when I stepped behind the curtain you're getting ready to go preach when I Ste behind the curtain uh there was two kids Joe Green's son and and daughter-in-law right and God gave them a baby that's right God gave them a baby and it was born exactly a year later another couple had needed a baby for 17 years and played for a baby and God gave them a baby and now they're getting ready to have a second baby that's right where I'm coming to you gido was standing there and he was worshiping the Lord and I said brother gido there's a train coming for you it'll be all right to get on it and in just a few weeks that train came and he stepped Beyond this realm of Tears that's right there was a man standing there that it set in the service and this is why I'm going there it set in the service for decades his name was Terry and in that spot maybe you've sat here for years and you haven't made a move for God W you call your name right there and Terry I had hunted in his tree stand he had been a friend but he wouldn't make a move church was just entertainment it was a place to go it was a place to be he was a part of the good old boy club I'll never forget it he was standing there beside the wall brother Homer longor was standing beside of him he said I can serve a god like that and in that moment we begin to pray Hall God changed his life we talk about Hattie wri and her two sons what about you tonight what about you I knew you when you were a little girl what about your family what about the ones that are wavered why don't you call their name right now that's right hallelujah hallelujah brother Ron you listen I walked by that that piano last night and she was sitting there playing it and God spoke to me said tell her her her family's coming home sister Betty said I walked in with one husband and I walked out with another one maybe tonight that you walked into this building one way can you believe yes I want to ask you a greater than Solomon is here believe maybe you've driven hundreds of miles and you come with expectation yes sir maybe the doctor just told you that there's tumors even in your female organs and fear strikes you you know when it when it's in when it's in another prayer request and it's somebody else it don't affect you quite as much as when the doctor's looking in your ey and say I I I'm sorry to tell you but the scans are showing that you have cancer but I want to tell you tonight that he's here to tell you that I can dissolve that for [Music] you absolutely this has come back for the third time and I'll say it now maybe you're m marag is on the Rocks you don't need to go to some marriage counselor the counselor is in the building that's right hallu the counselor is in the building and if you just fall in love with Jesus and you receive the Holy Ghost like never before Hallelujah two people can come back in a union and be happy again yes sir yes sir brother Ron looks like a total loss come on a lady I prayed for her one time she's there on a Sunday morning she said brother Ron my husband's left me and he's living with another woman he's a thousand M away I want him back I want him to be a real Christian the next Sunday morning I'm at that same place preaching and after I get done preaching there's a man comes to the altar the audience erupts I don't know what's going on he does that man said at the very same time they calculated it at the very same time that we were praying God spoke to him and said go home and he drove he drove all the way and on Tuesday Morning Hallelujah he was sitting on her porch and he said you may not have me back but something spoke to me to come home Hall you're not some wishy-washy people you're people with a sword in your [Applause] hand you're that people why don't you tell your neighbor I'm the people that he's talking about we have been tested we have been trained we have been adopted as Sons and Daughters of God you say brother Ron I feel like the weakest person in this building I've got good news for you when the weakest of Christians go on their knees the kingdom of Hell shakes and I finish with this it's time to shake him who brother Ron you God called you to shake him hallelujah hallelujah Heavenly Father you told me last night at 4:15 that you would stand with me and you have thank you Lord you have given me the strength to preach this message tonight and it's not an if it's going to happen Hallelujah We Believe yes now Satan you have heard the word of God take your cold clammy hands off of God's children you were defeated at Calvary and you took one step after another on your way up that hill no doubt a man named Simon Serene that was asked to carry your cross looked into your eyes you wasn't doing that for yourself you was doing that for us you could have called 10,000 angels and it would have changed the whole [Music] scene father you even forget your persecutors those that cried out against you yes you forgave them you did that because we could be healed and we could be saved yes and Lord Jesus we stand here reporting for Duty feeling your presence all over this building you've touched lives oh no doubt a Critic would look and say well that's some kind of a fleshly manifestation well just stick around and watch just stick around and listen to the reports that'll come in these signs shall follow them that believe Lord we're nothing without you but you're the one that made the promise and brother random asked us do you believe yes I believe yes I believe now if I was standing in the prayer line and I was standing there and I walked before that great presence standing there with cancer in my brain in my lungs limp [Music] nodes now taking chemo for three and three and 1/2 years and my card got drawn maybe never met the man before he would tell me he said now there's something standing between you and I that's him Ron don't fear that now your name is Ronald Ronald Spencer you live in Grotto 309 Pine Creek Lane yes yes that's right the doctors have told you that there's a curse of Cancer all over you yes that's that's right you're a preacher of the message of the hour yes that's right do you believe Ron I would say absolutely I believe with all my heart absolutely now Lord Jesus tonight I've stood here and preached your word not just to an audience of maybe 500 people but I preached tonight in this atmosphere believing that Lord you can heal not only their body but can heal mine Lord knowing that this is life and death yes now father we're not here to play games because we know one of these mornings you'll change our body in the moment of the twinkle of an eye can we have faith for that I say yes Lord yes Lord I believe that's absolutely the truth I believe it with all my heart like Mary said be it unto me according to Thy Word now Lord Jesus you see Erica Reagan Parker you Wicked devil you naughty enemy that girl has a purpose to be a mother a purpose to be a wife a preacher's daughter I don't care what it looks like from the dust to the Stars we believe your word we believe a report that you were wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities and you took those stripes at Pilot's judgment Hall that we could be healed now Lord Jesus we ask you to go not just to her but to the many other requests that has come before us even this afternoon now father as we as ministers will come
