minister to us we pray father lord strengthen us lord in this time that we're living him lord we give ourselves to you in jesus name amen amen genesis 1 and verse 1 and all also isaiah 60 and verse 1 amen it says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day also isaiah 60 and verse 1 says arise shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth in gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee amen how many can say praise the lord amen a place of darkness but in the middle of the darkness a great light amen we'll let you be seated like to speak to you this evening out of darkness and into light during chaos as we read read here as the bible says that the world was without form and was void there was nothing but just the darkness of chaos and it was a horrible shape that it must have been nothing but way into the darkness younger without a light or anything in the churning of the waters and the wandering star twisting as it were twisted around and around nothing to hold it nothing to keep it in orbit nothing to place it in a certain place or just just as it was just seemed like a a terrific mass that was lost couldn't find its way and this was where the earth was at as we now stand upon it today it's a beautiful place there's beautiful days upon this earth there's uh you know the sun that shines upon this earth there's the atmosphere that we enjoy that of good weather and things that that are here is here now but at one time it was nothing but a a just a mass of uh chaos as the winds would swirl around it and and waters would churn and things that were taking place as it was going to its place where god would prepare for it and you know this is what brother branham would say they said there's a type of how we were when we were also wandering stars and away from god without hope without god just turning around out of the darkness not knowing where we're going amen i believe every one of us could say that's who we were at one time amen out in that darkness and and of sin or darkness of whatever system you may have found yourself in and it was a great chaos of things that was around you your life didn't make sense you didn't know which way many times was up or which way was down and you know that's how it is when you're you get in the time of darkness i i don't i know many of us has has been in a room when when the lights would go out and you very quickly lose your bearings you very quickly uh lose you know where you're at and you don't know exactly where the furniture is exactly and bump your toes or or whatever amen because you know it sends you into a bit of chaos and this is what darkness does but his word was spoke over the darkness and over the chaos it was spoke over all the winds it was spoke all over all the turmoil when it said let there be light and that mass of creation power went out and began to create a sun begin to create a moon and begin to pull out of the earth the things that were laying in there in the earth until it would take it from a place of chaos into a garden of eden amen by the word of god and and god was showing right there that his word is powerful enough over any kind of darkness any kind of problem any situation you know maybe it might have been when he said let there be light there might have been hundreds of years it might have been thousands of years we don't know exactly the time that it took place but his word spoken let there be light before there ever was a light but it had to come to pass because god said so just as it just as though he has said god i'm going to have a church it doesn't matter how many dark ages they've been through doesn't matter how many problems and situations he spoke it he said i'm going to have a church without spot without wrinkle amen it doesn't matter how bad the degree of chaos is or how bad the darkness is or how bad the things are around us his word is already spoke so darkness can't do anything about it it can try it can gather itself he can try but darkness will never defeat light amen light can always defeat darkness it can always push it back but darkness will never defeat light amen you could turn every light in this building off amen you could strike a match it's a little bitty thing amen and it would push back the darkness amen but that darkness could never push back the light amen because we see a showing there in type that his word will always defeat amen the darkness it will defeat overcome every wind of doctrine his word will prevail it doesn't matter how impossible it seems he will prevail he would show us this amen as an attribute of himself in revelations 5 as one of the elders would say to john weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed over darkness he prevails over sin he prevails over demonic oppression he prevails over every sickness he hath prevailed amen he prevails amen over everything that the enemy would ever come with amen we could find him in john 1 and verse 4 it says in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not or the light or in other words it the light shines and the darkness can do nothing about it hallelujah amen when his light shines amen darkness can do nothing about it because it cannot put out the word of god it cannot stop the word of god it cannot keep it from coming to pass amen demons may try demons may scream they may holler they may protest but they cannot stop the word of god from being fulfilled amen but we see you know as we look at this light in darkness in every exodus there was darkness amen there was chaos in every exodus amen there was also the murder of children amen it would cause a chaos it would cause an upheaval it would cause amen people to wonder what is going on amen what is happening amen in the first exodus we could read a darkness that actually could be felt we could read it in exodus 10 verse 21 it says the lord said unto moses stretch out thy hand towards heaven and there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be felt in other words that you would have to grope or try to make your own way through because you have no life but they said and they saw not one another and he wrote neither rose any of his place for three days but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings hallelujah amen we can read in matthew 27 and verse 45 at the second exodus now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour now not only is it a physical darkness but there's also a spiritual darkness we can see the spiritual darkness that was taking place in the first exodus we can see the spiritual darkness that was going on in the second exodus and and for us to come to our exodus in our time we cannot expect there not to be chaos we cannot expect there not to be darkness around us we cannot expect that there won't be troubles on every hand but we can expect there will be light there'll be light to guide us and delete us no matter where we're at no matter what we're going through no matter what kind of troubles we're facing what kind of obstacles amen there's a light on our path that is guiding us day by day and this light is not a light that we got to worry about going out amen these lights up here you got to worry about it they got a time they got an expiration date there's a time that they're going to they're going to end because they're man-made amen the lights at your home wherever the lights on your car amen how many has replaced them you had to replace them because they have an expiration time amen but the light that we're being guided by does not have an expiration time it's an eternal light amen therefore it has eternal benefits amen you don't have to worry about getting in the valley of darkness and running out of light amen because there is a shadow in there so if there's a shadow in there that means there has to be light and the light is shining no matter how bad the darkness is no matter how much the problems around you god is calling us out of darkness and into light but there's going to be chaos during these times and we've seen it we see it arising more and more very rapidly as we're going on in the time that we're living in amen darkness is getting darker but the light is still there amen we can you know we can find uh you know i happen to just stumble across the video just yesterday of watching a woman get up in protest at her local school board amen about about what they're teaching children and why she had to take her children out and why she's here to fight for the other children and and she's talking about you know when does it become right that we teach our children amen to be something that they're not that we begin to tell them that they're a boy when they're a girl or we allow them amen to make a decision when she said god made that decision for them and she said you know just the other day and she made this statement i never heard about this but it shows you the oncoming darkness and the darkness that is pushing and it's coming and it's going amen she said she said you know just the other day one of our substitute teachers was fired because a little girl came up and meowed at her and she wouldn't be out back amen because this little girl had been taught that if she identified as a cat it was okay to be a cat how far are we going to go with these things darkness is pushing amen but there's still light amen it's not amen there's still good christian people that'll get up there and oppose that darkness amen amen see we're facing in this year amen we're facing both darkness and light amen we're in one of the most chaotic times of darkness that we've ever a man has ever stood in amen i want to say it's even greater than the first exit this was it's greater than the second exodus was we're in the darkest time amen that man has ever stood in yet we're also standing right now in the most blessed light that's ever shown right in the middle of chaos amen darkness all around and problems all around amen we're standing also in the most blessed light amen the light of the revealed word of the hour that is shining upon our pathway and showing us where we're at amen we're not a deceived people amen we're walking by the word of god and we're working towards a rapture [Applause] but just like in the beginning there was gross darkness upon the earth but the spirit of god amen began to move upon the face of the water and when that spirit began to move a voice spoke and said let there be light why did the light have to come because those seeds that were laying there in that in that earth could not come to fruition until the light began to shine upon it amen so the light had to shine it had to come amen it had to come over the earth and begin to pull out amen the sunflower seeds and the rose seeds and the pine trees and and this this guy this grass and that grass and this life and that life amen life coming from the sun from the light of god and god separated the light from the darkness you know and i he said i believe we're living in that hour again when god is separating light from darkness you know jesus made a really profound statement he said be careful that the light that's within you is not darkness amen because satan portrays himself as an angel of light amen so he's separating again the light from the darkness there's many lights but there's only one true light amen that's even we can talk like we said about the bowl but that's also spiritually speaking there's many lights but there's only one true light amen that's the word of god and what's been vindicated in this hour amen when god is separating it and he's pressing it from the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest and he said that's the reason i can say to the church in the middle of all this chaos shalom amen to them because that is god's peace mercy you mean in the middle of the chaos that's around me all the things that we went through this even this last two years and it seems like it's not getting any better it seems like things are getting worse than they are seems like darkness is getting bad and it's worse than it is amen it seems like things are just moving at warp speed and we're trying to in the middle of all this i can have peace yeah you can have peace he said that's what i want to bring to you for this year and i i want to bring it on to 2022. amen that's what i want to bring for this year not looking back we're not looking back we're not even going to look back and say how bad it's been we're going to look forward and say how good it's about to be amen looking forward we're looking forward to the breaking of a new day there's something great laying just ahead of us where years has been the joy that we've been looking forward to the pressing the coming of that great eternal light hallelujah we're right at the moment of the breaking of the light across that horizontal realm and it's going to break between mortal and immortality we're seeing it break between heavens and earth we're seeing from our earth brown sickness in the troubled world into a bright and shining day of immortal life and immortal body and immortal earth and it shall never pass away that's why we can say shalom it's a light time for the believers but it grows darkness for the world and they don't know what's happening they're wandering they're shaking in their boots you know it's like the jews prophesied or the jews within the days that jesus came upon the earth isaiah had prophesied that they would have eyes but they couldn't see ears but they couldn't hear it's a reason jesus would pray for their forgiveness because that was a way to fulfill the scripture it's returned again the bible spoke about the day we live in gross darkness upon the people amen but there's something simply that people want but they just can't get nicodemus would even express it before the lord rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god but no man can do the things you do if god wasn't with him but it was a darkness upon the jewish race that the messiah might come and take a gentile for a bride they had to reject him but also it's going to be the opposite way amen darkness is coming now upon the gentiles so he can go back to the jews again amen jesus came the first time it was a time of great darkness and chaos amen could you go back to moses the first exodus could you imagine the chaos that was upon that land when you had three days of solid darkness i mean they didn't have street lights like maybe we have street lights and lights on their carriages or chariots like we have lights on ours you know they didn't have it maybe in their homes it was a darkness that could be felt i believe we're there again we have a darkness that can be felt amen you feel it all around you pushing in on every hand amen could you imagine the chaos as it was happening as those babies were getting killed and thrown to the crocodiles and and they're wondering what's taking place what in the world's going on and all the while god's words being fulfilled i mean so a light could come and shine a deliverer could come and bring deliverance to god's people amen in the middle of chaos in the middle of destruction seem like it hope is gone and it's impossible anymore we've held on for 400 years but now it just seems impossible and there's a baby floating on a little basket going down a nile river and angels are guarding it and watching over and sitting on top of it striking crocodiles with swords they're not seeing none of that but it's happening and god's got a seed amen for a certain purpose that a light can shine in the middle of darkness that it would set god's people free then you come down to the second exit the same thing chaos everywhere romans over overlording the people taxes and and burdens and things that was going on and problems and why why's it gotta be like this meanwhile there's a little little donkey on his way to bethlehem and there's a light shining up there but nobody's paying attention to the light all they can see is the darkness jesus came first time in the great darkness and chaos and the world rejected him but there was a group that caught it listen god don't have an exodus unless he's got a people foreign exodus amen so we're coming down to the third exodus he don't have a exodus if there ain't a people for an exodus so to have an exodus he's got to have a people so there has to be someone in this dark laodicean age that we're living in now uh what you say we're now past even what the prophet lived past his death what he lived it's pretty mind-blowing raise our hands how many thought we'd still be here now the hour is dark gross darkness is on the people i mean to the point that our little children can now identify they want to identify as a cat we got to meow back to them hello they want to be a girl and they're a boy then we got to put up with it gross darkness where are we standing what does it all mean what hour are we in how close are we to the coming of the lord what does it mean god has begun to separate the light from the darkness pressing actually because the reason the darkness is getting worse is because the light is pressing from the other side it's pressing and it's pressing and it's going to break through to a new day again oh hallelujah light is beginning to be pushed into the darkness like he did at the beginning to show the dawn of a new day the church ages are fading now that the god is pressing the darkness into a place the world is covering it up worldlyism is taking the thing chaos everywhere dressing and acting and and carrying on like nothing is going on he says you are not of the world little children ye are of heaven this is not your home hallelujah why why would we want to try to worry about this whole place this is not our home the hour is pressing darkness is pressing but so is light gross darkness was blind in israel for the lighting to fall upon the gentiles now it's blind in the gentiles so it could fall the light can fall on israel just like the day and night one side has darkness the other side has light and then light comes over to the other side and then it goes back to the other side the church the bride is making herself ready it's time for the rapture for darkness is fading from the gentiles to dawn upon the jews the sun has traveled from the east to the west and it's going back around light can only do one thing go back to the other side light can only go back to the east again back to israel god blinded them for a little while but darkness is now coming now upon the gentiles so light can come to them you know we can read about the darkness that's upon us in zephaniah 1 and verse 14. it says the great day of the lord is near how many rejoice in that hallelujah you say well brother brother this has been like thousands of years this was prophesied was so was it also hundreds of years that had been prophesied behold a virgin shall conceive amen in that word brother branham said left that prophet's mouth and began to search for a vessel until 600 years later it found a virgin it could rest inside of and light began to come to a darkened world amen amen this has been spoken thousands years ago but this word has been looking for a vessel it's been looking for a people ready for the great day of the lord it is near and hastened greatly even the voice of the day of the lord the mighty man shall cry there bitterly that day listen to the great day of the lord that day is a day of wrath well check we've seen that it's a day of rep people losing their minds out in the streets riding breaking stuff turning over this burning down buildings a day of wrath it's a day of trouble and distress it's a day of wastedness and desolation it's a day of darkness and gloominess it's a day of clouds and thick darkness but it's a day of the trumpet and an alarm against fence cities alarm against the fifth cities and against the high towers and i will bring distress upon men that they shall walk like blind men like blind men because they have sinned against the lord and their blood shall be poured out as dust and their flesh as the dung and neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the lord's wrath but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all of him that dwell in the land hallelujah their fenced cities are not going to keep them it's not going to help them their high towers it's not going to keep them it won't keep you either the only thing that'll keep you is the true light of this hour and that's the word of almighty god [Applause] amen our silver our gold our riches of this place it won't do us a bit of good there's only one thing that will there's darkness but there's light there's chaos but there's peace mercy he said gross darkness would be upon the people but there would be light rise and shine for thy light has come the greatest time light can shine is in darkness amen you could take that match and take it out there in the middle of the day and it won't hardly do anything but you bring it in place of darkness it'll light up just a little match and you add another match to that another match to that and pretty soon you got a bonfire and it lights further and it lights further the bigger the fire gets the fire that's why in our churches i believe we ought to light the biggest fire we can get amen i'm not interested in a little bit of kindling or a little bit of spark i want everything god's got i want the spirit of god moving upon our midst and so that in the middle of our chaos the word of god can speak and say let there be light and when the word goes forth and that light goes forward it drives back suicide spirits it drives back spirits of this world and things off of our young people and it breaks chains of darkness this is why we got to have that spirit of god moving rise and shine for thy light has come how can there be darkness and light it has to be separated the only thing that's separated is the word manifest the darkness on the earth but when the manifested word of god the sun which is spoken to existence by the word shows itself darkness runs to the other side oh i love that you know again when you get up in the morning and you see that sun peeking over you know what that's saying i'm still here i am the very spoken word of almighty god spoken who knows how many years ago amen been spoken there and it was been burning and stayed in that position held by what not man's ideas not scientific on uh achievements none of that it's held there by the word of god and it's showing you the word of god still has power over darkness it has power over chaos it has power over everything that was there upon the earth but when the sun came up it's showing you i still have power hallelujah and this word has risen in this day not man's theology not man's ideas not man's creeds not some kentuckian preacher it was god's word made manifest and it's showing i still have power i still have power over sickness i still have power over diseases i still have power every every demonic oppression darkness is trying to push it's why you feel like it i feel like the way you do it's why the nerves try to raise up and the worry tries to come in it's darkness it's why it tries to get you to take a bottle of pills it's darkness that's why it tries to come over you and take make you take your life it's darkness don't forget the light shined on you and it's still shining the sun's still up amen even if you can't see the sun it's still up amen you can have the most uh dreary day there ever was and get in the airplane and go right up there wait man the sun's still up it's still shining no matter what the clouds say no matter how bad the clouds may look doesn't matter how bad it may seem around you it doesn't matter how bad you know things are going on in your family and situations in your life and you don't know how to turn to you don't know how to handle it you don't know what to do it's a bunch of stinking clouds but i'm going to tell you right now above those clouds is trying to block off the things of god from you but the light's still shining and that light is still there and all of a sudden on a wednesday night god will send the wind of the holy spirit and it'll blow those clouds back and the sun will still shine upon your life and say yes lord the esower is still out in the middle of my chaos in the middle of my trouble in the middle of my problem he is still there gross darkness upon the people but to the church the bride shalom which is god's peace you know people get the wrong idea about peace you know or joy they think just because i'm you know just go through a bad time and i you know i'm down in the dumps you know or if i i'm or some little worried some things comes by my pieces go this is not your piece this is his peace it's his joy it's his love it's his mercy it's his grace he's still there it doesn't matter what you're going through it's good morning god be with you god peace god's peace go with you it's good morning how do you do oh yeah brother timothy i'll tell you what it's where the night and i had a bad day i'm going through this and i did this and this one over here and i don't want i'm a can i hardly made a church well how do you do peace it's not a temporary thing it's an eternal thing when we see darkness settle in darkness just before the day we know the morning star is hanging to introduce to come inside it's always darkest just a few moments for the day the darkest before the day because the light is pressing the darkness but the morning star comes out and says good morning shalom that's him among us hallelujah his word being identified shalom the great day is fixing to break and when it breaks eternal bright and fair and his chosen one shall gather in their home beyond the sky when the roll is called up yonder i'll be there our names are on his book we'll be there doesn't matter what the darkness says it doesn't matter what the chaos says and my name is written in glory isaiah says arise and shine the light has come the word light is vindicated again light has been vindicated again god's word is vindicated again so when you see god manifesting his promise of the light of the day or the word given to this age you see the promises being manifested it's showing you peace good morning i'm here i haven't forsaken you that great light that hung in the wilderness amen that moses when moses forsook egypt that steamed their approach of christ greater than treasures in egypt that same light was the same light that he followed was the same light that met paul on the road down to damascus that great light hung before him amen that they said i'm jesus amen i want jesus i come from god i go to god that same light has come to what to manifest to make known to the people the promises he's made for this day manifested light of the day and while it's amazing the people of god gets more light the dark gets more dark that's what he said the darkness is darkened it gets more dark because the light is pressing it's pressing it's pressing he said well brother timothy i thought the darkness was pressing no actually the light is pressing it's not darkness it's light light from that other realm is pressing against the darkness in this realm and the dark is getting darker and it's getting darker and it's getting darker but that just means the light on the other side is getting closer and closer and closer and closer and closer until finally that darkness can't hold it no more it's held it for now for 2 000 years and it's now past the prophet more than he lived amen but darkness is getting darker and darker but why the light is getting closer and closer and closer amen we're one year closer than we was last year we're one day today closer than we was yesterday amen we're one hour closer than when we started service we're closer and closer and closer till one day boom light's going to shine like it's never shown before and that eternal round gonna break into this rail and we're going to be with him forever in the middle of chaos rise and shine for the light is coming to you john the baptist in his day in the middle of darkness would rise and he would shine the light of the hour as one crying in the wilderness behold i send my messenger before me to prepare the way of the lord jesus would say you did walk in his light he was a bride and shining light then that light went out and now there's another light and many of them refuse to see that great light that came down even the ones that walk with john others that was around many scholars and things and people that you would have thought would definitely would have knew when the scripture was being revealed and the prophets isaiah's message was being foretold or being fulfilled and and a virgin was given birth and things were mysteriously surely those would have knew it but the darkness was too great there wasn't in the light but there was a couple of fishermen out on a boat and they was having a bad day i had been fishing and couldn't catch nothing and this you know chaos all around and been working all day and it was just so stupid my work i'll tell you what i'm getting so sick and tired of it and all of a sudden light comes walking light comes walking he said can i borrow your boat for a minute peter said yeah i can you know we know he maybe he did throw a little fit i don't know what he did but jesus got in his boat and began to teach and then he turns around and says cast out go out into the deep and cast your net for the drought what happened light began to shine they began to shine in their little boats amen they had been walking around down the shore she's the seashores of galilee some were seeing it some the darkness was getting darker some the light was dawning upon them and he steps into that boat and light began to shine in that boat in the middle of chaotic day in the middle of chaos amendment to where peter would have to say ain't nobody could do what he did but what but god amen he had to recognize this has to be my god it has to be jehovah only he could create we've been fishing we've not been trying we've been we've been doing what we could do but he told us to throw on the other side and now we got not enough for our boat we got enough for two votes he's that kind of god amen the light's shining what about this new year we're facing brother timothy where are we going what's going to happen it's going to get darker that gives me the fields of goods it's going to get darker it's like i said even in 2020 people were saying you know hey i can't wait till 2021. well who said it's going to be any better and it wasn't any better and then we came you know now we've got 2022. is it 2022 is it going to get any better brother timothy no it's going to get darker it's going to get worse things are going to come even worse as we go into the into the darkness is going but it's in the in the middle of all of that chaos in the middle of all the darkness the way i want you to catch something the world is going to get worse the world is going to get worse you might be in the world but you're not of the world because in your dwelling in your dwelling there's a great light that shines and it's not a temporary light that goes out when it gets darker it's an eternal light and it does not matter how many devils rise up and begins to blow against it and howl against it this light is an eternal light it's a great light he says this is what even brother brown would say in 64. he says what's going to be darkness darkness to light darkness is going to get worse a new year a new year brother what about it it brings new hope what you said it's gonna get worse it brings new hope we're one year closer we're one day closer we're one hour closer you know he said it's like a man one morning he said i heard it man went out early picked up his paper come back sat down kicked his feet up on the on on the recliner put his glasses on began to read his wife was getting breakfast said john anything new he said no same old thing just new people yep that's right murders rapes everything somebody but just somebody else done it it's true he said but this new year we're not just turning a new page we're turning back to the word again to see what the word has promised for this day that the light of this day can grow greater and brighter in our lives in the middle of chaos it ain't changing pages or changing calendars it's moving towards him forgetting those things that are behind pressing towards the mark of the high calling you know what makes demons scream it ain't the darkness they've been comfortable in the dark they've enjoyed it they've been they've hid in the dark places but what would make a demon scream is light when that light stepped off that boat over onto the land that the maniac was on he'd been living out there for a while and maybe you know whatever going on just demons having their own way doing their own thing but when that light stepped off onto that land they begin to scream they begin to howl they begin to cross a ruckus amen even you've seen it in our camps what caused that not darkness light light exposes them it shows amen that the power of light is always greater than the darkness they can hide in the deep crevices of life of darkest moments and darkest times amen a psychiatrist or a psychologist can never get there but that light can get there it can get to those places you may not even know about we can see it and amen in brother branham's ministry he'd go back in lives and begin to discern hey man that wasn't psychology there was a light and that light was shining into a darkness and saying that's where that devil attached itself to and that light would expose that darkness and that darkness would have to flee but truly darkness is going to get worse on the world it's going to push and seemingly get greater and worse but if you'll put it in your mind it's truly light pushing against it it's only another day closer to the coming of the lord and that light has moved into that darkness and that darkness is screaming and hollering and chaos is breaking out and things because it knows it's just about to lose all power it's about to lose all power hey man we can go let me go down for a second amen the rising of the sun he said he says let me hold on let me get to the place before i get there i'm gonna stop here for a minute and shalom again he said we're creatures of time he's a god of eternity he says see he says see he's he's coming it's pushing he said just commit yourself to him look up shine with the joy of the lord know that you've been privileged your eyes have come open to see the day we're here trust in him for the future no matter how dark it is trust in him he's the god he'll get you through it you've seen him vindicate his word in days past he that vindicated his word in days past made all these things happen exactly to the hour that we're living in amen exactly right to the seventh angel's message both showed in heaven on earth made it known three ways so there'd be no slip up remember he promised he would come again that word will be vindicated god's promised word with 2 000 years of waiting 2 000 years of waiting he will arrive on time [Applause] don't be weary he will be there my god that light will break through the darkness it will come through it come through with ten thousands and thousands of his saints as they come back and take up their bodies don't be weary they're going to be there amen there will be a millennium the old will be young again sickness will fade away and death will be no more they will build houses and they will inhabit them they will plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof they'll not plant and another inhabit his son take it or his grandson his son will be living by him sounds good to me his son will be living by him he'll not plant another eats dies off and somebody else take it he'll live there i'll live there the wolf and the lamb shall feed together the lion shall eat straw like a bullet and a child shall lead them around there'll be innocence there'll be nothing hurt we'll be changed from what we are now to the glorious image of the son of almighty god which is immortal years can never touch us age can never destroy us sickness can never reach us all that's shouting grounds right there cancer will never strike a body again [Applause] hallelujah you'll never battle again with a mind paddle wondering if you're saved wondering if you're going to make it you're there hallelujah amen and meanwhile where are you while you're there where's the darkness it's all gone it's been eradicated it's no more the future what's the future brother timothy he holds it how do you know when's he coming i don't know but he'll be there when will he do this and us when will the curse go off the earth when with all these blessed reflections of god's love of trees standing here shining out the flowers and things when will they grow immortal i don't know but they will when will all the reflection of men's hearts desire to live in the hospitals and the doctors and the operations and the crying and the grief when will it all cease i don't know but it will it'll cease unto the glorious reign with jesus of a thousand years of shalom in the middle of chaos the world is going to go on in chaos while you go on into the wedding supper oh praise the name of the lord the healing the deliverances he said see he said see it's when the son of righteousness will rise with healing his wings he said that healing part there will not be a physical healing you think to say somebody got a sickness to be taken away from them that's what he's doing now but that healing will be the whole creature will be changed this mortal will take on immortality this old age will jump back into youth oh hallelujah the first light that was ever given to the earth was god's spoken word the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word he said let there be light and it turned darkness into light in order to bring forth the creation of joy and life on the earth then the spirit of god as it moved in love and compassion on that great day that first day of dawn as it began to sweep over the earth the sun rose it's raised and it dried up the waters and made an atmosphere above it'll bring joy and life to the earth what a great hour what a great hour he said but that wasn't nothing to the sunrise on that easter morning this time when the sun leap into the skies it brought forth a greater sunrise a greater light was brought forth amen a greater light to overcome a greater darkness because it was great news the s-o-n is up he has risen he is quickened from the dead and he has raised over every devil in hell over every power of satan over a spirit that wants to come against you he's raised up against it he's raised up over it first time sun rose in genesis is bringing a message there's life coming and this time when the sun rose it was again it was a dual sun rising another sun rising not only the s-u-n it was the esso wind it's risen to bring eternal life to god's eternal seed that by foreknowledge he's seen them laying in the earth oh yeah satan tried to cover you up with darkness god somehow destroy your lives with your family troubles and things and as young kids and try to destroy you but light shined on you and it brought you out of that darkness you know i always thought i've said this before but i always thought it was amazing of how in the middle of a concrete jungle that in the middle of concrete that this little blade of grass can come up and begin to break up concrete and break it apart and you know why because it was predestinated to life one but two there was a power that began to draw it out of the earth down where it was planted however many thousands of years ago or however many whatever before the before the concrete was put on it that germ of life was destined for life and so there wasn't nothing that the concrete could do about it it tried to try to compress itself and tried to hold it it tried to re-put rebar in it try to do everything he could but it couldn't keep that life from coming up because there was a sun that was greater than the concrete it had a greater drawing power than the concrete had a holding power hallelujah and when this sun began to rise on eternal seas laying in darkness under the concrete of sin and the conquer the devil said you know what i got him there ain't no way in the world he's coming out of that fence city ain't nowhere in the world he's coming out of that problem ain't nowhere in the world he's going to rise up out of there but the s-o-n began to rise he forgot about that but he also forgot that inside that seed was an eternal german side of there and the sun began to pull and that sun's drawing power was greater than the sin's holding power oh hallelujah i'm so glad his power is greater than ever sin greater than ever sickness greater than every trouble greater than every devil i'm looking at seeds that bumped up through dust and concrete of drugs and alcohol and every kind of sin they try to put on your life amen homosexual sin every kind of thing prostitute every kind of thing he tried to lay it on side of it with the sun rose [Applause] there might have been chaos all around you but the chaos couldn't stop the sun amen the chaos couldn't stop it the concrete couldn't keep it i'm gonna have a runaway here in a minute amen when i think about the power of god that rose even on my life you might have been in a tomb of denominational systems been so buried up in there in that darkness but the sun rose and it began to shine and that light has an ability to go down through crevices and down through all kinds of stuff and through every kind of obstacle and begin to draw all of a sudden for no reason you thought man this can't be the truth just i don't seem like out of the blue you know this can't be the truth something's wrong here man the way the church is going what they're doing and what they're promoting that ain't the word of god there has to be but for there to be a false there has to be a true what was that that was the sun that was drawing you you might not could have saw it you may not even knew it was there but that son knew you was there it knew where you was you may not know where the sun was but it knew where you was hallelujah he knows where you're at he knows your address he knows exactly what you're under he knows how to go get you he knows how to redeem you he knows how to wash your he knows how to sanctify you he knows how to justify you and he knows how to fill you with the holy ghost and i'm here to declare once again there ain't enough devils that can lay on top of a seed of god that'll keep it from coming up when the sun begins to shine upon their life they shall come up they shall come up they ain't enough devils they ain't enough devil to suicide they ain't enough devils to sin they ain't enough devils of pornography they ain't enough devils in hell line them all up pile them to the sky if there's a seed down there it shall can you say it it shall come up bless the name of the lord and he will begin to scream out he's risen he's alive he's real he's real let's stand together how many can say this evening i know the sun is over [Music] [Applause] i know he's risen in my life amen devils of every kindness try to hold me down in the old muck of the world try to keep me down there maybe you was one of them lilies down on the bottom of mucky pond and covered up with every kind of dirty thing hey man it's one of the most dirtiest places you ever could imagine the lily would come up not only does he got to come out of the mud he's got to come through who knows how many feet of dirty stinking stagnated water some preacher done damned up it used to be maybe a running stream my brother adam said a bunch of beavers got in there dammed it up and it's covered up down there but the sun comes over it's pulling pulling sunday pulls goes back around wednesday it pulls go back around monday it pulls pulling pulling and down in that old muck down way down there all of a sudden this lily starts something's pulling me i feel the pool i hear the call i can't even see it i don't i don't know what it is but something is drawing me i want you to understand something god wants to do more than bring you out of darkness he wants to also bring you into light hallelujah he wants to do more than just justify and sanctify you he wants to fill you with the holy ghost he wants to do more than just call you out of denominational systems and denominational self or sins of every kind he wants to do more than that he wants to take you in a rapture amen what you got to do is say god i want that sun to shine on me shine on me lord draw me out of my man-made ideas draw me out of all the things that i got going on around me and draw me into the presence of the sun in the middle of chaos light is shining and what a glorious light inspired [Music] so many things we could continue [Music] the sun is shining [Music] the sun is shining don't
