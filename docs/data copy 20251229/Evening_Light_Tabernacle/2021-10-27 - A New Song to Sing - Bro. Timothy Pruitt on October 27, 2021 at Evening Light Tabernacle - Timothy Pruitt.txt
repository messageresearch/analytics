god who's here today showing us that he's still alive and well living in us to tell we commit this service in your hands lord everything to be done and said for your glory in jesus name amen amen turn to isaiah 61 if you would and also psalms 40. i'd like to say it's honor to be here again tonight as brother joe said it's it's a wonderful thing to come the house of the lord amen when you've been out like that and things that we've had to do amen it really puts in your heart how important it is and how good it is to be with believers amen and so as you know we're getting ready for a very important day this coming up on on saturday this is your last service for a little while here amen sister adrian is going to be uh getting married to brother ben steeman there's already some gathering here for that amen and so some of the first inbound from florida they're already here so things are getting real real quick but uh so we're gonna need to some help afterwards brothers to take some things off the platform so they can prepare for that but amen god's been good to us and we're actually looking forward to this day it's not a day that we're dreading per se but we're very happy for adrian and brother ben and and just believe the lord's going to bless them amen for however long he tarries amen with a wonderful marriage amen psalms 40 and verse 1 what was what started isaiah 61 and the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings and to the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planning of the lord that he might be glorified also psalms 40 and verse 1 says i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry and he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the mirey clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings he hath put a new song in my mouth even praising to our god many shall see it in fear and shall trust in the lord amen we'll let you be seated oh actually it's kind of strange most of the time you preach something at home first and maybe take it somewhere and minister but i've actually spoke from this thought a couple of times one at a youth camp in ohio and another brother kelly hildebrandt's just one of the last times i ministered but the lord gave me this thought as i was actually sitting there on the pew at my mom's memorial service and it just dropped in my heart a new song to sing a new song to sing and you know i begin to think on the things that we have read and begin to look at the scriptures that he would appoint unto them that mourn and zion to give to them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness i thought it was very interesting that he would uh he would he would bring he would type out praise as a garment or he would equate it to be in a garment it would have to be something that you would have to put on it wouldn't be something that you could just manufacture per se or or but you would have to actually take it as you would take your clothes as you did for this evening and you chose what what what clothes to put on or what to do and you chose a certain dress or a certain shirt or certain pair of pants but you had to put that on it had to be an action it had to be something that you had to do and this is how you how the prophet isaiah would speak about he said the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness you have to actually take the praise as a garment and put it on amen and begin to praise god no matter what the circumstances are around you and no matter what is going on you still have to put that on amen to be able to break that spirit of heaviness but you know as brother as i look into this brother brown would make this thought and say this in his thought he said many today are becoming discouraged you know and when we become discouraged it takes our strength from us it makes us to where we want to just give up sometimes and and satan likes to pull us away and and may and maybe begins to make us think nobody cares or nobody understands and you know how his thoughts begin to run rampant thoughts of unworthiness thoughts of you're never going to make it thoughts of it's too much to handle it's as a heaviness a great weight that sets on you and it seems to squeeze the life out of you and discouragement begins to set in and darkness begins to close in and it turns into depression and other things that goes with that he said but you know today he said we shouldn't be discouraged he said what we need to do is take courage what we need to be is encouraged he said trials may come we're never promised to be immune from a trial amen we're never promised to be immune from losing a loved one we're never promised from being immune from a hard day or hard time he said those things would come but every every time it comes he will give you grace to go through that trial amen if the mountain's too high to go over or too deep to go under too wide to go around it he will always give you grace to go through every trial he said so just don't worry but keep your eyes on christ for he's the one that's going to take you through it amen and he said if you notice it's when you're discouraged that's when the devil tries to really pour it on you that's when he tries to get to you is when you're discouraged and you know and then the thoughts of you're never going to make it or you're never going to overcome it or you're never going to get ahead or you're never going to get better you got to cast all of that aside he said because you know god don't want you frowning god wants you to be happy amen the human heart was to be made happy worry causes cancer and temper causes cancer he says so don't ever be upset set just walking his love knowing that while you're walking you're walking with him and while you're walking with him nothing can harm you hallelujah so that's enough to be encouraged about to know that i'm with him amen that i'm i'm not walking and leo to see it by myself i'm not in this trial by myself i'm not i'm not lost a loved one and i'm all by myself i i i'm not you know in some room but i'm with him amen he's with me he promised he would never leave me or forsake me amen and so as we look at this and i got to thinking on this and i've been reading this this passion translation i want to take a little bit because in romans 8 verse 28 it says we are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together for our good for we are his and we have been called to fulfill his design purpose for he knew all about us before we were ever born and he destined us from the beginning to share the likeness of his son this means the son is the oldest among a vast family of brothers and sisters who will become just like him and having determined our destiny ahead of time he called us to himself and transferred his perfect righteousness to everyone that he called and those who possess his perfect righteousness he has co-glorified with his son so what does all this mean if god has determined to stand with us tell me who can then ever stand against us if god has determined to stand with us tell me who can ever stand against us for god has proven his love by giving us his greatest treasure his son and since god freely offered up him as a sacrifice for us all he certainly won't withhold anything else from us as he is to give who then would dare to accuse those whom god has chosen and loved to be is god himself is the judge who has issued his final verdict over them not guilty therefore nothing can harm you there's neither powers neither things present neither thing's future neither things anything can separate you from you he you are with him you didn't come by your own will you came by his choosing you're not here because you chose to be here you're here because he chose you to be here hallelujah and if he chose you to be here what can the devil do about it if god the power of the that created the universe destiny has chosen your destiny to put you in this time that we're living in the most evil laser ever was the most difficult time there ever was he placed you in this tie he has like he has a he has a watch over you and he's concerned about you he's not just letting you off by yourself and you're out there wandering around no god has predetermined your destiny [Music] hallelujah and he said we never came in by our own will he elected us he brought us to him so it is his business to take care of what he's brought to himself hallelujah you need to tell the devil you're god's business amen you're god's business therefore he would say no man can pluck them from my hands amen is the father who takes care of it who's got more power than god so what kind of power have you got over you that will take care of you it's the power that created the universe it's the power that put the solar system in this place it's the power that pre-that put every star and every moon and every planet in this place that power is watching over you amen oh but you know god loves to test his people and we know every child that comes to god to be tested there's no exceptions every one of us will be tested you may be tested in different places than i'm tested in but we're all going to be tested amen maybe tonight you're sick maybe it's just a little child training just a little testing don't be discouraged about that god's still on the throne his power his word is still in effect hallelujah amen if you're sick tonight he's still on the throne his word is still in effect [Applause] there's nothing to be worried about god's got it he knows all things he's still in control and if you're truly born of the spirit of god everything can you say everything is working together for your good he's going to make it all come out right he promised he would he swore he would he's got to keep his word he's kept it now for thousands of years to every believer show me one believer in here he didn't keep his word to amen would you be any exception oh no we're no exception amen he kept abraham he'll keep you he kept moses he'll keep you he kept shamgar he'll keep you it doesn't matter if it's 600 philistines he'll keep you amen he kept david he'll keep you he kept daniel he'll keep you he kept the three hebrew children he'll keep you he kept peter and paul and the martyrs down through the dark ages he'll keep you he kept paul and silas he'll keep you he kept william branham he'll keep you hallelujah you're no exception so we're not to be discouraged listen this quote don't be discouraged we're living in a terrible hour don't be discouraged we're living in a terrible hour but you know there's a comma behind that a terrible hour for the unbeliever but a wonderful hour for the believer for we're nearing the end time to which we're looking for the coming of our blessed lord amen it's not a terrible hour for a believer yes it's a terrible time we're living in but it's a blessed time it's a dangerous time but it's a wonderful time it's a worry sometimes but it's a hallelujah time because just any moment he's going to return [Music] but discouragement can come it tries to knock at your door through situations that comes in your life whether it be sicknesses or lost loved ones or or trials of all kinds and all kind of things that come you know every one of us tonight can name something no doubt different we've been going through and the devil's trying to set that and push that discouragement into our life to just give up why is he trying so hard to make you give up we could say we could look at that david we know the scriptures heard many messages preached from it but exiglag when the malachites invaded you know and burnt ziglag to the ground and took the women and the captives and and and and took them all captive captivity and here david and his men comes back and you know and behold it you know the city was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were all gone and david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept and the scripture says until they had no more power to weep that's crying a bunch of buckets of tears to where you get to the where you can't even weep no more in such anxiety and such torment and such hurt and such anguish and such discouragement that a tear can't even no longer come out of your eye that's pretty discouraged amen and his wives were taken and the scripture said david was greatly distressed and the people even his own men that had stood with him through many things they began to talk about stoning him it was a great defeat one of his worst days of his life every man began to in the souls of every man was grieved but david encouraged himself in the lord his god you know here they come down to it and they're burnt with fire discouraged that's probably not a big enough word to describe the state of their morale the bible says that you know as we said they will blow out bitter tears until they simply had no more power to weep for david it was even worse he was the leader and his men were so consumed by grief that they were even talking of stoning him and here he was in distress and it might have destroyed him completely except for this one thing he encouraged himself in the lord he began to remind himself who he really was not who he was right then but who he was a son of abraham a son of god a circumcised israelite that had a promise with god that he was he had a promise that god was with him it required though resolving david's heart as a garment he had to take something else and put it on he had a decision to make will he go deeper into his depression into his distress would he worry more and allow it to make him more helpless or would he make a conscious decision i'm going to turn my eyes towards the hills which cometh my help amen so david chose encouragement not to just be encouraged but there was no one around there that could encourage him sometimes there's no words that can be given to lift somebody up we want to do our best we want to try you know say i'm praying for you and all that's wonderful and all that's nice but sometimes words are just words but david encouraged himself notice the most important thing we're here to realize david didn't encourage himself in himself it wasn't nothing in himself to be encouraged by amen but whether he turned to the scriptures he turned to what the lord said he was he turned to the lord his god you see it was not just about david this this this zig lag and all that he had lost was not just about david david had a covenant with god so his covenant with god made what david was going through god's business amen and i want you to understand we are also a people under a covenant therefore the trial you're going through is not just about you it's also about god it's also god's business you see it was not just about david it was about god so it made it god's business so after encouraging himself david was able to move on from the problem to the solution you'll never get to the solution of your problem unless you get your focus off your problem and get it on your god what god's really doing for you how god's rea everything works together for the good amen discouragement does not come from the lord it comes from our adversary the devil that's why david could encourage himself from the lord because the lord was a source of his solution not the source of his problem amen anxiety worry frightening and discouragement it begins to it begins to have indicators it's indicating we're walking by sight and not by faith yeah brother i've used these before but this is very something i always go back to because it helps you with your thinking sometimes brother brandon would bring it out and you can go look at it you can look up deep thinker you can learn we'll look up across some bridges you can look up a lot of different uh uh different tags that you can look at but he said in discernment there's multiple multiple multiple i can't even tell you how many of them in discernment he would tell him you're an awful deep thinker he said you got a weary spirit you're always worrying about things you've got no business to be worrying about you're nervous and upset and it caused you to have acid in your blood which has given you arthritis the devil did it too no we did it to ourselves amen because we refuse to be encouraged to encourage ourself in the lord we can we will continue to go on down the road of our our problems to the road of the solution amen so if we the devil wants to keep you on that road of your problems because we know you could he can keep you about because then you're walking by sight and you're seeing this and you're seeing that and you're seeing that over there look at that over there wow over there and everything and it's all you're all then next thing you're out you're discouraged you're tore down you're depressed thinking too much there's another one he said it caused you to be a nervous person you're very nervous you're always taking other people's problems oh i think that's something about the devil he ain't even concerned about you having your own problems you start taking everybody else's problems and thinking about things crossing bridges before you get to it building things that never happen hello somebody how many ever had that happen before i've had you know you can go talk to somebody and say you maybe have an issue or something and you're you got you you start going through your mind all right i'm gonna bring this out and he's gonna say that and then i'm gonna say this he better not say that if he does and i'm going to say this and then and then you go there and you go talk to them they only know what you're talking about been crossing too many bridges going down the down the road of the problem instead of the road of the solution amen when it's time we start encouraging ourself and the lord our god in these times that we're living in don't look at the problems around us and all the situations around us and all the problems and things that's going on and then sicknesses and this that and the other look at the lord your god and he said that all that developed a stomach trouble but paul would say we walk by faith and not by sight we walk by faith we put our confidence in the lord and his promises but when we walk by sight we're trusting our senses we're trusting our feelings we're trusting what we understand and we easily fall prey to all the deceptions of the world the flesh and the devil when we find ourselves in discouragement we find where we've been placed in our trust oh man the answer to this is to put your trust back in the lord so when discouragement comes you find that you've been walking by sight instead of by faith head back to the scriptures let the promises of god build your faith back god wants you to be encouraged so if he wants you to take courage he has to give you the means to be encouraged by so re first of all you got to recognize i don't have to stay here you don't have to stay where you're at mourning is just for a moment amen we don't have to stay there we don't have to stay in that moment we don't have to stand that discouragement amen we've got to look to the lord our god you can be encouraged in fact you can encourage yourself well i just need somebody to tell me something good no what you need to do is start looking at the scriptures and putting yourself there and saying that's my name in the book that's me right there that's who i am right there that's not the devil's thoughts that's not who i am the things he's putting in my mind that's not who i am you know somehow although we get this idea that when we get the holy ghost we're not going to ever have any more bad thoughts we're not going to have any more depressed thoughts we're not going to happen and you know people get that in their mind and when they start having them they got the holy ghost no what it is it comes it can't help it it's like a bird flying over it's going to come it's going to happen it's going to come i mean look look out there on our building amen the birds going to fly around they're looking for a place to nest but what keeps them from nesting blow them out of the sky whatever it takes don't dwell on it move on past it don't dwell in your pity don't dwell in your circumstances don't don't don't let it build a man a mess on the side of your house and be all muddied up and thing and manure coming down the side walls cause all the stuff you've been dwelling on get past all of that turn your eyes back on jesus look to the hills which cometh your help and remember in the middle of all of it the lord jesus christ has committed himself to take care of you in every situation that's enough right there to just go on a shout and fish i i i got to remind you all this it i i when i think about it you know i seen this uh deal one time with this little cartoon of this dorky looking sheep walking on his hind legs cartoon walking on his hind legs and he was holding the with his little clove and hooves holding the hands of jesus and over in the ditch was this whole line roaring at him that old sheep just as dorky looking as he can be and helpless looking as he can be was looking at that line and he says i'm with him that's what you need to remind the devil you're not by yourself i didn't come this far by myself i didn't get here by myself he called me here he placed me here this is his doing this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes i'm with him [Applause] when the circumstances of life pressed and on david david pressed into his benefits amen he hadn't we grabbed him a new song to sing so the song would discourage me and started singing the song of encouragement amen he was singing maybe in psalms 103 bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgive all your iniquities who healed all your diseases who redeemed your oh that's a good song to sing who redeems your life from destruction who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercy who satisfies your mouth with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagles so you got to stop giving voice to your discouragement and start giving voice to your encouragement amen stop giving voice to the sorrows and and the things that are going on and start speaking the word of god stop repeating the lies of the devil and start speaking the promises of god stop speaking out of fear and start speaking out of faith stop talking about the problems and start talking about the solution find out what the word of god has to say about your situation and he has the answer for every situation start speaking it the word of god rather than your feelings amen meditate on the lord realize it's not about you it's about him amen well i'm just so this and i'm just so that you got it all about you this is what even suicide comes from you know what you don't a normal person don't just walk out there without you know without a thought and just shoot itself on purpose but it's been months and years of thoughts things is going through the mind adding upon he's been dwelling and it turns them inward that's right it was all about me and selfishness takes over suicide spirit is nothing but a selfish spirit all is about me and my issues and my problems and what i got going on and failing to realize when you take your life how many other lives you're destroying but what happens they begin to meditate too much on themselves you know it gets really discouraging when you hear people all the time that's all they want to talk about is how bad they got it and how bad they feel and how bad it is and how bad my work's just terrible this is happening it got around about the blood sounds like a broken record same thing over and over time to get a different tune time to sing a different song amen it ain't all about you listen singing the songs of the lamb is not about you anybody who you are and what you've done or hadn't done or how bad it is for you when you sing the songs of the lamb you're singing about him and what he's done for you what he's doing for you and how he's made a way where there seemed to be no way how he can open up the red sea how you can put out the fire start singing those songs but the devil wants to put something on you that's not you he wants to place a name on you to cause you to sing his tomb this is what he did nebuchadnezzar tried to do to the daniel and the three hebrew children hananiah and michelle and azariah he gave them names that most of us even call them by their other name shadrach meshach and abednego but that wasn't their names see these four boys had hebrew names and their names had a connection amen was a connection to the faith in god but iran would talk about some hebrew mothers would give birth amen they would even call out their names and as they called out simeon and and benjamin and all the different ones it actually placed them in the promised land in their inheritance it had a meaning that's why when you have a child you need to really look at what you name them names have meanings there's things that follow names so about the shazaar is trying to change it and cut off their connection with god [Music] this is what it was shadowy try to michelle meshach from hananiah to shadrach and azerite to abednego to change the names as a way of encouraging them to forget their god and forget their homeland and begin to conform to the ways and the gods of babylon it was actually a forced assimilation nebuchadnezzar wanted daniel and his friends to conform to the pattern of this world they're living in and the name change was to step and towards that each name daniel and his friends were given carried a different meaning and it actually was associated with a babylonian deity abednego means servant of nebo belter shazar which is was given to daniel means baal protects his life when his other meaning was god is my judge [Music] michelle's which is ill in in the hananiah and azariah has the yah in it which is from short for yahweh is the covenant name of god so there was one he's wanting to take who their real identity was and put a different name on them a different song on them to where they began to sing the songs of baal and they began to sing the song of the gods of that lamb and they wanted to place that name upon them so they would begin to feel comfortable in this land and what you're and listen that's exactly what the devils want to put on you god's called you by name he's called you bride he's called you redead he's called you his son he's called you his daughter but the devil wants to put other names on you he wants to put depression and anxiety and fear and every kind of spirit of hell on you but i am not serving those gods i'm serving the one true living god hallelujah therefore my name is redeemed my name is son of god my name is the daughter of god that's who i am the devil wants to place a name on you so you can sing his song he wants to place the name of bitterness on you so you'll sing the tune of bitterness and your whole life will be bitter and out of it a song will come forth out of your life until where you're nothing but bitter and you can't even gather together with family because of bitterness you can call it what do you want to you've taken the name of another land it ain't the land you want to go to either depression to come on you you begin to give praise to it forced assimilation it'll conform you to try to conform you to his thinking his song his desires but god as we said also changes our name hallelujah amen as we read there in psalms 40 david david said i was in a horrible pit bring that back up psalms 40 and verse 1. i was in a horrible pit out of the mind he brought me up though he didn't leave me where he found me i was singing the songs of america i was singing the songs of unworthiness and bound and slavery i was in a horrible pit i was caught but god rich in mercy we heard about a sunday but god came along our path and he snatched us up out of that pit and he said i got a name for you i got a new song i want to put in your mouth it's not the song of a maori clip here it's not the song of a maori clay it's not a horrible pit that's not who you are that's not where you come from but let me give you the soul of the redeemed a song that angels can't even say you know in the u.s we have this saying he says i bet he's singing a different tune now the context is that someone has had a radical event happen in his life and because of this he acts different because of this life-altering event he can no longer sing the same song because it don't apply perhaps this new song is a way of saying i have a life changing i've had a life-changing experience with the creator of the entire universe so therefore i cannot and i will not remain the same i will sing a new song because my desires have changed oh hallelujah it was many of you used to sing the song of druckiness and alcohol and tobacco and drugs you used to have a song coming out of your mouth and your life put it out hey you can see profile pictures and things of people that's getting caught with drugs and it don't take very much to know that person's been on meth that's what there's a song coming out of their mouth they may not even be actually singing nothing but you can see it coming out of their life hey listen don't think you backslidden people out here don't don't have a song coming out you can see it very quickly you can see it when you're not seeing what you're used to seeing you're not doing what you used to do but reverse when somebody has that radical event change in their life where our watch was in a horrible pit and i was going the wrong direction but i had a radical event changed and he turned me around and he put my path on a solid rock it gave me a new song to say it gave me something else coming out from the end where like a fire shut up in my bones we've seen how god would take abram and make him abraham it was an event change in his life he was just old shepherd boy out there in the plains of mamrie god called him his wife sarah and he takes him out we know he put the h in his name which is a part of him the breath of god being placed in abraham and sarah it was a radical event change that took place was it not a 90 year old and a 100 year old man and woman had a baby that's pretty radical if you ask me it was a radical event change that took place and abraham began to sing a different song sarah began to sing a different song she was singing the song of i am barren i am not nothing i'll never be anything i'm there to god change me i'm not the same person i used to be i'm pregnant i got a baby i'm a princess with god amen jacob had a radical event change in his life his name is a planner a deceiver and that's what he did he deceived yeah it sounds like we need some message people with some name changes deceivers always got to get the best side of things no no we want jesus got a hold of something real one night down in the ditch crossing over a little creek seen a man standing there beginning to wrestle him out and he realized this is somebody different i ever had a hold of my life he began to talk to that man said look and the man said let me go he said i ain't letting you go let me go i ain't letting you go i'm not letting you go till you change me amen he hit him right there on the hollow of his tie and from that moment he walked different he acted different he talked different he wasn't the same man no more and he changed his name amen it was a it was about from a from us a planner to a prince with power with god my simeon fisherman foul mouth when he caught on with jesus jesus changed his name he said i'm not no longer going to call you simeon i'm going to call you peter little rock little stone saul had a radical event change in his life to where he meet a pillar of fire under where it changed him from no longer being who he was a murderer tormenting god's children to standing for the truth paul an apostle of jesus christ abraham just an ordinary man but one day he met god and from that time he was changed forever saying a different song he believed something he couldn't see when he met god he was changed moses a runaway servant supposed to deliver the children of israel running away he didn't know he didn't know how to do his military training wasn't doing them no good but one day he met god and he sang a different song when he was one day hiding behind bushes worried about that there's somebody coming to take his life surely egyptians are still coming after me 40 years later still hiding out one day he met the pillar of fire in a burning bush from that time his song began to change is such a thing he took his wife put her on a mule young it on her hip whiskers hanging down low 80 years old and a bald head shining a stick in his hand said glory hallelujah where are you going moses i'm going down to egypt to take over that's a different song amen he met god where was it running he was going back to take over because he had met god he'd been at that burning bush and moses was a different man peter when he met god jesus revealed to him who he was amen paul when he met god amen he was going down to arrest people for shouting and speaking in tongues oh he was going to put him in jail he had an order from the high church to do it but he met god and from that time he sung a different song he was a different man when he met god one time a dirty stinking leper laid a gate and said if thou will i'm unclean unclean unclean unclean but if that will make me clean jesus said i will do you realize what your leprosy's doing to you you may not have nothing coming out of your lips but your life is screaming singing unclean unclean unclean unclean but if you can ever get before him be modest with god lord of thy will make me clean he'll change you too he'll change in such a way the church ain't no drudgery to you no more you're happy you're ready to come to church ready to be with in the house of god praising god days ain't no drudgery no more the birds are singing different the flowers are looking different how many remembers when you had that life-changing experience things were different and a moral woman met god one time in a well five husbands living with the six he told her the secrets of her heart from that time she sang a different song she could come see a man who told me all i've done this has to be the messiah when you meet god it changes things from that time it changes things it certainly does it does it for all people there was a blind man one time but when he met jesus it changed everything even death can't remain the same it changed the tune of death when it met god when you begin to realize it's not what i've done it's what he's done this is what david had to do he said it's not who i am it's who he is he's still the same god that gave me victory over the goliath he's still the same god that gave me all these other victories god ain't changed revelations 1 6 says he hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever he hath made us he said there's a truth we need to emphasize he hath made us you need to tell the devil that tonight god made me i didn't make me god made me i didn't ask to be here god put me here he hath made me salvation of the lord is grace he redeemed us for purpose he brought us for a purpose we are king spiritual kings we're going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on the throne but now we're spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom he has made us priests priests in them offering a spiritual praise of sanctified lips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and truth interceding and petitioning priests and kings in our god no wonder the world don't appeal to us no more because we are peculiar people we don't sing the same song we're not in tune with what they're doing shouldn't be we shouldn't be in tune with their styles we shouldn't be in tune with nothing sodom has if you're in tune with what sodom has it tells you who you are because abraham was in the ten at the tent with the son of man speaking to god himself and becoming taking on flesh revealing the secrets of the heart abraham wasn't thinking about sodom and gomorrah and what it's as lavishes and what it's doing and what all that it could he could care less but lot on the other hand was singing a different tune different song he said no wonder the world don't appeal to us we're a peculiar people different different you know as we would look at the scriptures as as as moses and then would come out of the out of the out of egypt and they'd go and we know the story of how they come to the red sea and how how all that taken place don't have all the time to get into it but as they come to that they were singing a song there was a song of fear they were singing there wasn't any graves out there to we could die in egypt why did you bring us out here in the wilderness to die songs were coming out of their mouth things were taking place and the lord says what you need to do is hold your peace because i'm going to fight for you and i'm going to change your tune i'm going to put a new song in your mouth from this experience right now you're going to walk away from this with a new song hallelujah and we know how they went through there and they come on the other side and moses would stretch it out his hand on the other side and the waters return and then they looked out there and there was all dead egyptians floating on the seashore amen and they looked around it was all gone in the next scripture exodus chapter 15 then saying moses and the children of israel this song went to the lord i was singing the lord for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea the lord is my strength well that's a lot different song than what they were singing just a few moments ago on the other side of the trial if you'll just be patient with god god's going to give you a new song if you'll just be patient god will give you something that'll come out of you from the time that you're living in right now the trial that you're going through is about to produce the sweetest song of savior that's ever come to his to the eyes and the ears of our lord hallelujah the lord is my strength and my soul and he is my salvation he is my god and i'll prepare him in habitation my father's god and i'll exalt him the lord is a man of war and the lord is his name pharaoh rose chariots oh hallelujah you see what kind of song that god puts in your mouth you start singing your own song you're singing about how great your enemy is i wonder how how powerful he is how impossible it is overcome but when god puts a song in your mouth he'll tell you how defeated he is how harmless he is he can't overcome you you're going to overcome it because i am the lord and i'm going to fight for you hold your peace and i'm going to put a song in your mouth i'm going to put a victory in your heart i'm going to put something inside of you [Music] oh the lord is a man of war and the lord is his name and cancer and sugar diabetes as he throwed into the city amen and lust and pornography as he throwed into the sea and drunkenness and drugs and tobacco has it put under our feet and his chosen captains satan's chosen men are drowned as chief of the tribe of them demons is defeated and depths have covered them and they sank into the bottom as stone thy right hand o lord has become glorious in power that right hand oh lord has dashed to pieces the enemy [Applause] hallelujah do you see what the vision of the song of the lord will give you it'll see your enemy for who he really is he's nothing but a blood but the right hand o lord and calvary broke his back bone but the right hand of the lord broke every sickness broke every sin broke every doubt broke every fear and that's the peace is the enemy and the greatness of that excellent high excellency has overthrown them that rose up against sea thou sentence forth thy wrath which consumed them in stubble and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together the flood stood upright as a heap and the depth were congealed in the heart of the sea and the enemy said i will pursue and i will overtake and i will divide the spool and my lust shall be satisfied upon them and i'll draw my sword and my hand shall destroy them but thou didst blow with thy wind and the sea covered them and they sank as lead in the mighty waters oh let's sing a new song who is like unto thee oh lord among the gods who is like unto the glorious and holiness fearful in praises and doing wonders does wanders doing wonders not going to do wonders he's doing wonders i want you to understand it ain't just a day of miracles don't limit him to a day because he's not a day of miracles he's a god of miracles and if he's a god of miracles every day is a day of miracles [Applause] hallelujah that stretches out thy right hand and the earth swallowed them up thou and thy mercy has led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou has guided them in thy strength unto the holy habitation the people shall hear and be afraid the sorrows shall take hold on the inhabitants of palestinia did it not do that oh yeah that song reached all the way over there to rahab heard it said we heard what your god did it at the red sea we heard that verse we heard how he brought you through the wilderness yep we heard that verse too and we've heard how he killed you we heard how he delivered you we heard how he's going to do all these things fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of that arm they shall be still a stone until our people pass over lord to thy people passover hello did you catch that that's the song of moses it's over there in revelations 2. until thy people pass over o lord to thy people passover which thou has purchased so in other words the enemy is not going to have any power in this age until every one of us has passed over start singing that song to the devil devil you ain't got no power never you don't have no strength over me never i am redeemed and we're walking to the promised land and you will not receive one ounce of power till i pass over can i get safely on the other side and not just me not just brother joe not just brother tim not just brother ed and all of god's children kill all of god's children pass over to the other side the devil is helpless the devil is bound well glory hallelujah everyone that thou has purchased oh i am redeemed by where the price [Music] woo hallelujah and thou shalt bring them in if god is determined to stand for you who's going to stand against you god is determined to bring you in he's just a determined more or more to bring you in than was to bring you out bringing you out is only one part of the story but he's the author and the finisher [Applause] so he the start of the work is going to finish the work he who brought you out of here who brought you out of the nominational system he who brought you out of creed's indulgence of man is not gonna leave you wandering around in the wilderness and wondering what's gonna happen next going to happen next brother timothy what's next for the bride of christ i'll tell you what's next the rapture is next the body changes next the day christ coming among us is next well let's sing that song a little while and you're going to plant them in the mountain of the inheritance in the place oh lord which thou has made for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary oh lord which our hands have established the lord shall reign forever and ever the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and his horsemen into the sea and i never did see them come out and the lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel every one of them went across on dry land in the midst of the sea man that song got so powerful miriam couldn't handle it no more she grabbed your tambourine and said give me some room i need to sing about my jesus i want you to realize something mario was no longer singing slavery songs she no longer was singing i'm bound i'm defeated i'm down i'm not gonna make it i'm discouraged but she encouraged herself from the lord her god because she's seen what god had done to her enemies oh hallelujah hallelujah i want you to understand if you didn't listen to sunday go back brother tim recounting what has went on in this church in the last years it's enough to grab something and shout about it because if god did it he's doing it if god healed cancer he's still healing cancer if god brought back a particle he's still bringing back a particle oh let's sing that song they're coming home yes they're coming home and ain't nothing the devil can do about it he can put sin that deep on them he can try to cover him up with every kind of spirit of hell but when that seed is called to life you can light every devil up and they're going to come with everything they got [Applause] so let's be ready to party hallelujah he said i seen a cena grab that tambourine and begin to dance and shout and begin to speak in tongues and run down that high down that old beach he said if that ain't an old-fashioned holy ghost meeting i ain't never saw one the daughters of israel followed her doing the same thing they had overcome and a man never knows what it is to live a victorious life until he's completely overcome that's the biggest enemy you got is yourself so we're not here to encourage ourselves in ourselves let's sing some songs for a moment the lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusteth in him psalms 28 7 and i am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoices and with my song will i praise him hallelujah

lift them up forever oh my we got a bunch of them here but i'm gonna hurry through y'all just remain saying we're almost done come on we can see the song that they begin to sing in revelations 5. let's just read it my goodness it's too good to just skip through that revelations five and verse one and i saw in the right hand of him on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven no earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and i welt much because no man was found worthy listen to a song well much because there's no man worthy to open and read the book neither look their own but one of the elders said to me let's change the tune in this place we've not for behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and the loose the seven seals thereof and i'll be held and lo in the midst of the throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb who had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him and set up on the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which were the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy thou art worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us unto god by their blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us into our god kings and priests and we shall reign upon the earth and i beheld and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and number them ten thousand times ten thousand thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is a lamb that was slaying to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing i don't believe that was a quiet service how many we got in here 150 maybe let's say amen amen thousand times ten thousands and thousands of thousands it was a roar it was a change of two we found somebody where are they we found somebody that can take that sin we found somebody that can defeat that disease we found somebody that can save the lord's sinner and the most wretched person and reach down and take them out of the moderate cliff here and put them on a rock we found somebody and every creature which is in heaven and on earth and unto the earth and such are in the sea and all that are in them heard i said blessing and honor glory not under the earth such as in the sea in them are over under the earth over the earth everywhere heard out john saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sit on the throne unto the lamb forever and the fourth beast said amen and the four and twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped the lamb and liveth forever and ever quit singing the song of unworthiness and start singing the song the lamb's worthy it's not what you've done it's not what i've done it's what he's already done psalms 98 verse 1 o singing of the lord a new song for he has done marvelous things his right hand his holy arm has gotten him the victory the lord hath made known as salvation his righteousness as he openly showed inside of the heathen he hath remembered his mercy and this truth toward the house of
