invite you tonight God we invite you into this service we invite you into every heart every life every situation every home God we invite you and we do that Lord by singing praises of adoration to you tonight God may we not be guilty Lord of not praising you enough father will we not be guilty of having a church down the street out worship us father where the restored word has been given to a

room right now and just be his healer any other needs Lord may you just come on the scene for them as well we ask it in Jesus name if you have your Bibles tonight we're going to look here in Psalms 95 we're going to start here at verse one well to see e was kind of upside down if we were going to have church or not but it's good to see some of you made it ier one was about to climb back into the bed I've had an allergic reaction today and my eye my right eye was shut pretty much most of the day and so I climbed in the bed and said well I'll just sleep this thing off and then when they said there was no church I was like oh praise God I can sleep this thing off and then about 4:45 we're having church and I'm like uhoh I got to get upstairs and study so but we're prepared tonight we I want to speak to you by the grace of God on some things of the scripture we look here in Psalms 95 and verse one it says oh come let us sing unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise into the Rock of our Salvation let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving that word there means praise and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms for the Lord is a great God and a great king above all gods in his hands are the Deep places of the Earth the strength of the hills is his also the sea is his and he made it and His Hands formed the dry land oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker for he is our God and we are the people of his Pastor the Sheep of his hand then we look here in Psalms 107 and verse 31 oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men Men Let Them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and praise him in the Assembly of the elders all right one last scripture reading this evening for you you can have your seats Psalms 18 and verse two Psalms 18 and verse two the Lord is my rock and my Fortress my deliverer my God my strength in whom I will trust my Buckler and the Horn of my Sal ation and my high tower I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised God bless you you can have your seats this evening so the last time I spoke I spoke on created for worship and we discussed there how praise was alog together different than worship and tonight I want to speak to you on exhorted to praise so I don't want you to think that we're not meant to praise God but praise is actually an essential aspect of your worship because you cannot truly worship God but what you don't praise him because if your heart is full of worship and your heart is full of love and full of Thanksgiving for what God has done for you then your mouth with your mouth with your hands with your feet with your life you will begin to praise God and give him thanks for what he has done for you so we're going to speak on exhorted to praise and this word exhort here means to strongly encourage it means to to urge someone to do something to persuade through Earnest appeals and in Psalms 18 and verse3 says I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised and that word praiser means to boast about it means to act foolish over it means to Rave to celebrate to Fain self to act madly to act like a mad man all right now people want to say you can't act this way but that's what the word means in the Greek and here we find that in this day we pray so many things as I said last time we give out participation trophies because we don't want the little fat chunky kid on the bench getting his feelings hurt cuz he didn't touch the field CU he's not good enough back in my day I was that fat chunky kid I didn't get a trophy for just being on the team but you had a perform but today we praise everything in everybody you find today people will go to sporting events this past year there was an event it was one of the playoff games in the football and I think the temperatures were in the negatives and the wind chill was e even in the high negatives and fans sat out there and they screamed for three or four hours and they spent no telling how much money to get into the game and no telling how much more money to get drunk and to eat and do all this other stuff they were act like Mad Men screaming and shouting and praising their team and and rooting on their favorite player and the team didn't know where they were sitting the player didn't know where they were sitting and yet we come into the house of God on a Wednesday night on a Sunday morning and we spend two or three hours and we sing praises to our God we clap our hands we lift up our hands and we worship Our God and that they want to call us crazy because we spend a couple hours and maybe we get moved by the spirit but yet I'm here to praise a God that knows where I'm sitting I'm here to praise a God that knows that I'm in the house of God I'm in a praise of God that knows my struggles I knows my name he knows where I come from and he knows where I'm going and he's worthy to be praised tonight he and he alone is worthy to be praised and I love what the Bible says in Psalms 10731 oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness notice it ain't based on your goodness it's not based on our Merit it ain't based on how you feel how what what kind of Christian you were to today but you praise God for his goodness and his Mercy some of us need to realize you was a sinner headed for hell you got a right to praise God some of you were drunk some of you were drug addicts some of you were prostitutes or you live that kind of dirty life but yet now God turned your life around and I'm here to tell you he's worthy to be praised tonight brother says now men are always praise God for what he's done they look forward to what he's going to do and they ignore what he's doing right now let's just bring that home you know I understand we can look back and we should be able to praise God for what he's done look at eite Tabernacle look at what God has done in our church how he's delivered how he set the captive free How He restored her to Mariah puit how he healed sister Lana sister Sharon sister Ruth s Genie from cancer How He restored the failing eyes from Brother David Dexter look we we we we recognize that and we praise God for that but don't miss what he's doing tonight don't miss that he's here tonight you say what do you mean brother Joe I mean this very evening right now God is still moving some of you parents that are praying for those way were loved ones you have a right tonight you can begin to praise God before they may take the first step back into the house of God you say why brother cuz you have a promise you have a promise you can praise God you have a promise right now you some of you are sick in body you can praise God in your sickness because you have a promise that he's a Healer some of you in a very awful trial and you can praise God right now because he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I'll be with you even in you God's walking through that trial with you you should praise him some you've been tormented by your past praise him because you got a future praise him because you got a present I love what the Bible says in Revelations 5 and that's to me is probably one of my most favorite chapters in all the Bible because here we find that there was no man found worthy to take a book but this just wasn't any book this was a special book brother it was the book of the redeemed and yet there was no man found worthy and yet we find that the Lamb of God stepped out from around the throne and he took the book he didn't just take the book but he did something with the book let me tell you he took the seals off the book and he opened the book up and here John was John begin to weep cuz no man was found worthy no Pastor was found worthy no preacher was found worthy no Prophet was found worthy no pop was found worthy but a worthy lamb stepped out around the throne and he took possession the title deed he took possession of the book and what did he do he ripped the seals off of it and when he ripped the seals off John could see his name there oh come on John can you see your name in the book of the redeemed oh you may have lived a dirty life but in your at your at the very beginning your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life you have a right to praise God we're not receiving Revelation from a closed book come on Church we're not receiving Revelation from a closed book the days of probing is over all the loose sins have been tied together the seals have been torn off and now the Bible has become a new book The Lamb took it he open and he showed John who he was and I believe we have a right tonight because some of us have seen your name that you were part of the Plan of Redemption the entire time that everything God did every message he ever sent every preacher that he ever put here was for the purpose of getting you to realize your name is in this book and you say well why should I praise God because God is worthy of your praise John 4:23 brother Tim read it again this past Sunday he said but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship worship him that's what he's wanting worshippers those that are not afraid to praise God those that are not afraid to act like Mad Men oh I've seen some of you watch a football game I watched it with you so I know what you're capable of tonight don't tell me it's not my nature oh yeah when it's your team it's your nature well whose team are we on tonight it should be our nature if he's our heavenly father and we're running for him and he's done everything thing for us all we got to do is go behind him he's worthy to be praised he's worthy to be exhorted tonight to be exalted and lifted up you know the most most frequent frequently repeated command in all of the scriptures is a command to praise the Lord the command to praise the Lord cuz sometimes you got to make yourself prais cuz all you're thinking about is problems all are you thinking about is your situation all do you think about is that depression and that anxiety and that this and that sickness and that but you are being commanded to praise God recognizes you got a problem he recognizes you're sick and body he recognizes you're in a trial but he don't want you to praise your trial praise your sickness praise your trouble praise him we should praise the Lord because he created us for such so you maybe you wonder well why am I here brother Joe why am I here tonight God's got a purpose for you and that purpose is when you praise God you're fulfilling your purpose yes as I said last time Angels were created to worship God but they couldn't give God what you can give God so you can give God a praise sacrifice offering from a voluntary worship you're not manufactured or made to do it but you're you're a free moral agent and it comes out of you so we find here that the Bible tells us when you praise the Lord it brings his presence close to us it brings his glory down in Psalms 22 and verse3 if you turn there we're going to look at this just for this evening Psalms 22 and verse3 says but Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabits the Praises of Israel so God inhabits the Praises of Israel God inhabits the praise of evening light Tabernacle well I just don't feel like praising God tonight God inhabits your praise come on some of you can tell your little depression story over and over and over and over and over till people are sick of it but what about praising the god the creator of heavens and earth tonight he inhabit your praise and that word inhabit mean he comes to to abide there he comes to dwell he draws nigh when you begin to lift up his name when you begin to lift up his goodness when you begin to thank him for his healing when you begin to thank him for his Deliverance when you begin to thank him for that wavered son when you begin to thank him for that wavered husband he draws now on the scene church he had have the praise of his people you can have the worst day of your life and I'm sure some of us have had it today but you go to praising God the atmosphere all of a sudden changes if I could just get you to enter in tonight the atmosphere and even the light of change go to praise him for watching over your life go to praise him for watching over that seed that predestinated Seed where he put this one with that one and that one with that one and it went through this war and this famine and this sickness and all that and brought you to where you are today go to praising God before putting food on your table today go to praising God from turning your heart from unbelief to believing go to praising God for what for taking you out of a life of sin for sending you a message for healing your body for filling you with the Holy Ghost for giving you a good church to attend for giving you a pastor in a faithful Ministry we got a right to praise God you say brother can't find anything to praise God about if you turn your eyes from the negative and start worshiping the positive and start thanking God for what he's done for you you got all kind of reasons to praise [Applause] him let me get a little bit more volume up here it's not working on my part if you don't mind see praise him instead of finding reasons not to praise God let's see why we should praise God and when you find those reasons to praise him and go to praising him he draws nigh yes that means when you begin to talk about God when you begin to extol him and lift up his name and give him the honor that he deserves he comes he comes and the atmosphere changes brother Timothy I believe you told me a testimony today of how you begin to talk about God and a young man had his moment brother Timothy LED this young man to the Lord this weekend in a moment because the name ofes Jesus was being lifted up he was being elevated and the young man gave his heart to God so we find if you'll just extol God for who he is he'll come on the scene he draws n he draws close to you that'll begin to praise him he comes to where he's invited is that okay he comes where he's invited you begin to talk about God he will show up brother B tells us in when their eyes were open they knew him he said they were talking about him when he appeared this is speaking of Copus and his friend on the road to d uh Damascus not Damascus wherever they were going to M us they were they were walking thank God we got Vehicles today Long Walk yeah he said notice now that's a good thing we notice here in the scripture and while they talked of him while they spoke of the things going along talking about him said when they found out he appeared when when he appeared he appeared unto them while they were going along reasoning reasoning about him that's when he always appears when we talk about him always through the scripture it's when the people talk about God that's when he appears he says Bo but we're too busy talking about other things uhoh he says think he goes I think that's the reason many people who love him fail to see him many people who love him failed to see him we're so busy with our Creeds and our denominations and the business about the churches and memberships getting more members and things we're too busy to talk about him he's the word we're too interested in some Creed some textbook something else how many members can we get both them in shall we take this one that one the other one he says we should constantly be giving ourselves to the word and God In Prayer but we're too busy talking about all this frivilous stuff that doesn't make a difference and I wonder yeah I got a little feedback up here I wonder today if we're not too busy arguing about doctrinal points in the message that we can't give God praise worried about who's right who's not right worried about if we can have emotion if we shouldn't have emotion wondered about if we can speak in tongues and we can't speak in tongues if we can have a moveing of the spirit if we can't have a moving of the spirit I wonder we got so caught up in all that that we forget to give him praise he's not worried about if you got a motion if you don't have a motion because if you don't you're dead but that's beside the point if you want to speak in tongues or don't speak in tongues if you if you want to run around the church don't run around God just want your praise he said well brother Jo I don't know if it's in my nature I don't know if I can do that I don't know if it's right or not I tell you what put all that other stuff aside and you just go to praising God you go to thanking God for what he's done for you you go to thanking God for what he's going to do for you you go to thanking God he'll draw not you may speak in another tongue he'll draw not you may run around the church he'll come close to you and you may be an interpretation it may do whatever God wants to do you just worship Him you just give him praise you just exalt his name and you let the Holy Ghost do the rest that's right quit trying to figure it all out and put God in some box he don't belong in a message box he belongs on our lips on our hands and our feet in a worship of adoration and praise notice brother the scripture tells us that cleopas and his friend they were down in their Spirits they had a bad day brother Aaron and we find here then he said this is in Luke 24 verse 25 he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets has spoken what not Christ have suffer these things and to enter into his his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures the things concerning of himself brother B says these people were sad they were talking a great thing had happened and he would have been taken away but they were talking about him and there he appeared so let's get our minds off of what this church is doing and what this brother's doing and what this one's doing and just put our focus on him every church is Sovereign in itself we're not worried about how they're run you don't need to go seek some uh guidance from some other Pastor you got a pastor you don't need to be worrying about all that you got a church home right here support the church have confidence in the ministry have confidence in your pastor have confidence in the shepherd this do I need to grab a handheld Welly we were having trouble we didn't want church and we did want church and now the mic is messing up and my voice is struggling but somebody's going to praise him anyway can we just set all that aside and just praise him tonight Hallelujah but notice they were sad but when they begin to talk about God and you may be sad today you may have had a hard day but let's just worship him let's just set it all aside and give God praise and all of a sudden things begin to change and the word came personally in flesh and begin to expound the scriptures from the beginning to the end he be to reveal to them who he was and the Bible says that he would have went straight on from them but something they constrained them oh Hallelujah they begin to constrain the word to come the day was Far spent let me tell you even like Tabernacle we're at the end time there ain't much time left and the daylight is CL it's falling the end is coming and there's going to be a people in the land that'll constrain him oh come inside and abide with me Lord you revealed to me who I was you showed me who you were in the scriptures I want to praise you tonight he said when they got to the place where they were going on he acted like he was going to go by oh you know that's the way he acts a lot of times you think he's going to pass you right by he ain't don't worry he's not going to pass you by so he just act like he was going to go by and some of you may tonight he may be acting like well it's just another service it's just a Wednesday night it's just brother Joe well if that's all you see you're not gonna get much out of it but if you can realize it's him and he's got a message for you tonight he's exhorting you to praise Him notice brother B said when their eyes were open he said now he makes out like he's going to go by them but they constrained him to come in they persuaded him so they had to do something it wasn't just a oh praise God oh Hallelujah I don't even know if Jesus knows what that means they constrained him they Earth Day the church come on Church they did it stay with us coming by come to the service tonight comeing to my family tonight come into my marriage tonight come into my home tonight comeing into the church tonight come into our young people Lord we can strain you tonight come inside and abide with us and notice when he did he begin to do something that he's always done before he begin to break the bread just like he's always done and their eyes were open and brother Brown said they didn't run back to the back back to wh they come from to argue their theology they weren worried about theology at that point their eyes become open they realize he is risen oh they begin to praise the Risen lamb church that's what it's about it ain't running back to your church or running back to this meeting and that meeting and arguing this point and that point it's running back and saying he is risen oh he's alive today he's in the bride he's in the body he's in the churches that's who he is and he deserves your worship and he deserves your praise that's what we need to be doing is saying Lord we want you we want you to have first place the Bible says he's a jealous God he's a jealous God and God wants first place the unwelcome Christ some of you people this is a direct quote this don't apply to you that's here it's applying to those that are not here so we just straighten that out some of you people only go to church once a year well if it hurts I didn't say it he did but you can change it he says oh my it's Easter morning you put on your most Charming garments something about Easter man you got them Easter gowns or whatever y'all call them maybe it's not a gown it's your Easter lies and Easter this and Easter that he says you put your most Charming garments on your beautiful hat and you go down to church and you sit 20 minutes and then you come back and you say well that settles it he says does Jesus accept it amen he accepts it he will take your 20 minutes once once a year of worship and praise he will accept it that's the gracious God that he is he says any place you'll give him he will accept it he'll never rebuke you for for it he will give you exactly what you give him he goes we have other things that we think are too important my brother my sister the most important thing in your life is to entertain Jesus Christ you believe that the most important thing in your life young people the most important thing is not what job you're going to get not who you're going to marry I know some of you young girls already got that all planned out but that's not the most important thing the most important thing in your life young or old is to entertain Jesus Christ he says I believe the most important thing in any life is to entertain Jesus Christ properly in first place in your worship all right even light that applies to us first place in your worship first place in your life first place in Everything Jesus Christ deserves that place amen I believe it with all my heart but we find many people today are still chasing the gold rush you know they're chasing that dollar they're chasing that that dream of being you know super rich or whatever it may be and you know you know I was out there in California and brother Johnny he's my interpreter and he said you know brother Joe he said the Gold Rush was out here and he goes there's the problem is that people are still seeking after him they're seeking these high-paying jobs and it keeps them out of church and you know they get some kind of name and some kind of title some kind of career and it keeps them out of the house of God and they putting these things before the house of God or before church are before the Lord and you find people put their hurts before the Lord well so so hurt me but what did Jesus do you taking your hurts out on him but you see serving God is not in their schedule until until there's an emergency until look this ain't no Band-Aid clinic this ain't an ER this is a house of worship we should come every day every time the doors are open open you should be able to worship God in your car worship God in your closet worship God in your home you should be able to praise God no matter where you are on the job off the job in Walmart you should be able to act like a mad man and ain't none of y'all looking mad tonight but we we are to entertain Jesus Christ and I wonder can the Bride Can his bride give him the entertainment tainment that he deserves that he desires the word entertain means to give attention or consideration to it means to hold the attention of pleasantly and agreeably so Jesus comes where he's invited let's look here in Luke 7 and verse 36 Luke 7:36 says one of one of the Pharisee desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and he sat down to meet and we understand this is Simon and Simon brother Brown tells us that he was he was ashamed of him and brother B says in the unwelcome Christ you asked him to come to your church sometimes and he will fall in an oldfashioned way and you're ashamed to let loose and let him have his way I think this applies to many message churches yes I think it applies to many of us as Believers we invite him to our church sometime and will fall in an oldfashioned way and you're ashamed to let loose and let him have his way you quench him away you invite them to your home and then you're ashamed of them before your neighbors let them set there unentertained Jesus wants to be worshiped he wants to be entertained how do you entertain Jesus say come Lord come into my heart I love you Lord entertain him he goes look if someone would come in your house and you didn't entertain aain them they wouldn't come many times some of you wonder why nobody ever comes to your house well first of all you don't ever invite them but just think brother Aaron if I invited you to my house and I didn't Entertain You and I sat you over in the corner and I just looked at you and looked away and we're cooking the meal and you're smelling and you're hungry and I just looked away I didn't offer you anything you probably wouldn't come many times cuz I know you like e you're a foodie and that food smelling good cuz my wife's a good cook cooking that Indian chicken butter or butter chicken or whatever it is man smelling good with some some nice non bread I know I got your salava glands going right now and you just got to look at it you can sit there watch me and my family eat oh then night time comes and we're getting ready for bed and you're still sitting there nobody's acknowledged you nobody's made you welcome nobody offered you water nobody offered you a Diet Coke nobody offered you anything you wouldn't come back to my house if you would you're stupid and some sometimes I wonder if that's what we do to the Lord we invite him to our service and we set him over in a corner and we want somebody else to recognize him before we do we want somebody else to start the worship service before we do we want somebody to lift their hands in Praise before we'll get behind it and say you know what it's all right tonight the atmosphere set tonight well how about you be that one tonight how about you be that one we invited him to even andite Tabernacle he showed up because he comes where he's invited now why don't you worship him why don't you exalt him in worship and praise entertain Jesus it shouldn't be a work up we shouldn't have to work you up you should be already worked up for what he's done for you and what he's doing for you he said you're afraid somebody will hear you say Amen oh my goodness that's why I do this I'm afraid El hear me say Amen listen what your Prophet says you're ashamed because your neighbor sitting there or somebody else what do you care about your neighbor Worship the Lord you invited him you invited him then worship him when he comes oh did we invite him tonight or was it just me brother Aon some of some of y'all that have responded did we as a collective body as a church invite him tonight he said no brother Joe we thought service was going to be closed the power was out about an hour ago well the power's here and the power Giver is here and he wants your worship he wants your praise he ain't worried about what it was two hours ago he's here now with we have invited him into this service and let God come and change the atmosphere he'll draw nigh to you brother B says he's sitting in the Pharisees house God walked in wo is Simon could realize who walked in he said God walked in the door oh come on even like Tabernacle this ain't Tim puit church this ain't Timothy puis Church this ain't Aaron Oglesby Church Jo Adam's church or your church it's his church and I'm going tell you he walked through the door tonight because he said we're two or three of be gathered in my name I'll be there he's walked through the door can't we worship Him can't we entertain him can't we make him welcome [Applause] tonight God walked through the door and nobody paid any attention to them they were too big busy passing notes too busy and giggling tell you some of you young girls y'all need to cut that out I see it service after service passing notes and just chatting in each other's ear and giggling you need to focus on him you need to focus on him this ain't no time to be passing notes and chitchatting in the middle of a service focus on him if you want to say something say Amen you want to say something else say hallelujah if you just can't keep your mouth shut say praise our God God ay matter of fact look I'll give you permission to stand up and throw your hands up and do it but just give God praise tonight recognize he's in the building recognize you invited him here and I'm not trying to be ugly I'm just trying to be corrective right now you he deserves your worship this ain't no playground this ain't no time for none of that nonsense this is the time to worship God and let him draw nigh to and let him take care of the situations in our lives for says we failed to entertain Jesus after we invited him to our place many times you're too busy at home in your home life you got to so many things you got to do you can't take time to pray you're too busy he goes oh I wish I could have been that footwash flunky there at the door have any of you ever listened to the unwelcome Christ go back and re re relisten to it prophet of God begins to break down because his Jesus was invited and he's pushed to a corner and it happens in a lot of message churches but may it never happened in this church he goes I know he was coming he goes brother B says if I know he was coming I would have had a pan of water already waiting and but before I washed his feet I would have said Lord I'm not worried to worship you after I wash your feet so let me worship you first see that's what he wants he wants your worship he wants your praise and we find there he is he's sitting there unwelcome the unwelcome Christ the anointed one the one that was going to pay the penalty of all their sins the one that was in a few days he was going to take the piercing in his hands the piercing in his feet he was going to die the death that you should have died and that I should have died and there was a footwash funky that didn't recognize who it was there was Simon the Pharisee the religious leader invited him to his house and he didn't make him welcome but what about it evening night Tabernacle what about it Sons and Daughters of God will you make him welcome tonight will you invite him into your house tonight and give him praise he sits there unwelcome saying over in the corner nobody paying any attention to him Pharisee was too busy with his doctor fin he didn't notice Jesus sitting over there in the corner his head bowed down and I wonder if we're just too busy what we got to do back home special projects honeydew lists maybe too busy with our jobs and everything that needs to be done tomorrow and next week maybe we're too busy dwelling on our past failures too many too busy dwelling on hurt and who hurt me and this that and the other to make him welcome too busy meditating on why I'm not worthy enough absolutely you're not but it doesn't matter your worth it was worth enough for him you was worth enough for him to leave all of all of Glory to come down and pay the sacrifice wonder if we're too busy arguing about church differences then to wash his feet look church he wants his feet washed he wants to kiss a welcome and he wants to be Anointed with praise and here he is he's sitting over there in a corner for they hell nobody nobody paying any attention to him he's so uncomfortable you think that's the way that he'd be here tonight if he come this is from your Propet direct quote you think that's the way that he is in your home uncomfortable sitting there with dirty feet think of a Jesus with dirty feet they call him Jesus When I Think Jesus with dirty feet he goes that does something to me to say Jesus my Lord sitting in a religious house with dirty feet unwelcome parching cheeks unwelcome not kiss welcome the very feet that was going to be pierced with the nails was sitting there dirty with dung from the road and sweat all over his feet and he smelled in this great fine home with his head bowed unwelcome nobody washed his feet brother saids I wish I could have been there I wish that I could have been there don't you you I wish I could have been standing there oh I would have run to him and he says how do this flunky let him get by same way sometimes we do you're too preoccupied with you to recognize that the Lord God walked through the door you're too occupied with what you think and what you got to do to realize who walked through the door and he's walked through the door to be entertained cuz you invited him you invited him you invited him you say brother Joe if I would have been there I would have made Jesus welcome brother Joe if I'd have been there I would have washed his feet i' would have been the best foot washing he had ever got I would have anointed him I would have gave him a kiss of welcome but let me tell you what you are here tonight what you are in this service would have been exactly your response that day if you can't anoint him with praise tonight you would have never anointed his head with praise in if you can't give him a kiss of Welcome in the house of God tonight you would have never gave him a kiss of welcome there if you can't if you can't Cry tears of repentance and wash his feet you wouldn't have cried tears of repentance there and washed his feet so what you are here tonight as a worshipper you would have been there as a worshipper there he is Jesus sitting unwelcome dirty feet all he wants is praise all he wants is to be worshiped and here the Simon the Pharisee and all these other ones didn't recognize who was in their midst oh but there's one the Bible says there was one that recognized who was there there was one the Bible reads like this it said and behold a woman in a city which was was a sinner notice when she knew that Jesus sat at meeting the Pharisees house she brought an alabaster box of ointment this word woman of the city means she was a sinner means she was a harlot she was Notorious public prostitute but yet something struck her she knew she shouldn't have been there she came to the service and she looked in and she saw Jesus sitting over there an Evite Tabernacle with dirty feet unwashed unwelcome but something moved in her heart she knew she was a prostitute she knew she had a past but something struck her heart brother a and she said I gotta get to Jesus I gotta make him welcome he's at one oh I don't know what I'm going to do but I'm going to worship him I got to get to his [Applause] feet her heart was moved to make him welcome she looked back in the corner brother B says and there he sat he says oh think of it he's invited and he's not made welcome she said if I could just get to him I'll ask him to forgive me for my sins I'll asked him to forgive me for my wrong for the life I've lived and I wonder what about us he's here we've invited he's not welcome in many churches but can we make him welcome in evening like Tabernacle he's not welcome in many homes but can we make him welcome in our home he alone is deserving of Our Praise notice so brother bam tells a story you need to go listen to it and I'm just going to dramatize that and here she looks in and she sees him and just begins to well up flood of emotion this one they call the Messiah this one that's already delivered a prostitute wrote In The Sand pardon go and S no more she knew if I can get to him he can pardon me if I can get to him maybe he'll say the same thing I'll ask for my forgiveness and her heart begin to turn begins to beat and says she begin to run brother she begin to leave she left the Pharisees house she begin to run down the street and brother brand begins to say she pulled out of her stock in there a little bag of money and she said I I I can't do this he'll know how I made this money let me tell you he knows already he knows your past he knows what you're going through he knows the things you've done today he knows but all he wants is your worship all he wants is your praise and she begins to say oh I can't do this and she be to reason with it and she put it back down and a voice spoke to her this may be your only opportunity this may be your last opportunity to worship Him you may never get another opportunity oh she took it out and she ran to the perfume shop and she threw it on the counter and she said oh I want the best B box you got don't give me something else I want the the very best that you got this is a special occasion let me tell you every church service is a special occasion when you come into the house of God give God your best sit there sleeping on God give God your best give God your best maybe many times you thought to give him some worship maybe you thought to give him some praise but somebody somebody criticized you and now you're afraid to let go now you're afraid to let God have his way we're not here praising critics no we're here praising our King maybe you're here tonight and in your thoughts in your mind is well you know I'm not good enough I don't want to cause a seen in church and you know I can't do this he knows what I've done he knows my past he knows my mistakes he knows you know what kind of life I've lived but if you could just be like her I just got to get to them regardless of what he knows this may be your last opportunity this is your opportunity tonight we invited him to this service down the street she goes she drops into the perfume shops I want the best you got I want I don't want some ordinary Alabaster Box uh she goes but I want the very best you got it's for a special occasion man if we could bring our best every Wednesday man if we can bring our
