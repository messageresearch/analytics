underneath your feet you know because it got underneath the house and you could actually feel the end of the house where you're in trying to lift but when they put those houses in they anchor them in the ground [Music] and no matter how strong the storm was and the things that got tore up those anchors held us and I'm thinking you know we're talking about a trailer house man what about the anchor of Jesus Christ in our life today you know the storms come and then they blow and and sometimes you feel like man we're just fixing to blow away but I promise you The Anchor Holds and if you're not

don't recognize you yet perhaps before you who recognized as a king of the earth Satan will reign for a little while but Lord You're the coming King and we're preparing our hearts today to receive you your kingdom is already built within our hearts we have received of your spirit Lord and we thank you for your grace Lord thank you for the mighty works that you're doing Among Us but what you promise that you would do Lord oh God as we look toward the end and we know Lord you that have become this race will finish it the battle that you started out the battle that began in the heavens when Lucifer was thrown out Lord it will end it'll end with the casting out of sleep The Binding of him for a thousand years hallucinate loosen and then the final destruction of all of our enemies one day we'll look down into the pit as we see him fall we'll see this one this worm this Destroyer this awful one that has caused so much grief and heartache we see him just forever come to an end Lord for us there's no ending for us there's an eternity ahead Lord we look away from this temporary life with his afflictions with his troubles with his trials with the troubles that are going on in this world we look away from that through the eternities from which we come and we know we're being drawn back to where we come from so Lord let us be like the little dude drop that comes down in the Stillness of the night maybe it don't even know where it came from or how it got there but it's there in the darkness it came but when the sun rose and signed upon it it glistened and shined and shouts because it knows it's being drawn back to where it come from and we know Lord there's a drawing of the holy spirit in our lives today this drawing us back to where we come from and like the psalmist said Lord as the dear that heart patents for the water Brook so thirstus are sold for thee o God oh it's the noise of the water spouts the Deep calling into the deep Lord thank you that there's something in us to respond I pray Lord that every soul today will be touched in your presence and changed let your Holy Spirit just reign in our midst I pray for the anointing of the spirit to strike the word Lord today Lord almost like upon us here scattered thoughts little fragments here and things we picked up there oh God almost like loose ends that will need to be tied into one message and it'll take the Holy Spirit to do it and I just prayed today that you will anoint me by the Holy Ghost to be able to rightly divide the word of Truth to lay it out perfectly where we can see the day in the hour that we're living Lord I pray you'll bless your people those around the world those that are listening in joining us by the way of internet that I hear it even in the week to come for months ahead may you touch their hearts today or you could change them in your presence may you ripen the mostest son would come upon the grain pick all the greenness and maturity out put in there Lord the full matured word of God today we know the plantings almost over we've come to the end of the teaching brain Lord we're here in the Harvest cycle I pray that you'll just move by your spirit now Quicken the words that we speak and may they become spirit in life because that they are Spirit moved and because the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost comes upon the mechanics to make the word live let it live in our hearts we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord today thank you amen we so appreciated the wonderful songs of Zion today and the rejoicing of the Lord and the good things that he has done and and continues to do and our midst and we're looking to him to minister to us today and I want to say as I'm going into the subject that I'm going into today it's um it's it's going to be a little bit um of teaching that we will go into and that um I want to kind of drop back because we've been preaching a little bit evangelistically and Gathering some of these thoughts and now I want to just kind of lay in some things of the word so that we can then build upon them in the weeks to come as God will lead us and um but this is for your edification for your knowledge for your understanding that you can solidly know where we're at in this hour because it's very important to know what God's doing right now you know hindsight as we say is always 20 20 and and yet on the other hand we have a lot of the world today that looks back and they can't see what God has done they cannot see his works and and the manifold Glory of what he's been doing uh and they they don't recognize the spirit of God haven't moved through a message in this last day they have not seen the end time message even though they look back they cannot see it but we can look it back and we can see it but today when we're looking at things we're we're wanting to see clearly now where we're at in this time I think this is very important to to understand so we're going to be speaking today on Sarah and the latter Reigns of our scripture we're going to start with Genesis chapter 18. and we're going to look at verse 10. now remember we're using the types in the Bible to to that are shadows that um Can portray what is coming so if you'll look at these types A type is um a shadow if I could demonstrate a shadow which I came properly here right now but if you look at a shadow you can never see all quite all the details you can't see the um you cannot see of my the shadow of my hand you can't you can see there are five fingers you can see one is the thumb of those fingers and you can identify different parts but you can't see the fingerprints you can't see um the color you can't there's a lot of things there that are in the um in the true positive that cannot be seen in the negative so but however you can get an idea of what is approaching by looking back and seeing the shadow so we're going to be looking here again at Genesis I'm just reading one verse verse 10 and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him something very important I want you to understand here is the son of man Christ in Angelic form standing there Discerning the hearts of Sarah in the tent behind him this is the last sign that will be shown but it's not the last appearing because he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life so here he was there manifesting to sign the son of man he would be bringing a message and we'll go into that in a little bit about that and and but then he says but I'm going to return according to time of life so there is every even though that this is a manifestation of God that there is a return promise turn with me to Joel chapter 2 verse 23 these are what Peter will refer to on the day of Pentecost which actually will cover the last two thousand years and again be very important for our day so again this is a prophecy of our day and and it speaks naturally of Israel being restored and it speaks spiritually of the Bride which is the Royal seat of Abraham who will be restored so be glad then you children of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for you have given you the former Reign moderately and he shall cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil so now let's look at that verse 23 one more time before uh while I want to get some thoughts to you right here to point out in this scripture that he gives you the former Reign and the a lot of rain in the first month so here will be an unusual time because normally the former and latter rain don't come in the first month or the same month but here he said in this outpouring I'm going to give you the former and the latter rain together in the first month now then will you turn with me to Luke chapter 21 verse 29 and I want to point out some things here and this also and he spoke to them a parable a parable again is a type it is a shadow it is a something that he's telling to represent something that is going to happen so he uses figuratively and he says look or behold the victory but he don't stop there and all the trees somebody say that with me all the trees so now we're not just going to have the victory restored but we're going to have all the trees now watch when they now shoot forth you see and know of your own selves that summer is nigh at hand Harvest time is coming and so likewise when you see these things come to pass know you that the kingdom of God is not hand verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled God bless you you can have your seats we're going to now um just as I as a set I'm going to lay some things out in a very um you know trying to uh slowly and methodically teach some of this we probably will not stick with teaching as we go along but and and maybe some of this will be somewhat more Evangelistic but um it'll be toward the end as I try to establish some things today that is that I have been studying and it's been on my heart but it's something that I feel like the church should know as to where we are in time and what to expect where we are now now we know that as the victory Israel is firmly planted in her promise slam and she's blossoming and what is interesting though that in this same time frame of Israel's founding as a nation the angel of God is appearing to brother Branham the prophet of God and promising the rest the soon return of Jesus Christ and the and that starting with the gifts of Divine Healing that he was now pouring out his Spirit making things ready for his coming so what's now things are happening simultaneously as Israel becomes a nation the angel of God is appearing to a prophet and then notice then as he as we say in the same time frame in 1940 in the 1940s the World Council of churches is formed as it does the United Nations so now you have things that are going on Israel becoming United becoming in their Homeland a move that starts to to gather the bride the elect for the last day it also begins with an angel coming to uh to a prophet and then we have the Nations unit 19 forming in politics a United Nation moving toward a One World Government and then we have the churches you're 19 coming together in EC communism now um even and I I want to just say something about that just for a moment because just because you do not yet see maybe a big move in the world Council of churches or National Council or that The ecumenical spirit is already went through the land Gathering many of these and brother Brandon would tell us that you know that Satan has the mechanics together and it's only waiting for the Dynamics to come upon the mechanics Satan's mechanics so he's already got things in place to bring about the the persecution which the bride will not be a part of because there's a Rapture before the tribulation but will come upon the world and so they're just waiting for Satan with the Dynamics now let me just explain that for a moment when when the bride goes up Satan is cast down so you know simultaneously the casting out of Satan is the going up of the Bride so you are a part of the Ascension and Satan of course will fall it'll be like the Bible said I saw a star fall from Heaven so again we're living in a time where it's just about over the last member of the Bride is being called I believe that as the message goes out into the world and when the last member of the Bride that comes in the Rapture takes place and as she goes up Satan is cast down you find out in Revelation chapter 12 which we won't look at it but anyway we we can see that um there has been some things put in place the mechanics put in place for the Dynamics to come now you see as we we are saying here that um the the fig tree has made its has made its um uh put out its leaves and all the other trees are doing it at the same time and this was this has been the planting rain or the former rain where seeds were planted for Unity a United Israel United Churches United Nations and a bride United with the word and ultimately with Christ with the median in the air now brother Branham tells us in the message look he said when you see the Fig Tree and all the other trees putting forth her buds Israel returning as a nation they are a nation we see other trees the methodists have put forth put there's forth the Baptists having theirs the Catholics having theirs all the rest of them having theirs the Pentecostals to Oral Roberts having theirs and all the rest of them having their revivals putting forth this Branch then know that the time is at hand this generation shall not pass until all these things be fulfilled now I I will admit you know down through time we have been in a hurry to see things finished and we you know there's been many have that have declared well you know Israel his inner Homeland so Generations about 40 years and and so is surely 40 years into 48 and will make 88 and by that time by you know that that this generation be passed away and and I want to just make it clear to you that people have thought that because that the United Nations recognized Israel being in her place and and what that this that this generation will not pass away but I want you to understand it is not when Israel is recognized by the world as a nation you see as I said United Nations recognized her in 1948 but when it but it's when God recognizes Israel as a nation and that's when the gospel returned to the Jews when they received their two prophets who brings them back to the original atonement now I know they're making plans of another Temple and they're going to have the articles of sacrifice and breeding over a red heifer area all of this hype and hysteria over that you know I I just say this the blood of bulls and goats will never take away sin so you see what will happen is is the two witnesses will not return them to the Mosaic or Arabic priesthood but they will return them back to the Messiah that they crucified 2 000 years ago because he is the original atonement and they will receive of his blood his spirit and when they do they are sealed in 144 000 of them under their two prophets now that's when God recognizes Israel and that generation will not pass away until all be fulfilled but first we we got to understand types when we are going into this I want to talk about types just for a moment we have been preaching on Sarah and Abraham and we've been typing and foreshadowing the end time but the type can be used in more than one way and and still be a true type understand that it can be typed in a in several different ways for example you know their brother Bradham types the bride as an espouse virgin she's engaged and she's going to a wedding in the sky and uh then there's other times he speaks of her is already married uh the wife and already married to Christ so you say well which one of these are right well they're both right it depends on how you're typing it in in that instance but what you don't want to do is mix the types because if you mix the types you'll have the bride as an espoused woman already pregnant going to the wedding so you got all the picture confused and clouded so you keep your types running in a straight line otherwise you get the whole picture distorted so that's what we want to try to do today as we look at this because brother Branham would actually use the former and latter rain as to type different things and if you're a student of the message and I'm going to just give you a a couple of sermons that you can go back and listen to one is uh of course the spoken words Original Seed it's together it's about a six six and a half hour sermon to go through where brother Branham is trying to tell us why he has done what he's done and why that where things are at that moment in time and and that he explains his ministry and what it has been for and then then there's others that he spoke on like in the Holy Ghost series that he mentions things and also in the in the sermon who is this in 1959 and and so if you want to listen to some of this also following that is another sermon former and latter rain where brother Madam is speaking about the former and the latter rain now he is he is looking at this as um the Reigns let's talk about them for a moment the Reigns prophesied of in Joel 2 and a Peter on the day of Pentecost it identifies the spirit falling as the promised rain so when we look at foreign latter rain we know it's the spirit moving it's the spirit watering something is the spirit doing something to accomplish a certain goal to bring a certain the church to a certain growth or to bring it to harvest as in the latter rain so now in the anointing what's it in time he said that rain dropping down from the natural upon the natural vegetation of the earth is a type of the spiritual Reign which gives eternal life dropping down upon the church for we call it we call it the former rain and the latter rain and it's a rain the pouring of God's spirit upon his church church so now we know then what rain is it's the pouring out of God's spirit but it's to produce a certain thing former rain is for purpose latter rain is for another purpose now of course God promised in his word a time of restoration and in one sense or application of the type the farmer Reign that fell on the day of Pentecost would come again as a laddering upon the end time people thus the book of Acts was the former reign of 2000 years ago and the continuation of the book of Acts in our day is the lattering that's one use of the type now remember we're talking about different uses of the same type the latter range so we can look at it like that now so the latter rain of course would be a double portion as it would be the same Reign or portion of the spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost so we know that the end time age is promised to be a latter rain for she is a continuation of the former Reign that happens in the same season or the same 2000 years of God dealing with the Gentiles so now but let's type it another way call Jose and I don't want to confuse you with these types but I I want you to get because when brother Madam uses them he'll use them in different manners depending on how he's bringing his sermons or the points he's trying to make and so brother random looks back to the 2000 years ago and he sees the ministry of Jesus now he sees the ministry of Jesus like the farmer ring and then the ministry of the Apostles at Pentecost was the latter rain so that once again in the same month or season both Reigns would fall but I want to remind you that that first age is the alpha age and we are the Omega age and they are the same what was in the alphas and in the omegas so we would know them that the last age mirrors the first age as the alpha is the Omega so we are to have the former Reign or the ministry of Christ and the latter rain the ministry of the Apostles in the last age so notice this both the minister of Christ and the ministry of the Apostles in the same age this is the age we're living in now what happened there two thousand years ago of the ministry of Jesus it was followed by the ministry of Jesus in the form of the Holy Ghost and the apostles and in a sense again as we look at the type that both are the former and latter rains if you look back 2 000 years ago they had two Reigns Peter on the day of Pentecost said that you know this is the pouring out of God's spirit this is that it was the latter ring coming after the former rain had come Jesus had come with the teaching Reign and and we're in the former Reign and showed the great signs and wonders and then he continues on and they have a lot of rain on the day of Pentecost so two thousand years ago they had former latter rain and again I want to get back to your memory here remember it's the alpha is the Omega so what they had back there we have again in this last days the minister of Christ and the ministry Apostle in the same age in the same time in the same season or as the Bible said in the first month now so in this last day the former and latter rain fall together and the ministry of Christ the the son of man and a prophet performing the sign of Messiah Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart it showed that the full word was coming into manifestation and this would be on the former Reign followed by the same son of man the same Christ but now in Bride form like the apostles had in their latter Rain Jesus was a former ain't the apostles was the latter ring now we looked and we can see brother Branham was the repeat of the ministry of Christ the former Reign and I want to show you this morning that he places himself as the farmer Reign but there is a bride that he introduces who are the people of the latter ring now at first when we in 1959 brother Branham is still believing at this point he believes that the Azusa movement is the grain he believes they were the seed he believes that they were what had fell at the day of Pentecost um and and even though it was imperfect and he said had a lot of fungus on the grain that he believed that day indeed was the grain but later he would say but you know it's like Matthew 24 24 so close it wanted to see the very left if it were possible and he realizes that he has misunderstood he has seen a shock that is look like the grain but it is not the grain but indeed it's just another stage of the wheat plant it's a move of God it's a work of the Holy Spirit but it's not what happened at Pentecost 2000 years ago it indeed is a shock not the seed now of course he realizes this because he looks at and says well look what they've done they organize what they have and when it organizes the life leaves just like other movements have done since the Catholic church so it's been a cycle of Revival and deaths it could not be the Original Seed hey because it organized did Susan Movement we want to get this did Susan movement was not the grain it was the shock or the husk that the grain will come out of but the Zeus of Pentecost so resembles the grain what the true church is supposed to be with signs and wonders and genuine tongues and gifts of the Spirit and the acts of the Holy Ghost that that brother Branham thinks at this time that they are the original grain now if you haven't got it figured out yet the message came to brother Branham in a progressive manner he was not God he was not infinite knowing all things and upon up to the opening of The Seven Seals he views the azusa's Pentecostal movement as the Grain and the spirit fallen on it as a promised ladder range so he even calls that which happened in 1906 the latter rains and it was commonly thought of all of them at that time this is the lottery and in one sense it was a lot of rain because you know it was the move of the spirit for the last day the farmer ain't being in the book of Acts and the latter ring coming in the last of laodicea and age but notice it will not be till after the seals that he realizes that although the Azusa Pentecost are part of the wheat plant they are not the grain but the shocking and they are the last stage of the wheat plant before the grain comes now if we don't understand that we better go try and be Pentecostals because then we think they're the seed but when you realize they're not the seed but the shock but they look so close to being like the seed that's what that's what I say a lot to a lot of these message churches today when's the last time you look like Azusa Street think about when is the last time that you had the movement of the spirit and genuine tongues and genuine gifts of the Spirit of genuine healings and genuine miracles it's so much that you look so much like the book of Acts the prophet thought she was right now you know again again in most in most cases as we bring it right down I I want you to understand the Church of this last day will be a book of Acts church that's what she is now the spirit moves on them and set a real way upon the 1906 movement it was a real move of the spirit but it was moved in such a real way it would deceive the elect if it was possible and and um you know so they are thought to be the grain and the spirit that was fallen on them was thought to be the latter rain now as we look at this then we want to understand if they were not the latter rain then when is the latter ain't coming random tells us what it was given for he said the same life was in the tassel made the ear it was a Lutheran Church that made the Wesley church it was a Wesley church that made Pentecost but Pentecost what is it it is a restoration of the same kind of grain that went in the ground at the beginning bringing back all the fullness of the power of Pentecost by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the last days so he looked there at Azusa Street and said this Instagram I see here the signs of it I see a baptism of the spirit I see the fullness of power I see the holy ghost moving upon them this has got to be the grave but I see there's a lot of fungus on it there's something ain't quite right about it but it's still the grain and in the message who is this brother Branham again is he is declaring what is happening and I want you to watch as he ties the latter rain and the former Reign together the ministry of Christ and the ministry the apostles together because it's just beautiful how he brings it together and uh in this message who is this of he says a few years ago the Holy Ghost went forth upon the people Believers and it caused him to shout and to praise God and separate themselves from the things of the world and and come out and be a separated people now all of that is what the grain will be a people that are separated people a people who shout who believe God the Holy Ghost was poured out upon them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied and did Miracles and signs and he says it was a latter rain falling now notice he is still thinking this is a latter rain he's still looking this is the Grain and this is a lot of rain and he says now but you notice he didn't just leave it like that but he said the former rain will come with the latter rain and did you notice what the first rain was was his own rain the reign of Jesus after that come the reign of the Apostles and in this last days both the reign of the Apostles and the reign of the Lord Jesus and he said that's what makes limits in the name of the Lord and the world asks who is it but the Saints cry Hosanna to him that cometh in the name of the Lord It's the Holy Ghost the spirit of God poured out upon the church in the last day to show signs and wonders the church knows it that born of the spirit watch how he did it the latter ain't come and then the former rain will come with the latter rain to confirm the latter ring was true and the people said to Peter them people are crazy and they went out they're out of their mind well they're a bunch of Fanatics and that's the same thing they said about him that were mixed in their opinion they didn't know what to do but they knew something was happening but watch they called him when he came in the form of rain they said he was behold of a devil how many times have you heard the people say that you that they speak in tongues is of the devil haven't you heard it them peoples crazy it is up their hands shake and speak in tongues and Shout they just don't understand it that's all scriptures are fulfilled this great Gus that is coming now is only getting ready for the church ready for him when he'll come riding on a white horse they'll be assembled together in one Accord in one place and then will come the Lord Jesus so I want you to see the prophet's expectation of what the latter rain produces and even though that he's using the type of the latter rain here and he's applying it to the Azusa Revival and later he'll recognize oh that was only the shock and that was not the latter rain what is important to note is that he is saying that both the ministry of Christ and the ministry of the Apostles will repeat with both the former and latter rain falling together in the last age the last age will have the ministry of Christ and the ministry of Christ in the people in a bride are you with me the apostles all in the same last age now we know already that that brother Branham was that Forerunner we already know he introduced that Christ we already know he had the ministry of Jesus Christ and he brought the word amen but we know also then if he again brought the ministry of Christ then there also has to be a display of the ministry of Christ in bride's form in the last age now Joel 2 23 remember they're falling together he'll cause he was given you the former aim moderately he'll cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month so it's important to note that the effects of the spirit which makes brother Branham think this is a lot of rain they are described as this he calls them to shout praise God separate themselves from sin be a separated people come out of the world and the Holy Ghost poured out upon them they spoke with tongues they prophesied and done Miracles and signs it was the lettering this is what he expected the lettering to be now notice the farmer Reign the ministry of Christ which is the ministry of the son of man the word comes back with the latter rain in the same age to unite with it to prove that the latter rain is true now any ads that'll take a born-again church to believe that so again he said the holy spirit is coming to the church to give signs and discernment I want you I want you to stop for a moment you know things get real common to us we we look and we we hear Brother Branham as brother Timothy Soul wonderfully brought out a lot of the discernment and things like that and we hear Brother Branham you know and God is using him in a very specific way to discern the thoughts and the intents of the hearts to call out people's names and tell their address and where they come from and whatever do you know this was a repeat of the ministry of Jesus Christ I want you to understand it's Unique to your day as it was unique to Christ's day look There Was Elijah there was Moses there was Jeremiah there was Daniel none of them had that Ministry they were not listened they were not the word they didn't know all things but Jesus wants the word and he knew all things so it goes to show you when the word comes again in this day to show you the presence of the word amen it'll discern the thoughts and intents of Hearts like it did Sarah in the tent behind him don't let this become common to you I mean we get used to it and we think that that's just the way things are no we were seeing the ministry of Jesus Christ we were seeing the word identified by the sign that this is a message Hallelujah that this is the message do you realize in the Leo to see an age that he makes us have known as deity out the amen it's God putting an amen on a message that this is the final word this is not another message coming this is the final message to the final age and I want you to know we don't need to look for another no age to age no eighth messenger nothing Beyond this this is Christ in his fullness revealing himself in his word now so as we look at it that he as he said the holy spirit is coming to church to give the signs discernment why do we know this right because it's the same spirit with the same action with the same signs with the same wonders with the same power and the same all that that was in the early churches in this church discernment of spirit prophecy tongues interpretation Divine healing powers and then he said why it'll take a born-again church to believe that that's all I'm saying let me just repeat what he said it'll take a born-again church to believe that now in the sermon who is this brother Branham is showing again that his his ministry is the farmer rain and remember it was the ministry of Christ repeating It Was preparing the way for Christ to come in bright form in a book of Acts Church now in the message who is this the Pharisees said who is he look look let's just take it from the context of Matthew 21 19. Matthew 21 19 and the multitude that went before that followed Christ saying Hosanna to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord Hosanna to the highest and when he was coming to Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this now brother Branham in his sermon is answering who this is what is all this noise about you know what it's it's kind of a parallel sermon to the sermon in 65 but what is the attraction on the mountain you see they knew he was he said this question today when you see him come and stand in the meeting the Holy Spirit give a person enough Faith to speak to another and hear and tell them exactly all about his life what could do that whatever did do it never did until Jesus came and never has been since then what is it the former Reign coming into the latter rain now get an understanding not only not only did Jeremiah and Ezekiel and all of them never have that same Ministry of Jesus that would stand there to at the woman of the well and said you know you've had five and the one that you're living with not your husband and and tell her all about her life are you with me I mean not Not only was it Peter you know he he said to your your your your peter or your name is Simon you're the son of Jonas but I'm going to call you Peter you know I've never had there been another it had never happened before when when you were praying on the victory I saw you never had this ministry even though they had been great Ministries let me tell you we have had great man like Paul ireneus Martin Colombo Luther Wesley all the way down to this last age and never have we seen until this age the ministry of Christ repeat again why did he do that to identified the word was present not that brother Branham was the word but he was bringing the word back again there's a restoration of the word now so he says and the people called you crazy the people that's called you crazy sometimes you just had to hold on with teeth and toenails as we called it trying to hold on what you knew is right I think that that kind of describes where we've been hanging on with teeth and toenails remember because you're trying to hold on what you knew is right now the holy he said now the Holy Ghost has come right back around and confirmed with the former Reign into the lattering to prove it was his move and they're both falling together I wish you could see that the great move of God that started back 40 years ago back Yonder when the latter rain began to fall the former rain the former power that started with Jesus Christ has come into this church and proven he is the same Jesus Christ and then again in this prayer he says we know that Jesus is on his road and we're beginning to Congress Aid ourselves to the gate the Gate of the power of God those who believe in God those who are born of his Spirit those who have the Holy Ghost they know that the Holy Ghost is the spirit of God and he's the same yesterday today and forever and he cannot change his nature and when God comes into people it makes them believe for the impossible it produces the same kind of fruits that the former rain produced because it is the former rain mixed with the latter rain and the world cries out who is this so he's identified now who this is and what has taken place and and so he said he's the same Jesus that was back there two thousand years ago in the former Reign when a woman touched His Garment the form of rain was falling now as he finishes this sermon he affirms again that this unique Ministry like Jesus had that has not been seen in a continuous Ministry since the days of Christ that it is the former reign and with it will come the latter rain that we're not just going to just have the former rain and not have a ladder ring to follow foreign so he he is Discerning now and he said here's two men sitting right here and looking at me right back to that one looking sideways he was sympathizing with the prayer line the other was looking up like that with his eyes closed praying your prostate trouble has ceased sir you that raised your hand just stand just because you believe put your hands on the man next to you the elderly man there he has a sinus trouble that's bothering him that's right sir that's right raise your hand and go home both of you and be well from your trouble in the name of Jesus Christ and he said what is it it's the former rain coming into the Pentecostal move is the latter rain being poured out together in the last day God said he would do it in the same month some would you see the prophet's expectation that with the former rain there has to also be a ladder rain now again the former Reign is Discerning the thoughts and intents of heart it's showing the presence of the word but it is making the way and we'll get into it a minute it is planting the seed for a harvest to come now so again that you know he goes into it he says he said how do you do I'm a stranger to you not to him but not to him we both know him because you're a Christian sister if I could help you and wouldn't do it I'd be evil but I cannot do no more than surrender myself to the will of God and let him speak what he says you have an allergy a spasmodic intestinal colon the doctor said that's right that's your trouble you believe with all your heart if you thou cans believe all things are possible Miss Andrews that's right you're from Oakland now go home it's finished Jesus Christ makes you well could I do that no certainly I could not it's the spirit of God and that's the reason the world says who is this it's the devil and that's what they said about him he's Beelzebub he's a fortune teller and let me tell you that's what the world still says about this message that brother Brandon was just a fortune teller or he was you know so operating some some will say it was a real spirit of God but he just didn't know how to teach and others will say well no it wasn't the spirit of God it was the devil upon him that's why he got off the word and they don't recognize who it is because they're exactly like they were 2 000 years ago some saying he's a fortune teller some saying he's you know that he's a beelze bomb that's chief of the Devils but then there's others saying No this is a Christ Hallelujah this is the word this is a message I happen to be speaking to some people this morning that no this is the message amen and we are saying Hosanna the Lord is coming the holy spirit is bearing record of his coming by putting the former Reign into the latter rain that we believe so he goes on in these in these things and talks in about it you know and and I I'm not going to go through all of them but he he deals within this again and Mary's belief Be not Afraid and after and several ones as he does but then here comes the book and the book is opened before the book is open he's probing not the book like everybody else but why but when if the seven Thunders revealing the Seven Seals to brother Branham that's the voice of God reveal them to Seven Seals if that you know if if that didn't happen to brother Branham he was not the seventh angel in order to be the seventh angel of Revelation 10 7 he had to hear the voice of God revealing the seals the Mysteries that are contained in the book and by you being able to receive it shows that you are the people of the book just like Israel being able to recognize their place in the Homeland the people of the book had returned to the land of the book and the same thing has happened in our day you the people of the book that was prophesied in the Bible Hallelujah have returned to the land of the book [Applause] and now every promise in this book is your promise Hallelujah don't matter he's a miracle science wonders gifts amen the Mysteries revealed whatever it is it's all your promise it's your land and it's for your taking [Applause] now but when the seals are open brother Branham has a different Viewpoint of azusa's treat because now he sees them as a move of God yes as a part of the wheat plant yes but not the grain but a shock and they're not the long-awaited restoration that has been promised so we already know already oh this is the street is not the latter rain no more than they are the original grain now they of course believe they are which is why they call themselves Pentecostals because they believe they are the Pentecostals restored but I'm looking at you today and I'm saying no you are the true Pentecostals restored I'm looking out this morning at a book of Acts Church now so again he realizes they're not to see but the shock and that they cannot I want to get this they cannot carry the restored word forward to the rapture no more than you can go pick a bunch of shots and harvest them it's the grain that is harvested but they cannot carry it onto the Rapture but rather they will reject it and the seed will not be Heir together with the shock now yet he saw that the Great Commission had to be finished and I want to drill this in for a moment the Great Commission brother Brandon would tell us right to the end of his ministry that that the apostolic age is not ceased and that the Great Commission is in effect amen and it has to be finished now it was 1965 in November and brother Brandon is about to leave like I told you I read a book on John F uh no Abraham Lincoln by O'Reilly and and he would he would take the last 10 days of Lincoln's life and the man that was to live nine more days done this and this and thus made me think of brother Branham what was God trying to impart to us in some of those last messages before he would call his Prophet home and and he here in 1965 in November he preaches a sermon and he said I'm doing this this is out of the ordinary for me but brother Jack has some you know always gave me an open pulpit and said preach what you want and I'm really going to take my Liberty and I'm going to preach to my church today the people that believe my message and he preaches a sermon the invisible Union of the Bride and he said here he was as he says the Great Commission had not been finished and he says it can't be done and let me just say it could not be done until the original Gospel of Jesus that Paul and the apostles preached was restored you know again when you you have the gospel The Gospel According to the Baptist The Gospel According to the Pentecostals The Gospel According to the Methodist but we had to come back to the original gospel to be restored in order to finish up the Great Commission because a Baptist gospel is not going to do it a Pentecostal gospel is another it'll take the original gospel to be preached again and restored to the church in order to fulfill the Great Commission and that couldn't happen until a prophet messenger came because the word the Lord never comes to theologians the word the Lord comes to prophet it is not a reformer it had to be a prophet and to be a prophet he had to be a seer and as a Seer he could see what was in the word by divine revelation rather than seeking it out in the theology it's his theology out in a in in a seminary now so he saw he he was emphatic now I want to go this for a moment in Mark 13 10 the gospel must be first published among all nations published also means to preach to be taught to preach in verse in Mark 16 verse 15 here's the Great Commission and this is what has to be finished look at your neighbor and say this has to be finished all right and he said unto them Mark 16 15. go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature brother Brandon is insistent in his men in his ministry he said it's never been done they have not yet been able to do it we are here in a day an hour where it's being done understand the Bible tells us at the end time that travel and knowledge shall be increased and travel will be vastly increased right now my voice is going to cross the world that in real time they're hearing it over in South Africa that hearing it over and back have in dark Africa they're hearing it in Asia they're hearing it around the world in other states throughout the United States and in you know why how come well it is where you know rather than me getting on a boat and and taking a six-month journey to China right now it's so vastly increase my image my voice is going across the Airways of the world come on Amen and the gospel is being preached around the world so the end can come it could not happen until this day and God would even make sure this message got caught on magnetic tape amen so it could be available to the whole world come on church because God is determined that the Great Commission be fulfilled and I want to read you the Great Commission and he that believeth and baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs at these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they will cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this is the Great Commission the gospel priests with power with demonstration not just a theology passed along not to recorded it in this way in Matthew 24 14 this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come how many wants the end to come we're living here understand you in your own way are Supernatural people things that was science fiction 75 years ago now our reality Dick Tracy with his watch with his you know all the other stuff I I never followed him but nevertheless you know with all the you know the science fiction we are now living it we Advanced into time and God has brought this about allowing knowledge to increase so this gospel could go into all the world so the end could come now let me just tell you it'll reach every predestinated seed that's the important thing it ain't it ain't that every person in the world will hear it but every predestinated seed will hear it so brother Branham says an invisible Union we know that the modern Church in his present condition its present States state is in no condition to finish up the Great Commission that God gave the church forth this day so God has given for the church and this day the job of finishing the Great Commission and he said the church can't do it now he said the reason he said he said we're Oneness with twoness with threeness with this that or the other we fight what is this one is that one is the other every one of them are afraid to face the word right down to the test so he further states that there has only been reformers to the last the past six ages until the seventh Age and and that Revelation 10 said it would change for in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins the sound the mystery of God would be finished and it would take a prophet to finish the mystery not a reform her but a prophet to bring true restoration in the sermon invisible union he asks the question how many how many of the demand denominations or how could the denominations finish it up that Great Commission the life it left the stock is now in the grain God let them die he said so he can open his seven seal mystery to the undenominational bride why did we have to be an undenominational bride because denominations set up their their fences and they set up that book of Creeds and they put a period to it and you can't go beyond it so it would have to be taught whatever the headquarters say that's why we answered at no headquarters amen our headquarters into Inglorious it's not in Jeffersonville it's not in Tucson it's not in Cloverdale it's not in Happy Valley which ain't Happy Valley no more it's unhappy Valley because they've left become Word of Life but it's not there that's not our headquarters our headquarters are in heaven and it had to be given to an undenominational bride and he said because how could a denomination accept the open and the Seven Seals when the mystery truce of the Bible like serpent seed is contrary to their dogmas and their articles of faith you know they'd rather believe that a magic apple is what a evade and she got it from a talking snake they'd rather believe some fiction story come on amen you but but the truths of the Bible that we have received have been restored is contrary to what is taught in their Halls of learning that's why God could not send a trained theologian you people say well brother Brandon was uneducated and he he wasn't um he wasn't a theologian praise God if he was a theologian we'd still be in the mess we were like the other 40 000 denominations out there that have formed on different views of forty thousand different theologians but God sent a prophet and he confirmed it with signs following with the ministry of Christ that we could see that God was saying Amen to the word that was being brought so that you would know what is the truth because how else will you you would spend a whole lifetime going through forty thousand different denominations to discern which one was right and God Did It For You by vindicating a message so that you would be without a doubt No Doubt this is God Only God can do this and if God knows my heart if God knows my name and God knows where I come from then God can take a prophet all the way back to the back part of his mind and show Who You Are and what is promise for this age so that's why God would sin not a chain theologian it had to be revealed also to a bright elect to people outside of denominations because denominations would not receive the word therefore they could not take it to the world can you depend on the Baptist Church to take baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and one God to the world can you depend on the trinitarian Assemblies of God to do that then who's going to do it who's going to take the truth that have been restored listen I want to get something clear to you these are not new truths what we believe is not some Mormon doctrine that we had to write in another Bible to be able to work it in what we received in this day was the Gospel that Paul preached that Jesus preached that Peter preached restored again and Vindicated by the holy ghost that this is the original word [Applause] they can never take it to the world and the Great Commission has to be fulfilled the gospel had to be restored the Gospel of Jesus Christ that Paul preached The Taking of the of the Gospel though is not in word only that's only half of it it must also have the anointing let's go back and look at the original gospel as Jesus priesthood Matthew 4 and verse 23 and Jesus went all went about all Galilee featuring in their synagogues preaching and the the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manners of sickness and all manner of diseases among the people notice he preached and healed notice this all men of sickness all men are diseases so Jesus ministry was not it did not just come with a theology it came with power this was the original gospel verse 24 it says in his Fame went throughout all Syria and they brought into him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments and those that were possessed with devils and those that were lunatic and those that had the palsy and he healed them this is the gospel this is the Great Commission to preach this gospel Matthew chapter 9 verse 20 to 33 and Jesus went about all the cities and Villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and ever disease among the people and John would wonder if he's truly the Messiah are you truly the one while he's in jail his old Eagle Eye got filled over filmed over in Matthew 9 35 and Jesus went about all the cities of then the villages and teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel healing every sickness and disease among the people and then and then the Bible said that you know he said go tell John he tells he said go tell John listen the sick is healed amen devils are cast out the poor has the gospel preached to them come on Church this is why he said you know this is the gospel being preached notice in Mark chapter 1 and verse 27 he they were amazed in so much that they questioned Among Us themselves saying what is this what new doctrine is this for with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits and they do obey him wow his Doctrine had power with it it wasn't just a cold Creed a powerless gospel come on somebody hey man some people are sometimes afraid to uh come into the Youth Camp because they hear Devils get cast out you better you better believe they get cast out but that ought not be something strange amen that shouldn't be something that shocks people oh there's Devil's can't stop there we may not want to go to that meeting because we don't know about the strains that's the gospel Hallelujah that's why I say the principal's job of the church ought to be casting out Devils when people are saved devils are cast out mind isn't Changed by psychology or by some teaching that they can form Devils or Castile and their nature is changed when people are healed devils are cast out when cancers leave devils are cast out that's the job of the church Matthew 27 28 we're talking about the gospel we're talking about the gospel the Great Commission the Great Commission and it came to pass when Jesus ended these Saiyans and people were astonished at his Doctrine oh wow he he really boy he's really deep ain't he he he man he's he I I don't know I'm a little more confused than I ever was you know I that's so deep it's over my head for he taught them as one who had Authority and not as describes who just read quotes first 32 of Luke 4. and they were astonished at his Doctrine for his word was with power go back to the Great Commission verse 15 of chapter 16 of Mark he said unto them going all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved that he that believeth not shall be down and these signs shall follow them that believe oh brother Tim we're not a seek sign he didn't say we would seek signs he said they would follow us and if there's real Believers Sun's going to follow real Believers now let me explain something just so that you don't get everything out you know a skewed or messed up brother Branham has asked the question by Florence shakarian brother Branham I fast and I pray and I fast and I pray and I still can't cast out devils he says sister you wasn't called to cast out Devils you were called to fast and pray While others cast out devils then he answers a question in question the answer 64. will every believer do this or is it among Believers he said I like that it's among Believers no ever believer doesn't do this but it's among believers so if we are real Church that's gonna be among believers maybe you never will have the gift of speaking in tongues you may never speak in tongues in all your life some people never do but I'll tell you the prophet of God said if you lay under the altar of God long enough sooner or later you will some of you just hadn't laid on the altar of God long enough if you did you would amen well it's not to sign the Holy Ghost no but it's one of the signs of the Holy Ghost is one of the signs that follows and believers they will speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it'll not hurt them I'll tell you you need that scripture more than ever every time you take a appeal or even an herb or a vitamin you're taking some kind of poison into your body come on somebody and you're gonna you're gonna need a lot of faith to go with what you're swallowing down that's why I say you know oh you you take treatment for cancer that's fine that's no problem with that the Bible said we took something deadly it wouldn't hurt us pray over every dose of it amen now you see they shall take up servants they drink any deadly thing it'll not hurt them they lay hands on the sick so every time Jesus commissioned and sent them out even before the Holy Ghost came in Luke chapter 9 and 6 and they departed and went into towns preaching the gospel and healing everywhere Luke chapter 10 verse 19 behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you Paul said in first Thessalonians 1 and 5 for Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance Romans 5 15 19 by the power of signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of God so from Jerusalem all the way around to uh ill there would come I I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ so to fully Proclaim or preach the gospel of Christ it has to be not in word only but through Mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit I'm trying to get you to understand there's a bride in this last day that has a commission to fulfill don't be satisfied with just being a bench warmer and a denominational church member that's why that's why sometimes we encourage you just get enough steam to let it out to whistle at least you got some steam some people have been dead for years they only come to this church as an observer they're not a participator they're Baxley at dying right on the pew oh I know you don't like me to preach that way but that's your problem you're dead you need a filling of the Holy Ghost you need the power of Christ to come in your life and charge you give me a passion give you a drive on the inside of you amen give you something that responds to the Gospel of Jesus Christ I found Hallelujah First Corinthians 4 and 20 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power oh second Corinthians three and six who had made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so we are ministers of the spirit not Ministers of the letter I just read it to you when we have letter only you kill the spirit you see Satan wants to get in the church and make it all mechanics and no Dynamics are all Dynamics and no mechanics that's what he wants to do with your life make you just one or the other a bird with one Wings can't get off the ground it takes spirit and Truth amen now so to fulfill the Great Commission cannot be with word only well brother Tim we got the message we got the theology we got the original Doctrine hallelujah amen we do but yet the gospel must be taught and preached and yet is not truly preached until it's demonstrated amen Mark 16 verse 20 and they went forth after receiving the Great Commission they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following hello somebody said well we don't need the word confirmed anymore it's already been confirmed every time the word is preached it has to be confirmed that this is the word and that happens with Souls being saved come on amen with Devils being cast out the sick healed the dead raised the blind eyes open everything else that the Bible says so now by the time of the Seven Seals brother Branham realizes what he saw in Azusa movement though it looked like the latter rain was not the latter rain and what he saw there that looked like the grain was not the grain and then he tells us in the resume of the ages he said this age started just around the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to be in the bride she was at Pentecost and we know we know there must of a necessity Bill return of dynamic power and so to be the bride she was at Pentecost there has to be of necessity a return of the dynamic power the Believers since this in their Spirit begin to cry and out for God for a new outporn us as it was in the first century back 2000 years ago and what seemed to be the answer oh they thought this was it came as many began to speak with tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit and it was then believed that this was indeed a long-awaited restoration and it was not for it but the latter ring could come only after the former Reign which is the spring or cheating rain so it couldn't be the latter rain because he said the lattering is a harvest rain and how could this be the real thing the latter rain when the teaching Ray did not come before he says the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to Pentecostal fathers had not come thus what was thought to be the restoration and final quickening to the Rapture had not come and then in it was a mixture of unrighteous particular spiritual blessings and then to prove it wasn't really said for this for the Next Generation they organized so this proved it was not the grain now what a disappointment what a disappointment but then what a what a revelation the latter rain had not come because before the lattering could come there had to come first the teaching reign and only after the teaching went forth could the latter rain come so the latter rain follows the message of Malachi 4. and can only come after our hearts are turned back to the faith or the original doctrines of the apostolic fathers and once returned to the gospel dim the Great Commission has to be finished not with just teach him but with signs following and God going with him confirming the words the commission cannot be fulfilled with just having correct Doctrine a correct theology taught it can only be fulfilled it can only be fulfilled when signs follow the Believers notice Let me just read a couple of these after a short and Powerful demonstration of this spirit this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus this is the age in which the true church would return to be in the bride she was at Pentecost we know there must have necessity be returned to Dynamic power the original church with the power at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims is his own all else's fault Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts it is also a fact that the prophet of the last age must be bringing forth a message from God therefore run the second coming of the Lord for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers and with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of the power what the church had in Pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost so the Azusa movement although a movement of God was just more of a Reformation the restoration can only come through a prophet restoring the word Amos 3 and 7. let's put that up remember this is a Cornerstone scripture to understand surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secrets to his servants and Prophets never theologians never Halls of learning never your favorite Bible College amen the only place that he reveals a secret is to his servants the prophets that's why the last messenger had to be a prophet Revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so all the prophets have declared it comes today that the mysteries of God would be finished you see actually Abraham and Sarah were prophesying of it Isaac would also and Rebecca would prophesy on their time Jacob would prophesy we could just go down to the Bible whether it be that of Enoch or Noah or any of the prophets were prophesying of this last name so now notice here you see but all of them were saying there's come a time where the mystery of God would be finished right now Abraham would say it's only in types and shadows boys but one day the Real's coming now so he said I want you to notice carefully here God has promised at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled it has to be for it is a spirit quickened word of God spoken by the prophet Malachi Jesus referred to it it is just before Christ comes the second time by the time Jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled I want you to get that down under your fifth rib by the time Jesus comes every scripture speaking of a bride has to be fulfilled whether it be extra whether it be Rebecca whether it be Mary Magdalene whether it be the book of Acts come on somebody every prophecy come on you got to start looking at the Bible it's speaking of you it's not just our history it's talking about you [Applause] Abraham was the prophecy Sarah was the prophecy you're the Fulfillment Esther was a prophecy but you are here at such a time as this Hallelujah to go before the king Esther realize who you are you're the queen you're not going to be rejected go boldly before the throne of grace Hallelujah go before the king Esther you're the queen realize who you are you are here for such a time as this [Applause] he's going to hold out the scepter he's going to welcome you into his presence you're not going to be rejected you're not going to be thrown out and condemned to die come boldly before the throne of grace you know who is this Melchizedek he's the high priest approach him so you see brother Bradham talks about all scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile dispensation will be in this last Church age when that messenger of Malachi comes he will be right with the word he will take the whole Bible from Genesis to revelation he will start at the serpent seed that's all the way in Genesis and carry on to the messenger in the latter rain he will be rejected by the denominations notice he says how could he how could the Azusa Revival be the latter rain and final quickening to the Rapture when the teaching Reign did not come the prophet messenger he was sent to teach the people and turn their hearts back to the Pentecost of fathers had not yet come so you you can see he was the Forerunner and he said the second Forerunner will sow the second Forerunner of Christ will sow for the latter Ray all the teaching he's doing is sowing seeds so when the latter ring comes it brings him to harvest so brother Brandon preaches a six-hour sermon I promise not to do that today but I may preach a third of it but he preaches a six-hour sermon on the spoken words of Original Seed and explains where he stood and he says what my mission is to the world and he said my mission I believe that God has called me before I have some personal things today because that's what I told you I would do and tell the world my mission I believe to the world is what to forerun the coming word the coming word which is Christ and in him in Christ in him has a millennium and everything right there because he is the word but I want you to understand the word the coming word would not just be theology but it would be Christ in bright form look back two thousand years ago Christ came in the groom form and he wants to work so in the last days Christ comes in Bride form who is the where amen the message ain't books and tape folks the messages of people they are the word made flesh they are the ones who prophesy again after eating the prophecy eating the book we've had the coming of the seventh angel we've had his message you're not going to like this some people are but brother Branham came to forerun you're coming he come to forerun you prepare the way for you for Christ to come in Bride form listen to me in spoken words for Original Seed as the end time prophecies will repeat I believe as the first Forerunner came from the Wilderness in Christ Behold the Lamb of God the second form of Honor will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word-born bride so the first one pointed out the groom said Behold the Lamb of God come on and he turns and and the lastful runner will do the same the first Forerunner did but this time he will point to a word born bride a bride who's been born of the word so he for run your coming he was prophesying there's a bride coming after me it's Christ but it's in bright form don't look for him in nail scars don't want to come for him walking down the shore to see a Galilee don't look for him in that manner come on here's what you want to see you want to see Christ is the mystery of God revealed that all that God was he born in Christ and all Christ was he pours into a church and that the church now is the mystery of Christ revealed why in the world did God do everything he's ever done to get a bride why did he make a world why did he make the heavens why did he come to Earth everything he's ever done is because of you [Applause] and he predestinated you would be here at this time to fulfill all prophecy as we stand in the water the word coming to the Prophet come on somebody and the spirit of God coming down as we declare it to cometh us to fulfill all prophecy a people who the bride who the word and the spirit rest in oh well that clock's too busy listen brother Brandon would preach the six-hour sermon the spoken words of Original Seed if you'll go back and listen to it and just take it paragraph by paragraph and listen just pour over it for a moment he's preaching that the Original Seed was Jesus Christ he's the word so the spoken word is the Original Seed and Christ came in order to be the original seed that every other seed would come through and he said there he came he was a seed he had the moisture the spirit within him he was both spirit and word and there at Calvary he poured out his life or his Spirit in order to give life to the word to ever spoken word of God has to come to life by the reign of God you talk about that Jesus was the original word John 1 and 1. so he was the original seed and from him came the spirit or the word to uh or or the world the excuse me came the spirit or the water to germinate every predestinated word of God and he said when he when Eve sinned it caused every one of you to be born illegitimate we look around sometimes that bastard child ain't gonna make it Rapture well you're the bastard child you were everyone born in sin shaping and iniquity came in the world in an illegitimate manner you were born to die every person born in this world will die if they were born of the sexual birth but Jesus came to breed out that high breeding that Eve did and give you a new birth and this time you're not born another human you are born a son or daughter of God amen and to be born of the water and the Spirit come on now both sight you like you should have been at the beginning [Applause] Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost did that I've done your natural birth and you're not a hyper drunch you're not a bunch that's gonna die you cannot die because you're at the Original Seed Hallelujah and there that Original Seed the spoken word God spoke a seed into existence Jesus Christ so out of him would come to life to water every other seed of God to birth you like you should have been born in the beginning so now when you're born again you are not born of corruptable seed but of the word of God that liveth and abideth forever you are the spoken word you are the original seed now that's why the word had to be planted now brother Branham tells us if we want the true church then he says you have to start with the word of God you want the light for God you got to start with the word of God you accept the word in his fullness every measurement that's the fullness of God in you then the rain that's falling will produce what's in your garden this is what the word had to be planted first in order to bring forth a word bride who is the original seed and understand so the word had to be planted first so the mystery truths had to be restored first now in other words the had to come a planting of the word before and and that would go forth in the former red there in the in the form of rain it comes there and it comes as as truths it comes as the word Vindicated but notice then it is only whatever's been planted is what's going to come up in the latter rain is what's going to manifest now so if you want the word then you gotta if you want a word bribe you got to start with the word that's why if you started with Pentecostalism if you started with baptism you're only going to get whatever you planted that's why the word had to be restored because if all we had was a Pentecostal word we were just in the latter rain get more Pentecostal children everybody plant the word that there's a word coming forth that'll be just like the Original Seed which is Jesus Christ now you only get what you plan to you can't plant you can't plant wheat and expect cucumbers the word must be planted because you can only give a harvest of the word if you plant the word if you hydrate it it's death that's why we do not want to mix denominationalism with the message that's why we don't walk are you with me we don't want psychology preached to fix our problems because that's all denomination has is the thinking of man of how to change the mind of man to how to reform a man this is not a Reformation this is a transformation and when you go and you mix the Creeds of man and the methods and denominationalism with the message of hybrid it and it'll never bring forth the original Crop that's why you can have all your sessions you want to of teaching men how to behave themselves sexually it ain't gonna do any good you've got to have a nature change but God's predestinated a bride a people they will have the mind of Christ in other words they will think like him they will agree with the word they will not disagree with the word they will be like they will be exactly like they were those predestinated seeds the apostles predestinated seed of God they had been taught the word of God somebody help me preach the gospel had been taught to them by Jesus Christ himself but they hauled themselves up into the upper room because the seed had been broken open to release the moisture the rain to come down on them here come the latter rain upon them to put in them the very life of Jesus Christ to repeat the same thing that he did in Bradford [Applause] so the same thing has to happen to you you've got to hold yourself up to the upper room so to speak and let the same light that was in Jesus come in you amen then it will the word of God will manifest itself now let me quickly kind of sum this up he said you know we've had a sowing rain he said Billy Graham has went forth with the Baptist for the evangelicals and he said he sowed his seed he's been a head planter and he said now this is kind of come into law in the Revival you don't hear very much of him all Roberts he said same thing he's been the head planners for the Pentecostals and he's planted the Pentecostal seed you realize out of that little Mission work of the Azusa Street Revival there are now 0.6 billion followers of Pentecost what happened the seed was planted but then he said same thing with me he said Divine Divine Healing movement the Revival is dying down and he said what is it it's been a time of planting seed he said the word has now been planted now so you have all kinds of seeds that are being sowed you know he even talks later about seeds of Communism he said this nation has been seated over with Communism well I guess you're seeing the Harvest amen what is it you know why we are in the time we're in the time where in the pouring out of God's spirit that is now manifesting what was planted so the Baptist right well bring forth you know Billy Graham would bring forth evangelicals and and the Pentecostals under all Roberts would bring forth Pentecost but whatever what kind of seed do you get Billy Graham would come and say hey I can preach and I have a thousand people come to Christ and and come back and I can't find 10. he said because denominational planting brings forth denominational children amen but he said the word is going to bring forth the word somebody with me now amen and he said I I have planted a seed I have planted the word for an end time Harvest Hallelujah and he said you're actually seeing your last sign before the promised son comes but guess how the promised son comes he does not come in the median in the air first he comes in Pride for him first because there has to be a lamb of God on Earth to match the lamb coming from heaven so that boy is the first Forerunner said Behold the Lamb of God therefore on herself Behold the Lamb of God because now there's a blind people on earth [Music] who is the wife of the lamb and species must marry species in kind after kind he's coming for the Lamb of God a people who demonstrate the Holy Ghost but this time this lamb is not going to be sacrificed this lamb is going to be raptured for a wedding in the sky Hallelujah we've had all kinds of waters had all kinds of revivals we've had all kinds of moves of the spirit but they have not been the latter rain the former rain brother Branham said was a teaching ring Billy Graham struck the world unto that Pentecostal struck the world and the word has struck the world so what's the matter now she's been waiting he says for the latter rain Pentecostals want more Pentecostals that's what they're going to get but the word is going to produce sons and daughters look at that great latter rain supposed to be done how they would run over the wall leap over they'd be an army coming come on he tells us in the churches but she's an invincible Army that Satan is powerless before her but he said she would run and leave over the wall and brother Madam talks about that wall he said it's a wall between the natural and the supernatural amen there are people that knows their God who does exploits no as we look like this remember for years men have tried to manufacture a lot of rain but he says a lot of rain won't be just a little move here or there it'll sweep the world and when Christ has been completely rejected and the world has shut their doors to it he said that's when he'll come that's when he'll show that's when you'll see a rain and we're right here in the final rejection in the laodice the rejection of Christ putting him on the outside of the church look at what America has done she has rejected Christ look at look she's been so communism until it's it's everywhere that you look Marxism going out in our schools in our society in every way that you want to look come on Church you know that amen why why is it that's what was planted amen but but you know there again 6.6 billion Pentecost 0.6 billion evangelicals you know there's a multitude without number that goes into the tribulation that winds up in the great white Throne judgment and God then will decide which one of them was really foolish virgins and what wouldn't at the white throne he'll be cast in the tribulation but I want to get to you the word has been planted and the next thing and I'm going to leave you right here on this because I don't have time to bring it out the next thing is the rain coming with rapturing faith and I'm not talking about a theology where we restored we've had the teaching right now let me just go for a moment I just got a couple of more comments in fact to the matter is we can go ahead and bring the musicians and I'll show you that I'm serious about quitting but here's where we're at I want you as a church to know and I'm going to be re-emphasizing this we've had nearly now since the prophet left let's just say since the church ages many people don't know this brother Branham never realizes that Elijah is fully realizes that Elijah is to come until he sees the last age of laodicea and says it'll be Elijah only then does he start teaching that Malachi 4 will come to restore all things and so with the beginning of the Elijah Ministry he said not in the days of the preparations in the healing revivals but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he starts sounding his message that's when the mysteries of God will be finished and we have had Now 60 years of teaching we've been doing what brother Branham called resting between revivals you can go ahead and start playing something that'll remind me to quit we've had nearly 60 years of teaching resting between the revivals we've been given testimonies of the great things that Jesus did in the ministry of brother Branham you know all the stories the possums the squirrels storm heady Wright you know all the stories of the blind man that is healed screaming out extra extra read all about it I'm Healed you know all the stories you we have we've been testifying for a long time now look what God did oh how great Jesus was how he moved amen come on and you know as you go along and the orders are going along it isn't long until there's a few arguments in the boat and the oars the doctrines we were to use to kind of get us to the shore you know to move along we begin to fight one another with [Music] but all the while Jesus is asleep in the boat [Music] it's time to wake Jesus I don't know if you looked out your boat window lately but there's a big storm going on laughs it's on National strife we're about to be bombed of smithereens is prophesied come on Church amen we know that trouble is on every hand look at our educational system seeds have been planted so much until kids don't even know what gender they are [Music] all of this stuff that's going on in this time and like Abraham and Sarah they received revelation of the Angel the son of man of sodom's burning and judgment Sarah's promise of restoration The Mystery of the promised Sun the mystery of lot and his salvation through the angel Messengers but I want to remind you again there is a promise and that promise is I will return to you according to the time of life that God is not abandoned his work and he has not forgot you where you are right now But Here There is a promise even like a Samson are the new growth of hair and the return of power Hallelujah there is a promise of an Esther who knows her position and who she is and I say to you this morning yes there's a wicked Haman and he swore that he will hang you on that hand on his hand noose but I'm going to tell you you've got a job Esther realize who you are and go before the king go tell the king go tell the king what this devil has been doing to you what he's trying to do with our young people seek him down in pornography or suicide devils and what he's trying to do to families and homes and how he's trying to wreck the church and pull him up go tell the king I want you to know Elijah has left but Elisha receives a double portion I want you to look at the type of Jesus The Farmer in the latter rain poured out on Pentecost and the apostles we've had a word Revival we've had great teachers just went forth brother biscoll what a man of God tremendous gift of God go out preach evangelize get the message in people's language great works of teaching them and brother Lonnie Jenkins many many others you know teachers we have reviewed and just dissected the mechanics fiddle battled with them over and over again but I want to tell you it's time for somebody to pull that car back down and drive and for us to drive down to Divine Healing we need healing in the church drop down to Miracles drop down to signs and wonders drop down to the power of God because if we cannot have faith to even believe for divine healers how are you going to have faith for your body change to look at your life today and say Lord we've had a worship Bible but I need an outpouring of the Holy Spirit today Dynamics to come to the mechanics to make the word
