beloved brother in christ lord has ministered the word there i pray that you'll just again use him for your glory and pour out an anointing upon the service beyond his capability because we we are unable to do anything without you and then lord today in this service that you'd meet the needs of your children they raised their hands to you i pray that you would supply them according your riches in glory lordy here in my hands are prayer class oh god and where that little heart is reached out to you send us prayer clauses say my my family my children my loved ones they're in desperate need

name give us strength courage and ability for we depend on you today in jesus name amen and amen god bless you oh it's so good to be in the house of the lord and we're grateful to god for his goodness to us amen i want to send greetings around the world today as um i have certainly been made aware of many many many that have listened in and have sent us uh cards and and emails and texts and phone calls from literally around the world india south africa over into um to other areas of africa and over into europe over in canada and of course all over the united states and we want to just express thanks for all the love that was shown to me and my family um during the departing of my wife sister karen and many of you uh so kind to us sat in the hospital with her um brought food tidied up my house helped in so many ways and and they showered us with so much love and kindness we can never repay at all and i also want to say thanks to all that came and showed their support i think there was between 15 and 20 states and canada who were represented here and a host of ministers that came someone wasn't in the photograph we took because they they came for the visitation and wasn't able to stay for the rest of it but uh my goodness we had we were ministered to in so many different ways and of course the ministry that was here brother ron by the donny brother wendell uh brother danny steeman and um also brother wayne lawson that that spoke and then the many others that that um participated in the service it was it was just wonderful brother jeremy shriner was certainly blessed us with his songs and worship to the lord and we had a great time amen it was a great celebration and i was very proud of you because that's what we're to do we're to celebrate and to rejoice in what god has given us we have been blessed beyond measure amen and um you know it's um you know we it's not been revealed to me yet as to what god's purpose and plan is but we know that all things work together for the good of them that love god to them that are called according to his purpose as stated in the church age book he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not a peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we should be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he puts his strength puts strength in us and i just like to say we're not defeated we're not about to surrender and many of those that were listed in hebrews the 11th chapter which is in the chapter of the heroes of faith they went by the way of the grave yet they did not die faithless they all died in faith that's what the bible said these all died in faith and there's no shame in in death or going by the way of the grave simply because god does not intend us for us to live in these corruptable bodies forever so he actually sets a limit to our time here upon the earth in fact not only god not only that but god does not lead the dead and christ out in fact they are preferred before us for the bible said they will rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord amen we're having some wonderful reports that are coming in from the youth camp and one of our young men you know brother william butts called me the other night after the service to say he and his brother joshua received the baptism of the holy ghost we have asked god for miracles and there's your miracles you've been wanting to see god is still moving these are the greatest miracles amen so god is still moving among us and we thank him for that first john chapter 3 and verse 1 as we look into the word of god we're expecting him just to anoint the word to our hearts and reveal himself to us behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of god and yet it does not and and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and then first john 4 and verse 4 you have god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and i have one more scripture that i'm going to read but i'm going to let you be seated as we read that one amen and trust in god will bless his word this morning revelation chapter 10 and verse 1 it's a as a scripture that's referring to our day to our hour and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot up on the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things with the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that darien are in the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again saying go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey and as soon as i'd eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings and you can see by this reading here that the bride of christ gets has the last prophecy amen today we're going to be speaking on the messiahs we of course are living in the greatest hour of the world the world has ever seen it is bride time it is the bright age where that god has called the people out of the tombs of religion and is bringing forth a resurrection in this hour now you know you some might object and say well surely not brother tim it's you know we're living in a time of great trouble and it's a time of death it's time where horrible things are happening and and there are of course or hundreds or thousands of people that are being slaughtered right now even as the u.s disgracefully pulls out of afghanistan and we even have believers there have received the lord and been baptized in the name of jesus christ and they're stranded there and the you know the and and other places like in myanmar where we were building a church there it sets uncompleted and believers are only able to meet in small groups because of the military takeover of the of the government bringing instability and horrible horrible persecution there are believers in china your brothers and sisters that are in prison or for just possessing or sharing a king james bible you know there are as we look there are pre-tribulation plagues that are falling and satan's anointing and his fear is almost so thick you can almost feel it and it's a dark spirit everywhere as we see friends ah precious friends like our brother jim babb that was mentioned today a dear friend that is dying of code that has died of covet and others that are dying of covet and diseases and afflictions and many others are confused and others are falling away and yeah there's tremendous suffering that's happening right now in haiti after a recent earthquake and thousands are now dead and so there's calamities and there's troubles and there's free tribulation plagues and there are rights that are breaking out there is instability there are people that are that are that are right daily you know asking lor you know please you know just for our bread please just send something to to give us to eat in india and africa and other places that are are just in in dire need today and it's it's kind of like cleopas and his friends on the road to emmaus remember jesus had died and was now buried and and they're on their way to emmaus they were told by jesus to go into um into the into jerusalem and to wait but but you know they could not comprehend at all the greatness of the hour that they were in the hour was so dark yet at the same time there was so many great things that were transpiring and these believers their minds were filled with the sight of their lord and master being spit upon and beaten and crucified and then dead hanging on a cross and sealed into it behind a tomb guarded by roman soldiers and to them there was nothing that was glorious about the present hour it was filled with pain confusion wild stories unanswered questions of why why why you know you know there were many prayers that had been prayed that were seemingly unanswered the anguish of jesus himself upon the cross crying out my god my god why hast thou forsaken me the anguish of the men and women and disciples who had cried and prayed for hours for deliverance hoping believing praying that any moment the power of god would that they had previously seen displayed that could open the eyes of the blind that could heal diseases could make the cripples walk and you know yet they seen it displayed and yet they were hoping praying believing now that any moment it would take him off of the cross and there was terrible disappointment of the disciples because things just simply hadn't turned out the way they had planned it things wouldn't happen the way they thought it would be and and they they were wondering and they were pondering and they were talking about it and they as they walked along the road to emmaus you know death and disappointments and heartaches they all everyone fit into god's great program why because always he has something better amen we prayed for healing for sister karen but god had a greater healing amen we we pray we ask for things but god he he gives us what we need sometimes not what we think we need but you see but i want to point out to you this is a resurrection hour if i could just get it to your heart this morning you know that it's not just a time of calamity and trouble and problems but it is a resurrection hour it is where the time as we have been dealing with uh in daniel chapter 12 where the michael the great prince stands up on the behalf of god's people it is a time when satan this one who has brought sorrow and sin and persecution and sickness and death is now being cast down it is a time where satan's accusation is over because the blood has justified a people and has made them without spot or a wrinkle or a blemish it is a time where people's faith will not fail and when they look when they will look in the face of adversity and their faith will prevail i'm speaking to people today who doesn't just have faith but they have prevailing faith that will prevail in the time of difficulty it is a time when a people rises on the scene and they break the cycle of revival and death and instead of getting colder and more weary and more and more dreary and more broke down they will become more revived and empowered and rising up in the face of adversity it is a time where the church rises and returns to the power of pentecost and prevails and welcomes back the lord jesus a bride a people who will not go down and repeat what the ephesus aides did who aimed at the high calling and relax their grip this is not and i want to get this clear to you because many times we are mistaken in our preaching thinking that we are trying to revive azusa street or even that we're trying to repeat the day of pentecost but i you know the it is not a repeat of the day of pentecost the azusa movement repeated that when they went back down into death again they rose up only to fail but i want you to know we are in the hour of the fulfillment of pentecost when the day of pentecost is fully come it might not come to go down into defeat but come to take a people into complete and total victory now this may be a little over the head for some of you but hold tight and we'll come back maybe to something more more simpler for you but he comes in three sons name he comes as son of man and he reveals a self in prophetic form he comes the son of god and reveals himself as the spirit of god through the ages and then he comes again as we come to the end time and reveals itself once more and repeats the same thing again revealing himself in a prophetic way amen but then he will come and reign as son of david over in the millennial reign so we're we're living in an hour where there is wonderful marvelous things that are taking place on the day of pentecost he came as the son of god the spirit because god is a spirit and and this brought in the son of god dispensation which is reigned through the seven ages but here at the end of the ages how many blades were at the end of the ages where it's not another baptist age or presbyterian age or lutheran age or pentecostally but it is now the bride age where infancy is passed where immaturity is passed where it's adoption agents mature grain age it is the eagle age it's the rapture age it's the age of the son of man that's why we don't look for another upper room where 120 are gathered into churches born this is not the birth of the church this is the coronation of the church amen it's when the son of man is revealed as in the days of sodom and that visitation brings back about a change and the long-awaited promised son comes amen and he says as we read today and i saw another mighty angel it is a son of man dispensation and it's anointing and it's not an azusa street anointing upon just the flesh and just the spirit realm oh we saw many of them you know get it and it was a genuine holy ghost even sometimes speaking in genuine holy spirit tongues but yet not a real change to the soul and see them go right back out into sin and darkness again but it's not an azusa street anointing just upon the flesh and the spirit realm though some may still get it that way but there is something greater than that we are living in a day where it's not just an empty jump or an empty shout with no change to the life it's upon the soul and it seals unto the day of redemption hallelujah let me tell you this bride is not another church who ends up as a failure she cannot fall she unlike pentecost of 2000 years ago is predestinated not to fall god predestinated them to go as a seed into the ground because there would be many more that would come after them but god in this day has declared i'm not planting this church they will not all go by the way of the grave they will not go into decay they will not decline remember they will be gathered into my barn they will be raptured hallelujah we are not like pentecost up 2 000 years ago like that but we are a people who receive the word and instead of going into decline we keep accelerating we keep rising higher we keep moving on we keep advancing christ the mystery of god revealed brother branham talks about this and says predestinated well we can look back and we can say that some in that first days that were predestinated you know to god allowing them to go into the decay and decline and break out into the church jesus and and into the dark ages and and god predestinated the people in every one of those ages are you with me amen but we're predestinated that's the mystery see he before christ or anything was ever on the earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing that eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated that church to that great glorious stand how wonderful is that do you realize others were destined for different things some were destined to go down to death in the dark ages some were destined there to to protest the catholic church and bring a reformation some were destined to preach holiness some were destined to preach on gifts and see the holy spirit fall some were destined in in different ways but you have been destined pre-destined not too far hallelujah what a promise that is we're not just simply those who wash their robes in the blood of the lamb and make them white amen like those in revelation 7 who have to go through tribulation and miss the rapture and they got to go through they got to go through further purging that we are truly washed by the blood and our sins loosed and every stain is sin gone i want to just say we are more than that we are the blood of god by a new birth hallelujah amen every child that is born of human parents is born of those parents blood and since our parent in the new birth is god we are born of his blood come on amen so we are the blood of god by the new birth heaven is born again well you weren't born a corruptible seed peter said but you were born again of the word of god that liveth and abideth forever you are incorruptible seed hallelujah excuse me here in just a moment that's right incorruptible see the church he says is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the holy ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word denomination won't never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did eve know it but she failed but this one knows it and won't fall she is ordained hallelujah she's ordained not to fall she won't fail she is predestinated to it blessed is the man whom god will not impute sin hallelujah a people ordained not to fall hallelujah now the coming of the mighty of the holy spirit in the form of this mighty angel with the open book it brings its people into a messianic age where there is again a messiah upon the earth you say well we're looking for the lord brother tim we're looking for his coming well certainly there is a meeting in the air don't ever forget it it is the hope of the believer believers believe that amen but however again you know we we we know that there is a messiah now upon the earth there is a form that christ is in that is here in our midst today amen not coming but here am i not not something that is abstract but present something that is real hallelujah amen and and so there is a messiah upon the earth he said what in the world you mean by messiah what do you mean by messiah by the time a messiah is an anointed one of god now here's what brother bradham said and who do you say this is give me a church are you ready for this that's so completely anointed with god till their ever moving action is thus saith the lord walk in that's your kind of glory and i'll show you a messiah an anointed one of god standing upon the earth hallelujah so brother madam tells us that a church surrendered to god and anointed to god walking in the shekinah glory is the messiah an anointed one of god standing upon the earth now friends that's what we saw this anointing do to a man our messenger it took him beyond anything denominations ever experienced denominations could never carry you that far it made him a messiah now not the messiah there's only one d messiah that's jesus christ but a little messiah an anointed one of god a full-fledged son amen now remember as christ descends he descends from heaven with a shout let's look at first thessalonians 4 16 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first so you see here he comes as he descends he starts his dissension and he does three things as he descends right he has a shout he has a voice and a trump now all of these are phases of his coming amen not one of them singularly is his coming and one cannot be complete without the other amen if you miss the shout you're not going to be the voice if you don't become the voice you'll never hear the trunk all right so you see the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout now this ain't a funeral scripture this was a prophecy for the last day that we often refer to to comfort one another with these words but that's not that's not what it is it's a prophecy amen and when god gives a prophecy there has to come a fulfillment and we're not living in the day of the prophecy we're living in the hour of the fulfillment are you with me now so you see he comes with a shout so his first phase of his coming is with his shout a mighty message you know it's got to be saying something or it means nothing right it's just an uncertain sound so you see it's got to have a meaning it's got to be saying something if he descends from heaven with a shout he's got to have something he's saying there is a purpose he's gathering he uh he is bringing people up to to a message they're hearing what the spirit is saying are you with me amen so let's let's look at here as we go back to revelation 10 1 and let's talk take a look at here because this is the scripture of of his coming in our day amen amen this again is like pentecost in the sin in the sense it's not a physical coming it's a supernatural event it of course will finally materialize in a physical form it's important you never get your eyes off of his his uh of of the the rapture the you know sometimes we can explain this so what we wait till we don't even appreciate anymore the coming of the lord jesus but as we look at this and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head his face was as it were the sun his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and his right foot was upon set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried right he what he cried that is he shouted he wasn't weeping we didn't need to hand him a box of kleenexes he wasn't crying he was shouting and he shouted with a loud voice and he does it as a lion roar hallelujah because when a lion the king of the jungle speaks and roars even the locus and the insects shout out why the king has spoken amen this lion's lord ceases every other voice hallelujah amen you want to talk about critics you want to talk about unbelievers and what they're saying i can't hear it oh man it's all been silenced by the king's voice it's all been silenced by a shout out amen the silence has has come upon all of them but for us the silence has been broken hallelujah he shouted with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had shouted or cried seven thunders uttered their voices now all of this is symbology in the bible the book of revelation is a book of symbols and the lion's roar is the king's message and it comes through a prophet because the lord god will do nothing except he reveals his secrets to his servants of prophets amos 3 7. so you see this this is it is a lion's lord the king's message comes to a prophet and when it does the voice of god thunders out breaking the silence on things that have been that have been silenced for thousands of years now but this time it's not a sealed utterance it's not something sealed up for another generation we are the generation it was spoken for hallelujah amen it is not a sealed utterance or a sealed book but this time it comes down as an open book as a prophetic utterance what is it it's the son of man christ our lord jesus revealing himself through a son of man a prophet amen now you see christ had the coming word for him first you got to understand the sequence of his coming he couldn't just come and appear nobody nobody would be prepared for his coming they might mentally lost their way we got 40 000 different denominational denominations out there try to wade through all of them try to figure figure them all out see where they're on or where they're off are you with me amen but you see christ had to come in word for him before he can come and groom for him yes we want to meet him in the air yes we want the resurrection of the saints yes we want you know our loved ones to appear to us amen we want to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye don't we amen but before he could do that he had to send a message to turn our hearts back to faith again back to the original faith amen so he's so again he would send a preparation something to prepare us for that coming he would sin as he did in the first age of john the baptist to forerun his coming an elijah ministry that would go forth in the spirit and the power of elijah and would you and as it would go forth than that he would he would bring forth a message to to prepare to prepare a people to receive a message amen prepare a piece of people to receive a word a word that would set them straight that would bring them back into balance that would give them understanding as daniel 12 said none of the wicked will have understanding but the wise shall understand amen so they had to come and understand it and to do that god would send a forerunner and this forerunner would prepare the way it was you know he would make the path for the word to come behind brother branham would say in the church age book it says it this way and and and brother kalin who's listening in from south africa pastor there god bless you and the saints there brother caleb we love you amen but in the exposition to the seven church ages brother caitlyn shared this to with me this i read it first about two in the morning he is some sending someone who is so far from organization education and the world of religion that has john the baptist and and eligible he will hear only from god because he will have thus saith the lord and speak for god he will be god's mouthpiece and he as it is declared in malachi 4 6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was to with paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day are you with me ready for this amen those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works hallelujah do you see it amen that's exactly right that will be his body will be his voice and perform his works you cannot do that without being a messiah amen you have to be an anointed church hallelujah amen this word coming was promised a message that would come to turn our hearts back the spoken words original seed brother branham would share with us his mission he said my mission i believe that god has called me for and i have some say some personal things today because that's what i told you i would do and tell the world my mission i believe to the earth is what to forerun the coming word see the coming word which is christ now he told us he would he would absolutely be son of god to forerun the coming word and that word would be christ and then christ would be in the word and in christ in him has a millennium everything in there every promise of the word lays there within that message and he did he flew around it he pulled around it with divine healings with miracles thousands of them not one or two amen he had them with signs showing the presence of the word discerns the thoughts in the infants the heart he forerun with the vindication of the coming word he proved it's the word i'm bringing because the word is the only thing that can discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart and it would prove that it was the word we needed vindication now the baptists have their vindication from their school ever ever presbyterian pastor will have his vindication that he is sent by them and that he is trained by them and he's qualified to speak for them because they have a certificate from him right that is that's the way they do in denomination but god was sent a forerunner who was uneducated who did not use the thoughts of man who would have to hear directly from god himself and god would certify that his message was not a man but it was a god it would give witness to it service after service telling people where they were from what their address was what their sickness was what their future would be even what happened 40 years ago god vindicated it and there has to be a message first remember first things first you don't get changed and then the message you don't become the voice and don't know what to say there has to become a message and and and it's the word you say well that's it brother tim see it ain't all this hooping and hollering it's a word revival you know but it's not an intellectual revival amen as brother branham said the gospel isn't word only but through power and manifestation of the holy spirit it would produce the signs of mark 16 when he said go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature these signs shall follow them the word itself is dead until it becomes into an action and produces life so under understand it's not a it's not a a teaching it's not just a doctrine with no life in it it's a word with power in it transforming power healing power deliverance power but i just want to inform you if you think for a moment that there's all all there is to to the coming is a prophet with a message you're sadly mistaken and if you think that's the summit and that's the climax and that's the product and that's what god wanted was just that you are really mistaken you see you know this has been the spirit of denomination wants to cabbage down on one little part of it and say this is it and that's all right that you know as brother timothy read the quote the other day of reaching the summit every one of them believed they had reached the summit but i want you to know even though it was wonderful what god did sending a messenger sending a message and if you haven't heard it you ought to be hearing it and it's a value it's a worth it's a great importance hey man you again you know unless you get the first part you'll never get the second part am i but if you think that's all there is to it there's a prophet coming with a message you're mistaken this message was not about just a prophet it was not just manifesting the the christ in a prophetic form of of a man who would be elijah and though he was and though he had a great work and though he is a great man and though we honor that and we appreciate that we recognize that and we know it's a message from god but again i want you just to think of this as brother madam told us spoken words original seed as the end time prophecies repeat i think you ought to write that down end time prophecies repeat now he's going back into the scripture and he said these prophecies are repeating in the end time as the first forerunner came from the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of god the second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride so not only would he forerun and prepare the way for the word a message to come but he would prepare the way for a bride to come if you would just get it he was your forerunner he was preparing the way for you to come amen he was coming forth and said there's going to be more just like this amen i'm not the fulfillment of it all there's a people there's a bride there's a left amen who who will be the embodiment of the prophecies amen he said he would point the people to a word born bride and then he said the bride of christ will be pointed to the disguise at the appearance of jesus screaming behold the lamb of god will come forth from his lips god help us to be ready for this near event but by the way talking about behold the lamb of god there has to be a lamb on earth for a marriage to take place with the lamb i want you to just ponder on that just for a moment the bible is clear the species must marry species the kind must must unite with kind god cannot just take anything he has to have a lamb a bride who is the lamb of god upon the earth obedient surrendered yield to him come on now amen so there is a bride god there is a lamb coming in the skies but there's got to be a lamb on earth to match up with the lamb coming from heaven so in order for jesus to come in order for him to be here he has to come in word form and then in bribe form amen amen now we're taking another step because again it's not that you do away with the other it's just one is the advice is advancing the other one are you with me now so therefore the lamb of god that the first forerunner will will the second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride i want to say today behold the lamb of god the bride the elect lady not just here and even in like tabernacle but around the world a people who have been not just washed but born of his blood a people who who are so united with him until he and them are the same that they are actually his body upon the earth amen now as he said in christ the mystery which you know i've been studying there would come a time forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church had the preeminence in his church what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by why accepting what eve turned down which was the word she denied the word of god and adam and coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see anointed with the word what even turned down we come back and accept and he believed everything she failed on one point that god would keep his word that he's the same yesterday today and forever but there is a bride in this end time who is going to believe every word of god amen they're going to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god these men and women are that as that church not not so much individually but exact church they are anointed messiahs now as he said in perfect faith we become anointed with that same spirit anointed messiahs anointed messiahs of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of jesus christ to show he's not dead but in the form of the holy ghost he's in his people he's moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out to her into her himself and they become one for the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same god in the same word is making the same manifestation and there's nothing left for us to do but believe it hey man how many can say i believe it nothing left for us to do but believe it amen believe it he said it's a substance and that creates a perfect faith oh just think how numb we are just think just a minute oh and i just say don't be numb fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophet has spoken this is what he said to them on the mace walk that's right again look we right now remember we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and as god raises bones and flesh out the grave that cannot hide the man that has the potentials death cannot take him jesus said all the father is given to me we'll come and i'll raise him up at the last day oh my easter why we're right in easter when he raised we raised with him he sent the abstract back that's the holy ghost our deed is clear we hold it as the baptism of the holy ghost he's alive forevermore the same yesterday today and forever hebrews 13 8 proves that he is the same his messianic anointed ones believe that what is the messiah messiah is anointed one and now if he was anointed by being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of god to be the redeemer and and the anointed one and god has raised up that body his bride are you ready for this his bride is the anointed one for this day it's already raised with him in the resurrection because these two are one hallelujah i'm looking across in this very dark hour and i'm seeing resurrection life all over this building amen i i went to i went brother tim and george winters bro both of them brothers they took me and brother timothy up into colorado as we're riding along i'm just i'm just remembered and i'm just thinking again of where jesus found them that they were dead in sins and trespasses they found that they are miracles if you never see another miracle they are miracles amen that god would take them out of the life of sin and you see even friends and relatives that were around them and the kind of life that they live and the wretchedness and the condition and the death are you with me dying condition and god raised their men up everybody changed them and made them and gave them a new life and drugs and alcohol and filthy sex things and everything else fell off and he transformed and he made them new creatures i'm talking about resurrected ones i'm talking about ones that was dead in sins and trespasses hallelujah but now they're alive forevermore and they truly have the keys of death and of hell and there is nothing can separate them from the love of god in christ jesus i'm talking about the power of transformation the power of resurrection sometimes we see all the darkness we see all the fears around we see all the troubles and we fail to see a resurrection is taking place sometimes we think about the gates of hell being against us and jesus said it would be but listen what brother bradley said the gates of hells are against he said watch and see where the gates of hell is against it isn't against denomination the government recognizes that it ain't the world recognized our denominations all of them we have a right each one of us is american citizens the rights of denomination which is fine we appreciate that but that's not what the gate of hell's against it is against the spiritual revelation of christ being here now the same yesterday today and forever that's what is against the gates of hell shall be against it but it shall never prevail the gates of hell are against christ being here now that revelation that he's here present now that he's here in his church that god is in his people amen sure god was in his universe amen he created the sun and all the moon and everything else and you can see him in nature god's in his universe god was in his son but that's not where god is now god is in his people i'm not on earth where god is where he's in now is god is in his people a people who the word oh god that message has went further than books and tapes it has been transferred into hearts and lives hallelujah amen and it doesn't take years of study to do that it takes one moment in the presence of god and he'll write his very nature into your life the gates of hell shall be against it what be against what the revelation that christ is here now brother branham said in the message super sign i'm thankful for a church universal triumph already predestinated called and sealed and ordained to that body i find them in asia you're listening to me asia africa rome everywhere indiana through the states africa everywhere around the world i find that church triumphant who knows you have come in the flesh talking about jesus has come to the and jesus said every spirit in your bible jesus said every spirit that does not confess this is the wrong spirit the antichrist every spirit that doesn't witness the same thing that christ has come in our flesh is the antichrist spirit now there's where you got to discern and withstand the antichrist spirit when it says well it was back in brother branham's day and it'll be when some day in the future but it isn't now you see that's your antichrist spirit that wants to make the church cold and powerless and formal amen but let me tell you friend every spirit that doesn't witness that christ is coming our flesh is the antichrist spirit hallelujah god is here where is he at people are screaming everywhere just like they did in his first coming where is he king of the jews where is he where is he here now at the death of jesus and and this very hour and you're wondering where is he and what happened to him and why oh god why oh why did you forsake us how come you didn't answer our prayer and you hear god was already right there in their midst performing resurrection and i want to look at every one of you here today that have been saved by the grace of god and say you are resurrection hallelujah we're not talking about 2 000 years ago of jesus rising from the truth we're talking about you well you were dead in sins and trespasses now he has quickened he had made you alive you once were dead but now you are died hallelujah he would take the wage sheath like a forerunner the wave sheath is the first of the grain in israel they would have celebrations and god would require an offering to be made before they could take the harvest and they would go and collect the first mature grains of wheats and make a sheep and they would take then and offer that and wave it before the lord and of course you know it was a it was the first fruits of the resurrection and jesus rose oh hallelujah at the same time now remember he was the passover lamb come on and he raises now on the first day of the morning at the offering of the first fruits because he is the first fruit of the resurrection amen in the in that sense he is the forerunner for all of us the bible don't get offended in that the bible in the book of hebrews said he's a forerunner who went before us to enter behind the veil but in this he was also a forerunner and that he would be the first one of all the ages that would come to maturity hallelujah the first grain that was planted all the way back with adam now here he comes and and here jesus now is a manifestation he is the fullness of the psalms he is the wisdom of solomon amen he is he is the root and the offspring of david he is all he is all the words of the prophets he is the manifestation of every promise of god and it's all embodied in him what was in abraham and seed form what was in in noah in seed form what was in all of this seed form here he is the fullness of the godhead in a body a grain and there on the first day of the week while in the temple they're offering the the wave sheath thanking god for the harvest here comes the first fruit of the harvest and with him he he there being waved there and been accepted are you with me and waved up on high here he comes back and raises up all the dead of the passages amen all of them from abraham or to adam all the way down to malachi or whoever the last one to the thief on the cross hallelujah amen the last ones that had just went in the grave he was the first fruits and here he the first fruits of the those that slept and he he he was waved there believing the rest of them would come and they did the bible said when he rose and many of the saints would slept rose with him would say they didn't all do it brother to him no because a lot of people thought some were saints weren't saints but all that was predestinated by almighty god rose with him and ascended and he emptied paradise he was the first fruits amen and i want to just bring it down so was god sent a ministry in this day that was a sign a sign of a mature week demonstrating to us what the rest of the crop would be like come on now amen all you you wonder what the pride should be just look at the forerunner what was he like the pride will be the same thing amen now because jesus was the first son of god that was come to maturity to be in god he was plucked up from the earth and waved over the people and then he was waved again 50 years 50 weeks later i mean 50 days later at pentecost it was again another waving of the loaves it was the product of this of the of the loaves and here he is he here he comes are you with me now amen as they are waving the loaves of the bread of the grain that has been beaten into into into paste and made into bread and here they have them and they are offering to god these loaves amen about that time here come the real wavy hallelujah the holy ghost coming down waving like a wrestling mighty wind and then the symbols over the house where they're sitting there and they're filled with the holy ghost amen people who were dead in sins and trespasses hallelujah here he came waving over them not physically yet it was somewhat tangible amen not visibly maybe some saw it and others didn't but somehow seen as pillars of fire upon them amen like you know like at sister karen's memorial i don't know if you know about it or what happened but you know as the brothers were speaking you know my granddaughter leah was sitting there watching so at one of the plants and she said i want to take that one home why do you want that one to leah because as i as i sat there in the service and the ministry was going on i watched that plant come out and buds break out into full bloom flowers that were only buds popped out as blossom and bloomed in full display they went back in the photographs right there and took the photographs and compared them you know stage after stage at the stage and you can see them as they just blood out amen so they popped out as blossoms and ballooned and full of display what is god showing us i am the resurrection in life hallelujah i'll take this blood into heaven but she's gonna come in the full blossom amen you see that that was what was happening in the upper room they were just buds they had just been justified and sanctified they had just had i walked with jesus and talked with him and and we're you know and we're sanctified lives and we're just betting and believing on christ but now in the presence of that pillar of fire blossomed out his full sons and daughters of god empowered hallelujah why because here he comes it is coming that son of god amen the holy ghost pouring out over the people amen but friends that is not the only waving of the sheep we are here in the last days and man where again the sheaf is waved where again another crop has come to maturity amen where we saw according to luke 17 30 amen in the days when the son of man will be revealed or waved over the people and we saw that the word he said this who is the son of man it is the word in the beginning was the word and that word has been waved over us you wonder what you're going to be like when you see the word you've got to be like it hallelujah the word isn't just for memorizing the word is in just for talking about an argument about the word is become flesh hallelujah when that word is waved over you by the holy ghost amen what will it do it'll produce in you a prophetic voice it'll produce in you a life of resurrection life hallelujah oh my he said it was it was it was there malachite 4 luke 17 30 and that the word is waved again over the people that the traditions of man is dead and the son of god is alive again and with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us and giving us life hallelujah thank you jesus hallelujah them young people down there in ohio or even you sitting here this morning you can get the same holy ghost that was poured out there in the son of god dispensation not being poured out in the son of man dispensation amen where god will take and make messiahs out of people a people who is not going to fall are people who won't get discouraged and fall away of people there whose faith will not fail hallelujah they can stand in that mercy they can stand in the face of death and they can say i know my redeemer liveth hallelujah praise the lord so he said he was the first fruits of those that slept and the bride coming to christ and coming out of the church there'll have to be a chief waved again in the last days hallelujah what don't miss it in the bride coming to christ because that's where we're at we are in the bride coming this is when he comes in bright form he comes in his people each one of you are to receive his life don't just make a profession of faith and stay there don't just get a little sanctification while i quit smoking and stay there no quit drinking instead of no going into your field overflowing until god's fullness comes into you into in all of his works from justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost right into your life amen that's what people are stopping today they're stopping short of the new birth amen oh yeah they say well i i believe i believe a message i believe god i believe you know yes i i've been sanctified i've been cleansed of this and that but friends you need to go further than that you need where god writes his law in your heart like i was telling you a vernon villanueva and his friends there trying to and his friend trying to introduce the message you know smoking marijuana and sucking cigarettes and claiming you know they had the holy ghost i said the holy ghost don't do that holy ghost don't live that way you might have had a profession of faith you might believe and you might have a confession but you don't have a possession hallelujah and the holy ghost came down in that day and filled them with men with the holy spirit of promise to the day of their redemption hallelujah now listen so again you see it's the full listen for the first time for the bright age for resurrection out of dark denominationalism remember this is a resurrection this church is a people of the resurrection we were once in tombs of man bound by chains of darkness seals put upon our tomb but god didn't leave you that way hallelujah he sent an angel come on who rolled away the stone who broke off the chains of the ideals of man and opened it up where you can walk out not the same old dead corpse you were when you went in but with a new life never to die again hallelujah and he said because that i live you shall live also because i resurrected you will resurrect also he was speaking to his wife when he said that amen now what a resurrection that was 2 000 years ago can you say man but what a resurrection this is hallelujah to be made alive in jesus christ amen to be a living church to be a people there with the power of god now listen we can't just be a church in name only or the bride and name only it's kind of like his example of two cars coming down out of the assembly line both of them filled up with 98 octane gas and filled to the brim and they come out of the assembly line you know they've been pushed off this assembly line they they look alike but one don't have any spark no firing power so well we don't need fire and power but him there's power in the gasoline there's power in the word well no you see you have to have a spark or that or that gasoline might as well be water right amen in fact you won't know if it's gasoline or not until you spark it and no matter how much theologians claim how well we set our church in church order how much education we got where we can spend the bible and the message to and fro and back and forth and quote it and know and know everything but until that wave she that holy spirit comes upon that person to quicken that word amount without the spirit it will not move and that's the problem we we fill people's tanks with knowledge amen with it with word on top of word sermon on top of sermon until it just spills out till it's almost too much and the tank is filled up and running over a man they have a profession of faith but that faithful that car will not move down the road to overcoming power it has no power still over pornography or or you know steal social drinking wearing your swords and man acting like the world looking like the world doesn't have any power to give you power to rise up above sin amen because no matter how much words you have and how much truth you know and i'll you maybe you can sit on i i know young men that could sit on a bar stool in a bar and i'd argue anybody in the bar of their knowledge but that knowledge didn't do them any good if you can give them overcoming power of alcohol or drugs or sex sins come on amen to the world are you with me you didn't give them any power over it but i'm telling you friends the holy ghost comes upon the word amen what will it do it will ignite a power you can unleash the power of the word if you get the holy ghost in you and you can overcome any kind of sin that comes against you amen you can rise up above the sin of the world and you can fly like an eagle flies amen i want you to know something friends we didn't we didn't get left with a car that wouldn't ride it wouldn't run when brother branham left that car he left it running he didn't turn it off and say days of miracles are passed he left it running amen he left it and he showed it would drive to by divine healing it would drive to salvation it would drive to resurrection power amen it would take you somewhere amen but what we've had we've had men come along that fiddle battle and want to turn the key off don't know how to turn it back on and mess with the engine every kind of way and as brother branham said we put too much stress on the mechanics and not enough on the dynamics it needs the dynamic power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest and to prove that this is gasoline oh it's wonderful you're reading your bible i'm glad it's wonderful that you believe that it's the truth i'm glad but you got to get the holy ghost to come and ignite that word and make it live because there is a 10 000 octane power of the word of god and a holy ghost to light it up and to resurrect the power of god into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church that'll shed the cadillac right down the road under the dynamic power of god amen there we're without excuse now listen there's been many divorce churches churches brides brides churches bridesbrides but there's got to come one hallelujah there's got to come one listen god cannot give up on the project god cannot come and do what he's done in our age in this stop it has to progress come on amen he cannot do it he cannot just abandon the project he's got to finish it he's got to finish the work that we that he started now let's just look at this for a moment we are in an hour of darkness and great trouble and problems and it's war and it's not a war against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers in heavenly places in other words our word our war is against demons of every kind if we'd have read that revelation 12 we were to see the great battle between michael and lucifer and this was happening in our last day and so our our war is against demons of all ranks kinds and authorities they're attacking humans everywhere amen they and especially the children of god i mean come on you you know you've been under attack we've been under attack and we ask how can we defend ourselves against them or lead an assault on the armies of hell and deliver the captives you know the air itself is saturated with evil spirits that that seek to infest our bodies if you look in revelation 9 you would see that that the the gates or the lids of hell is opened up and it comes like a smoke out of the furnace and it is it is in philip infiltrated every crack and corner of our society it's there it's in the family life it's in your schools it's in the colleges this the demons have taken over our education they're teaching they're trying like they did in the days of moses you know where the pharaoh who didn't know joseph rises up and to kill the children and they're doing everything they can to destroy faith so all they you know their classes everything are stopped it's against our you know it is against the fibers of our country the morals of men and women and you think well brother tim i'm on the conservative side can you can you imagine you know you've got a guy that's supposed to be the conservative voice now sean hannity of the of the television and the conservative voice for all of us and for governor he brings bruce jenner on and calls him a great conservative because why it's infiltrated conservativism it's infiltrated the republican party the democrats it's infiltrated in fact they're all giving their mind to the beast they're all beginning to think the same way and you want to think oh there's some differences here and differences there but let me tell you it's sin is abounding like never before are you with me amen and and let me just tell you it's just saturating the air around us there's a heaviness amen just like they were on the road to emmaus you know in a moment when god's doing mighty things and in that moment there's death around trouble calamities seemed like unanswered prayers we prayed and prayed and we prayed and didn't get answered the way we thought are you with me now you don't think spirits don't try to settle over a crowd or over people do you think that the devil won't try to use current events things that's happened in the last little while things that you're dealing with and heard about and things has happened in your own assembly and among your loved ones and even to even even to the pastor's wife you don't think spirits won't try to settle over a crowd of people during a battle like we have and don't you don't do do you not know that unbelief is going to do its best to raise its ugly head amen but i want to remind you that you can't lose even in death you can't lose yet some of us will still go by the way of the grave amen but but that's no lack of faith amen the list of the hebrews are the heroes of faith in hebrews 11 said these all died in faith they were believing unbelief will try to raise this ugly head oh yeah even to me riding along the road you know the devil start talking to you brother tim or tim didn't call me brother thank god tim you've asked god you prayed you prayed long prayers you prayed through the night you prayed day and night you know and and god it looked like god ain't even heard you why there is no god you know that there's no god and i just turned back to him and said well satan if there is no god there is no devil so you don't exist but i know there's a god i know he's answered prayer i know he's delivered his people i know i can see it in lives i can see him go out there and take a boy that's in his pajamas and drag him all the way to the church down to an altar but it didn't end there with just some empty experience justin where is still right here today delivered saved set free hallelujah i look right here and see james where he belongs on the front row amen right here never thought you would be on the front row of a church did you and a few months ago that was impossible but god took a boy who had been a drunk all his life and in dope and other things and all kinds of sin i don't know what all but in a moment's time changed him forever why because he's the resurrection and the light amen listen brother branham's talking about this make the valley full of dishes ditches god i know that you're s that you've sent jesus christ to die and to be wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we're healed oh god i believe that i believe these people are reaching forward through that misgender on beyond that little dark spell over that cloud just beyond that star yonder until their prayers are climbing now around the throne of god hallelujah oh my don't stop now and then lord is your prophet standing between the living and the dead anointed by the holy spirit i go forward to challenge any spirit of doubt that would be here and that the children of god might be healed now satan you are hanging around here with a question mark across the word of god you are literally disposed tonight you're exposed god has revealed you and told you right out where who you are and what you are and you're a liar and the father of a lie and as the church of god as one of the members of that church as being born again by the holy spirit being called in this world to be a prophet and these people have confessed jesus christ as their healer and interceding as a priest standing between the living and the dead i say in the name of jesus christ i break your powers and leave it this building in the name of jesus christ and turn every one of them loose come out of them satan satan leave them hallelujah amen you see that's what it is it's a cloud of the devil sitting right there brian telling you this ain't for you that god that don't care about you that you prayed many prayers and it don't seem like they're going to be answered but i want you to know amen there is a god who answers and a god who said you haven't crossed the line amen that there is still hope and there is your mercy and there is still grace hallelujah but the holy ghost is for everyone the lord our god shall call hallelujah you don't have to believe the lie of the devil you can choose to believe it or you can choose to believe god's word i choose to believe god's word hallelujah i choose not to live defeated i choose not to be depressed i choose not to retreat or to back up i choose life i choose to go forward i choose to speak his name i choose you know what depression is is a devil cloud in your mind he lies to you he tries to make the words of the adversary greater than the words of god and you forget that more powerful is great or greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world dark spirits shadows of worry dark spirits of gloom veils of depression i'll not have none of it ephesians 6 12 we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers and rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places let me give you one example this is a prayer line brother branham says to this man i i see what's wrong with you you've tried in everything in the world nearly to get well haven't you you've been to doctors everything has turned you down it's a nerve condition in that right that's right nothing can help you you've been given up but jesus will help you now do you believe me brother you believe it will you obey me as a servant now you want to be healthy and have that weary and gloomy and crazy feeling like you've been losing your mind and things like that i'll tell you where it started on the prostate and what really is doing it is a demon and it haunts you isn't it right you have no peace all at all day and night it's after you it seems like you just get gloomy feelings in there isn't that right yes or worry don't sleep nervous getting up at night let's bow our heads together our heavenly father they aren't here to bless my brother o thou son of god who is able to reveal the very thoughts of our heart able to do all things free this poor caged mortal in a cage now that he can't free himself like an eagle in a cage beating his wings until his weary eyes fall backward oh father be merciful to him thou servant knows that what he's suffering not demon tormenting this life in the name of jesus christ the son of god come out of the man now look here sir it's gone you're free you can go out of here testify and you feel all right now fine wonderful go out rejoice and testify now i can tell you what happened to you when you was a little boy down to the age right down where you are now the life that you live the things you've done that was true wasn't it everywhere true now i tell you what will be the results in the coming future go out of here happy singing testifying telling people god healed you forget you was ever nervous 30 days from now you'll be a different man altogether amen what was it it was an ugly depressing spirit that was dealt with and the atmosphere was changed amen why because if you can get people thinking right amen the right mental attitude you see nobody can be saved nobody can be saved until they believe that he is not that he was but that he is and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him amen nobody can be saved until they believe he is that he still says that he still delivers that he still heals amen you must believe he is and that he'll reward me for diligently seeking what is i'm not going to give up i'm going to knock and keep on knocking i'm going to ask and keep on asking i'm going to seek and keep on seeking i'm not backing up hey man if the door seems closed i'm going to knock again amen i'm gonna knock till it's open amen god's not gonna get any rest until he hears me amen that's where he taught us to come see your mental attitude has got to be right unless you believe the promise is for you it ain't right it's only for believers when you start believing it's yours but as long as you wallow in your unbelief and your doubts and whatever is never going to be yours you've got to confess it it's mine i want it i want it for myself i want it for my life so your mental attitude has to be right because satan knows even if you start believing mentally he's got to go the bible said in isaiah 26 and 3 that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusts in thee trust ye in the lord forever for the lord jehovah is everlasting strength second timothy 1 and 7 for god has not given us the spirit of fear but a power and of love and a sound mind you see fear is a spirit of bondage and you cannot be a messiah an anointed one and be also anointed with fear you've got to let the holy spirit anoint you you see fear is a spirit of bondage it's a spirit of control you know you know as as brother branham would often say about this he said i'm trying to show people they don't have any need of being scared the worst thing the devil can put on you is fear if you had cancer and you didn't fear and believe god would heal you you wouldn't be in too bad of shape god could take care of that if you're sick whatever it is if you didn't fear so fear is one of the worst things satan can place on upon the person and i've tried to prove by the scripture that man is born again the man that's born again and the kingdom of god has nothing to fear you're absolutely safely secure in jesus christ all that the father hath given me will come no man can come unless the father calls him and the father's got to lead him up to me and and he he comes to me i will in no wise cast him out no man can pluck him out of my father's hand no one is man is greater than he is you say brother tim i'm trying and i've tried and i'm trying to find god i'll tell you what i'm quit trying to find god he's not lost i mean you're the one that's lost oh man you need to say god find me because no man seeketh after god is really god's seeking man and if there's a hunger in your heart at all for god it shows that there's a god that is seeking you hallelujah and he's not gonna leave you alone he'll meet you in the night he'll meet you in the morning he'll meet you at a car wreck he'll meet you there at a funeral he'll meet you in a church service he'll meet you anywhere but he ain't gonna lose one of his he will seek after them and he'll find them surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever just look what the fear of covet did it brought to halt mighty economies it shut down churches it stopped governments fear took away freedoms fear took a mate stalwart christians stay away from church and hide in their homes governments then use the fear of kobe to control populists take away their liberty and their freedoms but there's got to be somebody i wonder if you'll be one of those somebodies someone that the resurrected christ has stepped forward in their life and says fear not he the resurrected one saying out of your life fear not i am he that was dead and behold i am alive forevermore and i have the keys of death and hell it's resurrection our church is where michael stands up and when he does he finds the names of those that are in the book amen and he there in that moment in time brings a resurrection and the wise understand and know their god and man it's resurrection our church it's a time where god is transforming lives moving in his church working in his people hallelujah bringing deliverance everywhere he's here where is he he's got a voice on earth what is that voice you're the voice of the resurrection amen the voice of the archangel the voice of the resurrection what is it you know as brother brandon told us for the first time for the bride age for resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has returned again in its full power being waved over the people you talk about the message what is the message a lot of people don't have a clue what the message is about that's right that the full the message is the message hear me out in the in the land the message is that the full maturity of the word has returned in its full power with the same signs and wonders that he did back there that's the message amen that's the crux of the whole thing that christ is here where in his people say well we're people of the full maturity of the word then words of full power with the signs and wonders that he did now let me just bring it down and i'm closing with this you see the world is doing everything to keep christ dead churches are producing religions with a dead christ we preached christ crucified he died for us and they're trying to keep him in a tomb that's right they're happy with him dead there's a lot of message churches you're happy with him dead too you don't want him in your service you don't want him anointing songs you don't want him in worship you don't want him even an anointed preaching just dry you know and even in salvation dried out confessions man they just wanted dead a dead farm we've had enough of dead floors we've had thousands of years now of the dead funds dead creeds dogmas of man producing dead people people still dead in their sins and trespasses preachers in the pulpit homosexuals dead amen perverts dead womanizers dead deacon boards dead church is dead why because they want to keep him dead i got news for you my wife isn't dead she's more alive than she ever was and not only not only what she healed she got a greater healing than ever my last conversation that i would have with her i would ask her karen are you ready to meet the lord i said i believe i know that answer but i just want to hear you say it she said oh yes tim i'm ready to meet him i said a year ago we were here karen this very same place the doctors had given you up and said you wouldn't live god's given us another year it's been a miracle i said we had 44 years of marriage then and i told timothy as we sat in the early morning son this is it if today is the day i have no regrets i said karen we're here now a year later and we've had 45 years of marriage and i still say we have no regrets i have none no regrets what about you she said tim i've had a good life i've had a wonderful marriage yes i have no regrets but today she's a young woman again she has escaped beyond the powers of death and what sickness can do into an immortal body that can never perish or fade away and a world is more real than this world and how do you even know that world is there because i've heard from that world and his transforming power changed my life you say but this is nothing but just another cult brother jim this is a cult that's all it is is a cult and a cult worship and a cult following well i'll tell you what a cult that will change a life let it take a george winters amen to take his little wife trisha who's right now both of them are sick at home but his wife trisha they're a chain smoker there couldn't give him up a mother who never could give them up a chain smoker addicted held in bondage and there one moment and god's presence took away the desire forever what is it we've heard from another world man can't do that what has happened here a.a couldn't do the pledges the promises the remembrance i you know i'll always turn to the bottle for dependence when i get in a crisis but when god comes he takes away every desire of it you see we were in a horrible condition mankind was lost men would go down the grave for they're never to rise again until jesus came when he came he said because i live you will live also you know what a resurrection that was but then what a resurrection this is listen closing with this and today they're trying to keep christ in a tomb and they are but oh what an easter morning did and easter morning ruined all their theology when easter morning came for people here a church and 1900 years later and and it ruined their theology he's not dead he's alive forevermore and they can't keep him in nope tomb you can put him in a methodist tomb a baptist tomb or presbyterian tomb or whatever you want to but he raised out of that tomb and he's alive today he said i had a baptist tomb you might have had a methodist tube but one day jesus rose from there from a hysterical god to a living present god alive forevermore hallelujah and he rose out of there our people in this day he we raised up out of creeds of man out of tombs of religion and we will never be sealed back in there again and because he lives i live also resurrection life is within us let me buy let me ask you to bow your head for a moment maybe you're in a tomb of no religion haunted there with doubts fears unbelief darkness the tomb is sealed there's no light the casket is locked darkness maybe satan's locked locked your casket you're sealed away in a tomb maybe every kind of unbelief imaginable holding you bound maybe sins of the past spirits of darkness of your of your past is holding you back but i'm here to say you don't have to stay dead jesus came to give life and life more abundantly you can have that abundant life today maybe maybe your maybe your praises that you have is this formal and it's as cold as a cold hand and a grave maybe maybe you're maybe you're your life your spiritual life oh come on don't call yourself a christian and you're committing fornication don't call yourself a christian you're living a life of sin and still in alcohol and other things drugs and fornication filthiness of the flesh don't call yourself a christian you're not a christian you're still dead but you can have a resurrection today you don't have to continue in the life of sin today sin can stop here brother tim i didn't understand everything you said just understand this part when the prodigal son came to jesus or came to the father he said my son which was dead is alive again what about you what about you some of you right now have stepped over into a bottomless pit you can't get back and you try and you try and you can't get back so i'm going to do good and you just try your best to get up again and you just fall again deeper and down you go you're just turning over and over and over so then i'm hopeless brother tim you've already gotten me into hell yeah you are in hell but you see right now there is that hand of mercy that can reach right out when you cry out to him lord god save me i perish and reach out and catch you and stop the fall and take you and put your feet on a solid rock on solid ground you don't have to continue the fall trend you can be changed maybe the holy spirit just speak into your heart today there's some little something down i believe god is real like i told william butts the other days when he told me tim i want to call you i want to tell you i got the holy ghost i said son is real he said yes sir it's so real it's not a fantasy it's not a fake it's a reality of the living god won't you let him change your life today in his presence while there's still mercy while there's still grace like when i said to my wife the other day honey we don't know when the lord might call i don't know darling he may call me before he calls you i don't know but here we are in the hospital are you ready to meet him i know the answer but will you just tell me how you feel in your heart she could look at me with a clear mind and say yes tim i'm ready to meet him are you ready to meet him are you ready to meet him he's calling your name today speaking to you let him talk to you right now would that just be somebody here that would just lift a hand to god and say remember me lord remember me i really need you i need a savior i need help lord i'm hopeless i'm helpless and i need you jesus god sees your hand dear one he sees your hand he's just reaching out to him i need you jesus how many of you would say brother tim i've been justified and sanctified like a like the apostles was and i quit this and that but i i realized today i need a real baptism of the holy ghost in my life i'm asking jesus to come to me god bless you sir he sees your hand there'll be somebody else just make a hand toward god right now as he speaks to you god sees you god sees you are you saying brother tim does god really love me god so loved the world he so loved you let's make it personal that he gave his only begotten son he so loved you that he left all of glory just to come down among men father we thank you lord for every soul that reached out to you and i pray lord god that you'll just speak to them today by your holy spirit let a little warning bell go off lord that has just warned them in their soul there's just something more they need something more than their yesterdays more than that they ever could imagine they need you i pray lord that you'll move in their lives that you'll take sin and darkness from them my brother philip saying no one else could take sin and darkness from me oh how much he cares for me i pray that you'll do it father in jesus name lord don't let one of them be lost father touch them touch them may they hear the voice of god and turn around today may they may they know that they can you can make a messiah out of them an anointed one of god set aside sin in this generation to be a lightbringer in a time of darkness in jesus name amen thank you you jesus my future my life is worth the living just because he lives and because he i can lives tomorrow
