you're not you're a God that wants to bless your people even in a time of famine a time of trouble and a time of high inflation and a time where people are losing their jobs and things are happening Lord in a time like that Isaac stayed in the promise stayed in the land and we went on and planted didn't go down to Egypt but then you blessed him a hundredfold in the time of drought Lord we thank you for those provisions we're asking Lord that you'd anoint the word today as you speak to hearts and lives and manifest your great glory in our midst today and as we read your word together may we rejoice in the god of our salvation Lord in the god of Truth we thank you for it in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord God bless you amen I can tell you're ready to have church we've got a good start already with you worshiping the Lord together thank you and we so appreciate God speaking to us today already and songs of Victory amen and I I believe that the church is a Victorious Church and she is to be without spot a wrinkle as promised and um if you look with me to Genesis Chapter 18 we're going to read from the 10th verse then I want to pick up in the Book of Joel again as a borrowed title today from brother branham's he called it the restoration of the bright tree you may not know this but he tells this as he preaches said I got this thought this morning from when brother Neville was preaching and he said that this thought came to me and he said so I'm preaching on it this evening amen he gave us about a three-hour sermon on the restoration of the Bride tree so he you know he received a thought from the Lord that was delivered by Brother um brother Neville as he preached under inspiration and and of course we're still operating under that same inspiration just as Elisha followed the ministry of Elijah so we continue as as Believers to to walk into that double portion of the promise of God um I'm going to be speaking in a in a service or two on um God willing on the Sarah and the latter Reigns I've got some things there that I want to bring uh to you as far as what God is doing in this hour in this time but I wanted to finish up some thoughts this morning that I've had them and uh before we go into that so uh we're just going to look back at the Book of Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 10 and he said I was certainly returning to thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him then Joel chapter 2 verse 23 we will read from there Joel chapter 2 verse 23 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God see we had a right to rejoice and be glad today amen for he had given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you to the Rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the canker worm the caterpillar the Palm worm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that it dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed see we're going to know it because he's the god that restores so when he restores you know he said I'm going to give abundance you're going to overflow I believe we're in the hour not just to be blessed now but in the hour of the Overflow amen where God is pouring out of spirit and manifesting himself in a great way and it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit now I want to turn to Isaiah chapter 61 and I'm just using these scriptures as the basis for where we're going today in this moment of restoration and if I were you you know wherever I was if you're in a if you're in a physical need or a spiritual need or whatever else I I would begin right now to realize that the god that we serve is a God who restores amen he's restores he'll restore Health to your body he'll restore Health to your marriages to your homes to your family to the church to your finances whatever it is so even though sometimes we may speak on things that are being restored I want you to realize it also has a practical application as well to you in your life and as you hear of God restoring then you look at to say to God lord is you're pouring out the Overflow as you're pouring out the blessings as you are giving the increase I want to be a part of that increase I've got a need in my life and you said I will restore it I've been robbed I've been you know something's been taken from me but now I am going to claim that which is mine and so the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach the Good Tidings to the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to proclaim the Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound look at this restoration to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord let me just stop for a moment this acceptable year is not an actual year like 365 days but it is a a time of of Jubilee it's actually acceptable year is a time of Jubilee of God's restoration to his people so the first part of this will refer to his first coming where Jesus Took the book and he opened this scripture and of course it's still um unfolds into this day where that anointing is here to bind up to heal to deliver it's an anointing upon the church as he finishes up the great work of God but in its second part it adds the day of Vengeance of our God and all that mourn will be comforted for even the dead of Seven Ages will rise so you know the last things that Paul said concerning the coming he said now take these words and comfort those Comfort one another with these words amen so again this is a a proclamation the day of Vengeance the acceptable Lord a day of the Lord and the day of Vengeance to comfort all that mourn to point to them that mourn in Zion to give them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning look at this restoration the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified and they shall build it the old waste and shall raise up the form of desolations and they shall repair the way cities the desolations of many generations God bless you can be seated thank you Lord for this wonderful Word of Life amen I tell you every word you'll just hang your soul on it this morning Amen to realize this is our god prophesying of what he will do in this last day as he finishes up Redemption if this was true in the first part of redemption it's here it's just even more true here as he finishes up Redemption now so again I'm looking here as he said they will build up the old waste and they shall raise up former desolations they shall repair the way cities the desolations of many generations you see the restoration of neglected forgotten truths the desolations of many generations now in our Genesis reading there was a prophecy lying in the historical account of this AIDS barren woman receiving a promise and becoming fruitful by restoration remember if you remember it's um it's a it's a God that that says there's nothing too hard for me this had reached the point of hopelessness in her barrenness and she's now 90 years old it's past Baron way past and yet um she has been set aside and Abandoned and desolate she will not be a part of Abraham's tree it looks like instead um Hagar a bonds woman an Egyptian slave girl a type of denomination is thought to be the bride tree the fruitful branch of the abrahamic race but here the Angel's visit is to assure Sarah that I will restore saith the Lord and the message of restoration in which Sarah is one of the types is the theme of this last day um he will restore a church to everything that was lost in Joel's prophecy he Likens her to a tree or some planting of the Lord that has been Stripped by four different insects or shall I say four stages of the same bug but now God had planted a church on the day of Pentecost and he had a church like he wanted it the restoration of the Bright Tree brother Branham told us now let's picture it they said I want you to get first a picture of God's big tree what he had in the beginning because we're going to be restored we need a picture of what was lost and what the tree used to look like before it got eaten down so let's picture a big tree of God's big God's tree is bearing nine spiritual gifts notice it is a fruitful tree bearing nine spiritual gifts they're Healing The Sick they are speaking in tongues they are casting out Devils they are doing great works they are preaching the unadulterated word of God no denomination to tie them down they're free doing the great work this is a church that brother by Adam looked back and he said let's picture it let's see what it wants to look like so we can know what the end time bribetry is going to look like it'll bear nine spiritual gifts The Healing The Sick they're speaking in tongues they're casting out Devils they're doing great work sir preaching the unadulterated word no denominations to tie them down they're free they're doing a great work now this is the picture of God's bride tree it's a fruitful Branch Jesus said the branches within the vine within his Vine they must be a fruitful branch bringing forth much fruit and the branches that don't bear fruit he says are not in me if you if you see a branch and it's not bringing forth fruit then it's not in me and so he said well my life isn't flowing through them or otherwise it would be a fruit-bearing branch you see then they are withered and and uh and will be gathered to be burned in the fire now again brother Bradham told us that if God brought forth his first Branch out of that vine if it was a Pentecostal Branch with power Visions Revelations healings sanctification Holy Spirit the next Branch will be the same amen certainly will every time that vine puts forth a branch it'll be exactly like the one that was at the first place so God planted a church on the day of Pentecost but there came devours from Satan to eat it down and it is shown in the first churches is a white horse rider an antichrist Spirit to close up and to seal up the promises of the book from the people and it rides to the end morphing from one stage to another conquering and devouring the church remember this the Bride is a supernatural people and to be the bride it requires a supernatural birth otherwise it is not in the vine and the flow of life of the vine is not in it again brother Brandon said I'm just an old-fashioned backwards preacher that believes in old-time heartfelt sky blue sin killing religion that's right that believes that the old-fashioned way I believe a man that when he's born again he becomes the Son of God the supernatural power of God dwells in him we have a supernatural God we have a supernatural life I believe that any man that's born of the supernatural Spirit believes in the Supernatural we got a supernatural Resurrection we have a supernatural heaven we are the supernatural Rapture I believe the whole thing is built around Supernatural and if a man is born in the spirit of God he believes in the Supernatural he can't help it because he's a Son of God and that's the reason we we got so many old cold at formal in different God forsaken backslidden churches because men and women are not born of the spirit of God they have no taste of God they know know nothing about God all they know about is Theology and that's the reason you can't get them to believe a thing that's exactly right you've got to get the man right in his heart first before he can believe he's got nothing to believe on he ain't got nothing to believe with so you see again we we must real realize then it starts then with a Life coming out of the vine itself you see even the church today is supposed to be like the original church at Pentecost with the power of God March 16 in action and that is it church that Jesus claims as his own now of course we know what the original route was look at John 15 and 5. he says he speaks of the original root he said I am divine and you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth more much fruit for without me you can do nothing it's important you know to be born of the Vine because without him you can be nothing amen so now of course in the Book of Romans Paul would use the um the the parable or the analogy or the type of um the olive tree to represent Israel and because of unbelief branches were broken off and God allowed the Gentiles as a wild Olive Branch than to be grafted in and so in the same manner Christ was the root of the gospel and Christ the vine put out his first branch and that was on the day of Pentecost and the Holy Ghost wrote a book of Acts through that branch and now I want you to understand this was not the Acts of the Apostles nor was it the acts of men but it was the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles so when we are speaking of another book of Acts we are not talking about the acts of men amen we are not talking about the flaws and their failures we are talking about the Holy Spirit and his eyes amen we're not going to repeat the book of Acts with all its bitterness and his quarrels and his fussing and his unbelievers in his and his divisions and and all of these other things with its ananiasis it's a virus like that in that sense we are going to repeat the book of Acts because it'll be the holy spirit in a church operating in that church moving in that church flowing in that church becoming the branches of that thine buried his life buried his fruits remember I want you to remember God is promised Christ has put him forth another branch in this last day a restored tree that's why I've said I mean why not you get ready to be restored also amen even as an individual come on even as just a member of the body why don't you get expect to have Restoration in your own life in your own family for your own needs this is a Day of His blessings this is a day of the Overflow this is a day where full Joy is here but Victory is here full power is here the fullness of the Holy Ghost says son of man revealing himself the same Christ of yesterday being the Christ of today now as Abraham was the root of the Jews and the branches was broken off because of unbelief and for rejecting the Messiah and the Gentile sin is a wild Olive Branch was grafted in even so the original Branch was cut off from Christ and the early church died in its first love its fervency his power and grabs in his place was the first church of Rome amen the Catholic Church who lived off the words of Christ and I want you to know that lived off the words of Christ they didn't even write a new Bible they took the words of the Bible and they were living off of that and using that for their own purpose notice this took off took on the name of being the Church of Jesus Christ but the fruit it bore was nothing like the first branches of Pentecost nothing like it in the in time other in fact you know his brother Aaron did so well on his his teaching on the church ages you know it what what it looked like it looked more like Pagan Rome than it did the day of Pentecost right it's beginning to have its Hail Marys and and the mother of God and you know all these goddesses and gods in the Trinity of gods and Saints to worship and all of these other things it began to look more like like paganism and satanic move that it began to look like the book of Acts yeah and you see again the the Catholic church was living off the words of Christ took on the name of being the Church of Jesus Christ but the fruit it bore look nothing like the first branch at Pentecost so you get down there with something crafted in because it's not matching the original root and of the original branch you know in time that would be branches of Baptists or Lutheran or methodists of zuza street now 40 000 other denominations have been grafted in so now the tree looks just like brother Branham shared the thought of what he saw at John Jarrett's place where you know a fruit tree you know with varieties of fruit you know he was he was there on his farm and he sees this fruit tree with that's an orange tree and it has oranges and grapefruits and lemons and tangerines and all other kinds it was an orange tree with all other kinds of branches of of citrus varieties that have been crafted in these these branches were living off the life of the original orange tree and he said to brother Sharon I I suppose next year these branches will produce oranges they won't produce lemons and grapefruits and whatever he said no he said that's not true he said they next year they will produce again tangerines and grapefruits and whatever because they're living off the life of the orange tree but there is no change to their nature amen so therefore they're producing other kinds of fruits amen that what the original tree was and he said well when will the tree produce oranges again and he said when it puts out another branch and when he puts out another Branch the root there will then bear an orange tree branch and it will produce oranges like the original root now so how did all this get in how come we got all these different varieties of Christianity how come we got all these different kinds of fruits that you look upon them and some are Swede and some are sour and summer you know this and some of that and you know but they're they're nothing like what was on the day of Pentecost you see you see the way that happens is you just split the tree notice almost every one of these movements came out of a split amen here the Antichrist comes in with his with his bloody sword and he splits the tree and there are plants in it another branch and now we got in in Christianity instead of orange tree fruit now we have another lemon Grapefruit Tangerine different varieties I have your way Christianity whatever flavor you want it's all citrus it's all Christian now so you see that's exactly what happens when churches are grafted into Christ such as or try to supposed to be uh you know slid in there by name calling themselves the Churches of Christ and what do they bring denominational fruits so you look at their fruit of course a Baptist Branch brings forth Baptist fruits a presbyterian Branch produces Presbyterian fruits you know how did this happen when men split the tree and grafted in a denominational branch now if but however I'm just going to share you some Snippets and things from Brother Branham over and over and over again because I want to belabor the point I want to I want you to I want you to see it from every different direction and from Time After Time where brother Branham is is declaring you know because you can build you can build a Doctrine on just one quote amen you just just think of all the quote you took is Matthew 28 19. that's that's what that's all the quote they take they don't take all the other quotes of Acts chapter 2 38. of Acts 19 of Acts 10 and all them to the Bible where they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so they isolate one quote and build a whole church on it now so again we but we we want to do we want to be able to look at it now time on time and time as brother Branham and why brother Branham because he's the seventh angel to whom the message comes to from Jesus Christ amen Seven Stars in the hand of Jehovah's seven churches representing seven ages seven seven Messengers to Seven Ages that's why we are referring to him if that Branch ever brings forth another limb it'll be like the first one was but let me tell you brother if the holy ghost is real in the church today the kind of church it had that wrote the book of Acts behind it if the Church of the Living God the Church of Jesus Christ become again Alive by the same holy spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost it'll write a book of Acts behind it right it'll be persistent at perseverance until the things come along and that's why we want to be persistent and persevering we're not giving up [Applause] until the tree looks like the original one till it Bears all the same fruits the same nine spiritual gifts the same Holy Ghost the same power of God come on Church we're going to be a person Church we're pursuing after it now you look at the tree and all around it is broken off and withered dead or dying branches to be gathered for the burning trial of tribulation I ran into a woman that used to be the teller at the bank that we used in Homer she's 80 something years old and she I met her in the grocery store and she knows I'm a pastor and she's a brother to him we're meeting together from different denominations and we met in a certain place the other day about 40 of us and we're praying and we're trying to get you know everybody in cooperative and because our churches are dying said our members are going away and we're trying to do something there to to revitalize our church you see you see you look at it all around the tree it's broken off and withered dying branches amen because God's been doing some pruning in this day he's declaring a man that I of who is his so he comes through and he said this is not a fruitful branch oh yeah it's got lemons on it but that's not what I planted well he's got tangerines on it but that's not what I planted that's not what the original church is and God prunes off everything that's why he says come out of her my people [Applause] because this is the day a pruning because in order for the fruit the tree to be a fruitful Branch all of these things that are sapping the energy has to be cut off so they're just sap suckers now why is God doing this because he said I will restore saith the Lord and because of unbelief because of wrong fruit and the rejection of the word God has broke them off and he's now bringing for the branch out of the root and this branches exactly like the original branch that came on the day of Pentecost it is bearing the same ox and the fruit of the root and any branch that is not bearing the fruit a Pentecost is being pruned from the Vine I want you to even think that about your own personal life because it doesn't have the fruit of Pentecost you're going to be pruned off and let me tell you a little something else if you have been fruitful does not satisfied with that he's going to purge you so you bring forth more fruit amen come on now Church this is what you do you do separating you from sin from parasites of the world right amen he has prayed you with a spray brother Madam called it a DDT and he said he prayed he sprayed it there to keep the bugs off of you he said it's a repellent a predestination [Music] Hallelujah because God is deterring I'll have a church and seal me without butter wrinkle now so you see Jesus said in Saint John 15 the Branson did not bear fruit would be cut off and it would wither and that's where our denominations today are being pruned off but not just a denomination any person will be cut off and wither only the fruit Baron the kind that bears the fruit that works of the Holy Ghost will be able to continue in the Vine brother Branham tells about this let me just share a couple of these right here he said you Farmers your Texans Louisiana and so now we're talking to you and many and what you've been here what you may be here anyone that's got common sense so maybe I got you that time ever seen a Vine grow knew that the that the Mind does not bear the fruit but it but the branches of the vine is what bears the fruit and it gets the light from the vine Jesus is our resource of life yeah you see he he had to differentiate but between what bears the fruit because if you're just looking for Jesus to do it when he comes back oh we'll have Miracles when he comes back oh we'll have Divine Healing or when he comes back you know in heaven you don't need Divine Healing and miracles in heaven we need them right here amen and so therefore there has to be branches that is bearing the fruit now he said the life that's in that vine is in the branch and if that vine puts forth the first branch of a great bunch of grapes comes forth from it if it ever puts forth another Branch it'll be a bunch of grapes it'll put a forth another Branch it'll be a a bunch of grapes it'll be the same kind of branch on the end of the vine oh God every time that vine puts forth the branch it'll be like the first Branch why because the life that's in the vine will put forth the same kind of Branch if the first Branch both with grapes the next one bring forth pumpkins the next one bring more citrus fruit then that then on a while it won't it won't do it but if the True Vine puts forth a branch and if Jesus is the vine and the branch that brought forth the real Pentecostal church and it wrote a book of Acts with signs and wonders following the believer if that Trill True Vine brings forth another Branch they'll write a book of Acts behind it amen praise the Lord that's why he says give that vine I'm going to share some of the Snippets if that vine ever puts forth another branch it'll be a Pentecostal branch that'll write a book of Acts behind it he goes on to say and I want to keep you in mind now we're not talking about repeating Azusa Street hey man that's not the Pentecostal Branch we're talking about that was another graft that came from a split are you with me amen let me tell you we are not born of a split we are born of the word get the difference now Church we're people that have been born of a supernatural birth burn out of the vine itself amen not another denomination now there there are those that are bearing those kind of fruits but that's not who the bride is the the first branch that came forth was the Pentecostal Branch filled with Pentecostal power so impact by the Holy Spirit till they staggered under the impact of the power of God they went forth and saw Visions perform Miracles opened the eyes of the blind heal the sick Joy was in the camp they prayed in one Accord and altered them together until the building shook where they were assembled and and then he said when the church buried itself in Jesus It produced the Pentecostal church and if that first Branch come out of the Vine Pentecostal every Branch will have to be like the person we've got to get back to the Pentecostal experience again he says where the first Vine come forth the first mind out that came forth out of the vine was the Pentecostal Branch Visions Powers healing baptism of the Holy Ghost great signs and wonders the next Branch will have to be the same kind of branch Hallelujah why am I going through this I want you to get a picture of what you're being restored to Sarah I don't want you seeing yourself as an old withered old woman bringing Jesus back to the Earth again that kind of woman is not going to reproduce Christ but it's a woman that has been restored to her original condition back to health again thank you Hallelujah this has got to change your thinking your mindset It's gotta blow out your old thinking of what you thought you should be and look here what God said you're gonna be sometimes I look at ourselves and I'd say how can we ever be that but God said it that's all I know and nothing's too hard for God [Applause] that's what Sarah wondered how will this be okay you know I you know how can this be you know you just laugh within yourself and he said is there anything or if I could get that down in your heart this morning about your situation about your family about the restoration that has taken places and lives and hearts and realize I don't care how far away how impossible it may have seemed come on trucks amen that's your situation and no situation is too hard for this God of ours if he had taken all decrepit forgotten woman and restore her to health again he can restore your life to health [Applause] he can take a bachelor in church and fill it with the Holy Ghost set it on fire for quad amen the sort of changed her ambition some young men some people I have a some Vision I'm making blocks I'm gonna make lots of money I'm gonna be the best drug lord there is I'm going to be the the greatest the greater yes the greatest and that's her ambition what a low devilish ambition take their life and use it to destroy others ruin home wrecked marriages ruin little children come on God's want to change your mind you wouldn't be destinated for Destruction you were predestinated to life that's why you're here this morning not to die but to live [Applause] here's a Vine and we're the branches this church should be another Pentecostal Church filled with the Holy Ghost dominated by the spirit of God brother Branham in his prayer Lord at the first church first branch that came forth out of that vine was a Pentecostal Branch filled with the Holy Ghost signs and wonders and fruits of the spirit hanging on that vine in the branch the second Branch comes forth it'll have to be a Pentecostal Branch if it comes out of that same Vine oh Lord May men and women realize that and come back to a true Pentecostal experience of being born of the Holy Ghost and believing in the Supernatural workings that God has promised that his Spirit would do in our midst Hallelujah again if God brought forth his first branch out of that vine was a Pentecostal Branch with power Visions Revelation healing sanctification Holy Spirit the next Branch will be the same see how he says this over and over and over here's his expectation can I say it to you here's what's prophesied over you Hallelujah amen this is what's prophesied over you what I read to you in the Bible of Sarah and John come on Church amount of what Jesus said and and what Isaiah said all these scriptures what I was reading to you it's been prophesied over you yeah when the vine itself puts forth the branch it'll be a Pentecostal Branch full of the Holy Ghost doing the same signs and wonders that they did in the beginning well my church don't believe in that it wasn't so at the beginning my church don't believe in shouting it wasn't so at the beginning my church don't believe in speaking in tongues it wasn't so at the beginning then at the beginning was the Pentecostal Church and he's the vine we are the branches every time that vine brings forth the church it'll be a Pentecostal Church Pentecostal Branch same thing it was at the beginning we got a bunch of churches who call themselves Christian churches but they bear the marks of theology and organization that's different but at the Pentecostal Vine that made a Pentecostal church ever puts forth another Pentecostal Branch it'll be like it wasn't to begin and that's exactly right if Jesus Christ appears in the church he'll be the same as he was back there it won't bear lemons or grapefruits it'll bear oranges if it's an orange tree and it'll put forth its branches it's not to be an organization it'll not be denomination it'll be Christ that vine that brings forth another Branch it will be a Pentecostal Branch with science following the Believers right back to the original brother Branham labors these points all the way to the seals and even in the even in the third seal he says Joel said I will restore all the years everything will Rome made up everything the methodists eat of everything the Baptists ate up and uh and and that original Branch I'll restore it in the last days he comes right along and he said you know we we all have the commonality of being Christian like a citrus but he says you got a fruit but what do you do with it you have a form of godliness and deny the power thereof you deny signs you did not wonders you deny the Holy Ghost you did not speak it in tongues you did not Visions you deny prophecies you deny heal it you call yourself a name no wonder the Holy Ghost said a power of a group of people full of Blasphemous names sure calling themselves Christians with form of godliness but denying the power thereof so now what form is he here if we would look for Jesus today would you look for a man with nail scars would you look for a long robe and long hair and come walking in this building and you know when nail scarves on his hands and feet and say I'm Jesus that's not how he's here he is here in the form of the Holy Ghost let me get it clear to you while we're there you will never see Jesus this side of the Rapture like that now I'm not saying you can't have a vision I'm talking about the physical of Jesus Christ you will never see Jesus like that until the meeting in the era until then he is here in the form of the Holy Ghost his spirit is not a second person of the Trinity or the 30 it is the person the spirit that was in the body of Jesus returned to the church on the day of Pentecost and there he he divided himself and gave each one of you a portion so in this building there's not one Jesus there's hundreds of jesuses sitting right here where God's possessing his people so how will we know him how will we know him this is a 64 quote he says he said the vine energizes the branch and if the branch ever brings forth to the vine breaks forth a branch and has grapes on it the next Vine comes out or a branch out of that vine will have grapes on it if the first church that came out of that vine was a Pentecostal church with all the gifts so oh at the seals it changed no at the seals it's opened amen all the book is made available stop there just for a moment sometimes people look at there and say well brother Tim you know you're trying to emphasize tongues or you're trying to emphasize gifts or you're trying to emphasize shouting or you're listen I I'm just saying that's in the book [Applause] hallelujah it's just it's just as much in the book it's all the Mysteries hallelujah what about the mystery of speaking in tongues you ought to experience it what about the mystery of healing you ought to have it what about the mystery come on church I'm working on Miracles it ought to be in the church [Applause] God has opened the buck and it's a full gospel [Applause] not a partial all of it's there goodness now he said if the first church that came out the vine was a Pentecostal church with all the gifts that was if that ever really puts forth another Branch they'll write a book of Acts behind it and what they had on the days of Apostles and the apostolic age never ended that you are in the apostolic age is still going on now bring it down to your life bring it right down to you personally individually now as a part of the body I want you to get this now we're speaking to the individual you know there's storms that are coming amen but oh I'm glad there's a hiding place amen a blessed hiding place in his Christ but now as you think of that blessed hiding place from Wrath remember there's no two hiding places just one you might be a member of some church can't hide from the devil there he'll get you amen we don't have nothing evil to say about church going go on to church but if that's all you have and your life isn't compared with the book of Acts um if the holy spirit that you profess is not making you live like they did in the book of Acts and your life could write another book you better take warning if the first Branch before the Pentecostal Church the second brancher Vine or Branch rather out of the vine will bring forth another Pentecostal church with a Pentecostal experience bearing the same fruits that the first church had so now we bring it down it's not just pulpit that needs to have the power of God it's the Pew that needs to have the power of God now we bring it down to you the individual you can hide in your seed in the church and say oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah it's there there's power to move hey you know there's Glory oh they're they're shouting there's this but what about you I want you to see not just the church planted by the rivers of Living Water but you're self-planted I want you to see yourself as a fruit Barrel because Jesus is very clear we don't bear fruit he said now if you're bearing fruit he said I'm going to purge you so you'll bear more God wants more fruit is not a good enough for God he wants more now so the tree that God planted it was to Bear nine different and nine different fruits of the spirit nine different kinds which means nine spiritual gifts nine fruits of the spirit that go with nine spiritual gifts that was God's tree and he planted on the day of Pentecost and David saw it and he said blessed is the man then we hear about blessings come on didn't we sing about this is your season blessed is the man amen and he said and this man shall be like a tree that is planted by Rivers plural of Living Water singular amen oh my now not the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran whatever no rivers of one water nine spiritual gifts by The Same Spirit nine fruits of the spirit coming from the same channel you will be like a tree again the church will be like that but you need to see yourself there why is God restoring because the bugs have eaten down you see he was stripped of everything it had all the power all the joy all the good things that God gave it on the day of Pentecost they tore it out what department were made to can't go wormate or what he left the canker worm made and and then the Baptist took shouting away from the mouth of this and one eat this and one that and they stripped the church down until the guests got them sitting dead as a doornail no spirit and I'm quoting brother Branham no Spirit no shouting no joy no peace no healing no nothing don't let that describe your life don't let that describe your church amen one eat this one away one took that away and one took that away and so so if there is a restoration and that was what was taken away then the then it the church a restored church will have it shouting back the joy back the peace back the healing back the nine spiritual gifts back the fruits of the spirit back amen the Mysteries back everything back [Applause] that's a restored tree don't call it restored you just don't snag with no Freedom oh yeah well we got a snag you're dead twice and don't know it let me just say if Luther restored justification back and Wesley restored back sanctification and Azusa restored brought the restoration of the gifts now let me say this if they were restored they must be in the church Apostolic Doctrine must be in the church Paul's gospel has to return to the church again brother Madam would tell us he said one took baptism out one took joy out one took the Holy Ghost out one took healing out one to give South first thing you know you ain't got no more than an old dead Bleak bush standing there but under there somewhere God reserved Life coming on God said but there's still life in Christ and he said I'll have a church listen we will not leave here defeated Kate if he said I'll have a church without that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against we're going to have a church that Satan all won't know what to do with that Satan cannot Prevail against it Hallelujah in other words it won't wall off the promise of God from you you're taking your land and there's wild cities but those Gates of Hell will not prevail amen something's been held back from you this is your season to be blessed this is your season for the outpouring this is a season for the fullness amen and and the church and as long as there's an earth here God will have a church representing him Hallelujah let me read that again as long as there is an earth is there an earth that God will have a church representing him Hallelujah amen God will have a people he'll have a fruitful branch I will restore saith the Lord all the glory of the former days I will restore what the canker warm left I will restore healing I will restore the Holy Spirit I'll restore Joy I will restore everything that the first church had I will restore again in the last days and then he had and we're living in the last days so you're in the season to be blessed Hallelujah remember the burn over force that brother Brandon saw out hunting they reminded him of old dead churches groaning with their high spiers up there and they were just statues there looked like a big graveyard and tombstones and there when the wind blew it was grown and saying days of Miracles are passed and no such thing as Divine Healing and you know because he said the palm of worm ate all the blessings out of the church until there's no more hallelujahs there's no more praises to God there's no more Divine Healing speaking with tongues oh you can't say they're not churches but the life is going out of them they're withered Branch what the method has left the Baptists eat what the Baptist left the Presbyterian and say what the what the Presbyterians left the lutherans ate and brother they got it down taken out healing wouldn't take it out speaking in tongues one taking out all these other things until they ain't got nothing but a big old starchy thing to don't believe a thing the Bible says foreign now that would be a bleak picture but God showed him another group he saw coming up underneath them some little bitty trees Hallelujah amen and he saw the same wind that was causing him to grow was causing these other nephrolic Hallelujah they could Bend and move in the spirit of God and when the Holy Spirit moved they moved with it and they were just shouting and rejoicing oh Rejoice some church Hallelujah hey my mind will restore saith the Lord I want to say we're back [Music] we are here amen there is restored free by message of restoration I want to say brother Branham it wasn't in vain for you to come with a message of restoration let's restore my life it's restored family it's restoring Sanchez it's not in vain let me hear you let you hear from the prophet's word let me tell you brother God's going to raise up a generation of people out of all the debts going to restore saith the Lord I could speak in tongues right now God is going to raise the people who will believe in signs and wonders he's going to raise up people who's got joy unspeakable and full of glory and when the rusty Mighty Wind comes it gives right to it in frolics and dances and glorifies God [Applause] Hallelujah thank you Jesus ready the bark the bark the true and correct Doctrine has to be restored it's important as the Mark is a Lifeline or the sap that the sapphire the life of the tree flows through the Bible is the lifeline that's the spirit of God flows through the word so if the branches tore off the tree we got to get the bark back amen you know you can't have fruit on the tree till you grow the bark you know all you have to do to kill the tree you don't even have to cut it down just wring it all around trip to bark with a Lifeline next thing you know the leaves will wither the praise will be gone the Clapping of the hands are rejoicing come on the tree begins to die and it doesn't bring forth fruit and the scripture God's holy Bible is a Lifeline to any church so we know the Bible is the lifeline the word of God is a Lifeline you had to have the word restored not just shouting not just dancing not just no you got to get the bark back on the tree we got to have the original bark and the only way it can come back is when God grows it himself because men have tried to do it and that's what brother random taught us he said you know they stripped the original Doctrine and then they put a rag of some denominational Creed uh of infant baptism or sprinkling or father-son and holy ghost or you know all these other doctrines and there therefore he said but the Holy Spirit can't flow through the rag this is this is what's happened you know God gave us Restoration in this day and put the back on but then we get a you know this one coming out he's going to be the apostles and he's going to have the Thunders and he's going to be the next great man and you know he strips the true bark off him and then he puts a rag on then you have the Perugia comes along and they do the same thing you know they take away the original truth of the word of God and got to have a teacher now to bring Clarity and and whatever and the next thing you know they put a rag on it but the Holy Spirit won't flow to it that's why you can't have a book of Acts Church amen you got to come back to the original word the original sing that the the prophet of God preached that restored the word of God back to the sage remember only the on the only the power of God can grow it back to its original condition when you have the lifeline that's been cut off then you begin to lose the genuine fruits of patience and long-suffering goodness and meekness and gentleness and the first thing you know and let me just say if there's something comes in your life that cuts the lifeline of the Holy Spirit it won't be no time you lose your joy your peace your gentleness your patience your brotherly kindness and the next thing you'll be falling off the tree dead faith there must be a perfect faith brother Branham would tell us again he said he wanted to eat the fruit of the Faith Off faith in the word look how many times it's been translated this is what he wants to do to you he wants to come along you know with with some worm on a on some worm of a jebusite on a website take your faith away from the word of God from the message of the hour you know I mean sit around and try to pick out flaws of you know why he couldn't be the real Prophet you know he had too many human flaws are you telling me our Prophet was human I say amen he sure wasn't God you say he didn't learn he didn't increase in knowledge come on he was a man you got to understand God that used to man a man declared it amen and many will not believe because a man declared it so then they try to make him God and he wasn't God but he wants to eat the fruit of Faith he wants to cast doubt on the message get you to where you can see a flaw you know that's what he wants to do even the church he wants to point out the flaws in the ministry he wants to show you how human they are how they don't always make the right move you know how how did they you know that that they they're not uh they're just not perfect people you know if you're trying to tell me that I'm not God I'm not I'll help you out amen you know I know I'm not God no preacher is God come on we're humans but God takes the foolishness of preaching amen and uses the man of God to speak under inspiration and to lead the church but then when Satan wants to he wants to cast doubt on he said another one they ought to Aid off of and we've been through some of these but let me just pick it up briefly another he said they ate off the leaves which was Joy the joy of salvation you people make too much noise gets to a point that they don't even want rejoicing in the in the congregation don't want no amens and hallelujahs and glory to God brother Brandon said that's how I can see the spirit is moving amen you and you know what he said I had an old dog he said that wouldn't get after a skunk but he said if I patted him a little bit and said seek Him boy he'd go get after that stinker come on Amen you know it ain't just preaching alone it's the congregation responding back pulling on the gift of God Amen drawing from the fountain Bringing Down the anointing amen we need to hear sick and boy go get that devil you got him on the Run get him Tennessee tear him up restored me the joy of my salvation David cried notice this little Puma weren't beginning to eat the joy out you people make too much noise I can tell all this crime this sailing man is shouting not nonsense there's nothing to it and the first thing you know it's like a lot of message churches sitting around like in a big morgue all of them dead all the way from the pulpit to the back pew listen whatever you want you want to preach your anointed amen you want somebody that can find the flow of the spirit and be anointed by the holy Joseph speak the word of life amen because otherwise the church will just have cold Creeds pumped into them until until they're 40 below zero all right somebody say amen and everybody stretched their neck looking around who in the world is that you know like a goose and becomes a shame you know dean of a Lutheran college and don't don't tighten up on me now as I go down this road here because I I got a point to go Hey Dean of a Lutheran College asked brother Branham about those who shout and scream and kick out window lights said I've been all around and I've seen them kick over the tables and knock over chairs and turn and tear up the furniture and fall on the floor said what is that and brother Branham answered the Holy Ghost how many blasphemers out of there brother Brandon said the Holy Ghost and he said he said the Holy Ghost he said yeah they're blowing their steam all out the whistle instead of putting it together and making the wheels roll see if you'd ever get them to stop down to place and put some of that power in the Steam and the vows and make it push the card and have signs and wonders and miracles and great fire on Soul like that moving out it'd do something but they want to blow it out all out the whistle and that's just all there is to it it said it's good enough to show that got steam anyhow he said if they just knew how to put it to work they shout it all out and they scream it all out he said they're full of fire they're full of the Holy Ghost and they don't know how to settle it down on the word that says it's thus saith the Lord and they blow it all out the whistles and screams and shouts and runs it could ever bottle it down you see a church stand on her feet in power and Glory there'd be a book of Acts wrote behind it they take it out in joy into the power of Faith hold that there and believe it it's God's word stay with it notice what he said if you can only get that thing in operation the enthusiasm moving out you under the wind Souls it conquered the world therefore I think here's what he says are you ready for this I think even where we would call ourselves Pentecostals has failed to represent the real thing that Christ has set forth to represent for us to represent the Holy Spirit and the life of the spirit see we represent sometimes Sensations we represent joy and that's good but there's more to it than that there's a fruit that goes with it that hungry man that is looking for this fruit of the spirit and this is a quality that was in Jesus says they got plenty of steam that make the wheel that they'd make the wheel roll and do something but they'd blow it all out the whistle you see if they just put it down here where put her down here and they'd have signs and wonders and miracles and everything but they don't know what to do with it it's got to go somewhere so they just scream it out or blowing out listen to it now hmm I'd rather be blowing it out than holding it and not have any steam to blow out wouldn't you like the old fellas said I'd like to have a little Wildfire than no fire at all so you say that this Pentecostal Church would take a lot of his praises and put it to work it would do something for the kingdom of God God gave you the Holy Ghost you'd like to Shout by Praise by it but just put it in the gifts and wonders and go out in the street get the Sinners to come in things like that your church will grow and everything will go right along don't blow it out the wisdom put into action make the wheels roll the gospel train Hallelujah can you still a Say Amen but I just want to say some of you have been bound up so long that you just now got where you can even blow it out with steam and Shout and that's okay scream shout run dance the house blow the whistles you have Steam Hallelujah I'm glad they're Steam I can feel the power burning amen I can feel the holy ghosts are moving I can feel it bubbling up on the inside of me Hallelujah Steve Hallelujah it can make me dance the aisles shout and run the aisles and scream the blowers of God but it's also to be put to work let the Holy Ghost take you like that woman sitting on the on the front row in brother Brown's meeting and what's a young mother with a sick baby looking for a seat amen and she she there she watched her look at her seat walking back and forth trying to get a seat where she could get her baby prayed for her and her burden Came Upon her oh oh my I I I I I know brother Brandon was going to pray for that baby but here there's something moving for me to pray for that baby I tell you what I'll do I'll give her my seat so I called over and she called and said listen listen mother you can have my seat but let me do something today you know there's something burning here something burning here it's a fire she's not shouting screaming something's burning here and said hey

prayer line come along and brother Brandon said to her said your baby's already been healed said that woman way up yonder in the top up there prayed for your baby and God's already healed that child Hallelujah wow because a woman put the work of the Holy Spirit she didn't screaming out and sat it down she put it to work amen I say let us shout let us Dance Let Us blow the whistle but let's put it to work that's got to be meant a prayer women of prayer young people with conviction witnessing on the job at school people left by the spirit the old dream and spiritual dream the young seeing visions have you got enough Steam enough to shout put it in a gear and drive down to Deliverance yeah Hallelujah do you hear what it said put it down and put it in gear you feel it burning put it in

blow our heart about that we got a right to give praise and blood and I'm not about to tell you to quit blowing it out the whistle but I want you to know that power that you feel within you will heal

screaming but use that power to defeat the Devil I'm glad you sat down because that means I can preach some more peace of mind is another that I was ate off knowing you're saved knowing you're saved how many people have been stripped to that peace I got a promise for you at that day you shall know foreign the father me and I knew why I actually met him it's no accepting by faith you know it is the the tree is peace of mind knowing that you're saved you know I he's not joining the church and you know you're saved you know our Hail Mary like the Catholics say or you got to have your name on this book well I'd take all the joy out of it you see you know you know brother Brandon's story about The Mule he said he's a hybrid he don't know who his pop and mama is that's a problem with the many people on message pews today they don't know who the pop and mama is but a good pedigree to horse knows who is Papa and mommy is through the generation and a real good pedigree Christian that has the Holy Ghost he knew it fell on the day of Pentecost and he knows where it's at he can trace his Generations back his genealogies to The First beginning of it Peter had it on down to the nation races we they've had it on down a good pedigreed Christian knows where it comes from amen I tell you what you just keep pressing on until you know [Music] well then the locusts come along and wants to destroy a Divine Fellowship that's right you know you didn't think it could happen in the message churches but first thing you know I'm Perugia I'm too Soul I'm seven Thunder I'm this I'm that we got you know he's old Nazarene this oh God's Pentecost talking you know we have nothing to do with them you don't have a meeting for Healing The Sick wall our church don't even believe that seed ain't The Season's heart no no you're wrong it's always in season amen you know so what did he do he cut the fellowship off like I said the canker worm took the took the bark off and first thing you know after he got them all dignified like we were talking about and he took the fellowship away from him form of a locust and now he comes along and they're very religion and makes dogmas out of it the message is not a law the message is the grace of God living in your heart Amen to me but he wants to come and strip that away take the take the the doctrine away brother Brandon said to mark his religion and I just want to say any religion without emotion is dead that's what your Prophet taught it's got to have the motion the the moving of the Holy Spirit through it so then he said the cake a worm next thing it took away was the baptism of the Holy Ghost because if you have that Holy Ghost it's going to shed light on the word so again the first revelation that you must have is to know who Jesus is when you know who he is he does like he did to Peter and thou art Peter amen he reveals to you who you are [Applause] hallelujah amen so there again that's what the new birth is it's a revelation of who God is he's my father I'm his child I am blessed because I belong to him hallelujah amen so so again you know here here would be the canker worm come along and oh he would replace it with a substitute in those days it was a ridiculous substitute this is how far they have strayed away from the book of Acts experience they started with a taking a wafer putting it on the tongue and say receive ye the Holy Ghost drink and then the priest drink the sip of wine the only stimulation it had it the priest got it but you got the Holy Ghost this is how you got it you know the Protestant come along and it was just coming join shake a hand look at Billy Graham's deal you know everybody who wants Christ walked down to the walk down to the front and fit his house and come and move Pentecostal you know instead of having the Holy Ghost they do the same thing you know join you know and come enjoy and shake a hand speak in tongues manufacture tongue you you know what message Community does it tells you you've got the Holy Ghost without knowing it you don't have to have the experience and that's no different than a Catholic communion or Baptist handshaker a church joining amen you know and now there's another personality cult it just says push play and you got it there wasn't somebody coming around and shook a hand in the upper room come on amen no there wasn't somebody come up and say join the church stick out your tongue here comes the sound of the priest down the aisle shuffling his feet and he's got the wine and the bread and says pick out your tongue and received all the ghost that's not how it came no that's not it but but what came down with a sound not of the priest amen by the sound of a Russian Mighty Wind that filled the house where they were sitting amen and it come right down to the leaves and poured over the bark and first thing you know they were all frolicking in the Holy Ghost amen don't you love that amen now as we just look at this for a moment you say but brother Tim but you see we're not in that season you see that was okay for them and that's all right for the back there but today we are in the opening of the word and so you know we have the knowledge of the gospel and the doctrines restored and so we're in the you know the word will open into the word we're beyond all of that and brother Branham said in the Feast of the trumpets brother Joe you read this the other night there will come a messenger in the last day will guide the people back to the first fruit back to the original Faith granted Lord that the great messenger Among Us the Great Christ the Holy Spirit made Vivid made understanding opening up the word and revealing it to us may he guide them back to original Pentecostal faith so think about this again is the opening of the word guides you back to the original Pentecostal faith not something different as he says and why little Bethlehem he said what we need today is an opening of the word that lives I see a lot of this we call an opening of the word to kills amen but we need one that lives somebody with me amen oh yeah they can say whatever they want to call it spiritus devil as long as the word is Flowing free and producing exactly what it's said to do is a fountain in the House of David again back in Bethlehem where that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever to his Bethlehem dwellers live with it live in it it's a life journey in water for us as Israel had a tree planted not happenstance a tree planted by the rivers of Living Water brother Branham told us that are danger in this age was that we had got away from the living fountain notice a restored tree is restored because it is there planted by the rivers of Living Water it's got to house the resource to continually flow I want you to know in the dry times it's there in the in the drought is there in the springtime is there is all the time its Leaf doesn't wither because they're planted in the Fountain of Living Water amen notice again brother Madam would preach the sermon broken cisterns and he says in Jeremiah 2 13 for my people have committed to evil one they have forsaken me and I'm the Fountain of Living Waters and they have done second here's the other evil they have that sisters and then he says even some of them are broken cisterns that cannot hold water now of course again a cistern and then it becomes broken where it just really has nothing but as a cistern you see it's there in a cistern that parasites thrive in that old stale stagnant Waters you see they don't really live in the fresh water of the Holy Spirit that's why they're firmly against the word you see the message because it is a living water and the and and they parasites need a stagnated stream to swim in or wiggle in a stagnant pool are you still with me a stagnant pool becomes a home to wiggle tails unclean spirits like frogs tadpoles snakes and leeches when you see a man that is so filled with bitterness that it drives him out of church has no confidence and a god ordained a god-sent Ministry and criticizes the work of God always finding fault just remember it's an evil spirit that drives someone out of the house of God and it's because they are drinking from a stagnated pool that's why a continued renewing of the Holy Ghost is needed I want you to get it it's needed a continual renewing of bubbling up John 4 and 14 Jesus talked about the water that he provides he says that but who's ever drink into the water I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up springing up everlasting life let me read to amplify it whoever drinks this water that I give him will never be thirsty again but the water that I give him will become in him a spring of water satisfying his thirst for God welling up continually flowing bubbling within him to a eternal life John 7 Jesus again in the last day in verse 37 John 7 37 the last day that that great day of the Beast how many beliefs were here the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried and said If any man thirst let him come to me and drink he that believeth on me as the scriptures I have said out of his belly shall flow Rivers of Living Water amen but this he speak of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive but the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified you see parasites cannot grow in that water they cannot Thrive there bitterness and fault finding it just keeps flushing it out amen keeps flushing it out little Ops against one another keeps just flushing out it can't Thrive there when you've got the Holy Ghost bubbling up it keeps pushing out enmity and jealousy and strife and bitterness and fussing and fighting and quarreling and brings a Unity of the spirit that's why brother Branham told us in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said now he said to love one another no matter what the devil tries to say you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning Satan won't let it stay that way no sir he'll shoot he'll shoot everything if he's got to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbelievery end set him down and cause him to fellowship with you under quietness of things then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff he'll start right through the church with him don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with it you stay right loving and sweet and kind with one another pray for that man that he'll be saved to or that woman whoever it is just pray for them stick close together stay with your pastor he's your Shepherd and you give him your respects he'll lead you through and cause he's ordained of God to do so now you remember that the enemy will come and when he does his clean that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't ever Clan among one another talk make yourself planets we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand he's my left hand I want it to stay there every little chip of my finger I want to stay there I want it to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body believer to stay right exactly with one another right with one another you got the dictates on discipline in the church how we behave ourselves in the Church of God how we come here together sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God's in your heart you can hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time that you get to praying because we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us that much more we see that day approach it to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another and this shall all men know you're my disciples when you have love for the other stay right together and if the brother you think he's a little wrong with his sister you say Lord don't never let me have a root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that'll take the Holy Spirit right from you it'll run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurts your pastor it'll do anything don't you do that you just whacked that much closer together top nights about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you Hallelujah this is what God has said to the church amen what is don't let bitterness come in don't let little odds come in we're all human we're subject to those things but that's what the holy spirit is for to boil that out don't let it take a route amen listen I was in Israel some years ago which is where I got this this topic on the people of the book because the people of the book the Bible the Jews they had returned to the land of the book while we were there we went to the Dead Sea and the Dead Sea is known in the Hebrew as the sea of death is also called The Sea of lot is also called the lake of Sodom the salt in the Dead Sea is as high as 35 percent nearly 10 times more than normal ocean water and all that saltiness is meant there's no life in it no fish no vegetation no sea animals nothing lives in it that Dead Sea that's where it gets his name see just north of there is another sea it's called the Sea of Galilee I ate fish out of that sea I went there and took a boat and I got out in the in the boat there and we were out there where with the testimony on the sea and we played that part of the tape and the spirit of God just come down and we just had a jubilee as we looked around and see him these are the mountains Jesus looked at this is the sea Jesus there's the the towns there's the there's where the maniac was there was this one there's that one there's this all of these Miracles that had taken place and I'm right here in the sea the Sea of Galilee is just North of the Dead Sea both the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee received their water from the same source one of them is that source is a river Jordan but very very different the Sea of Galilee is resplendent with Rich and colorful marine life there's lots of plants lots of fish there's life in it the same region same source of water yet one see is full of life and the other is the Sea of death the water River Jordan flows to the Galaxy of Galilee and it flows out of it you hear what it said it flows in and flows out and that keeps the sea healthy and vibrant and teeming with marine life because it's constantly being fleshed out New Life coming in vigorating water coming in but not only that it's being pushed out and goes out and flows out to water hundreds of Acres elsewhere its light goes out bringing life many other places the Dead Sea takes its water from the River Jordan and it holds it you see it's below sea level and all of it and it has no Outlet so it just all flows into it it's always flowing in and flowing in and flowing in and flowing in and flowing in but there's no Outlet flowing out some people's religion is a Dead Sea that's all they are they're just a collection of quotes scriptures this and that and the other but they're dead there's no reinvigorating life it's not giving birth it's an Optimum with life there's no refreshing coming again flowing through it it's just it just becomes stagnant What flows in it becomes stagnated well I'm trying to get into a picture Jesus said the Holy Spirit would not be like a Dead Sea it would be a river of Living Water let's see now purging out pushing out the parasites pushing out the unbelief pushing out the bitterness the doubt the fear all of that is going to have a flow Hallelujah amen oh yeah the Dead Sea can get choppy when the wind blows but you know you know just dancing ain't gonna do it church it's got to have a flow out what the sick are healed the dead or raised miracles happen Deliverance come we gotta have a Rapture in this age we gotta have a people with not just Faith but a Rapture in faith but I got some good news for you the Dead Sea will not always be dead in Ezekiel chapter 47 and verse 9 it speaks of its restoration too it says swarms of living creatures will live wherever this river flows there will be large numbers of fish because the water flows there and makes the salt water Fresh So Where the River Flows everything will live hallelujah amen I'm telling you I don't care how long you've been dead Hallelujah I will restore saith the Lord Hallelujah I'm gonna throw the Holy Spirit through this bride she will not be a sea of death serious yet life feel pretty much alive your experience with God may have been a genuine experience but you can't let that get old and stagnant [Applause] manner could not last another day it bred worms and stank even though it was real mamma but if you come into the holiest of holies in the Shekinah Glory that same manner would last forever to every Generations parasites of unbelief have got to be flushed out fear parasites of bitterness parasites of complacency and and satisfaction where you just satisfied where you're at all of that's got to be flushed out your mama cannot become stink it must be fresh your River has to flow and if you'll further your experience in the holiest of holies stay in this kind of Glory your Manna will always be fresh but when you get so full of stagnation lovers of stagnation when somebody when we try to when when the word comes and tries to get you respond move in the spirit let it flow through you let it move in your life and you resist you become a stagnated stream broken cisterns see denomination make stagnant pools where men can live with women then women can carry on Cutters hair and swear shorts and everything else and call themselves Christians the same thing can happen in a message community where the church has become a stagnant pool and unclean spirits a pornography and divorce remarriage every kind of unclean spirit is going on but as we close this morning I want to just close on a on a real positive thought and of course as we come to that I want you to remember there's all kinds of things that will try to stop up your will beaver dams that will come that's why preachers have to Beaver beaver dam blowers blow up those dams dams of unbelief and doubt and fear and everything else blow them out with a dynamite power of the word of God and let the word of God flow brother Branham said we got too many Beaver Dam preachers today that once said but he said get the logs out of your experience and I'm closing on this scripture Second Kings 3 19. here's where Elijah told them to to dig the valley full of ditches the more you dig out the deeper you make it the more you get rid of yourself the more the holy spirit is going to flow and fill you is somebody with me now Second Kings 3 19 and you shall Smite ever fence City and every choice City and civil every good tree and stop up all the wells of water and Mar every good piece of land with stones now he's talking about what they're going to do to the enemy after you you did this Valley full of ditches you're gonna have such a victory that you're going to Smite every fence City everything that's been walled off from you every choice City and you're gonna fail every good free and stop up all Wells of water and more every good piece of land with stone now so if you just dig deep enough until this building gets filled with the Holy Ghost and people are healed and filled with the spirit of God and out on the streets of screaming and praising God and giving testimony and everything else you start digging with all your heart there and when you get over into the land with all the non-believers are you're going to take your welcome you're going to take your stone of testimony this is what God did for me he filled me with the Holy Ghost about this is my testimony and we're going to stop at those Wells of doubt and I believe parasites come on somebody amen we're going to see the Holy
