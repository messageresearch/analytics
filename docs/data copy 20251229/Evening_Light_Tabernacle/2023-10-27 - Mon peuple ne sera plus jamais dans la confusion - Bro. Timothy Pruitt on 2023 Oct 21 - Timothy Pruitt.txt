prayers amen keep keeping them we keep them in our prayers we don't have any news about the funeral and so on maybe brother FR have but you know the the word of God tells us if one of the members is suffering the whole body body suffers amen and that's what we are seeing now when somebody is suffering going through hardship the whole body is suffering amen but we are a blessed people amen also there's a change in plan as I said for those who didn't hear it a precious brother Donny Reagan his daughter sister ER Parker went to be with the Lord she was young 42 years leaving behind her two sets of twins 16 and 18 years but God doesn't make mistakes and certainly we want to uphold them so our precious brother Tim puit was torn apart he was coming here but then his best friend brother Donny Reagan they're best friends for many many years and in moments like these you need your buddies so he will be doing or being part in the funeral service tomorrow so if we can keep them all in our prayers amen maybe you never met brother Tim never met Brother Don but we're the same family amen so certainly as I said God Don't Make Mistakes I know the load is heavy for our precious brother Timothy but God knows everything when we lose control he never loses control listen was as I was just thinking and seeking Lord may I have some some words words of of encouragement even when I sent out the invitation the Bible verse came to my my mind we all know it by heart Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother BR says in the evil age that we are living in now we are here to prove to Satan that we are not like the first Eve [Music] hallelujah amen and she will be tried the bride will be Tried by the word amen every bit of the word the first Eve got confused on one word that he's the same yesterday today and forever but not the second bride saints of God we see prophecy being manifested before our eyes amen Israel is in the Homeland the bride has made herself ready brother BR says the uniting time and sign finishing God is uniting his bride she's coming together from the East the west north and south there's a uniting time and it's on right now Hallelujah that's what these meetings are about what is she uniting for the Rapture amen maybe we lost a beloved brother a precious sister soon and very soon we'll be together amen even brother Brenham when he saw his daughter who are you young sister amen soon and soon very soon we'll spend eternity together that's why we are uniting together now what with the word of God Amen for all heavens and earth shall pass

family very happy to be here with my wife and my family two sons and two daughters and now a son-in-law and two daughter-in-laws so we're all happy to be here with you to bring our lick of fire and put it together with your Li so Lord willing we'll have them have them sing maybe this evening for you sing a song or two or three or four amen but it's good to be with you amen God bless you Joel chap 2 verse 23 says be glad then ye children ofj in the Lord your God for Heath given you the former rain moderately and he will call to come down for you the rain the former rain the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the canker worm theer the P worm my great Army which I sent and you shall plenty and be satisfied and praise the the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your godone else and my people shall never be ashamed amen amen God bless you be seated well if you notice he says this word this this phrase two times my people shall never be ashamed now God doesn't make mistakes he doesn't stutter or just repeat himself for no reason but when he says something and he says it again it has a meaning to it and he has a reason for saying it he wants to put an emphasis on it that my people shall never be ashamed I would like to speak to you that on that this morning my people shall never be ashamed in other words they will not be put into confusion or another meaning or be disappointed amen for he says I will restore all the devil has stole from you amen I believe that we have received a message of restoration it's a message that says I will restore your health I will restore your peace I will restore your joy I will restore your children man all the years the devil has taken and made a wasteland out of I'm going to send my rain and from that dry and Barren Earth life will spring up again amen I believe God is not going to leave you where he found amen you might feel Barren today lifeless amen but God has a rain that rain is his word and he sends his word amen and so the Devil comes and he tries to kill harm and Destroy he tries to take life he tries to strip off the power of the church but God says I will have a bride I will have a church I will have a people amen so no matter what the devil does or what the devil say says I will have a people amen another word another meaning to this word of shame it means a drying up of a land or a stream amen this is why he said I'm going to send my rain because the land is dry amen the moisture has been taken from but I'm going to send a rain amen and when when a land dries up uh you know if it's a wet land you know wet so it begins to dry the fish begins to Die the vegetation begins to die and from that from that death comes a stink because of all the rotting matter and it gives off a real bad odor and this is what your life was when it was dried up it stunk it gave off a bad order but God sends his rain and from that Dy land amen Life Starts springing up amen life comes forth and what was withered is now coming to life what was ashamed and Confused is now brought back to his right mind now we want to find out why was this land in this condition and we can read in Joel 1 and verse 10 it says the field is wasted and the land mourneth for the corn is wasted and the new wine is dried up and the oil languishes be ye ashamed oh ye husband men how oh ye Vine dressers for the wheat and for the barley because the Harvest of the field is perished the the vine is dried up and the Fig Tree languisheth the pomegranate tree the palm tree the apple tree and all the trees of the field are withered because Joy is withered away from the sons of men see Winds of different doctrines had blow through the land and the husband men or the men that was over the land they allowed those winds to kill the movement of the spirit they allowed it to dry up the flow of the word of God Fields were perished but said my floor my floor will be overflowing with a harvest so it doesn't matter what man decrees or what man says God's word says I'm going to have a bride I'm going to have a people I'm going to have a bride without spot without R amen and it's going to overflow with wheat the wheat is the word of God and it's going to over flow with wine there will be word and there will be stimulation Revelation hallelujah amen Amen brother Bram taught what the wine and the oil represented in the Bible he spoke about it in the third seal he said the oil simplifies the Holy Spirit the wine symbolizes stimulation of re Revelation he said I almost w woke up the neighborhood when the Lord showed me that stimulation of Revelation all and wine is always represented together amen amen he said when the truth of the promised word of God the wheat amen has been truly revealed to his Saints those that are filled with oil they will get stimulated amen wine is a stimulation he says Glory I right now stimulated with joy stimulated with shouts this wine has the same effect on a man who drinks natural wine he said because when the Revelation has been given of the truth of God and the True Believer filled with all and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great it makes him behave himself unnormal amen un normally in other words you're not going to be normal amen I don't know about you but I don't care about being a normal person amen I don't want what the world says is nor that is normal to be you know your hair all different colors and to dress all kind of ways and to live all kind of way that might be their normal I am unnormal this is not my home this is not my land this is not where I belong I'm going to where I belong Hallelujah and when I get there I'll be normal hallelujah amen shout on the hills of glory amen amen he said if you want scripture for that he said just start reading acts two when the promise of the Holy Ghost was poured out on them he said you know maybe one of them said we he told us to wait here for our ministry maybe Mark said to Matthew well we've already got it don't you think so we already got it we ought to just go preaching and said no we're not we we ain't there we haven't got it yet and he said I can see Peter wait a minute the scripture says you stay there until you stay there until Joel's prophecy comes to pass until Isaiah's prophecy with stammering lips and with other tongues speak to this is the refreshment this is the wine that's being poured out what is wine in the B refreshment this refreshment comes from the presence of almighty God Amen wine representing stimulation of Revelation and when the Holy Ghost fell they seen the fire of God upon and that begin to stimulate them first thing you know is stimulated them to people thought they were drunk come on now they thought they were drunk I want you to understand God wants us to have more than a head knowledge more than education it's more than degrees we can hang on our wall but it's a life of Jesus Christ coming into the believer to fill you to change you to move you from who you was hallelujah amen amen you so well you know Mary received it without sensation no if you read that brother Brandon was talking about when when when Mary met the angel amen that wasn't when she received the Holy Ghost that was when she got pregnant but if you'll read what he said about her receiv the Holy Ghost she was in the upper room and she got drunk and she came out staggering just like all of the others hallelujah amen amen listen we want more than just the head knowledge we want more than just scriptures we want more than just quotes but it's a live voice it's a live voice amen a live voice that tell Satan take your hands off of God a live voice that'll look that devil in the eye say devil I'm not going to serve you no but I'm going to serve a Liv I want to serve him amen we're not here to bring you into some uh education but we're here to bring you to a place that can stimulate you Amen to a place of Revelation amen you'll go home he said I know who I am I am a Son of God amen amen amen when you see him Vindicated among you and it happens to start something on the inside hallelujah amen amen but you notice amen he said it in the he said he said touch not the oil and the wine in the third seal brother Bram said who said that he said the lamb said that it wasn't just the four Beast that said the lamb said so if the lamb said don't hurt the old and the wiow don't stop it up let it flow let stimulation of Revelation begin to flow into every heart every life hallelujah amen if I can get you to understand you're not just some trotting down nobody you're a son and bought with a price call by the name of Jesus Christ it'll start stimulating you it'll start changing your thoughts hallelujah amen he said that's the reason I like these four gospel conviction is that what we're in a Full Gospel convention I want the full gospel he said you hear people cry and Shout praise the Lord you hear people cry and shout and praise the Lord God and because they've come into Fellowship Divine fellowship with the Holy Spirit whenever you get rid of that you gone back to Babylon and you might as well bury yourself when we get to the place we get away from the Shana Glory that Praises of God that fresh anointing that breaks down all religious barriers makes us one with Christ Jesus free from all condemnation that's what we need to he said I found in these conventions in places where men and women they are not ashamed they are not ashamed of the Gospel they're ready to testify about sing about it shout about it he said I've even heard them speak he said you don't hear it much anymore a while they don't you ever lose that don't you ever lose that if you ever lose that and get to a place you're ashamed to go into a relationship with let him dwell in you God in man making himself known to you to the People by his Spirit a royal priesthood Nation a pecul people odd different from the world Sanctified from the set aside from the wow that's good preaching right there he said it what will it do it'll save a man from sin it'll clean a person up it'll make them a new creature amen it'll take the shamness away from it'll take the backwardness away from you he said I've seen a little woman so bashful someone can come knock on the door she'll just back her head away but you let her get to an altar and the sh Glory fall she'll stand there and testify give such a testimony it will shake the shingles house she's coming into the presence of met somebody that's life is a new thing he's no more a coward because she's come in fellowship with Christ but see Satan is always trying to cut off the flow of the spirit you know we go through difficulties in life and we become dry we lose the joy brother Brandon would speak about the desert and he said in Arizona in the United States in Arizona there's not much rain so everything's dried up and when it gets dried up it gets stickers on it it's always poke yeah it always pokes it hurts he said everything out there is like that because there's no rain every weed has a pin on it amen then you take them weeds and you come to a place there's a lot of rain and there's no sticker on it he said that's a good lesson he said if the church is all dry and no spirit in it they got a lot of stickers amen but what we need is a good old Holy Ghost old fashion Holy Ghost rain it'll just soften you up it'll just soften you up he said the church can't do it itself it takes God to do it but you know what's happened the water line has been cut off that's the reason we got all the church fusses we got you take that kind of plant and you put them in a desert it'll get a pin on it amen you take that same plant you put it with a lot of water it gets soft again he said that's what's matter with a lot of churches glory to God glory to God I'm this I belong to this and I belong to that see you're L you got a lot of stickers your water supply is gone that's just what's the matter the water has been cut off you don't do you don't have the things you used to have years ago the Miracles and things are not in the church the fellowship and the feeling is not there like he said what's the matter the glory spring that led to your Hallelujah Garden is cut off I say let's open it up let's unclog It Whatever stopping it upen take something as it start moving if it's bitterness pull it out if it's unforgiveness say God I want that I want that flow Glory Hallelujah am I want that glory spr amen that come across my garden again flowers begin to grow hallelujah praise Lord Let the Rain Fall Let the Rain Fall you say what brother Timothy you must not understand what's going on in the news this world is falling apart no actually if you look at it this world is falling into place uh Sodom and Gomorrah is in their place the world systems are getting in their place religious and and economical they're all moving in their placeel is in her place so is the Bride of Jesus Christ amen so it doesn't matter what the news says amen what fox news or CNN or whatever you listen to I have some news amen it's the good news I have news this morning it's good news it's the gospel it's still the same yest it's still an effect it doesn't matter what the world is doing and what's going on around us we still have good news amen we have a reason to praise God God so maybe this morning you got up with your head all down and you're all depressed and anxieties and fears turn to Psalms 34 Verse one hallelujah amen let's see what we're supposed to do amen Psalms 34 I Will Bless The Lord at all times did I read we read that right I will bless the Lord all all time amen two time yeah I Will Bless The Lord times amen whether I'm happy whether I'm sad whether I'm down whether I'm up whether it's good news or bad news all times his praise shall continually be in you say well it's not my culture well you know the Bible has something for that too it says Praise You the Lord All Ye Lands All Ye Lands All Ye Lands so you have no you have no right scripturally to not praise the Lord amen amen I'm not saying every one of you got to run up and down but praise God give him glory give him the honor he give him what belongs don't hold back allow him to come amen amen my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad oh magnify the Lord with me I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me and they

know didn't know what to preach so so they had went with the sister uh sister hildbrand to shop a little bit and I was in the hotel room I'm just praying God I W you know there as these brothers know you can there's a lot to preach but you want to preach the right and so I was just asking God to direct me to the right place so I began to read about the woman who touched him daughter had the blood and as I begin to read it the presence of the Lord fell into it's almost like the room just lit up so I take I took that thought on who touched me and I preached it that night well there was a young man who had been raised up in the church and they had a lot of issues and things I don't know the whole story and he left when he's about I think 12 or 13 years old now he's in his 30s and he's married and his wife he marries gets diagnosed with Ms yeah yeah and so he he he's asking God to be merciful and so he he comes he said look he said I know where God's at she she was not a message believer at all wouldn't really really anything of course Christianity he said but we've got to we've got to get to God and I know where he's at so he came to that first and before he came he went into his bedroom and he knelt down he said Lord I've left you a long time ago and I've been away from you but if I can just touch the of if I can just touch you tonight I know you can make her well and here I come and I begin to speak on who touched me God already had the answer he heard the cry he heard the heart and he was already there Hallelujah he's already here for this meeting he knows
