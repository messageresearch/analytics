our times of difficulties lord father we have dressed ourself in battle of peril and we come tonight to hear from the word of god and we just asked oh god as you would visit us time and time again god you have been ever so faithful to your people and we just invite you right now lord come father and loose the lips of the minister to speak the words of life lord and not only that but loose the ears of the hero to receive father we thank you for this opportunity tonight lord and lord we don't want to draw any credit to ourself but we want to give you all the honor and the glory and the praise and we pray lord you'll just be the speaker tonight move now father those here locally those on the stream god made your holy spirit just go out to them and minister to their knees tonight for we ask these things now in jesus name amen and amen if you have your bibles tonight we're going to turn to psalms 34 and as you're turning there just want to say we're glad to have brother tim brother timothy and their families home now come on we can do better than that we're glad to have our pastor and our assistant passing their families home amen i've sure enjoyed the word of god this past sunday brother aaron did an outstanding job and just so thankful we got a wonderful ministry here uh you know when when the first string and the second string are out being used god's able to still feed his flock and we're so thankful that we can be a part of that and we sit under a great ministry and great leadership and we sit under the holy spirit tutelage and we thank the lord for that but we look here in psalms 34 and verse 19 and the bible was tell us that many of the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all you can have your seats this evening and i want to speak to you once again on god does impossible math uh i hope you're not tired of hearing that obviously you can't be um we want to we want to look at god's purpose will not be defeated part two so and i want to kind of focus maybe a little bit you'll hear me chime in here on unbroken we spoke last time on god's purpose not being defeated but i want to kind of draw an emphasis this week on you know god's purpose will not be defeated but his people will not be broken god's purpose will not be defeated but his people will not be broken you will remain unbroken by whatever this life can throw at you and we find here that the bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous and that word affliction there means bad times it means disagreeable times malignant times unpleasant pain unhappiness misery displeasing now how many of us can testify that we have faced those times in our life we have faced those times of affliction when things were not going our way and in times of difficulty and it seems like every day you woke up was a bad day but we also find the scripture would tell us but the lord delivereth him out of them all so no matter what you're facing in this life no matter what the journey that you're on and no matter what the difficulties that you're enduring right now god is going to deliver you from your present condition where you're at right now is not an eternal condition it's not only it's not your earthly condition that you got to stay in this situation for an indefinite period of time but god will deliver you from that as we heard last week that god let job be purged so he can bless job and i believe god has got a people on the earth that he's going to allow them to be put to the test to prove to the devil that this bar will not fall like that first bride fell so no matter who you are no matter how good of a christian you are we all have afflictions we all go through trials even the ranking center has good days and bad days i remember when i was out in the world i had good days i had bad days and no different for us being a believer we have good days we have bad days none of us are free from the pressures and hardships of this life satan does not care who you are he does not care who you are but we find we have a promise as a believer though that god's going to deliver out of them all brother branham would tell us in the message the un uh be certain of god he said this body that we dwell in perishes regardless of how it's taken care of but it's the soul that's in man it's a condition of the spirit that moves into the presence of a living god that we take this body some of us we take our bodies every day and we take it to the gym and we put it through rigorous work and we we're lifting weights we're pumping iron we're trying to max out and man we're doing all these things and we're trying to define and sculpt our muscles come on some of you young brothers we do this but at the end of the day when your life is over you're gonna perish your body is going to perish this body is going to appear and some of you maybe you don't feed it uh the weights but maybe your feeding it herbs and vitamins and all these other things you got a healthy diet that you're on and yet the body still gets sick it's still going to perish but it's the soul that's received the spirit of god that will never perish so no matter what happens to this outward man here it's the inward man that we're concerned about this out where man's going to face difficulties this outward man is going you're going to wake up and there's going to be days that this body that you dwell in is going to embarrass you it's because every day is going to be a day that it gets more crippled and more uh more more ached in pains and different things of that nature but it's the soul of man that's been occupied by the baptism of the holy ghost that'll take a man from the this earthly realm that we're living in now and bring you up into a heavenly atmosphere it's where this body will never die and that's what we're longing for that's what we're looking for but the prophet of god said you got to be certain of god when you're in your hard times when you're in your difficult stages of life when you're cleaning out sewer pits things of that nature and it's all backed up for 300 feet you got to believe in god that and be certain that he is that god brought you to that trial god brought you to that mess and not only did he bring you to it but god is going to bring you through it and you're going to be a better christian when you get to the other side he says when we've done what we know is right when you've met his requirements when you've confessed and made right and done restitutions and laid it before god i don't care how silent he is he's still god now how many you've ever been in that trial and you prayed and prayed and prayed and it seems like god remains silent god just doesn't answer god i mean come on i'm your servant i'm your son i'm your daughter i go to church i serve you i get up i have my devotion my quiet time and yet it seems like god is a 100 million miles away and he's silent that's when you got to be certain that he's god that's when you got to know that it's not based on what you do but it's based on who he is and what he says he will do he says you've done your works now he wants to see your faith by your works he wants to see what you will do if you've been anointed and prayed for god's waiting to see what you'll believe about it not run up next sunday and run the next day until the next healer comes through the city he's waiting to see your reaction on your faith not walk back the next day and say well i feel so bad you know you come up for prayer and things don't get any better come the next service and first thing you want to do the you come up for prayer and you come up for prayer and you come up for prayer god is ready to test your faith believe on the first prayer that he's god and he heard you you don't have to keep making trips to the altar to get prayed for just trust god and that's what the prophet of god is saying here you ain't got to wait till their favorite preacher comes or or the next healer comes in no believe god be certain that he's god believe his promise if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's the word of god it's an eternal work and it has promises if you can just have the faith or latch hold to it god will not fail you he says you've been prayed for well i feel so bad i don't guess i got healed he says you're not fit for the prayer line in the first place you're not right you're not ready yet you don't believe that he's god first thing you do i walk away and i want to quit nobody understands me they don't understand my plight they don't understand what i'm going through if they just knew what i was going through maybe they would it doesn't really matter this is not the time to quit this is not the time to walk away this is not the hour to give up this is the time to hold the line this is a time to fight harder than you've ever fought in your life because we're about to break through and enter into the heavenlies this world can't go much further church i don't know if you've been paying attention to what's going on all around us and i'm not here to talk about politics but for crying out loud this ain't the place for the believer to remain in nor do we want to stay here but we find the conditions are getting just right so that the people will cry for a savior they'll cry out for a deliver lord deliver us from this egypt that we're in we don't want to stay here another minute god but come and take us he says when you openly confess that god is the same god in your life applied in his hands to be lord i am the clay the outdoor potter then ask what you will faith will never move it'll stand right there those circumstances seem to fall from right and left but that faith never moves because you're certain that he's god and if he's god he keeps his promise he can't make a promise and break it if he's god he's got to keep his promise i think we have had in this hour a perfect example that's been laid before all of us i know we we go to it often but i think we have to because he was given a commission or he was given a promise if you will trust me with your life i will use you like never before how many could god ask you that question and every sunday you stand behind the pulpit and you preach with such passion such power such anointing such a glow across your face not down in the dumps not in the molly grubs not woe is me but you're preaching a people up building their fate up that god is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him and he there he is in the condition i listen to sunday's service and brother brown was just going on about the ordeal that he had on thursday at the the doctor's office it was one of the worst ordeals he's ever faced and he left and i hope he doesn't mind but he left the hospital crying like a baby just got in the car and began to bawl to sister connie and yet stood there on sunday morning and you would never know what kind of week he had because why he was certain who god was when god gave him a promise ron spencer if you will trust me with your life i will use you like never before and i believe that even like tabernacle and the bride around the world can testify they have seen the hand of god move this man and use this man under such a special anointing for what to declare to you church no matter how bad it gets god is still god and nothing that the devil will do will defeat god's purpose and the bride of christ will not be broken she will not be broken no matter what test she goes through how severe cancer is she's unbreakable she's unbroken and she will remain unbroken by the effects of laodicea he says oh how satan likes to throw that at you why you're no better than you were when you were anointed how many's ever told you that slipped in on monday morning because you were still feeling the the difficulties of life you woke up and seems like nothing changed well you're no better off than when you were when they prayed for you when they anointed you you're no better off when those preachers pray for you them preachers ain't right in the first place you know i'm satan to tell you that young man come on you get to know brother joe you know his good side is bad side don't amen that but you begin to realize that we're all human and we all have human tendencies there's no cherubims here tonight some of you look like cherokees but we know the truth but we find he and the devil would try to put that over well well i've seen him at like this so i guess his prayer doesn't work and those preachers not right to begin with the brother the prophet of god will tell us it doesn't matter about that preacher it's your faith in the living god what mounts see it's your faith to believe that god gave the promise god's obligated to the promise see it's not what the preacher is it's what god is the preacher never made the promise god made the promise it's not up to the preacher it's up to god and your faith to believe what he says and for ron spencer he said if you trust me with your life i will use you like never before look when he had his first chemo treatment he didn't give up he didn't walk away though he may have felt that way but he stands in the test he's holding the line what is he declaring he's declared to the body that this message works church it'll keep you in your bad times it'll keep you in your breaking point but you can't be held by broken chains you won't be held because god is holding you already the bible will tell us in romans 4 16 speaking about abraham and we ended last wednesday on abraham and sarah we'll pick back up there just for a minute i'm not going to go in to great detail like we did last time but therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace and this is uh four in verse 16 to the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed that includes you not to that only which is of the law but that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead noticed now in abraham speaking of he calleth those things that were not as though they were you know how hard that is do you understand how difficult it is to call those things that is not as though they are when you get up and your body is ravishing in pain to claim that you're healed my father-in-law jerry show me you remember brother jerry every day he woke up and every time he was around him the man fought for every breath to breathe and yet every minute every of every day he said thank you lord for healing me that was his confession he never confessed to waywardness he never not waveredness but he never confessed the results that he was feeling in his body and in his life his dying breath he still trusted god because he was certain that the one that did a work in his life will hold him in his final moments and abraham here he was he called those things that were not as though they were against hope he believed in hope he'll do what's good to believe a little bit tonight maybe the trials that you're going through you can believe that he's god and be certain that he is god then it may make the the cares and the worries and all the the things that you're going through maybe just be so trivial and just dissipate away for he was against hope he believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and in verse 19 and being not weak in faith he considered not the deadness of his own body here he was 75 years old already five years past the allotted time and yet god gave him a promise at 75 abraham you're going to have a son not only are you going to have a son i'm going to make you the father of nations this man only didn't look down and his knees hurt his back hurt he had prostate troubles i mean he had all kind of difficulty he was 75 years old but he trusted god or it looked unreasonable it looked foolish but god gave the promise and god doesn't care about your age god doesn't care about your condition god's determined do you serve me will you believe me i'll give you the promise will you trust me with your life i'll use you little bride like never before i'll declare the laodicea i'll have a young person that'll rise above pornography and arise above video games and worthless living they'll rise above the cares of this life being not weak in faith being not tossed about by every little wind every little difficulty every little trial now i'm not making light of your trial i'm just making big who our god is because i believe we face difficult moments we all have been there and if we're not there we're going to be there but see abraham had a lot of things working against him his age was working against him the frailness of his body was working against him the deadness of sarah's womb was working against him sarah's unbelief not able to see herself in the promise was working against him yet the bible says he staggered not he looked away from his body brother aaron doctors can't figure it out what's going on he looked away from it and he looked to the promise he looked away from the nagging wife couldn't see herself in the promise he looked away from that said god no matter what i believe you said i'm going to have a son and you said it's going to come by sarah he staggered not at the promises of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and maybe you're here tonight and you know yours are a lot of things that you're facing maybe the doctor's report is against you maybe your health is working against you maybe your age is working against you maybe unbelief and doubts are working against you maybe the thoughts of your past and past failures are working against you maybe it's reasoning and nervousness they're working against you but instead of looking at all these things that are working against you how about look at who's working for you and if god be for you little bride then nothing could be against you oh brother joe you don't understand i don't have to understand i got a great big god that understands i got a great big guy that knows the blueprint of my life and he knows he's brought me here but that ain't my final resting place god is gonna bring me into a heavenly atmosphere god is gonna bring this body let me be frail and he's gonna come one day and change it back to a young man that's the promise of god the bible will say that abraham was fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform oh he's the same god today brother hell he's still able to perform and therefore was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also you're included in the promise with abraham with sarah no matter what you're facing no matter what you're going through you got to be fully persuaded fully persuaded god thank you i know what i used to be i know what i used to do i know the life i used to live and i can tell you satan didn't transform that life into this life so it can only tell me and declare to me hey god you that started this work it was your handiwork and we're the craftsmanship of your hand and we know that if you started it you're gonna bring it all the way into the perfection that you had in your thoughts in your mind and that's where we're headed problem will say faith is ridiculous to everybody but god and the one that has it faith is ridiculous they don't see what you see they can't see what you see because you look past what the eye can see you you you feel past what the body feels and you look you look to the promise you look to the one that gave the promise oh the believer that receives it it isn't ridiculous to him because why because by it's the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that you can't see taste smell fill and hear but he knows it's there it's not ridiculous to him because why it's just as good as done god said it i believe it and that settles it i don't have to debate with the devil about it i don't have to argue god's point god said it i believe it that settles it the case is closed dismissed so you might as well back off devil but see he knows that god told it talking about the believer that has faith and god said it and that's enough for him so when you're facing what may seem an impossibility you know that you know that you know that you know that god still does impossible math let me tell you there's no teacher that's going to come behind him and correct his mathematics he's got the answer and the prophet of god will come and tell us we had the answer to the devil's question he's constantly questioning you putting you through the test to see who you are we have the answer the headship has come oh come on church we find here he goes i like to see somebody to take their unbelief and stop the sun anybody want to try that tonight take your unbelief and stop the sun he said by faith joshua did see but your unbelief will get you nowhere and we find in hebrews 11 and verse 11 through faith also sarah received strength to conceive and was delivered of a child when she was past the age because she judged him faithful who had made the promise by faith through faith so faith is the anchor point church you got to look past what you see what you smell what you feel what you think and you got to have faith faith is what ties you to god and sarah she couldn't see herself in the promise but through faith she received strength when she judged declared considered him faithful that word judge there means to be the ruler means to have authority over to be the chief leading as respects of influence controlling in counsel so when she recognized that god had control of the situation she then received strength to bring forth the promise and when you can ever catch the revelation that god is in control of your life every detail every aspect he's the control and influence of your life and though you may be in the worst difficult moment it's not by mistake god has brought you there for a purpose and when you judge him faithful the blessings will follow see it wasn't until sarah judged him faithful considered him as the leader that she was able to conceive and bring forth the promise it wasn't until she declared him to be the chief to have victory over the circumstances of her old age and her body her paps dried up her womb dried up dead not able to give life but yet when she looked past her body and passed the situation and she judged who he was and who gave the promise that's when she could receive the body change and when we look past everything that's going on around us and we look to the one that promised a bridal rapture and we look past our frailness and our humanity and our disappointments and difficulties then we too will be made young again think about it 25 years sleepless nights long days wrestling with doubts and unbelief will i ever bring this baby cannot ever see yourself in it daily fighting with depression anxieties satan doing all that he can to hinder the plan of god satan doing all that he can to break her and break her will to get her to turn around and walk away yet satan didn't have enough see he was relentless in his assault on sarah and her mind to keep her from seeing herself in the promise his purpose was not to break her or his purpose was to break her and it was also the purpose to block the blessing of god and so she had hardships so she had her testing though she had our trials though she had her difficulties but when she recognized that she was a part of the promise there was nothing that could stop that child to come and when you little bride recognize that you're tied to this promise there's nothing can stop you no matter what you're facing no matter what you're going through when you recognize that everything that he did he did it with you and mine and not only did he do it with you and mine but he called you his bride he says i no longer call you a church i call your bride let me tell you that's what he's declared of you tonight you may see yourself in your sickness or you may see the frailness of your humanity and maybe you see your disappointments but he sees his bride being manifested on this earth through your mishaps he's called you no matter what he needs ordained you in this hour to rise above it all oh we're not gonna fall church we're not gonna go down like the first bride went down we're going up in a body change we've been seen in a vision think about sarah here elohim comes and visits them in the tent and she laughs at them and the prophet of god said abraham he had failures but he couldn't take the church and he can't he can't kill the elected therefore he can't kill you because you're a part of him and if he can't kill you because you're a part of him what do you think the devil why do we give him clout why are we worried about what he can do if god himself will not destroy us because our union with him he's not going to let the devil get away with his assaults on his bride think about what the prophet of god will tell us in the message the revelation of jesus christ and he's speaking about satan and he says now he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church otherwise you catch the revelation that you're included in this promise you're the one that's going to receive a body change you're the one that's going to manifest the word for this hour when you can see the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army not broken not defeated invincible we have had a vindicated prophet coming this hour brought us rapture and faith through a message of grace tied up to loose sins revealed the seals that was on the back of the book and here he's telling you what the devil knows about you he's declaring to you what the devil knows about you that some of you sarah can't see yourself in the promise yet but he knows what's laying on the inside oh and what did he say he says now oh i love this and she can catch that true revelation and discern and withstand that antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her there's nothing can break you there's no ordeal can break you there's no cancer can break you there's no loss of loved ones can break you there is nothing that can break you because you are an invincible army undefeatable but you got to catch the revelation that i'm tied to the promise god is not complete without you and everything that he has done every message that he has sent every word that's ever been preached by anointed man of god is for that account so that you can see yourself in the promise oh church you are that invincible army that's what you are that's not what you will be it's what you are now now we are the sons of god now he says he couldn't take sarah on account of abraham and he can't take the church on account of christ see in all of the mistakes it's still his church that's right he can't take it because he'd take christ and she's a part of christ she becomes flesh of his flesh bone of his bone all of our ins and outs unbeliefs and so forth and scruples as long as she's into that body her ups and downs the grace of god still holds her i say thank you lord thank you though my soul be converted this frail body has its ups and its downs it has its good days and bad days but nevertheless god still holds it see god had a mystery in his mind before the foundation of the world and we find that i know we touched on some of this last week but we're going to touch it on and just keep going forward here but he said god had a secret a mystery in his mind and he says that it's it was a kept secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it and he said that's the one thing that he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come that's the mystery and we find the colossians even the mystery which had been hid from the ages and from generations but now has made manifest in his saints here can you tie this mystery this great secret that he had to whom god will make known what is the riches of his glory of the mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory so the mystery of his coming is his coming in bride form through your failures he's here through your disappointments he's manifesting himself through your sickness and fairness of your body he's manifesting himself a living god christ's a mystery and the prophet of god will say that christ had a threefold purpose and the first thing he wanted he wanted to reveal himself to a people he wanted to express himself completely god in christ then second to have preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride until he could have preeminence to express himself through them god's desire is to express himself through your life and he thought it not robbery to be equal with god then why do we consider it robbery to be equal with him he's wanting to express himself through the old through the young to the middle age to the adolescent god expressing himself that was his threefold purpose that's why he allowed the fall because he wanted to be a savior a redeemer he wanted to express himself in a way then he wanted to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that failed by sinning by the first adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with the people and he talked with them in fellowship with them god is taking us back to that place see you have been made for a purpose and that's to express or to allow god to express himself in the form of humanity christ's secret mystery was his coming in his earthly bride so you're here tonight and maybe you think well i'm just a mistake mom and dad told me i was a mistake you're not a mistake you may make mistakes but you're not a mistake you may fumble but you're not a failure you're not some joe blow off the street just wandering through life just barely getting by god has called you you're not somebody just happened to hear a message no you ordained predestinated to hear this message you are the elect of god called chosen anointed and the prophet of god will say you are the very heart purpose of god you are the heart purpose of god now how many of you brothers here really love your wives you really love your wife man the first time you laid eyes only your heart skipped several beats think about god you're the heart purpose of god not only did his heart skip a beat but he left all the glory that he would come to redeem his purpose man what a god what a savior you know some of you brothers you may take a bullet for your wife some of you you may not i don't know i don't know what kind of wife you're living with but move on brother aaron said exactly but god was willing to strike his hands out god was willing to spend three days in hell god was willing to declare himself to victor and rose again on the third day for you because you mean that much to god that he wasn't going to allow his purpose to be defeated he wasn't going to allow his brides to get to the last age and be broken by anything that the devil could do he was determined that he was going to raise her up he was determined that he was going to have a bride without spots without wrinkle without blemish though she may have human failure she is perfect because he's perfect and she's tied to him oh what a god we serve what a god we have in this hour oh church you may feel like giving up don't give up hold the line he's coming he's there he's here to lift you up if you can only realize who you are that's what i've been preaching to you this service so far in last week is to get you to connect yourself to the promise you can connect yourself to the promise he'll look away from the awful effects of this life this life ain't getting any better i mean come on your trial is different than my miles different than yours some of us get sicker than others but nevertheless god remains faithful faithful you can trust him when you can't trust anyone else you can believe that his word is the absolute when you can't believe mama or daddy because he will never disappoint you but you know god will allow us to go through some very difficult times what we find in ephesians 1 and verse 4 he says according as he has chosen us before the foundation of the world we have been chosen before the foundation of the world see he says jesus christ is choosing his bride just the same as men choose their brides today the bride today does not simply decide she's going to take a certain man for her husband now i know how i got little girls i got young girls in my my home and you just hear all kind of scuttle oh he's a cutie pie uh-huh yeah that boy from north carolina or that boy from this church that boy from that church oh he's good looking then they start planning a marriage i'm like really really you already got the wedding dress picked out you already walked down now he's saying i do huh you don't pick him out for yourself that's not how it works no it's the man who's seeking character he's seeking something that's gonna display his heart display his affections display who he really is he looks for character he doesn't look for beauty beauty is going to fade but character is going to last forever it'll remain and so he's looking for that and when he finds that that's when he goes and he begins to have relationship with and talk to and feel the friendship and all these things and then in time it becomes a union and that's what christ is doing here he's choosing his bride his bride is not choosing him we have been chosen because you reflect something that he sees in himself each of you here though we're different from one another there's something special about you that's a reflection of his intimate being you're declaring who he is on earth so he's chosen you and let me just go ahead and put you on notice tonight and put the devil on notice everything that the devil has done to you god is not going to let him get away with it don't you think for one minute that god hasn't taken notice of what the devil has done to you the bible will tell us in second thessalonians 1-6 seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you i say god pour it out well i want to be sweet to the devil no you don't punch him for jesus as my cousin philip would say i'll punch you for jesus i'll punch you for jesus and for joe but he says in exodus 23 23 22 but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an adversary or an enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary to that adversaries god is ready to take up arms for his wife god is not going to let the devil get by with anything that he has done to you you think you're going to pray you can't be broken church because god is not going to allow his bride to break you may be in you may feel like giving up you might feel like throwing in the towel but god has deposited something on the inside there's something inside of you you can't be broken you're unbreakable in this hour because why there has been a seed planted on the inside of you and that seed has got to manifest the very heart thoughts of god before you took your first breath you existed with god before you committed your first sin you com you existed with god for you ever got sick you existed with god and the thoughts of god are eternal you can't die no more than god can die see god took a picture and i talked about this last week and i'm going to try to hurry here he said in this life is the negative where does the negative get developed in a dark room very limited light dark room has to go through a couple different solutions i've done photography i took a photography course we had to develop prints you develop them in a dark room you put them in a solution that solution is acid some kind of acid but it brings certain things out of that picture otherwise it'd just stay there as a blank piece of paper and so that's why you go through trials it's your dark room but this negative is only declaring there's a positive he says now this ain't the real thing this is only a foreshadow of the real thing that is to come i don't care what you would do with it they cannot destroy that profile that picture is in god's great gallery of affair it cannot destroy it's in heaven you could burn it up you can feed it to lies do anything you want to to it it'll come forth again just as sure as two twos is four just as sure as god spoken it will come forth so no matter what you are we are chosen of god eternal with god and his love is elective love before either one were formed or born esau i hated but jacob little shyster i loved him why would he love a shyster because he loved you because he loved you and in revelations 3 and 19 the bible would tell us as many as i love i rebuke and i chasten be zealous therefore and repent and he's brother brown will tell us in the labels he and church has as many as i love i rebuke and chase him to rebuke us to reprove to reprove is to expose with the view of correction chasten does not mean it's punished it does its discipline because of subject subject's amendment is in the mind so he says it's not as a form of god's punishing you but god has chosen you and because god has chosen you and he loves you he's going to allow you to be developed because he's got a masterpiece in his mind and you're going to fit that masterpiece through all the trials through all the sufferings you're going to fit that masterpiece well brother joe it seems like every time i walk outside the clouds are shining or the clouds are gloomy and the rain's popping and it seems like this thing what was me what was me what was me but the sun is still up there ever fly in a plane and you just bust through with dark clouds and man it's just glorious says all you gotta do is push the clouds back push the clouds back because the sun is still shining the clouds may hide the sun but they can't keep you from the sun he's still there let me bring this home down here see god's got confidence in us he had confidence in abraham he had confidence in jacob he had confidence in moses he had confidence in job he had confidence in martin he had confidence in wesley he had confidence in brother branham and he's got confidence in you because they without us cannot be made perfect they without us cannot be made perfect romans 8 and verse 35 who shall separate us let's just stop right there for a minute give me one excuse give me one example of what can separate us from the love of christ what can break our fellowship come on you've had a bad day right but does that break your fellowship does it stop god's love for you abraham sinned told a lie but on the other side of the book there never was anything spoken about abraham's lie there's nothing can break us nothing can separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation shall distress persecution famine nakedness peril sword he says nay as it is written we were killed all the day long we were counted as sheep for the slaughter but in all things we are more than conquerors you in the frontness of your humanity are more than a conqueror you're more than a match to anything that the devil will throw at you tonight and he says i'm fully persuaded or i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels no principalities nor powers no things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord and he says now and i know my redeemer liveth he says now we want to draw this first into our mind there is not one thing that can destroy us into the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled death can't take you until god is done with you don't fear covet don't fear cancer don't fear any of these things don't fear death because it's only a pawn in the hand of god one breath out of this dimension is your first in that one we have nothing to fear nothing can separate us you're here because god made you for a purpose god made you for purpose no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are maybe how unimportant you are you are here for a purpose and nobody can take your place nobody you need your brother you need your sister this church needs you and you need this church this ministry needs you and you need this ministry we cannot be substituted we're here for a purpose god brought you to this church for a purpose and nothing god's purpose can never be defeated he says what god has imagined in his mind what god has purposed in his heart to bring to pass there is no demon there is no power there is nothing can ever separate god's great immortal internal plan it must be as god has said and he told matthew or he told peter here in the book of matthew the gates of hell will batter against it but they shall not prevail there was a war in heaven michael and his angels fought but michael and his angels prevailed satan did not prevail over god and over god's purpose and neither will he prevail over god's purpose for this hour let me bring this down to a close tonight i want the musicians to start making their way back see there's something in our heart tonight that speaks of a land beyond the river this place that we live in this world that we are currently living in i hope you don't find it as a place of refuge my every day is a disappointment every day you want to punch your computer screen you read the news and fox news and cnn news and fake news and what you don't know was news is news and everybody's saying the same thing you don't know what to believe that's why he gave us the good news that's why he sent us a message that's when he sent us a prophet and that prophet came to declare that god's going to have a bride and nothing is going to defeat that purpose nothing is going to stop what god has imagined in his mind he is going to bring it to pass god has deposited something you may go through trials you may go through your testing times you may have hardships but god has confidence in you think about this when you don't have confidence in yourself god has confidence in you there was a time that i almost wanted to commit suicide actually probably tried i don't know still think about that night was the night i gave my heart to the lord i didn't have confidence that i'd make it through the night but god did because because god saw this moment i couldn't see this moment i didn't know there'd be a ministry i didn't know there would be you people that i would be rubbing shoulders with 20 years later but god saw it and god had a purpose and though satan tried to break me i'm unbroken and satan may try to break you and maybe he has tried to break you but you're unbroken i'm going to end with two testimonies tonight many of you may have heard of corey ten boone i loved the world war ii i loved the history of it i i soak up novel after novel book after book i just what i've been doing i've read the story the life story corey ten boone and here her and her father and her sister were thrown into a jail they were actually arrested on february the 28th 1944 because they hid the jews in their home and they had a nazi informant that told toed arm and they came and they they threw corey ten boone in solitary confinement for three months because she was sick and i didn't want her to expose anybody else could you imagine being in solitary confinement in a little dark room for three months by yourself satan was trying to break her the nazis was trying to break her generally people that are left in that situation go insane they lose their mind because there's something in us my wife is going to smile here to want to fellowship with somebody else because we're god creatures and god wants to fellowship with his offspring so there's something inside of us to draw us but to be in that situation for three months said the little ants would come out and eat her food and she would play with the ants mice would run in every now and then and she would play with the mice that was her former keeping herself sane they transferred her from this jail and they put her in the concentration camp it was a ravens brook concentration camp it was a work cramp for women and there she had to do hard labor maybe beat and punch and things of that nature she smuggled a little bible in with her and you would think my why was she in this she was a believer for what she knew in that day she was a staunch christian godly lady feared god they had bible studies in their home her dad was a great patriarch there in in dutch and wherever they were from and yet god saw fit to take this little precious sister and place her in this awful environment a labor camp because she was doing something for god hiding his elected people protecting them helping them escape to freedom to life why would god turn his back on her and throw her in a concentration camp and beat her allow her to be beaten allow her to be broken but in that cell in that concentration camp her and her sister every evening after a long hard day's work they would have bible studies and they would begin to go through the scriptures and begin to have bible studies and they led over 70 women to the lord in that concentration camp what the devil saw fit to do evil god used it for his good we find before she was released her sister betsy who got very sick had a dream and in this dream she said that her and cory were going to be released before christmas of 1944 well her health deteriorated and on december 16th she passed away but before she passed away she told corey she said there is no pit too deep that god is not deep or i want you to remember that evening light there's no trial too hard there's no pit too deep but that god is not deeper steel you may be at the lowest of lows but god's hand can reach down and pick you up it was said that 12 days later she was released she was released 12 days later and they determined that it was a clerical era and just a week after her departure all the women in her age group were sent to death god doesn't make mistakes god placed her there for a purpose he had seeds from all walks of life that were thrown in that concentration camp to break them and yet that's where they found who god was your trial satan may be using it to try to break you tonight but you can't be broken there's another story can i go just five more minutes another story louis zamborini a great athlete he was an olympian started running when he was in high school because he was a derelict he was a delinquent he found running as an escape he was able to run the 5 000 meter race in 1936 in the berlin olympics he finished eighth as a 19 year old kid running against trained athletes he had no formal training he was a high school

went through their body on three or four different occasions and they didn't die threw them back into a little cell for six weeks they endured this kind of treatment until they were finally taken to turk there they would go to a pow camp there was a general there a corporal by the name of they called him bird you can look this up because he knew who louis zamborini was that he was an olympic runner and he was a fame kind of famous because he was the youngest they expected him to beat the four minute mile he promo zamorini with clubs belts fists he beat him on a regular basis and threatened to kill him and one time he was told to hold a board a log something kind of like a railroad tie above his head and if he was to drop it he'd shoot him on the spot he held it for 37 minutes his arms went numb he blanked out all he knew was that his hands were out until finally he was told to let it go on another occasion he received 220 punches in the face by every person in the camp because the bird wanted every prisoner to hit him and strike him in the face lost at sea beat experimental treatments he got out of there he was able to survive to last he was below 100 pounds by the time that the war was over and he struggled with ptsd became an alcoholic got married was about to throw his entire marriage away he couldn't contain he couldn't control himself it controlled him every night he had dreams nightmares of this man the bird attacking him and he had dreams of him killing the bird and his wife in california went to a billy graham revival she gave her heart to the lord very beautiful woman come from money you wouldn't expected that very wealthy family and she encouraged him won't you just come and take in a service he says no i got nothing for religion but he made god a promise when he was on that wrath he said lord if you get me through this i'll serve you if you can get me through this i'll serve you and here it was he finally conceded and said okay i'll go sat in the back first night he didn't move didn't budge came back the next night billy graham began to pull begin to draw something drew louis zamborini out of his seat and he come down that sawdust trail gave his heart to god the man lived to he was 90 something years old i think at this point he was 30. he lived 60 something years for god went around the world declaring what god had done for him and won a many a soul for god oh it looked like he was going to break but god used his captivity god used his ordeal because god had a purpose and god had a plan when what about your life god has a purpose god has a plan and when you feel that you're at your breaking point i want you to know one thing you can't be broken you can't be held by broken chains either so if you're feeling overwhelmed tonight you don't understand the why behind your life the trial that you're going through maybe you feel like the lord's forsaken you you feel abandoned god has a purpose for your trial god has a purpose i can't tell you how many times in the wee hours of the morning i get up and have my devotion and i say god why when is it ever going to end because we're human what did i do to deserve this and if i could hear that audible voice i believe he would say if you just trust me if you just trust me i'll use you like never before i'll use a young boy a young girl a mama a daddy a grandmother a grandfather i'll use you like never before while satan is meant for evil god's declaring it for his i got a good last night my wife did and i want to read that here this evening i'm closing with this right here several of us felt led to break free in the spirit yesterday this was concerning sunday service but we held back needless to say that led to a major conviction and knowing that we greed the spirit of god and with that conviction even pressing heavenly today on our hearts this is the strongest desperation that some of us have ever felt this is your young people mama daddy grandmother grandfather i want you to listen to this text this is our this is our church this is our offspring this is our youth this is what god is doing in our midst this ain't some fairy tale somewhere else this is god moving into even like tabernacle this is god moving into service tonight with that conviction even pressing heavenly today on our hearts this is the strongest desperation some of us has ever felt we're coming to service wednesday night with a whole new outlook i pray we come every day with a new outlook we're coming with a purpose to cut satan's head off you know what it's about time you come with that kind of mindset you'll stop taking the blows of the devil you'll start giving the blows we won't be stopped or hold back no matter who sees or what is said our praise will not be hindered you know i spoke wednesday and i believe brother aaron may have touched on a little bit on sunday have sometimes a spirit to come moving by and we sit there and we don't allow ourselves to yield to it he'll keep on moving he's going to find somebody's going to yield to himself that's going to give him due benevolence we won't be stopped we won't be held back no matter who sees or what is said our praise will not be hindered we're coming to slay the enemy and stand for the truth that god deserves complete surrender each and every day of our lives this young person goes on to say these words hit me after service and i was shaking very hard and i felt like i couldn't breathe writing this out i felt for months either in spirit leaning in the building around me and i'm not sure if it was tongues or prophecy but this hit me so hard that i felt i heat all over my body my chest was on fire and the words i'm limitless kept repeating to me and i grabbed my phone and i typed this i want y'all to hear this i'm limitless talking about god god speaking to you telling you he's limitless you have not because you asked not i'm limitless limitless you cannot contain me in a building or think that i cannot move when you leave this place it was said that i believe it was one night this week the holy spirit fell in two separate vehicles simultaneously at the same time not just at evening light tavern or not just the four walls of this church he could be moving down the street andrew tushner and the presence of god coming in in the wee hours of the morning had to pull over and stop and just throw your hands up and praise god we've been there never forget that night and some of you young people had that occurrence this past week you'll never forget it you'll not he says now this person goes on to say my hand is in the midst of this and what i am doing cannot be stopped you will not stop believing you will not stop claiming every promise you will not stop pushing for worship i am god and i do not change nothing about today or the fear or the negativity changes what i do and everything that you have been called for there is no end to what i am doing there is no end to you you can't be broken his purpose will not be defeated i am eternal do not box me in this building or moving how you expect me to move i have not lost today i have not lost ever and neither will you neither will you maybe you're here tonight and you're going through a difficult trial i want you to know you've not lost don't you just bow your hairs i feel a sweet presence here just now i know i'm kind of going a little lengthy and i apologize in advance for that but i believe he's here i believe this is a time that we can yield ourselves to him and to his presence maybe life has thrown you a curveball i handed you as they would say a bag of lemons what do you do with the lemons you throw them out because you don't like lemons under you take them add a little bit of sugar to it and make you some lemonade and have a refreshing cool drink choice is yours tonight oh i i understand that the difficulties of this life is tough but i want you to know you're unbroken satan can't break you he couldn't break louise zamborini he came he couldn't break corey ten boone he couldn't break moses he couldn't break william branham when he tried to commit suicide he couldn't break them because god has a purpose and god has a purpose for each of you that's here tonight last week god had a special visitation to one of our brothers i believe god has a very special visitation to some of you here tonight this is a time to allow yourself to know god like never before quit asking god why why am i here why am i in this mess why why is it so hard now's the time to praise god praise god when you don't feel like praising them praise him when it's so dark outside praise him when it seems like everything's against you that door may be closed praise god in the hallway until it opens up this is a time that we praise god he don't he didn't say just praise me in the good times he didn't say just praise me on your mountaintops you gotta learn to praise god in the valley praise god when it gets so tough thank god when you don't know what to do thank god that that he's in control of your life and there's nothing that the enemy can do that can destroy you because why because you're a child of god you're an offspring of god there's not a cancer great enough there's not a sickness strong enough there's not a depression that's that's able to take you the night because why because god is holding you in the palms of his hand and he's here to assure you tonight that there is nothing that will stop you father thank you lord tonight for your words of promise we know the service may have been a little bit different lord we just yielded ourselves to your spirit to deliver the way that you've have given it to us but father i believe firmly in that word i for one lord needed to hear these things tonight it seems like life sends us down a spiraling spiraling road and seems like there's no end to some some of the trials and difficulties and sicknesses that we face and maybe the doctors don't have answers and this one doesn't have answers but god you do the impossible math you had the answer and i believe you are the answer tonight lord you're the answer to every heart here locally to every heart out there on the stream those that would archive the service you have the answer satan be careful you're picking on god's bride you're picking on the anointed the elect of god and god it's a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation god i'm asking tonight that you begin to pour out tribulation on the enemy who's attacked your body attacked your bride attacked our young people attacked our elderly attacked brother ron brother ross brother jerome sister maryland different ones the enemies attacked them in their old age but god we ask tonight through the anointing of your spirit that you begin to pour out tribulation lord be an enemy to our enemies father be an adversary to our adversary build us up into a heavenly atmosphere god we come
