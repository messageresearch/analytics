appreciate you for all that you've done in our lives for coming and being with us Lord in these moments and Time Lord and the situations that we face can be so difficult and difficult times but Lord you're there with us cuz your word said you were and and Lord uh you promis you'd never leave us or forsake us and Lord how we lean upon that word in these times we ask God you be with each one be with our pastors as he way speaking Lord and be with each heart we pray we ask it in Jesus name amen amen turn your Bibles to First John chapter 5 amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen we have quite a bit streaming this morning um not sure who all is but I know uh brother Kelly Hill friend church had to cancel this morning and got quite a storm that come in winter storm and we're enjoying sunshine and about 70° and they're freezing to death about - 35 so uh it's it's okay to go every once in a while and I enjoy it when I go up there and I just don't know about living in it but uh they they do and they do it with a smile on their face so amen we welcome them to this morning as well and just good to be children of God and am and um to be called of his kingdom and the time that we're living in and it's a glorious time it's it's the most wonderful time to ever be right at the coming of the Lord Jesus many prophets many sages long to see the day that we see and the day that we live in but blessed are our eyes for we can see amen there's a whole lot of people in this world but they don't all see they might have eyeballs but they don't all see amen they may have ears but they don't hear but I'm so thankful to have an ear to hear amen so thankful for that 1 John 5 and verse 4 says for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God Amen we let you be seated amen I so enjoyed Wednesday night about the Champion within and amen just going along with some things I've been looking at and so uh this might be a bit of a part two I don't know but uh amen this is it's wonderful to be in the same channel amen so uh just looking at this this this scripture whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world our faith and and I'll take some from it brother Brandon preached on faith is our Victory and uh I I I am so thankful to be a person who in the time that we're living in has Faith uh because there's a lot of faithless people in this world that we live in they they don't believe uh where they may believe in something but I'm talking about a faith to believe in a living God Amen you can have faith in a tree you can have faith in all kinds of things but amen I I I want to have something a faith in something that amen can respond resp to the need that I have and you know uh to to have this Victory there has to be something on the inside Amen to give you this overcoming power and the only way amen as we heard Wednesday night about the champion within amen how that he would come and he would give us life and from that life would come the life of God and it would come and live on the inside of you and and honestly that's the only way we can overcome the world is by that life amen as he overcometh the as he overcame the world and I just want to look in John 16 and verse 16 and and it's quite a interesting scripture and the way Jesus done things just follow this for a moment it says a little while and you shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me because I go to the father and then some of his disciples among themselves what is this that he saith unto us a little while you shall not see me and again a little while you shall see me and because I go to to the father and they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while we cannot tell what he saith now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do you inquire among yourselves of that I said a little while and you shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me verily verily I say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice you shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy as a woman who she is when she's in travail has sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she is delivered of child she remember no more the anguish for the joy that a man is Born Into the world and that's that's the truth amen when a woman's in expecting a child and she's going through all the sorrow and the pain amen it'd be hard right then to talk her into having another one but when she's holding that baby and a few months down the road it ain't too long she wants another child why because the joy that this child brought that came into the world and she through that Joy she's forgotten all the sorrow and the travail that she's going through and he says ye now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you and in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall re receive that your joy may be full and these things have I spoken to you in the proverb but the time cometh when I shall no more speak to you in Proverbs for I will show you plainly of the father and that day you shall ask in my name and I shall not say unto you and I said and I will say not unto you and I will pray to the father for you for the father himself loveth you because you've loved me and have believed that I came out from God I came forth from the father and then came into the world again and leave the world and go to the father father his disciples says lo now speaketh thou plainly and speak no proverb now we sure we now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needest not any man to ask thee but this we believe that thou comest forth from God and Jesus answers it do you now believe behold the hour cometh yay is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet I am not alone because the father is with me these things have have I spoken unto you now sometimes when you want God to speak to you very plainly it ain't always going to be what you want to hear amen because sometimes it's going to be it's going to tell you exactly what's going to take place and it ain't all going to be roses and everything's hunky dory you're going to go through a lot of things and and then you know I look at all this all this uh scattered and and sorrow and all of this and he said I've told you these things because in the world you shall have tribulation a let me go back the these things have I spoken to you that in me you might have peace I I told you you're going to have sorrow I've told you going to go through tribulation I told you you're going to be scattered but I've told you this so you can have peace now that's that's a paradox because in your in yourself alone you'll never come to peace but if you'll look on me and know that I have also overcome the world I have overcome it and as I I have overcome it therefore you shall also overcome amen and I I believe that that's exactly why he put put his life on the inside of us amen is to overcome as he overcome to destroy every work of the devil as he destroyed every work of the devil amen he put his life in us to heal the sick as he healed the sick amen to raise the dead as he raised the dead Amen to overcome and this where he said be of good cheer I have overcome the world so when we hear of cancer we can be of good cheer and at peace because he's already overcoming amen when we have sin or things in our life or the oppressions or whatever it is amen we can be at peace because he has already overcome it and as he has overcome we shall also overcome so his word is where we base our faith it's it's not on what a preacher said to us or what somebody else may say but it's what God's word says you know we got you got a lot of people in this day wanting to hear a word from a preacher or or you know hear something amen it's not that's not always the way God our orchestrates now God can anoint a man to give you a word word or bring a inspiration upon his heart to do that but that ain't the way God is looking to do things God wants you to believe his word amen I don't believe that I'm Healed because a preacher said I'm Healed I believe because his word says I'm Healed I don't believe that I'm an overcomer because a preacher said I'm Overcomer I believe it because his word says I'm an overcomer amen I believe that's where we need to place our word our our our faith upon is not upon what some man can say what some man can do but what the word of God has already spoken upon our behalf amen unbelief you know will speak fear it'll speak worry it'll speak doubt it'll speak all kinds of things but faith will always speak the word of God Amen faith will look at a difficult thing and say I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me amen it don't say some things or good you know just when I'm feeling good it says I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me I faith will look and say I am born of God therefore I have World overcoming Faith yes sir I am born of God therefore I have World overcome in faith residing on the inside of me I will let the peace of God rule my heart and I refuse to worry about anything come on now amen this is what he said I told you these things so you can have peace amen this is a peace that the world didn't give and the world can't take away amen we're not talking about a pieace that is dependent upon whether there's a good economy or there's money in your pocket or or you're feeling good that ain't the peace I'm talking about I'm talking about the peace of God that passes all understanding in other words when you cannot understand you can still have peace amen when you still don't you don't know how it's going to work out and you don't know which way the word the road's going to turn next you can still have peace because there a peace that passes all understanding you can trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding in all your ways submit yourself to him and he will make your pass St amen this this your faith will speak a word that'll look right in the middle of enemies surrounding you and doubt all around and unbelief all around and and situations you can't handle and said no weapon formed against me shall prosper amen no weapon formed against me shall shall prosper but every tongue that is formed against me shall be condemned amen that devil that's been whispering in my ear he shall be condemned that devil has been telling me I can't make it that this message is not for me it shall be condemned that devil that tells me I'm not a son of God I'm not a child of God it shall be condemned amen I am an overcomer I'm overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony I am submitted to God hallelujah and in my submitt to God the devil flees from me because when I resist him he will run in the name of Jesus Amen Faith looks at the word it says God is my refuge and strength he is my well proven help in the time of trouble hallelujah we're not dealing with a a a help that may work out or may not work out or isn't proving you know it'd be hard to uh depend or put your trust in something that's not proven right you know you got in your car today because it's been proven you know it's been proven it goes down the road but if you get you a car that ain't proven and you ain't likely to take it on a long trip go get a rental car or something you know you got old car old beater yeah you ain't going to just jump at it and go across the country not most likely cuz you'll get stranded somewhere but if you got a well proven thing and I understand it's man-made and it's still can break down I don't care if it just got one mile on it amen but I I was just trying to make a point here amen you put Faith and something but listen God is not a man-made thing he's not going to get you down 500 miles down the road or 5 years down the road or 20 years down the road and leave you stranded somewhere he's not a man-made thing he's going to take you all the way from the beginning to the end he who started the work shall finish the work he's the author and the finisher amen in all these things we are more than conquers through him that loved us greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world this is where Faith goes to it doesn't go to our feelings it doesn't go to our thoughts amen God if we we we went we went on our thoughts and our faith was only in what we thought where would we be we wouldn't be here this morning most likely we'd be still in bed somewhere probably in the hospital somewhere but our our faith is not resting upon what I think or what anybody else things it's only resting on what the word of God says amen if we could receive this truth he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world we know that's true how many know that's true the one that resides on the inside if you got the holy ghost that champion within it's greater than the one that's in the world he's proven that he knocked him out he gave him the knockout punch at Calvary come on somebody he broke his back at Calvary he proved he was greater than the one that's in the world Amen so what is in what what what in you is greater is Christ the anointed one amen that's Christ in you greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world and if he's in you it's not you anymore living that's it's him living in you it's not your thinking it's not what you thought about it it's what he said about it I can't drive that point home hard enough it ain't what we think about it it's what he said about it amen then if he is in you he would absolutely not deny what he said he can't deny his own word he can't do it he would keep what he said he's trying to find a person that he can vindicate himself through he said he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world God in you like he was in in Jesus Christ come on now God in you like he was in Jesus Christ amen that's the words of a prophet God in you like he was in Jesus Christ because what all God was he poured into Christ and what all Christ was he poured into a church into a bride how many's part of that church let me tell you it's not a wimpy church it's a powerful church it's a church that'll get up and believe no matter what situation is around it it'll believe in Divine Healing it'll believe in the spirit of God it'll believe in all things that's written in the word of God doesn't matter what Theologian says doesn't matter what anybody says it's God in you he that's in you no wonder the winds and the waves obeyed him it obeyed his word it obeyed his word because it was God's word through him amen you may not go out you as a person go out and individually turn a hurricane around or turn a tornado around you may may he may God may work that way sometime through I'm not saying he can't but am man that's not the that's not the storms that he's worried about right now he's worried about the storms in this earth that's right that storms that try to come and trying to whirl you out of the path of God and bring destruction to you that you something on the inside of you will rise up and say devil this is enough I'm not taking it a piece be still and take dominion over those things when he spoke it was God speaking through human lips the very creator that created the winds and the waves was in him think that think that he said now think deep now because he said no wonder demons paralyzed at his word it was God in him it was God in Christ demons was paralyzed amen that's what he said about Moses he said Moses Faith was either going to Egypt was either going to paralyze moses' Faith or moses' faith was going to paralyze Egypt amen I believe we're right there at that same time this world is either going to paralyze you or you're going to paralyze this world Amen make it where it has no dominion over you he says now think about this the demons were paralyzed no wonder the dead that was turned back to dust could let could not lay there at his word for he was the word he said Lazarus after being dead and stinking four days his face his nose has fell in that much in that much time no Lazarus come forth and a man dead raised up from his on his feet why it was God he he that was in Christ was God the dead could not stand in his presence it was God in Christ and let me tell you he still raises the dead today he did it in William bram's day he still does it today amen it's happened before amen God's still God he said God created the winds in the air God created the waves it's it's the water that produced him he created all that but the devil got into it and it got to tumbling to bring destruction God created men to be sons of God but when the devil gets into them then it tries to bring destruction he said that's what the devil got into the winds and sent that storm but couldn't the creator that created the wave say go back for I created you isn't that the same Creator standing on top of the hill the other day isn't that the same one that could take a piece of fish and break it and another piece grow on he didn't he didn't exactly have to do it that way but he could have said it he could have done whatever you want to he's a Creator couldn't he create squirrels amen he that was in Christ is in us for it does the same Works he did the same thing he did it does now the dead cannot stand in the presence of his word greater is he it's God the Creator it's the the winds and the waves had to obey him demons become paralyzed Hallelujah I like to tell that again to that old devil demons become paralyzed all nature obeyed him because he was a creator of that nature and he said we we we ought to understand isn't it isn't man man can't do that but man's part of the creation it's the winds and the waves that obey the Creator see what he's saying he said it isn't man it's man that's part of the creation it's the winds and the waves that obey the Creator it's this flesh that has to come into into and into obey the Creator it takes the Creator to do it for he that is in you is great than he that's in the world Amen he that can the one that can cause turmoil the one that can turn your world upside down the one that's inside of you is greater than that he can rebuke the devil out of the Winds I've seen him do it seen him do it right there in Youth Camp there's winds and w get to roll in and demons start speaking out of that creation amen and the power of God begin to speak and say come out of them what was it peace be still what was it the same creating power that put his foot up the bow of the boat was the same one that spoke those words and the same Devils that became paralyzed then is the ones that become paralyzed [Applause] now greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world what what do you think happened in that back room there at Youth Camp when brother brother Aaron was summoned to come in and pray for that girl that was having that demonic manifestation and that demon looked around and said no not you she wasn't talk about Aaron Obby he's a big dude but she wasn't talking about him she wasn't worried about him she was worried about what was on the inside of him it was the same one when that Maniac come running out to that boat and that same Creator stepped out and he starts walking up there and this maniac's going to come destroy him as he's destroyed many others all of a sudden what are you doing in there Hallelujah that devil saw beyond what the human flesh people were looking at that human flesh calling him Bel calling him the devil calling him an illegitimate child called him everything but the devil knew who he was and he said what are you doing in there amen there was the same one of that little girl that looked beyond human flesh and said what is what not you not you you've defeated me too many times and he defeated him again cuz he's the same yesterday today and forever he that's in you he can rebuke the devil out of the Winds those winds that get stirred up in your home he can rebuke that those devil those Devils that get stirred up in the Winds of your own flesh make you think all kinds of things yeah yeah he can rebuke that but you better not lean on your own understanding cuz he'll whoop you around on your own understanding but greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world the devil is in the world the world belongs to him that's what the Bible said oh Lucifer why art thou following Lucifer the son of the morning the world belongs to him that's when he was kicked out of heaven he's he's he's now in rulership he's the same one that said to Christ these kingdoms are mine I do with them as I will they belong to him and he's the one that's in the world John told had just told the disciples you heard of the Antichrist who has come and is here already working in the children of Disobedience but little children you're not of the world you're of God and greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world that's Christ in you greater is he amen that was in Joshua than that than the son amen that Joshua was just a man he was sin born like you and I greater was he that was in Joshua than the son that was running by the Commandment of God God had commanded that sun to shine and to stay there it was governed and controlled by the laws of God but greater was he that was in Joshua than the laws of God Mercy because the Creator himself was in Joshua working there in that anointing he'd come down to take on the on the Battle of them as they took Jericho and was taking the promised land Joshua looked up the Sun and said you stand there where you're at and the moon you stay where you're at till the till I finish the battle and the Sun and the Moon obeyed him for he was the Joshua was greater than the Sun and the Moon he that was in Joshua was greater he that was in Moses was greater than Egypt we're talking about our champion this morning and we're not talking about necessarily about Moses and Joshua he could have used whoever he wanted to but we're talking about the one that used them the one that was inside of them Egypt had great armies had the greatest army in in all the world they they had conquered the world at that time but greater was he that was in Moses than was in Egypt amen the Nile God wasn't big enough the frog god wasn't big enough the flea God wasn't big enough he destroyed all of their gods maybe it wasn't a fleeing sight might have been even winter time but whatever God said to Moses go speak my word and I'll put your mind what to say you go out there and pick up some dirt off the ground and throw up in the air and say Let There Be fleas and fleas went to crawling said probably several inches deep that gives me the heie jeebies yeah buddy makes me want to scratch right now all over the ground in a few moments what was it the Creator there wasn't any frog so he stretched out his rod and said let there be frogs and there they were piled up till the whole land was stinking and dum Pharaoh says Mo Moses said when you want me to take him away he said tomorrow night what in the world wrong with him when it came to the Red Sea what was it God said speak to the Sea and Moses spoke it and greater what was in Moses than what was in the Red Sea amen Moses now you see the greater was he that was in Moses he that was in the world greater this he than Moses than any nature or anything God whatever God told him to say he said it and that's the way it was and the same God is in us tonight not only with us but in us he proved he was with us greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world greater than he was Moses greater than he was Joshua than was the musicians greater than he was in Daniel greater than he was in the three Hebrew children sir he said Daniel gets to tossed into a lion's den he's expected expected to happen to him what happened to everybody else got tossed in there maybe a few crumbs of Bones left Lions rushed out hungry they ain't been fed they've been hungry ready to eat there was something greater in Daniel they couldn't eat him Satan is as a roaring Lon going around sinking whom he made devire but he finds some that ain't edible I am not lying food amen this is who because greater in me is in me that's what's in that roaring line amen he going around roaring and saying it ain't so and saying it's just d of Miracles are passing and roaring and saying look at this one they died look at that one they lost look at look at all I'm not listening to that I'm listening to what the word of God [Applause] said so the Lions rushed out hungry you know said when lions were created they were created to be a friend to man I always thought that' be really nice just to go up there and rub that old big head can't do it right now but one of these days I'm going to do it they can have one they say it's tame all they want to I ain't I don't trust it cuz I know down inside there's still a nature that's amen and you know if hey if I get tossed to the lines Den because of my belief so bit but I ain't going to just jump in one people say well I'm tell you what we're in the Millennium all right go ahead jump in the lines then show me I don't believe we have to worry about that when we get over there though everything be a piece the lamb and the lion lay down together it's what the Bible said you better go over and rub it so we go I don't gu can't call it woolly man whatever kind of man is hay man scratch him on the ear rub him down his back he'll just sit there and purr at you it's what happened to Daniel I'm sure he had enjoyed himself that that day in that Lion's Den here he is down at Lion's Den the king comes the next morning what did he tell the king for when he got thought oh King I'll see you in the morning amen he had faith in his God cuz he knew he was just he wasn't doing nothing wrong he was praying to his God come on somebody amen and he gos down that lines then and the King opens it up and there he still is and he said it isn't by my might or my strength it's by my God amen see the LI what was in Daniel was greater than what's in the D the lion he said the man man it was made to be a friend of man but he said the devil is what makes him do that he said you know the devil but in the Millennium the devil will be gone he'll be chained up it's the devil that makes wild beast tear and rip and eat and things like that that's the way they do it's Satan that does that but greater was he that was in Daniel that was in the lion amen this is why we see men losing their mind and women amen doing things to babies that's unheard of and unthought Unthinkable what is it it's Satan that's gotten the winds and the waves he's gotten the Flesh and the creation men and women who were created to be amen lovers of God and worshippers of God the devil gets into them and they turn into nothing but vile beasts and and they rip and they Roar and they tear and they ma but greater is he that is in US that's right the Hebrew children getting ready to be thrown in the fire and he said heated it up seven times hotter well I mean if that ain't a type of us I don't know what is seven time why didn't he use six why didn't use four why didn't use 10 he said seven seventh Church age it's worse than it's ever been darker than it's ever been hotter than it's ever been more evil than it's ever been and getting more evil than it's ever been amen by the minute darker by the minute more evil by the minute and it's getting harder and harder but there was three Hebrew children that refused to bow to the to the king's demand amen here actually they had been they had put a god before them and I understand it was a image of Daniel but whatever image it was here they were told to Bow and they wouldn't know no no cuz the word says you shall have no grave in image the word says there's only one God that what was it going back to the word again said do what you want to oh King but we're not bowing amen and I love how brother Brandon plays all all that out he says here they were down there and on Earth he said but meanwhile up in heaven they God was watching and he said the Angels come over to him he said Lord have you seen what is going on and he said yeah I've seen what's going on and wormwood wanted to go and Michael wanted to go he said no this is a job for me and he said he grabbed a zigzag of lightning a roll of thunder and down into the fire he went and there he was standing there in the fire when they came into the fire cuz he knew what was going on he knew what was taking place he knew what was happening he knows exactly what is going on at all times sir Hallelujah that's why we can be at peace cuz he knows we're in Tribulation he knows we're in sorrow he knows when we're in depression he knows when we're going through things and we don't know which way to turn we can still be at peace cuz God knows he knows so well what about sickness greater is he that's in you than the sickness because that is interrupting the very laws of God sickness is that's what he said greater is he that's in you the Healer the Creator the then the dev devil that's interrupted the very program of your life has to go got it written somewhere wrote I don't know where I've lost it here but it says another place it says God has a plan for you wow that just sink some peace right over us don't it God has a plan for you he said I know the my thoughts of you is to get they're they're high my thoughts are higher and your thoughts my ways are higher he said but I know I have thoughts for you and they're for a prepared place a prepared end he hasn't got down to this moment and lost control he hasn't come down to you I don't care what moment you're in your life I I'm talking about as a bride coming down the seven Church AE right down the last moments of time he hasn't lost control he's still in just as much control as he's ever been or he's not God but he is God so he's if he's God his word is still real his word is still true and it's still in control and he's still orchestrating all that is going on in this world it may seem like the devil is in control but the devil ain't nothing but a puppet the Bible says he said I will put rains in his mouth have you ever seen a puppet it has strings attached to it it can only do as the one is pulling the strings and it's playing out his part amen that's nothing but what the devil is I want to put a picture in your mind what he really is he ain't nothing but a dumb puppet that's and he's sitting there and he's only moving where God says he can move and he's only doing what God says he can do God is in [Applause] control it's Christ in you he said I don't rest on something you've done so well I felt a little shiver you know I spoke in tongues I danced in the spirit all those things are fine and wonderful he said that's all right that's great but don't just rest on that your life has got to be this greater is he that's in me this is it you and this has become one and then this manifest itself yes sir hello amen you don't dance to get it you dance because you got it you don't cry to get it you cry because something happened amen you don't shout to get it you shout because something happened he said what if tonight that you can say with all your heart the spirit of SP of Shakespeare lived in you then uh Shakespeare if he lived in you then what would you do You' do the works of Shakespeare you would create poems and plays and so forth and you know be great writer or something if Shakespeare lived in you he said Bo bethoven lived in you what what would you do you'd be a great composer you'd write songs you you would do like what because that's what Beethoven would be in your life if Beethoven lived in you the works of Beethoven you would do and and but if if Christ lived in you then the works of Christ you will do and if Christ is in you the works of Christ you would do for Christ lives in you he said so in John 14 vers 12 he that believeth in me amen The Works that I do shall he do also so if you was in Christ if Christ lived in you then the Christ is the word and the word Came To His prophets and down through he said Christ lived in you the works of Christ will be done through you the Life of Christ will be lived through you The Works he did the life he lived and everything would live in you just as if Shakespeare Beethoven or whoever it was lived in you if his life but if you're still living your own life then your own works you'll still see but if you're living the life of Christ if Christ is in you he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world so if your doubts and frustrations about God's promise in you then Christ isn't there maybe I need to read that again if your doubts and frustrations about God's promises is in you then Christ isn't in you in isn't there you're only worked up yeah that's what he says but if Christ is living in you his word he will recognize and his promises he will do when thou prayest believe that you receive what you ask for and it shall be given to you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart amen but believe what you say it will come to pass you can have what you ask the father worketh and I worketh hither too verely verely I say unto you the son can do nothing himself but what he sees the father doing that doth the son likewise and when the father showed him what to do he walked out there with a without a failure of everything and said let it be and it was that that same Christ is living on the inside of you it lives in us and his works we will do there ain't nothing can stop it he said I'll not leave you comfort is comfortless but I will come to you be in you I the person Christ and the form of the Holy Ghost that champion within will come and live in you you cannot overcome the world until you get the life of the Overcomer in you you can lo law your way all you want to you can put laws and regulations and rules and and people who look at the message is nothing but laws and regulations and rules is because they don't got the Life of Christ on the inside of them because if they had the Life of Christ in them they wouldn't look at laws and rules and regulations they would look at it as their protection amen that God is with them and for them and God so Lov me that he came down and he anointed a man to preach a message that would call me out of my sin call me out of denominational system or wherever he found me and bring me to this place he that was in Noah was greater than the judgments of water greater is he that was in David than the bear that show stole his sheep or the lion that stole his sheep or the great Philistine the giant that stood in his path you know Faith looks at tomorrow and says no matter what tomorrow brings I know God's already there that's what faith does faith looks beyond circumstances and situations and uh and you know faith is the Victory faith is the Victory and this is where David was as I've said before David didn't go into the valley because he fought well he wasn't a fighter he was a Shepherd he wasn't a soldier he was a Shepherd he wasn't a trained man he was a Shepherd that's right his greatest thing he ever did was keep take care of some bye bye by B he was the last the totem pole in his family let's just be honest even when the when the prophet came to anoint a new king and knew it was coming out of the house of that Jesse he comes to the house of Jesse and Jesse brings all of his sons nope ain't this one nope ain't this one nope nope nope nope down the last one nope you got another son cuz God told me to come to your house his dad didn't even think enough about him he's like if anybody was going to be king it sure ain't going to be David I ain't going to call him but that was the one God was looking for and he said yeah well I got one more but he's out there he the Sheep Hur her go get him we ain't sitting down and eat until he gets here amen so he comes and he anoints him amen but David now anointed he didn't go down there amen because he fought well he yeah he had fought a bear he had fought a lion he' done all those things but he wasn't a trained soldier he didn't have armors he didn't have none of that he didn't go down in the valley because he fought he went down there because he believed right and he believed the same one who kept him from the line who kept him from the bear would be the same one that would keep him from Goliath and I'm telling you right now the only reason you got a Goliath in your path is cuz God wants you to know you're a David he wants you to know there's more in you there's a God that's in you that's greater than that one that stands before you so Goliath laughed throw his head back and laughed so I'm going to just stick you with my Spear and I'm going to hold you up in the air and let the birds eat your carcass David said I didn't come to you in the name of some great army or in my own belief system or what I think I come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ today I'm going to cut your head off cuz he knew greater was in him and he said how much more is he greater that's in you than in that wheelchair greater is he that's in you that put you on that stretcher greater is he that's in you than that cancer greater is he that's in you than that Affliction greater is he that's in you than anything somebody say anything anything the devil could ever put on you anything the devil could ever lie to you about greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world yes sir Christ in you the hope of glory he that's in you that's Christ greater is he but you have to to have faith there has to have be something you can believe in now people some people can believe in stuff I never could believe in It's s right that's just the way it is you know they can believe in all kind of things they they can put their faith in all kinds of stuff but there's really only one place a real Christian can really believe this supersedes anything this supersedes your oils this supersedes your health food well I'm going to tell you right now I don't take no medicine I take Health Food well this supersedes it this supersedes your medicine this supersedes the doctor come on somebody it supersedes everything to a Believer this is the end all period this is the amen this is the all of it you can put your faith into anything you want to but I want to put my faith in the god sure whatever you want to take I don't care take what you want to take but just still believe God it ain't the medicine that's going to heal you noow it's God that'll heal you it ain't the doctor that'll heal you anyhow it's God that'll heal any any any God any doctor that believes anything at all will know that he's not a Healer he can put the arm back but he can't heal it amen he can cut you and take something out but he can't heal what he done it's God that does that boy I can get some stuff I'm G to stay out of it I believe we have a God that we can believe in no matter what of this situation I believe we can have a God that we can believe in no matter what the sicknesses I believe we have a God we can believe in no matter what the situation is around us amen you will find if you'll find you a God who is God come on now sometimes we make our own thoughts God we make our own belief systems God but I'm talking about a God who is God I'm not talking about a little G God I'm talking about a capital G God a god that is God over every situation and every circumstance and has proven himself he is God that's right not just God in the good times but he's God all the time he's God when you don't feel him and he's God when you do feel him he's God when you don't see him but he's God when you do see him he's God no matter where you are or what you're going through God is God he said what if today the people that's sick would begin to think these thoughts God is God there he is come on one mind and one Accord right now God is God Amen let's put down our thoughts let's put down our thinking and let's lift up the word of God God is God he said if he isn't why do we serve him anyhow but if he is God he's still a Healer if he is God he's still almighty God he can do all things if he promised it he won't break it he will always keep it Hallelujah he said that pulsation begins to rise in your heart something is about to take place nothing's going to stop it it's a fire God is God God is God God is God God is God he's God over my finances he's God over my trouble he's God if I don't believe him he's God if I do he's God when I don't feel him he's God when I do God is God Amen it begins to build a fire he said it's like building a fire on a windy day how many's ever done that get you in a lot of trouble it just keeps blowing as the Holy Spirit finds that fire it keeps burning till it becomes a reality he said don't you take the devil's lie about anything amen you just remember God is God I wouldn't take the devil's lie about me about who he says I am or what he thinks I'm going to be that's it's a lie anyhow why you going to believe it he can't do nothing but lie so if he's telling you you ain't a Son of God what does that mean if he telling you you ain't overcoming what's that mean that means you're kicking his tail come on somebody you've been whooping him up one side and down the other and he's trying to say you ain't no Overcomer you ain't no Overcomer you ain't no you ain't no Overcomer in the meanwhile you got your sword and you're whooping him from one end to the other why because he's nothing but a liar you're marching your way to Zion he saying you ain't going to make it you ain't going to make it you can't make it you might as well quit you lying hound dog I ain't listening to none of your lies I'm listening to thus sayth the Lord he said I already made it he already saw me shouting before ever this ever happened he saw me giving him praise to almighty God cuz he's God and he don't change he's healed me he's delivered me he set me free he's broke my chains he's broke my complexes he's broke my fears he's broke my depression God is [Applause] God God is well I don't know what about me well let me read it to you God is God over every person how many persons do we have God is God over well I don't know about what about color every color direct quote every race every language Hallelujah he's God he raised from the dead living among us no respector of persons neither male or female but all one in Christ Jesus amen God is God he's proved himself over and over he's proved himself to every race every color every language so we have somebody we can put our faith in amen we have someone we can rest in and believe no matter what why you still here cuz he said so why you still believe him cuz he said so why you think you're going to get healed cuz he said so right why you think you're going to overcome cuz he said so cuz my faith is in one who cannot lie it's funny how quick we are to believe a liar you know what let's just take it human Humanity right now if somebody lied to you and they kept lying to you how many how long you going to believe them he like man I ain't listening to that dude no more he's a liar he told me lie after lie after lie after lie sooner or later his credibility is shot but you same human beings will listen that devil over and over and over and he's lied to you your whole life gotcha you give him credit you'll tell his lies it's the truth oh I know I'm on a trail right now amen you'll tell it over and over until you actually start believing it and it ain't nothing but a lie why don't you start telling the truth the word of God and say it over and over until you believe it it ain't never told a lie he ain't never told one person one thing wrong it's always been nothing but the Tru believe this [Applause] one faith is the substance you know you don't get the substance and then you get faith faith is the substance people want the substance and I'll believe you know tell you right now if I see something happen then boy I tell you I don't know that ain't the truth cuz there's people that saw it and they still didn't believe so seeing ain't always believing I know that's another lie of the devil I tell you what if I could see it there people saw Miracle after miracle in Jesus day and still called him a devil saw it saw it there was many at the gra of Lazarus saw a dead man walk out grave clothes on him Lazarus come forth they saw it they didn't believe it there's a few days later they're saying crucify him let his blood be upon us and our children I thought seeing was believing no ain't always to be so cuz even when you don't see you can still believe I don't know about that well let me give you a scripture blind bmus couldn't see a lick but yet he's still believed and he's sitting over there in his beggar clothes and he's like here's all this noise and he's like what's happening something else going on ah old fanatic they call Jesus Jesus you talking about the one talking about the one that healed the leper I heard about that yeah yeah that's what they say you you talking about the one who who who who delivered that woman of all those Devils well you know that's the story you know I don't know our our our preacher don't quite believe it like that Jesus Jesus th son of David have mercy on me blind as a bat but still believed and Jesus called him immediately he received his sight followed him glorifying God and all the people and they saw it and gave praise unto God it's your faith that saved thee is what Jesus said receive thy sight thy faith has saved thee oh yes he said to the woman that came and washed his feet says our sins are forgiven and they that sat and meat with him begin to say with them themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said thy faith save thee go in peace it was faith faith is Faith is the substance faith is the victory faith is what saves the the same word in the bible translated saved and healed is the same word all the way through the scripture saved and healed saved and healed saved in it's saved to the physical and saved in the spiritual it's both salvations both healings saved and heal the very same word all the way through the scriptures he said anyone knows that well you're saved spiritually or you're saved physically now he said the woman thy faith has saved thee physically saved you and now in redemption in atonement in the plan in the plan of God you can be spiritually saved or physically saved because he was wounded for our transgressions by his stripes we were healed it's all right there it just takes Faith it's according to our faith that we believe what he said he said if there wasn't a law that said Sons and Daughters of God would they said there wasn't a law uh uh saying this saying they couldn't do this Sons and Daughters of God would create a world out there and go live a private life on it he said that's the power that's in you to do it if you got a shadow of the power of God in you you've got power to do it hello go create my own world and go live privately on it boy that sounds real good right now God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you will make you can speak a whole world into existence and go live on it there you are that's what power is is in the church now but see it's not God's desire for us to speak another world into exist he's already created us a world his desire is to take this world into subjection and let it be burned over with fire so the spirit of God can come down and create a new creation upon it it's a law of Faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe all things so that includes all things right of does all things include all things far as I know it does all things are impossible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatsoever God will lead your soul to believe it's yours every place the soul of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you amen it's yours it's your possession if you can find the key to this law of Faith it'll open it to you see the power is controlled he said if you are sons of God your daughters of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there so when you're saved God gives you Faith to rise from the muck of the earth your faith overcomes the things of the world what is it what does it your faith it overcomes the things of the world your faith in the act that God done for you to make you a son to make you a daughter you quit your lying you quit your stealing you quit your drinking you because Faith Rises is you up above it said if that didn't happen you didn't get have faith but your faith and by faith you're saved through Grace and as much faith will be released that's much how much power you can have Hallelujah listen he's got he wants faith not just to rise above the muck of the world and become sons and daughters but Faith that'll rise up to a body change not just Faith to to heal a body but Faith that'll change change your body amen that's that's why that's why the kind of faith is being released it's your faith according to your faith be unto you if thou can't believe all things are possible verily I say unto you if you say this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe what you said then what kind of people ought we to be tonight having faith in this great redeeming Christ that lives in us this smitten rock that never leaves a church hello somebody never leaves a church I'm with you always even to the end of the world that ever presentent present G gusher of Salvation that power that's poured forth from Calvary into the church that every presence of the Living God that great flowing smitten Rock it'll go with you through all of your journey I'll use the human part again how many of you would continue to be friends with somebody who always left you when you was going in a situation when they should have stood by you they walked away won't happen break trust break friendships break all kind of things the humanity of us well why do we trust the devil that wants to take us and drop us off in some pornography somewhere drop us off in some sin somewhere and start laughing at you and making fun of you look look look over there look right there see that right there why are we trusting him for why don't we trust one who never leaves us never forsake you but you can go through some of the hardest times of your life and he'll still be right there you can walk down to the Valley of the shadow of death and he's still right there you can walk through sickness and he's right there you can walk through family troubles and he's right there may not always know it may not always feel it may not always realize it but his word says He is his word says he is and then when you go through something he's there pulling the strings orchestrating it according to his will he got the devil on the string nope can't punch him right [Music] now this ain't the time nope get back from him right now nope can't get that close nope can't take his life nope little puppet tried to take your life but he couldn't tried to destroy you but he couldn't he tried to wound you and Ma you to where you wasn't even recognizing no more couldn't even be a uh anything anymore more in the in the Society of God but he couldn't cuz he was held back by word he would have killed job if he could have but he couldn't he done a lot of things but he can only do what he could that's right what he was allowed to what God was allowing job to go through during that times he turned his family against him he turned his own wife against him he he put ballls on his body put him in a as sheet put him in all kind of brought three comforters well I tell you job the only reason why you'd go through something like this because you done some awful sin it job would say I know I have sinned but I got a sacrifice go read it go read their their words go read what job's reply was to them he was said look I understand I've done wrong I understand I'm a man born of sin but I have a sacrifice and this is where you need some of you need to start pointing that devil back to wants to tell you're unworthy yeah I know I'm unworthy but I have a sacrifice and it ain't a woolly lamb it's the Lamb of almighty God it's the perfect lamb who's one shed it shed blood For All Mankind I have a sacrifice no I'm not perfect but my Lamb's perfect yeah I have failures but my lamb don't have no failures yes I made mistakes but my lamb didn't make no mistakes he was without sin wants to come and put you know the funny thing is I I watch The Devil many times he'll wait until God does something really good for you he'll let you rejoice in a little bit and then he'll come right behind it and say God didn't do anything and and he'll tell you he'll get you all depressed and all down and all discouraged all over again and get your eyes off of what God just did how he just saved you how how he just healed you how how he just saved your life from Death or whatever he whatever he done and the devil is constantly there to try to minimize it brother brother Joe mentioned depression I've been going through yeah I I've go through depression we all do from time to time but what is it it's the devil coming behind and trying to minimize what God did and he tries to always point to the negative you have to change your thoughts and I say it that way but really it's his thoughts he's putting those thoughts in you you said well how you know because of it ain't God's word amen God's word is our is where our thoughts belong amen so he puts all these kind of thoughts into you that your children's going to fail and this is going to happen and that's going to go take all kind of negativity I'm sick of that negative devil he always wants to point out every negative thing that's going on in a church and a family and a situation and this that and the other all he knows our weaknesses he studied man for about 6,000 years now he knows exactly where to poke somebody he know some people are more prone to negativity I don't know why I'm on negativity but I'm about to smash that thing amen because what is it that is a thought of the devil and he's trying to bring you down into depression and bring you down to work nothing God never done nothing for me God never and my meanwhile God saved you God healed you God delivered you God's watching over you get your mind off of what's negative and say devil I'm not putting myself through that no more I know what God did for me I know he saved me I know he filled me I know he touched me I know he healed me I know he deliver me God is God he wants to point out every negative thing well I tell you what I I was born in this family and such and such such no you're born in there so the grace of God can be made real through your life well I wasn't born in this family I was adopted well you was adopted in that family so the grace of God can be brought through your life amen God is in control faith is the victory it is the power to overcome any circumstance any sickness any sin faith is the victory over death faith is the victory over sin faith is the victory over sickness faith is the victory over worry faith is the victory over frustrations faith is the victory over depression faith is the victory over the world so if he overcome the world he overcome everything in the world come on somebody it's just like brother Bram standing there I believe in Portland Oregon when that Maniac came up and made his Challenge and he said and he and he began to spit on him and all that kind of stuff and brother Brandon looked at and said you'll fall over my feet you remember the story and the man RAR back to hit him and over his feet he fell and the policeman said did he get delivered he said no he worships that devil he said but will you kindly move him off my feet and he moved him off his feet and he got back up and he said now as I was saying faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen and he said about that time somebody jumped off of a c somebody come running out of a wheelchair he said just in a few minutes time everybody in the building was healed he said what happened that chief of that tribe of demons made his Challenge and he lost and he said when he lost every demon under him fa Hallelujah let me remind the chief of the chiefs of the chief of chief of the tribe of demon and Calvary you lost Hallelujah my Champion defeated you and he overcame you and when he overcame everything under him fell cancer has fa sugar diabetes has fa high blood pressure has fa Hallelujah every sin has fail he has lost the battle faith is the [Applause] victory Hallelujah it is the victory it is the overcoming power it is something that'll make you rise up and take another step that's the truth the devil wants to whoop you down over some some feeling it's time you start whooping back that's what I'm talking about get off them ropes start swinging yes sir you've been taking punches long enough start swinging back well how I swing back get on your knees lift up your hands you said well John you know he wrote that scripture he didn't have any troubles huh okay he didn't have anything to deal with like I deal with he did not have to go through things that I go through that that may be right he may have he didn't have to deal with the same folks I deal with quote he may not have had to overcome the same thing things but he never was excluded from them he had trouble he was setting a bad of oil bad of oil tried to be bold to death how many ever been through something like that so take your wowy wowy Woos and put them back in your pocket if you want to this ain't the service for wowy wowy Woos your wowy Wy Woos blob to get chopped off so if you like them too much put them back in your pocket quit worshiping and throw it on the ground though you wonder why you ain't delivered sometime cuz you worship it come on that's right I can't get off of I'm sorry but that negative Spirit you worship it it's following family trees all the way down and you just carried it right on why don't you get a sword of the word and say devil I'm not going to be that person I'm cutting it off and when it rises back up cut it off it rises back up cut it off he says faith is the victory that overcomes the world so he told us i' i' I've told you all of this so you can have peace well how can I have peace because he's over already overcome it it's overcome and he put it on a string and it's just playing out how he wants it to play out I like doing that because I know the devil can't stand seeing me do that devil you're on a string yes sir H that's I'm G to play that a little bit more look at that puppet you can only do what God says do you can only do what God allows you to do you can only speak what God allows you to Faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer Faith isn't a peacemaker what does that mean brother Tim ain't I supposed to make peace with my enemies well not the devil he ain't talking about Humanity here yeah if you got a human enemy you need to make peace forgive and let go and move on but not ever the devil we don't make peace with the devil we don't make peace with him we don't allow him to just you know take well you take that and I'll take this ain't none of that no it's all mine so get your hands off of it Heen we're not we're not a peacemaker when it comes to the devil it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is Faith what does it conquer it what is to conquer conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down you listening to devil conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff and to throw in [Music] prison Hallelujah come on somebody maybe you'll clap a little bit more cuz that was a direct quote conquer means to beat down to override to handcuff and to throw in prison hallelujah amen this devil wants to override you no you have been given the promise to override him hello somebody this word overrides anything the devil ever says this word overrides any lie any Spirit of Hell any devil wants to come torment you this word overrides it look there I was needing one of them anyhow it overrides it it rises above it and it conquers that old spirit and it binds him up and it chunks him back into hell where he belongs amen it means to beat down I remember uh there there in Johnson City they in Johnson City we had a prayer line there their meetings just last year brother Ron brother Donnie and different ones praying we went to the back you know brother Ron's laid out brother Donnie's laid out they got oxygen brother Donnie he finally gets that boing off he said boys if the winners look this bad how many how how bad does the defeated [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] look hallelujah hallelujah I believe it I believe after every service they go back dragging limbs yes sir what happened to you what happened to you well I made the stupid mistake of going to Eden light Tabernacle and I showed up there this Sunday morning and that preacher whooped me from one side down the other and then this little woman get to believe and she grabbed that sword and she back took my head off Hallelujah here comes another walking into hell and he's got his head in his hand he said well she didn't miss me she whoop me I'm I don't know what to do I ain't going there no more come on somebody it's time we realize who we are you say well we look like a bunch of rundown nothing well you ought to see what the whoop side looks like cuz we ain't the whoop side we're the Victorious side and we're Rising above every Spirit of hell we're Rising above every Spirit of hell and we're putting them under our feet it means to beat down to override to over oh my how many times you come to a service and you had all kinds of thoughts and the word of God comes across and it overrides it cancels it brother brother Andrew preached a sermon on that when the devil's plans are cancelled he he got plans but it don't work out the way he plans he makes plans and he makes plans and he make You' think you'd get tired of making plans cuz it don't ever work out the way he wants it means it's the sin that once ruled you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it you have whipped it you're greater than it is he's oh boy I'm feeling religious about right now which was first a sinner or a savior he said a savior for a savior is more powerful than the sin which one first the Healer or the sickness it was a Healer cuz it can conquer the sickness faith is a victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil he may have put curses in your family tree but Faith overcome them faith will rise up Faith is a victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not faith in some man but faith in the one who overcome the world Jesus Christ who made the promise that's the victory you say well my arms still crippled but faith is a victory well I feel sick faith is a victory it overcomes the world when you can climb into God by prayer until you see that thing conquered under you there's nothing can hurt you then maybe maybe let's just use these words then so maybe something's been tormenting you and you've allowed it have you climbed into God by prayer we climb into our feelings a lot climb into our passions a lot but what about climbing into God by prayer getting down to business with God he said you who have been a drunk or a slave to Whiskey you'll be a master over him then that Old Devil of alcohol that made you drink he's your master now when you when you get Faith he said I don't mean make believe I'm talking about real Faith he's your servant then he's your servant then you who couldn't lay down tab uh tobacco you women and men when it come to a place where you get to a spot and then that's where you have to overcome it by faith you'll Master it he's a little woman that's sitting here present now has been an altar Time After Time good woman but she started smoking a long time ago and she couldn't overcome it she'd come up and I'd pray for her and seem like she just couldn't overcome it and the first thing you know I told her here I said there'll be danger down the road she said brother Rand I've cried I beg I said you're just being emotional fighting the air that won't do any good and I'd get down and pray with her and lay hands on her and she'd go back and a few days of me her again just knock you down with cigarette smoke hands still brown one night Down Yonder she went to a doctor and began to get sick wither away till little spinally thing and he said it's cancer from smoking cigarettes there she was laying there dying then she got down to business he said I drown a man will reach for a straw long as you can walk out of this church tonight and know you're going to join something or be something I'm a good person there's nothing wrong with me you can't do nothing I can't do nothing with you he can't do nothing but when you see your sins as God sees them in the light of your Bible then you'll see then you'll repent or perish something will take place you'll get down to business you'll walk out here and smother around your heart the doctor back there it's a heart attack you'll get down to business then he said she had to get down to business and he said that woman is sitting looking at me right now he said brother Robertson back here Mr wood so forth went down there somewhere we said we were going somewhere hunting I think in a truck and holy spear began to move us move among us to go up by the knobs of where she was and I got there she had a dream and when the Holy Spirit come into the room she got down to real business she had never smoked a cigarette from then on she gain many pounds of weight and can't find a trace of Si cancer what is it it's faith that overcomes it's faith that overcomes Why didn't it overcome when I was praying for her because she was just fluttering around all right so it doesn't matter how many times you come up here and get prayed for if you're just fluttering around it's not going to happen but if you're down to business with God that's right then I personally believe you'll come and be prayed for and believe won't come Time After Time After Time for the sake thing if you're doing that you're coming because you don't believe and if you're coming because you don't believe then ain't no reason coming you're fluttering around right but when you get down to business why not get down he said why not why why wait so long why not get down to business now put your faith in God what if the woman had had her faith in me it have failed because I'm a man but when she changed her faith not in brandom Tabernacle or William brandom hello somebody this is a trap we can't get in I believe and laying hands on the sick I believe calling the Elders of the church but I also believe you speak the word and it'll be done come on somebody amen I I believe though if we're not careful our our our belief will turn to unbelief yeah well I got to have so and so pray for me or it ain't going to happen well it ain't going to happen I don't care who you get to pray for you cuz your faith is in the wrong place come on somebody well if I can just get brother so and so if I can just get to brother so and so then then I I can get it no if you'll just get to Jesus that's who you want to get to it ain't brother so and so it ain't me it ain't brother Aaron brother Joe brother Tim or any other preacher it's to God well I just need a word you got it and like I said I'm not against I it's happened through me so many times but it's it's it's uh Sovereign exactly right I can't make it happen there ain't no man can make it happen brother Brandon can't well brother brand you see me a vision he couldn't see no vision not on his own it had to be Sovereign of God neither can a man give you a word just because you want one come on somebody amen that's not where our faith should lie anyhow we already have the word amen when you get down to business he said often wonder why does Christian want to frustrate them things amen with the things of the world men and women he said come to to me many times go back why do Christians want to frustrate themselves with them things anyhow men and women come to me many times and say their confession and so forth when I have those private interviews and meet them make confessions living Immortal and all kinds because they can't deny it the holy spirit's right there and if they try to cover it up it'll bring it out he say so they might as well tell it but if they try to get out the Holy Spirit stops them and say just a minute here's a certain certain thing but when they come they begin to tell me about the little things of the world I noticed amongst the Believers you're going somewhere what are you drifting for get an ambition about you set your goal on Christ and quit tallying with the world he said you pick up a magazine say well now the Divine Healers of this day there's no such thing as Divine healers that'll put de my doubt in your mind somebody gets on the radio and preaches a pretty good sermon but says the days of Miracles are pass he said that'll weaken you he said get right with God either be what you are or don't be at all if God's Bible doesn't teach it then get away from it but if it does teach it stay with it said for instance what if we're going to take a little trip in 30 days from now to another land and in this land the climate was so wonderful till you never come back no more over there we would never have to die or get old we' just be there forever he said I could I imagine seeing you go around to a 10- cent store buying a lot of junk to take with you you'd be trying to get rid of the junk you had amen he said when you just frustrate yourself with joining one church or this or that and you act accumulate more junk he said but if that but if you just think of where you're going you'll get a rid of a lot of doubt and nonsense you'll have real faith I say to people are you brother BR he said are you they say brother brand are you the one to pray for sick yes well that's against my faith said you ain't got any faith said that's what the Bible teaches there so many people come to the line they say well I've got all Faith then what you doing up here then hello somebody just tell what he said oh it isn't so real Faith knows no defeat it will never be defeated even death itself can't defeat it it knows no defeat trials no defeat but Faith knows no defeat it cannot be defeated it's the only way that you can please God without faith it's impossible to please God and then in this place could I imagine you go around some of you using slang slang using Christians using smudy dirty words you belong to a church could I imagine you're going over to that other land in America learning all the American slang you here about certainly wouldn't the thing you'd be trying to do would learn a few words of that language over there did I read that right he said I I I think You' try to be learning a few words of that language over there as much as you say how do you do anyhow he said I think it would behoove Christians more today if they try to learn some Heavenly language the Praises of God that we're going to sing over there enjy and the people that's not going to believe that does not believe in shouting what would you do when you get over there you're going to be out of place you better get Faith and overcome now for faith is a victory that overcome no we wouldn't be tagging little things like that we would be having Victory he says how do I do it brother Brown he said it's so simple yes sir it is just give yourself over to the Holy Spirit then it isn't you anymore you don't know what you're going to say you just let him do the saying it's so simple as that got a few more minutes he said many of you people have faith in in your doctors you should if you got a doctor so when something gets wrong with you you go to that old fa faithful doctor you believe in that's what you should do that's good then you submit your case to him and if he says you should go to the hospital and you don't do a thing but go home and pack your clothes and you go to the hospital sure you got faith in the doctor but if he doesn't decide you want to go to the hospital or you should go rather he'd write out a prescription give you some pills hack full of pills and you'd swallow them you don't know what in those pills but you got faith in the doctor he said how about God can I say it again how about God you're scared to swallow some of the gospels he gives you by his stripes you were healed faith is a victory that overcomes the world swallow it and see what happens swallow it and see what happens it's a confidence you show what confidence you have in your doctor by taking his medicine then you don't know what it is you show your confidence in the doctor by submitting yourself to an operation that proves your confidence in the doctor but when it comes to Christ we're scared to take him at his word hello and you know God has never misdiagnosed a case I know doctors do all they can humanly speaking but they still make humans mistakes they have went in and pulled the wrong tooth they got x-rays they got all kinds of stuff and still go in and pull the wrong tooth it's happened before they go in and do some of the wrong things but do we quit go going to a dentist no do we quit going to doctors no why would we quit going to Jesus when he's never misdiagnosed a case when he's never lost a patient he's never overdosed anybody he won't give you more than what you can handle he'll give you exactly what you have he said submit your cas to Jesus Christ just as you submit your case to a doctor give me anything you want Lord You're the doctor on the case then you got the victory then you got faith that overcomes you'll never hunt another prayer line You'll never hunt nothing else you'll have it right then it's settled you'll never jump from church to church to see if this one's got or that one's got it you have it you got it when you got the faith you got the victory he said what we need today is to let doct Jesus come in and perform an operation on our faith the doctor tells you you got a little appendix it's all poison it ought to come out you got this that it needs to come out well he takes out so the rest of you can live can function that's what the matter tonight with our faith we're afraid to let God take his operating word his knife sharper than in two-edged sword and operate on us and tell us that our little Fandango hung um bugging around is wrong your laxidasical attitude your depression your anxieties your fears are wrong it's unbelief we've got to turn loose every shadow and sail towards God's Eternal promise he said if we'll do that Jesus will perform the operation of Faith taking away all doubt all fears all worries all sin when our faith is clearly operated on then come out a new creation can you trust Jesus for an operation can you believe him can you say Lord at Thy Word we've done all we can but at Thy word nevertheless Lord at Thy word I'll let down the net Lord I'm a fisherman I know what I'm doing I know the signs of the moon I I know when they're biting when they're not I know all the schools and the theologies I know all but at Thy word I'm going to let down the net and when they did they enclosed such a multitude of fishes to their Nets almost broke faith is the victory there might not have been one fish in the water but God made the promise he will create a fish when you throw the net in there might not be a chance for you to live you might be dying with cancer you might be bound to a wheelchair you might be totally blind I don't know what your trouble is but if you'll take the chief doctor's prescription yes whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them and believe that that faith will overcome any difficulty that there is my God you may be so burdened with sin until your soul is as smudy as you can be you might have tried to get rid of that ill temper and that slandering tongue and that gossip it might have tried you might have tried ever remedy but if you'll let Jesus come tonight and operate on your faith and give you a faith that'll climb beyond anything the world could ever produce a victory that'll overcome the world let's power our hearts Faith to overcome Faith to rise above it all many of us I never had to up to this point about the worst thing has happened is a broken arm one time that cracked actually and they just put a cast but many of us has had to submit ourselves to an operation faith enough to let them give us something that'll put us out Faith to believe they'll give us something else to wake us back up and while we're out they're doing what they're supposed to do it's going to fix and allow other things to operate how they're supposed to operate what about right now would you have faith to believe and allow God to come and operate on your faith how many can say Lord I I just need a little operation this morning I just want to submit myself to you just come by whatever it may be Lord I just need something cut out need something worked on so other things can operate the right way whatever it's been maybe it's been some depression he can just come by in a moment and say and it's gone but you got to submit yourself to him recognize your needs recognize I Need You Jesus let me just lay myself on your table just give me that medicine of your word just to go down in my Realms of my body and my soul and open me up where I need to be opened up cut out what needs to be cut out Lord if there's a cancer that begin to grow there cut it out there's some that's come there because of some resentment cut it out some bitterness Lord that I've allowed to Fester I know that's going to be a hard Operation God i' to go deep Lord I know your not your knife can go exactly down to the very root of it and cut it out would you submit yourself to him submit yourself to him and then the devil will flee from you father seen these hands lifted all over this building you know the situations
