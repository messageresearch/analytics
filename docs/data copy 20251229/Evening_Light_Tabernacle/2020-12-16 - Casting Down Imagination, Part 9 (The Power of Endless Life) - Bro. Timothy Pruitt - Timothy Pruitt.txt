tonight touch us by your grace we pray we commit this service to you lord and for your glory and honor in jesus name amen amen amen let's turn to second corinthians 10. amen it's always good to be in the house of the lord amen like to speak to you again on casting down imaginations the pulling down of strongholds ii corinthians 10 and verse 3 said for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds amen we let you be seated today looking here at what paul wrote in the word of god it says the weapons of our warfare are not carnal in other words they're not merely human the weapons that we depend upon is not our human ability or our human nature or what we are born with as a human but the weapons that we are dependent on are mighty through god in other words they're not having they're not of the nature of flesh but they're in the nature of the supernatural they're not under the control of an animal appetite or human appetite or a human nature but they're under the control of the spirit of god all of our human efforts combined can do nothing against the powers of darkness but we are not relying on ourselves we are relying on our god amen these weapons are mighty in god amen mighty through god the word mighty actually translated they're dynamically powerful in other words these weapons he has given us he has supplied us with more than enough than we need to have victory in our lives amen we just have to tap into what's already available you know brother brandon would make this statement as a powerful statement he said any christian in here has a right to meet satan anywhere and defeat him hallelujah how many christians do we have here tonight any christians in here has the right to meet satan anywhere and defeat him on any grounds that he could ever stand on hallelujah the weapons that we use are not physical they're not tangible but our weapons are weapons of faith their weapon that's a whip our weapons that we use it is the word of god their prayer and even the weapon of worship it is right believing or believing right and they are mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds that have tried to keep us bound now strongholds are places that the devil has tried to build to hold you strongholds are many times the results of wrong thinking or wrong beliefs that have taken root in our lives they're contrary to god's thoughts as we have heard the scripture says god's thoughts are higher than our thoughts amen our most are often inspired by the devil's lies lies that we have believed about ourselves lives that we believe about god lies that we believe about others and that that there gives a stronghold for the devil to hold on to your actions to your behaviors to your habits and the more strongly you believe these lies the stronger the whole now the whole stronghold doesn't just sit in your mind and do nothing no they produce actions they produce behaviors they produce habits they produce no matter what you try it seems impossible to get rid of them you know someone compared a stronghold one time as i was studying this i thought it was really good analogy it compared a stronghold to like being in a boat that is filling up with water and you can grab a bucket and you can work as hard as you want to to get the water out of the boat but the water is not the problem the one the problem is the hole in the bottom of the boat amen and many times strongholds is our problems and until you plug that or deal with that problem or that hole in your life or that hole in your thinking or or that hole in your actions or whatever you're going to keep getting water in the boat and all the hard work and all the efforts in the world will not get the water out but the hole in the bottom of the boat is what the real problem is now you know we we you can try really hard to get rid of the behavior like the water you know i don't like being this way i don't want to be this way but it just keeps coming back amen it keeps coming back and it keeps coming back you know it was very strange here last sunday uh thoughts as i was singing here at the end of service the lord began to deal with me about peace and you know people want peace all the time especially in the world that we live here but many times in situations people want god to change the situation instead of god changing them amen and that's what we're dealing with is the boat the hole in the boat it's you know the water's still there the trouble still there the problem's still there the situation's still there but god i need you to change me amen many times peace is not a magical moment where all of a sudden all the surroundings change and we have peace the greatest peace is god's peace and that peace surpasses all understanding in other words when you can't understand why you're in the situation why you're going through this you can still have peace when you can't understand why am i this way you can still have peace or why am i dealing with the situation or the circumstances you can still have peace in other words this peace transcends the emotions and the circumstances but you know too many times we are not careful we are worshiping our emotions or our state and giving it more importance than god or others amen we're not dealing with the hole that's in the boat you know honestly these you know uh we we won't we won't change but what you have to change is what you believe and what your thoughts are upon and what your thinking is and you know as the bible says as you think in your heart so you will be many if not all people have strongholds in their minds that hold them in the bondage by the way they think and there's many strongholds that we could deal with tonight there's strongholds of addiction and strongholds of anger and strongholds of fear and strongholds of loneliness and strongholds of rejection strongholds of unforgiveness or jealousy and the list goes on and on and you can see people allow these things to become really predominant in their lives to where even like a stronghold of of unforgiveness to where they can't even gather with family no more they can't even be in somebody's presence why because there's a stronghold there and and they want the situation to change but they won't deal with the hole that's in the bottom of the boat amen you know and and so we got to realize that whatever we think as david would say in the psalms he said all your precepts concerning all things i consider to be right but i hate every false way and i believe that's what we got to come to is when we realize god's word is first as we've been preaching on this we got to put god's word in this proper place that when it comes to our thinking or our ways or whatever we're willing to submit ourselves and say god i'm not the right person i'm not right in this situation your word is right amen and i hate every false way so every way that i have that don't line up to the word of god is a false way you say well i was born this way or i i this is the way i am this is just if it does not line up with the word of god it's a stronghold it's a false way and david said i hate every false way hallelujah he is acknowledging one god is always right about everything hallelujah he is right about marriage he is right about money he is right about our family he's right about forgiveness he's right about bitterness he's right about everything you can put there anything you can think of god is right amen he also said i hate every false way every idea every reasoning anything i think or do that's contrary to the word of god i hate it see lives can imprison you and therefore defeat you and we have to turn down the lie of satan eve didn't turn down satan's lie they brought death to the human race and if you don't turn down satan's lie it's going to bring death to you amen but what happened with mary she accepted the word of god and it brought forth life amen we must rely not upon our abilities but upon our weapons that god has given us amen and use them against the enemy knowing it's not our strength it is his strength it's not our abilities it's his abilities it's not my waltzes his wants it's not the way i've desired is his desire it's everything about him his way is the way i want hallelujah this is what he would say in ephesians 6 and verse 10 he says finally my brethren be strong where well i got a strong nature that's not where you to be strong in i know many times we rely upon our god-given now our natures our human natures amen but that's not what we're to be strong in to be strong in the lord and in the power of his might amen the scripture said it's not by might nor by power but by his spirit amen an amplified it would say it like this in conclusion be strong in the lord be empowered by your union with him this is the power that a christian draws from this is what gets him to the deepest of valleys and and what gets him to the greatest of sorrows it's not who i am it's who he is it's not me that doesn't it's the father that does it in me hallelujah amen let's be strong in the lord be empowered through your union with him draw your strength from him hallelujah i know people draw their strength from a good a good uh something that happened you know well this happened over here that and testimonies and those things are wonderful but no matter if there's never another testimony we draw our strength from him hallelujah put on god's whole armor the armor of a heavy armed soldier which god supplies that you may be able to successfully stand up against all the strategies and the deceits of the devil for we are not wrestling with flesh and blood we're not continuing continuing contending with a physical opponent but against principalities against powers against the rulers of this present darkness against the spirit forces of wickedness in heavenly or supernatural spheres therefore put on god's complete armor that you may be able to resist and stand your ground in the evil day of danger and having done all the crisis demand to stand stand firmly in your place and don't give it back don't step back an ounce or an itch hallelujah hallelujah stand therefore hold your ground and having tightened the belt of truth around your loins and having put on the breastplate of integrity and a moral amen responsibilities and right standing with god and having shod your feet in preparation to face the enemy with full firm footed stability and promptness and a readiness that's produced by the gospel of peace lift up over all the covering shield of the saving faith of almighty god upon which you can quench all the flaming missiles of the wicked one take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit and wield it which is the word of god pray at all times at every occasion in every season oh hallelujah amen in the spirit with all manner of prayer and entreaty to that end keep alert and watch with strong purpose and perseverance amen this is what we're to do god has given of himself all of these are weapons of the spirit amen and this is where he tested them all out jesus when he came filled with the holy ghost he was tempted in all manner he tested every weapon and he tried everything and he realized it works it'll hold through every temptation it'll hold in the middle of the storm it'll hold in sickness and trouble when family leaves you and sitting and everybody walks away it'll hold when your closest friends walks away in a hole hallelujah when people defect it'll hold he's tested it over and over and he gave of himself he gave us a spirit amen to pull down strongholds not to let those strongholds hold you hallelujah he's got examples all through the bible of pulling down strongholds jericho was a stronghold but god didn't let it stand he tore it down amen listen god is in the business of taking down strongholds god is in the business of of rewriting lives and rewriting situations to where it don't even hold you no more his spirit is here to lead in god he came in the flesh to do what to destroy the works of the devil it came to put himself in your battle this is where paul is talking to me he said look be strong in the lord the weapons of our war for our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god amen what is he saying he's showing a union there that it's not just you and you alone i know satan loves to get people out and you're all by yourself and nobody cares listen god's with you jesus is with you amen this is what happened with the great triumphant general that's what he said taking the whole armor of god came down and was the word made flesh he took that word and he defeated satan on every ground he took the word and he said you destroy this temple and i raised it up in the third day why david in the word and said i'd suffer my holy one not to seek corruption neither will i leave his soul in hell he knew that that was one promise of god he would be raised up and he took that word and went to death with it knowing that the word would come to pass in his body and raise him up again hallelujah and there's not one word of god's promises that will not come to pass he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail every promise is perfect [Music] and on one promise in the scripture he stood and went to death on one promise oh hallelujah amen on one promise can we not stand and go into eternal life jesus knew corruption set in the body after 72 hours the nose falls in begins to stink david said by the holy ghost a man inspired the word of the lord coming to the prophet said i'll not suffer him to seek corruption he knew before one cell could corrupt he would be up out of the grave he was the word fortified by the word he rose up and he conquered death hell and the grave and himself came back in the form of the holy ghost to fortify his army for this last day for this last day this big onslaught where there'd be great intellectual giants rising up reasoning against the word of god but the promise said i'll not leave you or forsake you but i'll be with you and i will not leave your comfortest but i'll come again and i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world hallelujah so we're not in the boat alone listen we got a god who's in the boat fixing business let me go down for a minute i heard this song today and it just it just spoke to me it was a charles johnson singing at him and the revivers this course says jesus is with me when the storm clouds gather he's standing by my side when i hear the thunder roll he holds my hand when i begin to tremble when the winds of this world are blowing strong and i believe we'll see if we're feeling the winds of the world blowing jesus is offense around his children his grace is sufficient enough to stand the storm his word is a promise we can stand on when the winds of this world are blowing strong satan is moving to and fro throughout the land seeking whom he may devour but he was defeated at golgotha that day when jesus made him out to be a liar satan is always sneaking around the gate trying to lead a sheep astray but he that is in us is greater than him so then we rebuke him and chase him away if you're caught up in the winds of the world with no joy in your life at all just give your heart to jesus he'll always understand and he'll never let you fall jesus is with me when the storm clouds gather hallelujah this is what paul was trying to get a hold of go get a hold of our minds to let us know in the storm he's with you in the battle he's with you in disease he's with you in situations of life he's with you he'll never leave you or forsake you jesus is with me who do you think you're wrapped around who's wrapped around you when you put on the armor of god it's not our creeds it's not our dogma it's it's not our religion it's the weapons of god amen but he said that he gave us this for the great onslaught of the great intellectual giants that would be raising up at the last day intellectual giants it says days of miracles are passed intellectual giants it says there's no such thing as divine healing no more intellectual giants it says mercy's over come on now there's intellectual giants making these decrees and they're calling it out and saying there's nobody else to be saved there's nobody else to be filled with the holy ghost there's no there's there's not the holy ghost power can't keep listen there's intellectual giants in this message they're saying the holy ghost can't keep you no more it's a mess it's intellectual giants that people have raised up in their own thinking and own vain imaginations and begin to see things the world the word has never said and begin to decree things and and begin but he said but in these times i'm not going to leave you comfortless but i'm going to be with you hallelujah he said i pray to the father he'll send another comforter which is the holy ghost this is what the armor of god is it is the holy ghost hallelujah you cannot use the word of god without the holy ghost you cannot use a shield of faith without the holy ghost he said to pray in the spirit the holy ghost the word god's great artillery artillery in a human being manifesting the resurrection think of it the great conqueror who conquered every sickness the great conqueror who conquered every sickness so i think we ought to let cancer know tonight it's conquered blood pressure no it's conquered every sickness is conquered that ought to give shouting shoes to us tonight every sickness our chief captain has already conquered it hallelujah he's conquered every superstition he's conquered every giant he's conquered both death hell and the grave he's conquered every atmosphere [Music] oh hallelujah and he ascended on high but he didn't stay there he comes back in the form of the holy ghost and now we are more than conquerors oh hallelujah don't you know there's a spirit in the building that can be placed on the inside of you that'll overcome that depression they can overcome every kind of demon oppression demon a torment spirits that want to come against the children of god there is a spirit the holy ghost that'll overcome everything and i think as a bride of jesus christ we need to be holding the banner the holy ghost works the holy ghost heals it's changed and amen hallelujah the holy ghost will break every addiction the only ghost will break every spirit in hell it's already been conquered and we've been made more than congress pulling down strongholds oh he says what an army he said should be an invincible army in other words an army that's unbeatable unstoppable an army that can't lose why he's in us he's already conquered i don't have to do a thing but just believe in him and walk on for he's risen and his spirit is now in us the same resurrection presence that fell in that body and raised him up from the grave is in the people that's got the holy ghost we raised up from the things of the world we've raised up from unbelief we've raised up from creeds to living christ with every power of the enemy defeated even death itself is defeated hell's defeated graves defeated sick was defeated amen not me he conquered it it's not what i am it's what he is it's not where i'm at it's where he's at i'm passed from death in the life he said well you might call me silly preaching like this he said well i feel better the way i am just let me alone if you don't want to believe it let us along amen because i know out there as he says i was dead but i'm a lot better off today because of this word has been given us in this hour he did he don't go before us he even goes in us oh hallelujah he tells a story about a fire that broke down and broke out down in jeffersonville and it about burned this whole thing down and they got a fire department out the jeffersonville fire department standing around like a little boy with a little water hose chief walking around with a cigar out saying squirt a little water here and squirt a little water there come on squirt a little water up there well we got another fire department get another wing sufficient send down clarksville and then come bang bang bang the chief walked out shook hands with other chief doing what honor to one another how can you have faith when you have honor to have to honor just like that some great men some big guy some press but it's not about that we're brothers and sisters in christ jesus it's nothing big among us it's about what's in us that's big oh hallelujah oh that'll deal with every racial problem right there it ain't black or white it ain't red or yellow it's what's in us that's big hallelujah it's what's in instead of calling somebody to get up out of a wheelchair and walk again it's what's in us that i call a woman that's laying there almost brain dead and the doctors ain't giving no hope but a little man walking the room be the call for her life it's what's in us that produces that it's what's in us the holy ghost and every one of us believers ain't no great holy bishops and great holy fathers it's the holy ghost and his people hallelujah it ain't big big preachers and little preachers it's the holy ghost in his people here comes clark oh good evening chief bishop how you doing the building burning right now this is where they're at they've become so intellectual they put themselves outside of the age god is calling the bride out of and squirt a little water over here and squirt a little water over there big eyes and little use mocking us making fun of us meanwhile the building's burning down break out break out that one to squirt a little water over here we said when that hill army of firefighters come swirl that little truck that big truck around there in the streets they about cleaned off half the sidewalk when they turned it who was up at the end of that ladder it was the chief himself he had a hose in one hand and an axe in the other and he said let her go and they pulled the lever who went first the fire chief when it hit up against the wall he took that axe before the ladder got against the wall and he slammed it through the window and he said come on boys let's go put this fire out and he said that's exactly what christ done the word come living in a human being and he took a hose and an axe and he conquered the death hell and the grave and he said come on now i'm with you you're not in this war though i'm with you he is so tired at the time i met you in the fire i'm with you in the water i'm with you in every situation don't forget who's with you [Applause] great conqueror he said we don't need great intellectual denominations well i belong to the biggest church in this nonsense it ain't even i belong to the littlest one i belong to the one i've been in he said i've been in the branham family for 53 years they didn't ask me to join the family i was born at branham he said that's the way you're a child of god you're born a child of god by the new birth and where do we get away from that it's like brother adam will say i can tell you where he put it in it you tell us where he took it out we're not born by believing a message that's only a start have you received the holy ghost since you believed well we've gotten away from that gotten away from preaching the holy ghost god it's like it's some kind of old folky idea it is the idea it is all of the idea if you don't get that you miss the whole boat if you don't get that you don't even have boat you're sunk he said many times he began to talk about the armor he said why is a nation providing all this protection and training and and and all the and he said they put this 90-something pound pack on this 90-something pound man low started sweating to death does it really work really we really got to go through all of this we you know he starts complaining he said but when he gets in the battle then he'll appreciate all of that he said wait till the battle comes he'll appreciate what's all in his pack you know many times we get aggravated with what we're going through god's training us for something we get mad at god we get angry oh i'm not mad at god we'll check your attitude because we allow it to overtake us and we allow it to be our stronghold to where that's all we can think eat sleep anything about it's a stronghold god knew that this time would come he knew the time that we would be living in and all the intellectual giants that are spouting out their nonsense and he knew the kind of enemies we'd be facing with the trying to reason the power of god out of the church and prove that days of miracles are passed and prove god don't do that no more so what does god do he packs his church with the baptism of the holy ghost this is a prophet of god speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues prophecy gifts and all kinds of things they may seem hard in the training but in the battlefront every one of them's got to be used god equips his soldiers exactly what it takes for the battle they might say well just learn psychology just learn just be you know he said that's thinner than a broth made of a shadow of a chicken that's half starved of the earth there's no that's no good we have to have the power of the holy ghost coming upon a man hallelujah you said i just don't like to get out i just don't like to pray i just don't like we got to have the power of the holy ghost coming upon a man he said if you don't like it you're going to get killed in the battlefront you're going to be a defector oh no i'll never do peter didn't think he would either judas when he first started walking with god he didn't think he would either amen he said you stay there until a god equips you with the baptism of the spirit and then everything you've got need of in this world or the world to come is in you right then the always god knows how to equip his army he equips it with the best thing the baptism of the holy ghost mercy he knew that people would reason it would go to reading this word when it come out in print out here and what would happen hello somebody oh they could then now find get a message search and follow and follow him and realize he may he said this here and he said this over here they got mistakes over here and they begin to reason reason reason really till they talk themselves right out of it he knew it would happen he knew there was going to be people that would do all of that and bring all their their fake trials against the prophet of god he knew all of that amen so what does he equip you with not with more reasoning not with a greater intellect than what they got he and he he equips you with the greatest power ever known to the man of any man that ever has lived on the face of this earth it is the power of the holy ghost that'll hold you in your greatest trial because it held him he said we knew he knew it would come to where people say where is the god of history where's the god that crossed the red sea and opened it up where is the god that healed the sick god knew it would take the baptism of the holy ghost to prove his later latter day signs he knew it would have to be to be an effective witness oh hallelujah he knew what it was going to take he knew what it was going to take to hold you in the fire he knew what it was going to take to hold you in the middle of the storm he knew all about it so he gave us the best there is satan knows that reasoning and what reason and powers there are and where it lays the power of reason and and so he knows what it is to come against you in the mental uh capacities but god doesn't fight him with your mental capacities he fights him with the spirit he says listen this he equipped his army with the holy ghost to do those things talking about to be effective with witness to be uh to show the signs he equipped his people with the baptism the holy ghost to do those things to make the secrets of the heart known as he promised you can't do that with any kind of training you can only do it by the baptism of the holy spirit the armor of god and this is the evening light to make hebrews 13 8 a reality it would make take more than a training you can read words you can read words you can read words it'll never make it come to pass until you have the holy ghost in there to manifest it that's the light put it on the whole armor of god not just to dress only or dress up and say glory to god i got the holy ghost you're spurting all the power out of the whistle you're doing no good put it in action put it in faith make it move make it do something putting on the whole armor of god to go out and withstand the wiles of the devil and the tear down is strongholds it's what he would say in romans 8 and verse 5 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be for then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit oh hallelujah if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you you're not in the flesh if the spirit of god dwells in you now if any man have not the spirit of god christ he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwelling you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you hallelujah it's not by our mental capabilities it's by his spirit it's not how good we can put quotes together it's by his spirit this is why paul says i do not come to you with word words of man's wisdom and enticing words of man's wisdom i come to you in power and demonstration of the spirit of god listen people got it all wrong they think it's something just to get up and give a little flowery speech and the goods that make us feel a little good listen i ain't interested in a flowery speech amen for that matter obama was a good speech maker but i'm not interested in that i'm not interested in a good speech i'm interested in the demonstration of the power of the holy ghost that when i see there i know god is there when i see lives changed i know god is there you know one of the greatest testimonies of this church is not it's sitting on highway 371 with a sign out front it's not it's rock pillars and it's a nice carpet and beautiful piano beautiful pews that were donated that's not the greatest sign one of the greatest signs of this church being a living breathing body of christ is there's young people sitting there hungry for the word of god one of the greatest signs of a church being a dead church is the young people ain't hungry they're not growing they're not moving on they're going into things of the world i'll never forget when this man and woman sat there and said you know what they come from the baptist they tried to come become a message but they just only become baptist methodists matt baptist message but they said one of the greatest things that testified to us about your church was that our church it was only 60 year old and up that's about all that's there young people are gone but we came to your church there's young people that's worshiping god there's life there hallelujah i want to be where life's at praise the lord amen i want to be where the spirit of god can move and convict and and move upon hearts and change them hallelujah oh my this and i want to get to this for a moment because there is a power you know the power it's not a temporary power hallelujah you know you come to come to church tonight in the car how many come in a car or a truck vehicle nobody come and horse a buggy i don't think but anyway car and truck everybody came in there enjoyed that nice that nice um heat and maybe some windshield wipers i don't know if it was raining or whatever enjoyed that keeping the elements off of you but that car and this power is temporary it bottle like last till the pavements are done if you're lucky that's right they they i think they make them that way you used to you can get a washing machine last 30 years and they decided you know that's a bad idea they last that long they won't ever come back and buy another one so they make them last just a certain length that's what they do parts are made out of plastic from china and everywhere else and they put it all together it's only temporary it's only a temporary thing but what you have the holy ghost is not temporary and something that's temporary is also limited your car has a limited horsepower it has limited abilities it can go only a certain distance without being refueled it has limitations it it can only cool so much in the hottest of summer it can only heat so much in the coldest of winter it has limitation but you do not have a power in you that is limited you do not have a power in you that's temporary or or it is eternal this is what paul said in hebrews 7 and verse 10 14 he said for it is evident that our lord spring out of judah which is the tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchizedek there arises another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life well that's what power i'm talking about and that power of endless life has made you oh hallelujah amen you can tell that a power that made the car a car is limited it has limitability so it had to be a limited power that made a limited creation well come on now but this power's not limited and if it made you kings and priests it didn't give you a limitation it said your love your kings and priests over every spirit over every ruler of darkness over every power over every depression over every anxiety you have been made rulers hallelujah the devil is limited oh hallelujah the devil is limited amen he was created he didn't create him to destroy he was created as an angel of light but he was given a choice and he made the wrong choice and here now he's destined for destruction you know it's kind of it's kind of a humorous to me to think about the devil he laughs at me i like laughing at him but to realize he's limited to realize he's like my car he has an end that ought to put some some joy in some hearts tonight when you realize that depression has an end that sickness has tormented you has an end and he a limited being is trying to defeat something that's unlimited that's just how stupid the devil is but you have been made kings and priests you have been made rulers he hath made us i didn't make myself that he made me this there are certain truths you brother brown said you have to emphasize he made us salvation is his doing all of his grace all of his power he redeemed us for a purpose he brought us here for a purpose as kings over a spiritual kingdom we're going to be kings upon the earth with him but now we rule as spiritual kings we reign over a spiritual kingdom we reign with christ having dominion over sin amen that's what the holy ghost does for the believer it gives you a dominion over sin therefore sin does not rule you no more you rule sin if real sin is still ruling you then you don't have a dominion you don't have the holy ghost but if if you are the ruling over sin the world the flesh and the devil that's the dominion that christ has given us showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is christ in us willing and doing his good pleasure he has made us kings and priests to the christian today how many christians the victory is one you need to look at that stronghold and say the victory is one [Applause] just like joshua would look at jericho and he said the victory is one before one wall came down before one stone crumbled before one little motion was made the victory is won amen and when the victory is won the joy bells are ringing why the victory's won in order to conquer and win the greatest battle that's ever won he stepped out of glory and he took on human flesh he didn't come in a form of an angel he didn't come as a great person he came and he didn't take on muskets and bullets and atomic bombs he clothed himself in humanity like a little baby born in a manger in a manure pile stink rotten flesh human flesh look at the different material of warfare human flesh he chose to do battle with satan he could have done battle as god that's right spoke him right out of existence but he chose to do human battles as a human oh my so he would know what it's like to hold his head with a headache he would know what it's like for his body to swell he would know what it was like for blood to run down and these sores and cankers he would know what it's like to go through all temptations he would know what it was like to face mind battles he would say he destroyed this temple but in three days i would he was satan such great anointing but as a human he would have mind battles just like you adam's race was in bondage without hope without a chance without mercy without anything that could help them the great enemies of the lower regions of the law should shut them up in darkness and there was not a way out there was no one that could help him nothing could be done it looked like a total complete loss but our hero came down from the portals of glory for there was no man on earth that could do the job they were all worldly speaking in the same boat amen they were all born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to the world speaking lies none of us could help each other we stood helpless defeated chaos on every hand we couldn't keep the simplest of laws and ceremonies finding weaknesses we had them it seemed like the whole human race was going to be wasted but he came because he was in the beginning the bible said he was the word and he descended down and the word became flesh and was dwelt among us he was the word and the word became the intercessor and the word became flesh the same flesh that was in the world receivable in glory now the high priest make an intercession he knows what it's like he knows what it's like to go through those battles he knows what it's like to face loneliness he knows what it's like to face fear and anxiety he knows all about it as god he couldn't know that's the material the church got what a weapon he was the word born in a manger he came to use the weapon to conquer the world not army bullets not machine guns not tanks a different manner he came in the form of love he came to conquer he came to put the devil under his feet he came to conquer hatred and if you've got christ in you hatred is conquered he came to conquer bitterness and if you've got christ in you bitterness is conquered come on now he came to conquer unforgiving and if you've got christ in you unforgiveness is conquered come on if you don't if it's still eating at your fl eating at your flesh and tormenting your thoughts and all that it's not conquered therefore you don't have christ you got holes in your boat amen christ come to conquer he come to love those that were unlovable he came with a different sort of weapon he humbled himself made himself lower than the angels we're in the christmas season to suffer death to give us an example and when he was here on earth he walked among men he proved his weapon of warfare could heal the sick he proved it could feed 5 000. he proved he had a power greater than any atomic power he proved that he could amen that he could get water from the not only did he could he get water from a well he made wine out of that water he proved he had power to conquer he proved he had power over the grave when he walked to lazarus grave and lazarus had been stinking for four days and and skin worms were crawling through his body and he said did i not say to you if thou canst believe all things are possible and he said well my brother's dead he said he's not dead he's just sleeping i am the resurrection of the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live hallelujah he only ma he never only made a statement but he also was able to carry out that statement and make it manifest among them why because of the power that was inside of him it was a power of endless life dwelling in him veiled in human flesh a man but inside dwelt none other than the almighty god the great mighty one he could create he could create new things he could speak and it would happen he could curse and it would be so and he humbled himself he stayed low he wanted to give an example he wanted to be the right kind of conqueror come on now he wanted to be there i want to be a cocker we want to be the right kind of conqueror a woman would argue with brother branham as we bring this down he was just a man he said you want to make him deity but he was just a man you try to make him too great he said lady there's no words that could express his greatness and how great he truly was well as john would write and he said if it was if it all was told of all the miracles and things that happened it couldn't hold it the books couldn't hold it well you he was nothing but a man maybe a prophet but a man he was god he said you make him deity was not he wept as he said well that was just the heart of god he was flesh he bore in his body the same desires and things we do but yet to become the perfect sacrifice he had to do that he said he wept he was just a man it was a man when he was weeping but when he stood back and he straightened them shoulders up and he said lazarus come forth that was more than a man because corruption knew its master there was a power of endless life standing there to break the strongholds that was holding lazarus oh hallelujah this is what the holy ghost does for you it comes into your life not for you to live with the devil it comes into your life so you can overcome the devil so you can rise above the devil amen it comes to you to make you greater than the powers that hold you greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world corruption newest maker he said oh you're talking about beating the dish pans and blowing the horn the world ought to be in a jubilee like never has been the screams and shadows of his people because in this memorial day that he conquered the last enemy and set us captives free oh yes he was a man but he proved himself to be god when he stepped on the brow of the boat he was sleeping as a man but on the boat he said peace be still and the winds and the waves obeyed him true he hungered like a man when he came down but when he took those five fish and five biscuits and two fish and fed five thousand he was more than a man hallelujah he proved his last th of his messiahship when he broke the bands of death and he raised from the grave and said i'm alive forevermore there's the comforter the conqueror you're talking about jerking off the aprons and waving it around people say we're crazy because we shout because we run because we scream because we holler they've never felt the victorious vibrations of heaven that the battle is over it's conquered he's already conquered for me it is over and he stands alone this morning as the mighty conqueror he made a highway where there was no highway where satan had blocked it off he talks about the highways the first line of doubt demons of doubt then prejudice and then the next was selfishness the earth covered over with lines of demon power sickness and diseases but he arose into heaven overcoming every one of them and he broke every power the devil holds over man did you hear me church of the living god he broke every power that the devil's ever held over man and in between and between him and and every believer is the blessed old highway of holiness that the righteous can walk and a way of escape has been cut to glory and we're going up that highway and while we're going his people are having a jubilee tens of thousands of them around the world are shouting the victory he says when the first world war is over the message coming down the road what's all the noise about the war is over the war is over what's all the noise about the wars of over he said oh brother i'm here to tell you it's already done the conquering's already done the enemy's already defeated what's all the shouting about my enemies defeated what's all the shouting about my sickness has been taken care of what's all the shouting about my depression has fell off of me what's all the shouting about my god's victorious and he's given the victory to me and he said it takes this blessing old baptism of the holy spirit to guide you up this highway without it you're not walking amen and in this power is the power over every sickness in this power is the power over every stronghold in this power is the power over every over death in this power is the power over every grave and it won't be long those graves are going to come back up again and open up and those dead in christ is going to rise and we're going to go to meet him why are we shouting why do we rejoice why do we weep people say what's the matter of them what's the matter i know it's finished he's already done it he's already paid the price it's all over it's as good as done the glory and the power of god is made known it's a finished work so if it's a finished work why would we let a stronghold hold us what what happened what changed with joshua what changed with the the the hebrew children or the children of israel they crossed that jordan river they begin to look at jericho in a different light once they looked at them as giants and walls too high and impossible situations but god wants to change your view and your thought when you see jericho i see a defeated foe when i see cancer i see a defeated foe when i see spirits that wants to rise up and i see a defeated foe change your look at satan he's defeated his power ends it is the power of endless life that breaks strongholds it's unlimited you know the stronghold you've allowed to rise up in your life it's a defeated thing if you'll recognize it but as long as you look at it as a giant as long as you look at it as an impossible situation as long as you look at it as no way out as long as your thoughts are going down that path it'll hold you but if your thoughts could ever change say this is defeated it's been i broke how many would say god i've been praying for things to change but i want you to change me i need you to change me there's a power to plug the hole in your boat there's a power that's greater than your emotions there's a power they can bring all these things subject and has brought all these things subject the holy ghost lord you see the hands that were lifted all over this building too many times lord we we look for that magical moment and it does happen where circumstance changes you you change things but many times you want to change us and our perspective and

recognize lord the spirits that try to hold us as defeated spirits help us to recognize the sickness tries to come as a defeated sickness granted father oh jesus let the presence of god just fall upon
