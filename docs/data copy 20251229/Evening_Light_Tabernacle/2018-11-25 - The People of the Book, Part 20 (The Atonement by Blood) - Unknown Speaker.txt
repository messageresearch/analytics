Thanksgiving a man god bless each one of you brother Branham would say in the message who is Jesus someone shared this with me today said you see when you go to prayin for somebody something goes to taking place there's where we fail friends not prayin prayer is the key note asking you shall receive you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not ask abundance that your joy may be full asking believe that you receive what you've asked for then hold on to it don't leave it if it's a promise in the Bible and it's been revealed to you that God's gonna give it to you hold to it amen there it is pray for it and hold on today Jesus taught that we should pray and not to faint Amen not give up in other words so let's go to prayer this morning and let's just ask him to grace our service with his presence now speak to us through the word if you got a need in your life maybe something you've been praying about why don't you just hold on to that right now for that need for that person for that situation dear Jesus we bow our heads before your throne of grace it is there that we find help in our time of need we thank you that your healer delivers Savior satisfier needs supplier we thank you that you're the lifter of our head when our head is down so low that you lift it up Oh God and cause us to look up for our Redemption draweth nigh the promise of our deliverance draws near Lord we thank you for your promises to us there yes and man Lord we thank you that you do answer prayer and that you supply ever need according your riches and glory and we're just asking today that you would just minister the hearts of your children you know their needs that they would have in their lives and the situations that the eats are dealing with the burdens that each one are bearing Lord of whom we pray O God today that you would just lift the heavy load as we cast our cares on you for you care for us Lord we pray that you would bless now the word as it goes forth and just anointed to our heart Lord just speak to each one I ask Lord in a real and living way and father Lord knowing that when we minister we want a minister of life and health to your people Lord we we don't want a minister something that we'd be hurtful or harmful Lord or something that would be wrong as Lord we hear of so many times a spirits dropping in saying things that shouldn't be said even from the pulpit Lord may it not be so so sanctify our lips today and hide us behind the cross that we would say nothing except something that would be pleasing to you and that would build up and identify your body and strengthen your church the Bride of Christ I ask it in Jesus name you see those that are not with us today Lord you know that where they are and father many of them traveling no doubt maybe coming home from Thanksgiving holiday with their loved ones or wherever they are some are here from out of town and we pray traveling mercies for them as they would go back to their homes may Lord they be able to go back to their homes with their spirits lifted lorda and rejoicing in you because you're a Living God healer delivers said silence portion everything we needed more in Jesus name bless the word as we read it today bless our brother Craig Lord is out ministering and use him for your glory in a marvelous way I pray in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you man good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen and aren't you glad to be a believer amen brother L is so good to see you and your family today and amen we're so happy to have you in service with us and praying the Lord's blessings richest blessings upon you hey man and upon you and you and you and you and well just a bonus all amen isn't God good did you enjoy Thanksgiving this week I think about brother Branham sayin a lot of Thanksgiving you know there and then he a ministers along that line of being thankful he said like the Pilgrim Fathers came to a new land and they were thankful that God had given them that new land and the freedom of it and he said even so we have returned back to this new land amen of the Holy Ghost and and we are joined the benefits of it I'm glad to be beneficiaries of his covenant today and trusting the Lord will just speak to you in a mighty way will you turn with me to Leviticus chapter 17 we're going to read from the eleventh verse I'm sure brother Timothy mentioned communion foot washing next Sunday the first of December and so there'll be two services then and of course you know we have a fellowship dinner together to enjoy and and to be a part of it so you know just look forward to that command and communion with the Lord and ma'am fellowship fellowship with Jesus Oh what joy divine amen so good to have each one of you here see brother McNulty back there and God bless you amen years ago spent sometime with his grandparents going back and forth to church together and they hosted me in their homes and and I I don't know if I'm old or you're old but we're something's happening amen but it's good to have you today God bless you take our greetings and love back to your Church in the family um Leviticus 17 and verse 11 for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the Soul and then the Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 22 let's take us on a New Testament reading here Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 22 and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission and that remission of course is forgiveness or pardon or of sins letting them go as if they had never been committed remission of the penalty Amen so without the shedding of blood there is no pardon our forgiveness of sin then back to the Old Testament again to the book of Exodus chapter 12 and we will see them leaving the land of Egypt this is verse 21 where that the instructions are given to leave the land of Egypt and go to the promised land and of course this is very applicable to us today as we are also a people leaving the world Egypt and in the world here and and now going in a rapture in a promised land and of Exodus chapter 12 verse 21 then Moses called for the elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take your lamb according your families and kill the power / and you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and strike the lentil and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until morning for the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians and when he see if the blood upon the lentils and on the two side posts the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you what wonderful words of life this morning Amen god bless you can be seated we're going to be turning for another reading over into revelation 5 and we'll read from there in the thirteenth verse but as you do I want to just make some comments as we are going to be speaking today on the atonement by blood now we have we have returned back to this land and this is what we've been preaching on is the people of the book have returned back to the land of the book and in order to come back to this land it was to bring us back to the original atonement now those are brother branham's words original atonement not a new atonement but the original atonement not a Rekluse affiant of Christ nor is it another blood or another way of approach but it is by the original atonement and so now so we're going to speak this morning on the atonement by blood now the opening of the seals is what we're going to be reading about where the lamb takes the book and I have some things to say about that because in this lamb is where the book of title to the land and to every promise of God is being handed to to the people of God and if you'll notice when in our reading that Christ does this as a man it is a man taking the book is there any man that is worthy so the call came for a worthy man we were singing that song just a moment ago I thought was very appropriate to some of the things that I'm going to speak about this morning worthy is the Lamb that and that has paid the price of redemption now the opening of the seals does not end the atonement work of Christ in fact the taking of the book and the opening of its seals are done by the atoning work of the Lamb so to Tom means to make restitution and so it's actually the lamb atoning that is making restitution taking the book of title that Adam lost and bringing it back into the hands of a man again and by Christ taking it as a man notice he had it as God's not to gods not to Lords he had it as God but he became a man to take it as a man for man and in taking it farm and he done it for all mankind so we can say once again that a man is for in possession of the title of every promise of God of the earth and of man and everything that is inclusive there now so a man is in possession of it now that man is Christ Jesus now of course he doesn't do it for himself he had it as God amen but he did it too and in order to take it for man he became a man in order to redeem it far man to give it back - man this is where that through his atoning work that you actually see in Revelation 10 the book that that John was not worthy to look upon neither to to take on rté much less to look upon he is told to take it and eat it after the atoning work of the lamb or the man Christ Jesus has been done so after Christ took it now then he made us worthy so that we too could be a participant in the inheritance now so again to Tom means to make restitution and that's what the lamb is doing making provisions that the book could be open and then given back to man again now the opening of the book was made possible by the atoning work of the lamb the advancing of the lamb to take the book was not Christ leaving the throne but rather advancing to the throne or else how or else how could he take the book see he had to take the book from the ones sitting on the throne he takes it from God and brings it back to man again this is a whole symbology that is being shown in the book of Revelation so the intercessor by taking the book is not cease in his work of intercessory but rather completing his work for the Gentile bride because the work of redemption continues on and we're going to find out here in a bit how long this work of contention continues because he will continue his work of redemption then as the gospel goes from the Gentiles to the Jews so he's still doing a work of redemption even after the Gentiles have been secured away and raptured and taken taken into glory then he is still doing his redeeming work would you just to see he is still Redeemer taking the book loose and it seals does not cause him to relinquish his atoning work neither does it caused him to relinquish his priesthood because he continues to be the high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmity and continues to be the intercessor between God and man now redemption may be coming to a close or maybe may be coming close to being finished for the Gentiles but redemption is far from over redemption is an ongoing work that continues until the earth itself is redeemed and restored back to his eatin condition again as long as the work the earth is not in its Eden condition now yeah man you may be in your soul but your body's still far from it you're not back in the Eden condition yet the earth itself is not back in the Eden condition and as long as the earth is not in Eden condition he is still Redeemer he is still Savior he is still restore he is still the priest now as we as we look at this when that when the scene of revelation 5 is finished and here we're looking at it right now when the scene of Revelation 5 is finished all creation is worshipping God now that's not to continue the condition that we're in right now creation is groaning travailing and pain your bodies are groaning travailing and pain your sickness sorrow pain death all kinds of things that are happening right now because all creation is struggling and is groaning but there's gonna come a time when all creation will worship God hey ma'am now this this of course is is a time that still lays out in the future now the reason I'm pointing this out is because many people take revelation 5 the breach as being a moment in a twinkling and event something that occurred or maybe um in 1963 perhaps he'll want to put a date to it there when the when the seals was open but that is not true because this is a process of redemption it is not a moment twinkling our event event it begins with one sitting on the throne with the book in its hand it shows the scene of redemption of a slain lamb taking the book and it finishes here wherever all creation worships God so you see revelation 5 is not a moment twinkling of an eye event it is a process which has many different steps in its parts of redemption in fact a revelation 5 begins with what begins over in revelation 4 where one is sitting on the throne that's God and then he has a book in his hand he got it back from Adam when Adam fell it had to go back in the hands of Almighty God so you see it's beginning is long before Calvary and it's ending is is even after all the ages is over so if you see every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I say in blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever and the four beasts said amen and ah and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth for ever and ever so you can see it begins with a question book and then it also goes right into the Redeemer and his work and it it goes right on until all creation is worshiping God now so now I'm here is a scene of the Redeemer at work let's go to revelation 5 now in verse 1 revelation 5 in verse 1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book to loose the seals are of and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me we've not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof now notice he he is the Lion of the tribe of Judah hey man he is the line he is the king the king prevailed and the way he prevailed was becoming a lamb they're not two gods here and man this is why it shows in the symbology a lamb and he's got seven hundred seven eyes and I was before him behind and so on like that he he's a very odd looking that Jesus is not a willy lamb he's not a funny-looking creature he's a man but this is symbology or symbolic of his Redemption work where the king becomes the lamb where the lion becomes the lamb let's look at this real close so and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals are of four that was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood notice now redemption is my blood and how does he redeem how does he pay this price is by his own blood a man out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation for that gives us all a chance this is not history Jews and Gentiles this is not for colors and nationalities and men this is for God's people of ever race kindred tongue people aren't you glad to serve a god like that a man notice and he has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and I held I beheld and I've heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and then all of creation breaks out into praise amen because once that redemption has been finalized and the king of the earth that fell is restored back to his physician then the earth gets restored in fact that's what we are seeing in the Millennium is the king and the Queen ruling together payment for that thousand years created and Eden upon the earth it'll be a time of the Feast of of Tabernacles amen where we were where we will remember our journey ins here upon the earth notice what he said redeemed by that blood notice he is lying Abdo de and that is symbolic of his kingship but did you notice he did not take the book as a king as a king he sitting on the throne but he takes it as a RAM because that is symbolic of his Redemption work a man so he does it not as a king but as a lamb which is a priest so this is his priesthood work and then this is his this is his work of redemption that take in the book is showing his final work of intercession and his final work of intercession with the Gentiles is taking his bride into a rapture and Matt now as long as there's one soul that hasn't been redeemed and their name dipped in mud are you with me now he is still the priest still david assessor still the redeemer a man and he does it by his blood notice that he does not do it any other way is not a redemption by faith is not an atonement of faith faith cannot make an atonement for you only the blood can make an atonement we can apply it by faith but it first must be the blood applied by faith now but he does not take the book as a king but he doesn't as the priest are the lamb now the tangent of the book is showing his final work of redemption and then intercession by rapture in his church it is all a part of his claiming work it's the Lambs work he first prentices us a man that's his purchase and work which he done at Calvary then he continues right honor and and here he has been interceding for us through throughout all of these years and he's still interceding how in the world do you think prayers can be can be received you see he doesn't stop interceding because he starts claiming hey man but no you know his purchase and made a way for him for his intercession work and his intersessional work makes away for his claiming work the claim of work means to rapture up ride out of here now so though the lamb is symbolic and it represents his work as kinsman redeemer were the king the lion became our sacrifice and it is his work of kinsmen worrying he takes the book and opens it notice he does it as a man is there man worthy the book represents the redeem now you know we get a lot of different pictures of this because we fail some time to realize that the book of Revelation is a symbolic book it's rich in symbols and so it's showing a drama or a scene and so you know there there's really there's really not two God's up there one on the throne and one over here is a land now that's that's the wrong conclusion that's just showing what he did the king became the lamb amen but he doesn't do it as a woolly lamb is not a is not a lamb going up with hooves and reaching up and with his biet with his hooves there and taking this and he's a woolly lamb with seven horns and seven eyes no that's only symbolic of his priesthood and his Redemption work now so again the book itself we we picture maybe it's a big leather-bound book you know it does it have a goat skin on the outsider does it have you know is that a cow's skin is it tan leather or what is this book of course you know we think of it as a book and it's really a scroll a man and it's sealed with seven seals but it's nothing it's not a book per se it that is symbolic of the people that he is redeeming and meant soil reality and take in the book he has taken a people to himself because the believers are the names in the book and the book is only symbolizing them in this scene as who God is redeeming aren't you glad your name is in the book hey ma'am because that's the book the believer now so the book represents redeemed and when he literally takes that book he that is the physical translation of the bride Amen now let's just let's just look back for a moment in history you know when John turned to see a lion he didn't see one what did he see he saw a lamb now really what we are seeing here is Melchizedek priest and King because the priest is also King the king is also priest and the same God that created the heavens and the earth is the same God to step down into human flesh and became the son or the offspring of his creation and God comes and well in his the body that he makes not two gods in all not to lords one Lord one faith one baptism one God one father one creator not many not two not three one here o Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord but he puts it here as a symbol because it's symbolizing his work as a man now as John looks to and he C turns to see a lion as I said he doesn't see a lion he sees a lambeth it reminds me of Esther you know Esther was afraid to go in to see the king she had heard all the stories of if he's not pleased with you while you dive you interrupt his business he can judge you and send you to death you know I it was very very fearsome to her fearful to her for her to go in to see the king but you know she heard all her all her life about this king and how how angry he could be at being been disrupted in his business and how anybody who come in without without permission and interrupted his court would be sent to death and she worried and worried and worried and was reluctant to go before the king but when she went before the king she didn't see a king she didn't see this lion she saw a lamb and the lamb said answer here's my Ceptor and you're welcome in my presence I'm here here it is come on in what do you want even half the kingdom a man in other words you're Aaron join there with me so when she approached the throne she never saw a lion she saw a lamb Oh God isn't that wonderful for you today to know is that the Bride of Christ you do never see the judgment side of God you never see his anger you never see us wrath you've never seen his judgments but when you come into his presence you see a lamb hallelujah lamb that says welcome come on in I'll give you half the kingdom I share with you all that I got all that I have is yours what a wonderful thing to know that we can approach him as a lamb a man now I'm gonna read a quotation that that causes sometimes a lot of a lot of people to get confused because again they want to make all of this a moment twinkling of our event and as I've showed you in the scripture in Revelation 5 is not a moment twinkling eye event it is a process of redemption and so brother branham would tell us in the breach he said he leaves the throne of intercessor as a slain lamb to be a lion king to bring the world to judgment who has rejected his message he's not a mediator remember the Old Testament teaching now as we hurry when the blood went off the mercy seat what was it judgment seat and when the lamb slain walk forward from eternity out of the Father's throne and took his rights it was a judgment seat then he become not a lamb but a lion king and he calls for his Queen to come stand by his side know ye not the Saints shall judge the earth now I wanted to say to you we are in the process of fulfillment as he says he leads the throne of to be an innocence Lane lamb to be a lion king to the bring the world to judgment who has rejected his message he is not a mediator now let me just say it I'm flat that hadn't happened yet amen although we're in the process of its fulfillment it hadn't happened yet but the world will be judged and plagued and Satan will be bound a thousand years it will happen he is coming King he's not King yet ix king of saints but he's not king of this world Jesus even would have to give place and Satan turns as say of Satan he's the prince of this world you will see in the tribulation he will reign for a short time during the tribulation be flow as brother Branham calls him full king of the earth right now Jesus is not the king of the earth that's why you know we cannot blame Jesus for all the crippled children the blind eyes the old people that are dying and sickness and disease and war and strife because Jesus is not the king a man if he were king then he would be responsible for what's going on in his kingdom when Jesus comes King there'll be no more sorrow no more pain no more death no more crippled children no more evil no more sin somebody help me preach when he is King he'll take control over the earth when it becomes King on your heart he there's no more sin there's little more wickedness there's no more evil in your life come on somebody because he became the king in your life when he becomes king of the earth and man Satan's reign will be over because he'll be found a thousand years he'll take him around and grab him by the neck and sew him into a pit and chain him with circumstances and there there will be a time of a freedom of millennial peace of all the earth but right now peace is gone from the earth why because Satan is the Prince of the power of this atmosphere amen but the world will be judged and plagued and Satan will be bound a thousand years the horror the false church will be judged and burnt but before she is a people is called out let's let's look over here revelation 18 and verse 1 and after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that receive not of her plagues so look before she's pled got those of people out hey man now listen Church he has called the people out but he's calling the people out he is still presently today calling a people out he is presently today calling for a queen to come stand by his side hey man hey man it's all in the process don't put a period to it I'm not because I'll tell you many of you if a period was put where they wanted to put it many years ago anybody born after a certain year couldn't make it in because men have tried to be to play God and will it bring an end to Redemption and close the door on all the others and laugh and make fun you know those that are on the outside let me tell you friends that ain't Christ a man that ain't the sphere of Christ that is not the bride the spirit and the bride say come and whoever's thirsty come and drink of the water of life freely hey man but I heard another voice and verse five said her sins like Sodom have reached to heaven and God has remembered her iniquity now listen brother branham explains us this angel is the last messenger before the coming of Christ in Revelation 19 chapter of Revelation the messengers voice if we notice when he gave his voice on earth there was a voice echoed again in heaven fourth verse if you wanna read it alright fourth verse the 19th chapter this messenger on the earth was so inclined with God when he spoke it on the earth God echoed it from heaven and he said what is the fourth tense translation Bert's translation what does it mean God's voice speaking to his predestinated people saying come out of her just exactly what the voice was he got it people all out there out through Babel and come out of her that you be not partakers of her sins yes sir out of that dogma and creeds to the Word made spirited life a man notice the 19 top chapters the next after these things did you notice here the 19 chapter after these things what what after what after the message of come out of her after these things is the shout of the bride Saints with the bridegroom going to the marriage of the Lamb how close are we then brothers hey man how close are we then we've heard the call this has come out of her that's why you're here this Lord you heard that call come out of Babylon come out of the confusion come out of Nimrods towers and man come out of the crease of man come back to the word get back to the homeland what was that a of Schauder a trumpet sound and then a voice ringing now calling his elect back to the homeland again now that is still going out today as we prophesy again it still rings out it's still going out it's going out from this church it's going to out from every believer across the world come out of her my people it's streaming out to your heart today come out of the lukewarmness come out of sin and unbelief come on into Christ get in there the plagues are coming don't be in just a little cold church member you know just don't just be content to sit on even a message to you get into Christ get it without your heart put everything you got into it this call is still going out but he let me say it again he has not yet become king of the earth he will do this in the millennial reign now let me just read it again when the blood went off the mercy seat what was it remember this whole thing a revelation vibe is a process not a moment in a twinkling of Iban it's showing the scene of redemption now when the lamb slain walked forth forward from eternity out of the Father's throne and took his rights it was a judgment seat then he he become not a lamb but a lion king and he calls for his Queen to come stand by side know ye not to say to judge the earth now first of all let's look at this the throne is not yet a judgement seat it is still a seat of mercy and it will be until every name that is on the book has been clams by blood hey Mack now in trying to do God a service with that it be as this wheel this is a Jeff sermon in in 65 when the brother branham's last sermons when then in them days they only had one meeting place that could meet God and that was at the ark under the blood and that's the only meeting place yet see it's unchanged remember it's not making a new atonement man and a new atonement won't be made for Israel either it's gonna get them to recognize the atonement and again this is not a new atonement that God brings us to but it is us recognizing what was in the atonement hey man if you could recognize it this morning there wouldn't be a sick person left a man we would all be healed and delivered and saved and a man if we could just recognize what's in the atonement it's paid for you don't have to work for it you don't have to labor again and man it's all paid for it's in the atonement the price has been paid you ought to look at your adversary the devil is shake your finger in his face and say the price for my healing the price my family the price has all been paid it's been paid with blood a man with the blood of God Himself seen it now take your hands off of what belongs to me amen that's the only meeting place yet under the blood mercy seat was sprinkled to give mercy to the worshiper or they asked her when he came to ask the petition of God and God had a special routine the way you had to go about it he wouldn't accept anything else he wouldn't accept any other provision just the way he fixed and then he continues to go on to explain as brother Branham would call even in another sermon that Jesus is God's mercy seat and how that Jesus is God's chosen place of worship and under his shed blood is the only place that we can worship now God made sure that we would understand the provisions from her mercy from the mercy seat his endtime messenger to us would preach to us and said a God who is rich in mercy I want to submit to you the opening of the seals did not take away mercy it gave a grain of mercy and man they revealed a God rich in mercy he would preach a sermon called pardon oh man well if there's no one on the mercy seat you can't get pardoned but if you got a merciful God who is still in the saving business man come on then you can be pardoned but you gotta believe that he is not that he was because if you believe he was an audience today then you can never get a pardon now brother Branham would tell us he said but you see in this book what was redeemed it was a book of and everything that he had redeemed was written in that book all he died for was written in the book and he could not believe his minute oriole seat until he had surly redeemed and he couldn't redeem it at the cross because they were predestinated here on the Lamb's Book of Life and he had to stay on there to make intercession until that last person was finished glory amen Oh aren't you glad aren't you glad friends it reached down to you amen brother Jared just a few weeks ago months ago now what happened mercy came rewrote your life and then he could not come until you came in and then now we're still looking for the next one whose name is in the book of life and then the bride is saying whosoever will her man and you might have been a believer of sorts and the sympathizer with the message for years and years and you've language out there in the world and over all for years and years and years but I'll tell you God is not just a God of one chance he's a God of second chances and third chances for taxes he's a God who is Richard Matt Sitton we will not give up he'll stay there no matter how many preachers have put him off he'll stay there until that last one amen amen I don't know when it's gonna happen then it turns to a judgement seat but it happened yet because I still see mercy I still see the high priests at work man I still see them heal I still see him deliver I still seemed set free come oh I still seem liberate souls so I know he's still the high priest now brother branham would preach sermons like the unveiling of God and the mighty God and veiled Ana and he would tell us that the unveiling of God would reveal the true mercy seat now what it did like in the days of Israel if it rid the veil of traditions and so there was no God there in in Pharisee ISM and Judaism that there was not nothing there it was just empty are you with me and when God does the same thing in this end time here in surveillant radition and shows that there's no God there that there's nothing that will rapture a church in denominational traditions a man but but it doesn't say it doesn't remove the mercies of God in fact it shows a greater mercy scene and we have a greater mercy seat like insel did greater than the woolly lamb and we have a greater mercy seat than even the justification or segregation or gifts of the Spirit and seats of mercy that was in denominations we've got a greater mercy see with not less mercy but my mercy in fact the opening of the seals did it give us more mercy or less well look at it it showed there's a bride in the rapture but that's not all a multitude without number saved in the tribulation that's a god rich in mercy 144,000 Jews and man even souls under the altar they didn't even have the testimony of Jesus and are given white robes merci merci and we found that there was a God with more mercy than what we ever imagined when we thought it was all about house and it was all about him and his redeeming plan that he had a bride and then he had a church and then he had a foolish virgin are you with me and then yeah they got on in 44,000 and he had he had their souls on the yellow we had a ball and they were all their names were in his book and when he opens it he shows there's mercy for all and the unveiling of God showed us a mercy seat not what's in denomination but the original mercy seat the original atonement now yes they had parts and those parts get them into the tribulation some of them go into life but friends with the full mercy seat come in view you get a rapture that's a god rich in mercy are you with me now now so you see when the veil of traditions are taken away then the mercy seat comes into plain view yes it shows the impetus of forms and dogmas and man's religions but at the same time it would show beyond the veil of traditions of Judaism was the lamb slain and the same thing happens for us in our day when the when the when God wasn't veiled before us when the mighty God unveiled himself to this generation he showed the emptiness they met the emptiness of all the forms of religion but he showed Arup own for the bride there he his mercy seat a man in fact of the matter the the mercy-seat is advancing to take the book of redemption and to finish what was started at Calvary this is awesome Church and man now so he says so again he said now the veil was written at Calvary the mercy seat came in the plain view but what happened it was hanging on Calvary dripping in blood in the unveiling of God he said God wanted to show them the mercy seat God want to show them who he was so the veil in the temple from the hand of God above was rent from top to bottom and should God in plain view it was Jesus Christ hanging on the cross the mercy seat the man you said where there's no more mercy seat then there's no more Jesus because he is the mercy seat the mercy seat ain't a piece of furniture the mercy seat is a person somebody help me breathe and that person is Jesus Christ He is God see the mercy and then the book is not a leather-bound book the book is of people the lamb is a person the mercy seat is Jesus and if you ever get a view of Jesus or my man if you ever get him come and plain view and men right now on this side of eternity you're gonna see a lamb a man who says coming to me all ye that are heavy laden I'll give you rest take your yoke upon me it's easy and my burdens are light what a mighty God were servant what a God rich in mercy now he said it was Jesus hanging on the cross the mercy seat what was it the people were too blind to see it and it's repeated again their traditions how then the day of Pentecost the word came and was in the form of son of God they began to organize it at Nicaea Roman first day they went to Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals so forth and it organized tradition till a man don't know where he stands but Gorda God he promised in the last days what he would do he would show his word in plain view what word the word of his mercy let me ask you what in word you think the rapture is it's the word of his mercy it's the word of great grace it's a cat's tongue come and crime grace grace to finish everything off a god rich in mercy this is what brother Branham was asked the question his mercy over he said hope mercy goodness don't you ever think that you'll have to go against the words of the prophet of God himself to think mercy is over our mercy is only in your corner mercy is not in your corner mercies in Christ and me and you may think you got all of Jesus but it's more important that he's got all of you hey man now notice he would show his word in plain view open before us again open it up then and only then he calls for his Queen to come stand by his side now let me just read that in context again and one the lamb slain walk forward from eternity out of the Father's throne and took his rights it was a judgment seat then he becomes not a lamb but a lion king and he calls for his Queen to come by his sides come stand by his side know ye not this Saints shall judge the earth now has this happened has he called his Queen to come stand by side now it's in the works it's in the plan but I agree with what you were saying it hadn't happened hey man nah notice he will not become King until he rains his son of David are you with me now this is he where he comes in his three sons name he comes as a prophet priest and King son of man son of God son of David and now he won't become King until the millennial reign and he has not come he has not come as revelation 19 so while the word has come and that's him on the white horse brother branham never applied that there he always applied that in the future so stay with what the prophet said a man he will come to reign as king of kings and Lord of lords and when he does will be the Battle of Armageddon and then the destruction of the enemy and Satan will be bound and then he will reign with his bride any man but he create on that what's the term he calls for his Queen to come stand by his side now it can't happen now listen his queen who is his queen first let's define who is his queen is this Queen only the living bride what about those who just went on before us are they not his queen somebody help me preach now I'm making a point a man think about it now what about some of those what about brother Jerry shawl that we just laid as a seed in a garden was he not his queen well what about brother Branham was he not a part of the bride let's go back what about Daddy Bosworth Smith Wigglesworth John G Lake John Wesley Martin Luther what about Paul now when all of that his queen so for him to call for his queen to come stand by his side means for there to be a resurrection of the dead and a rapture of the church that substan by his side so what well spiritually okay but spiritually jeri-show did spiritually William Branham dead spiritually John G Lake did Spira spiritually John Wesley did everyone took his side stood by his side so he has not called for his queen yet spiritually brother Taylor okay but friends let's realize this how far in the world are you gonna go with all this spiritual stuff when we spiritualize it and we do away with actually what the prophets talking about he is not talking about a spiritual application he said the Queen and the Queen is of seven ages and when that queen is called to stand by side there's a resurrection and when the resurrection takes place in a rapture takes place then he begins and turns from from the from priests to judge and never another Gentile will be saved but then he'll continue his priesthood with the Jews so now his queen is a seven ages both the living and the dead in Christ this is a resurrection in the rapture it is the trumpet call which in watch those words the trumpet call saying come up hither in the meantime in the meantime in other words before the rapture takes place in his promised resurrection he is still the land and as well he has filled the high priests that is his work of lamb now again when we talk about symbology in the Bible you have the Eagle is symbolic of his prophetic office the lion is symbolic of his kingship and the lamb is symbolic of his priesthood so it's prophet priest and King now looking at this brother branham would tell us in god's chosen place of worship about you know he decided how he would save man now remember we're coming back to the original atonement the two prophets of revelation 11 do not introduce them a new atonement the inner knee they introduce to them to the original attune Jesus death at Calvary we'll read about it if I have time but now the same thing happens with the prophet of Malachi 4 under the seventh seal message if it does not introduce us to a new atonement but back to the original atonement and the original Tolman was black not my blood not your blood that wouldn't work amen but God's own blood now of course he would use blood until the man could come the blood of animals an innocent animal until the man could come but once a man came no blood of any animal will will work as a sacrifice it will not atone and it would only atone in part because those who would die under that blood of animals would go to place called Paradise which Jesus would pay the price of redemption and empty a man because it would take the blood of Christ to bring forth full Redemption now in God's chosen place of worship brother Branham said he decided how he would save man we've tried to day to educate man into it we tried to school them we try to educate them tried to denominator add to do these other kind of bring them in shake them in baptize them in and ever other way there is bring them in by letters but still remains the same God meets man under the shed blood of the Lamb blood was God's Way in the beginning and bloody is God's Way tonight it is good to dependents and all these things but salvation only comes through bad blood is the only way God chose to save man and he cannot change it Jobe had the same thing he knew that he was righteous because he had offered the sacrifice God required of him so now God's chosen place of worship as we know is not in a church it's not even in a movement it's not even in a certain doctor God's chosen place of worship is in Christ now again it's the place where the body is now as brother Branham would say now look at another type we're along here the type of the Passover for foreshadow Jesus we notice here the sacrifice of blood by death the sacrifice of blood was a place that foreshadowed Christ can a denomination bleed can you think of a church bleeding a denominational beat bleeding certainly not had taken the blood to bleed from a life and the life here Jesus comes in view by the lamb the lamb was a type of Christ for shattered Christ because he was the Lamb of God that John introduced that takes away the sin of the world and we find Jesus come into view here in accidents as well chapter notice it was the only place death could not strike get this and get this because it's important there is a place of mercy but there's also a place of judgment outside of that mercy is judgment now when death was about to strike the land there had to be a certain place Oh from under this died only one place now I didn't mean it was one house but it was one place and that's where the lamb was killed where the Lambs blood was the death angel could not strike because it was the place God put his name and that lament was named back there in the beginning the lamb and notice it's in the one place he could not strike and now that's the same it is today notice if he brings us right over to today what is required today there's only one place that spiritual death cannot strike that's the word death cannot strike the word because it's the Living Word of God but you and you put Creed's with it the word moves out to itself it'll separate like water from oil you cannot mix it together therefore you see when the Creed's come down and comes into the denomination they all go into after the Creed and the word dies out and goes on with somebody else and increases it more picks up the momentum and as it goes from justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and on out into the grains you see the path God has trod bring in his name all the time write down the same because he is the word notice it cannot die the word of life cannot die notice how perfect the death angel was not forbidden to strike egypt's great intellectual people it wasn't forbidden to strike its sacred lines or its great buildings or its pharaohs or its priests of the land the angel was not forbidden to striking to strike any building any place anybody but it could not strike where the lamb was death cannot strike where this provided place of God is and that's in the lamb notice now if he's no longer lamb you have no place of grace you have no place of safety because only where the lamb be zoella brother Tim he's not lamb anymore he's just only lion well then there's no more grace you have no place of mercy and you miss the rapture sorry because there's no mercy the mercy that the rapture itself has a judgment of sorts he takes one and leaves one church wherever you are what you belong to makes me delivered but there's one thing you must know you've got to be in Christ or you're dead and you remember what he said it's the lamb you've got to be under the lamb and the Lambs blood or you're dead you can't live outside of him your church might be alright as a building your fellowship might be alright as a man but when you did not what's now this is very crucial when you denied the body the blood the word of Jesus Christ you're dead the minute you do it it is God's chosen place of worship I mean there's where you put his name there's where his name is exactly there's where he chose it but his name not in the church but in the son Jesus Christ notice safety laid lied only in the place of his choosing in his lamb and in the name of his the lamb notice it was a male lamb machine not a her not a church she but his name now you know we got people today what a hood but mercy in in the bride that she sees the seed of mercy his name is not in see it's in him Amen listen you cannot come under the spirit of this age and take the job of the man and put it on the Wellman amend them the woman though are you with me now the bride take the lamps face we will never you can never hand intercessory tomorrow man intercessor between God and man is the man Christ Jesus and so you get to you try to get the bride doing the husband's work not sure she is his body up on the earth and when she prays God intercedes Christ intercedes a man were his body I just struck me you know as I read this quote today about how important prayer yes you know sometimes we don't see the importance of it there's thousands and millions of needs and God opened your eyes to needs upon the earth as a part of his body amen you see the needs of your brother your sister you take him before God and you pray and then what are you doing you're you're bringing them to the attention of the Lord amen you're interceding on their behalf but that does not that does not negate or take away from his intercession now because over and again after the seals will open brother brems let's see how sure is he still the high priest and he can still be touched he would preach a sermon who is this Melchizedek and a free would get through printer who is that smell cousin my cousin dick is among us he said okay then you can touch him nobody touching me notice notice not by touching me I'm not the intercessor but by touching him ain't it wonderful this morning you don't have to come through a preacher to touch him you don't have to come to a pope or a bishop to touch him I bet you can touch the high priests Oh ma'am all you gotta do is press through the crowd get down humble that's the hem of His garment strip lay down hot yourself down and touch the hem of His garment and you told him tell you to permit you to be released back to your knee no Pope no bishop no in between no preacher Amen it's you in Jesus but men want to have power today in their hands to forgive sins and hold back sins and whatever else we got to power yeah we do the church whatever we bind on earth is bound in heaven but how do we release sins by getting them to do exactly what they did in acts 2:38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ we have the power to remit sin by what bringing people to repentance and baptism in his name filled with the Holy Ghost amen but don't turn this back into Catholicism notice he was a male am i he not her not a church she but his name not her name where he was going to meet the people was not in her name but in his name him the Lamb a man now we say the church the great mighty church she did this she did that she weighed the storms we picked up in population we're great numbers were mighty church he did great thing God never said anything about her she he said him him is the meeting place the lamb not to church not her but his name he didn't put her name anywhere he put his name and him that's why all we do on word or deed we must do all in the name of Jesus Christ if we pray we got pray in the name of Jesus if we walk we walk in Jesus name if we talk we talk in Jesus name if we baptized we got a baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for all we do in word or deed do it in the name of Jesus Christ hey man so improving his word proven his word he sus Jude believe it if so reached out my faith and touch His garment because he's passing this way oh ma I believe you pass right by this way in this service this morning I believe he's here to heal ever sick to save ever lost a man turns he show his work of redemption that he still heals we've seen him do it hey man we've seen him do extraordinary things we've seen the cancer field and man we've seen the brain bleed field we're seeing the cripples walk we've seen the kidneys restored come on we've seen the eyes that have been healed over and over and over we've seen him as the high priests I many time others have we touched him you can touch him this morning though I'm with you always to the end of the world he's the same yesterday today and forever he's passing this way he's a high priest according to Hebrews the book of Hebrews four chapters and 15 verse he is the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities do you believe that I'm asking you this money do you believe that man then then he reached out and touch the Lord he he is ever-present although I with you always look down to the ages prove all things hold fast to that which is good now if you belong to a church that don't believe he's the same yesterday today and forever the same in every way get away from it that's your prophets instruction I think it's pretty good advice I have to say Amen to it remember cuz we ought to believe he's the same in every detail except for his corporal body a man the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a high priest sitting there making intercession upon our confessions he we have to confess it first before he can be a high priest because he only intercedes to our confession is that right minister brethren the minister say man and he only intercedes upon our confession what we confess that he is and what he has done for us not he will do he's already done it we have to confess that he's done it he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed what are we a confession it's painful it belongs to me then healing his mind he paid for it victory is mine he paid for it oh my god victory over this depression I can rise up above this hurt I can rise up above the confusion of the age because I have a high priest that I can touch who release his virtuous strength to me in the oddball sermon in jeffersonville in 64 you know God made this promise in the last day he made a promise and I can't make it happen I cannot do that he has to do that he's the one who doesn't not me but believe in him or I wouldn't be standing here telling you something I didn't believe in my brother brother makes a statement I wouldn't be standing here telling you something that I didn't believe in now you pray and you say Lord Jesus I'm taught in the Bible wonder who taught that wonder who's teaching this is brother Brennan said I wouldn't say it unless I believed it and then he said you pray Lord in the Bible I wonder who was teaching this was that a message in this day hey man now you praise say Lord Jesus I'm talking to Bible you're a high priest right now that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities I don't care where you're just you just say I believe you and by faith I believe what that man said today that's what the angel told me get the people to believe you and if I tell them Word of God and they believe me it's believed the words apparently Hebrews 4 is still in effect that he's still the high priest that can be touched he's still the one that we go to the intercessor between God and man now and that means you'll say if it ain't it with the word I'm quoting now then don't believe it but you believe it's the word and then whatever it is you pray and believe and see if he will reveal what's in your heart now let me just tell you say there is no such a thing as an atonement of faith there is only an atonement of blood that blood is applied by faith like the blood was applied by hyssop but hyssop alone would not make the intercession and faith alone will not make an interception there has to be blood applied by faith not faith alone now so you see that blood is applied by faith but it's faith in the shed blood now there's never been I just wanted to say there's never been a time in human history where sins could be remitted without the shedding of blood now one example in the scripture all the way from Adam until now it's based upon the blood was shed so why not wait a minute brother Tim Jesus how did Jesus forgive sin before his blood was shed well how did he forgive sin all through the Old Testament through the blood of a sacrifice a man he will often say the people your sins are forgiven listen Jesus before Calvary was the high priest John said there's the Lamb of God hey man he was a high priest and he has to hope of God forgave sins based on the blood of innocent lambs that was shears accepted sacrifice until the day he died at Calvary after Calvary as high priest he forgave sins based on the shedding of his own it bud hey man now let's look in let's just look at the scripture let's take some Bible acts 20:28 because if we're gonna believe something it's got to have Bible Bible to back it up right a man acts 20 and verse 28 take heed unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own but notice it was how how does he how does he um purchase the flock he doesn't with his own but notice again Hebrews 9 and verse 12 by his own blood he entered into once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us again by his own bad man by his own badge he entered into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us all right now in verse 13 wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate notice again sanctification making your holy only comes by his sad blood revelation 1 and 5 and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead the Prince of the king of the earth until her and to him that loved us and washed us from our sins what in his own blood you see you know if it could be faith without blood then it would been unnecessary for Jesus to even die at Calvary all you have to do just have faith that's all we need to do to get people just to believe and now then Jesus would never it was it was unnecessary but you see without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin before Calvary he this the blood was shed by animals a man and accepted sacrifice after Calvary by his own blood somebody help me preach amen so you see if it could be with bad faith without blood then it was unnecessary for Jesus to die now why go to Calvary wife suffer what all we have to do is just believe not that say Jesus for you to die or we just believe you know that our sins are going and and we just accept that forgiveness no there had to be something pay the price there had to be something eradicate sin somebody with me now in the future hold brother Brandon would say it this way his plan of redemption is exactly the same by everything he uses the same method he never changes he said in Malachi 3 I am God I changed not the way he does it therefore if he saved the first man he ever saved by the shed blood of an innocent one he'll have to the next and everyone he saves will have to be the same way if he healed a man at any time through the journey of life let it be in the days of Jesus now healing is salvation on the body right hey man so the salvation on the soul of course is saving the soul but it's it's the same work of redemption when Jesus paid for our our sins he paid for our healing is that right if you healed any man at any time to the journey of life let it be in the days of Jesus the Apostles the prophets wherever it was when the same conditions is met he's got to do it again that's right he doesn't change man changes time changes ages changes dispensation changes but God remains the same he's perfect what a hope that ought to give to sick people amen if he ever healed a person he's got to do it again when the same conditions in math if he ever ever saved a man he's got to do it on the same grounds he did it out the first time that's why your eternal prescription goes all the way back to acts 2:38 repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin and you saw receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen if you ever mad filled a man with the Holy Ghost you've got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time this is what brother branham's little nephew would come to him and say brother Branham I'm having dreams and everything and I'm lost and and he said he called his name and he said son you know you you there's only one hope for you know Mary Hail Marys will do it no church join us we'll do it you've got to come the same way of acts 2:38 this day this scriptures fulfilled he still pulling him right back to the eternal prescription a man if he ever filled a man with the Holy Ghost he gotta do it on the same girls he did it the first time if he ever raced a man up from the grave he's got to do it the second time wherever other time on the same principle he doesn't change oh what a hope that gives me what is it not a sudden man-made via theory something that groups of men have come together but is on changeable word you say it is it the truthful he said let every man's word be a lie mine be true heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall not fail all Scripture is given for inspiration therefore it's good and profitable for doctors and remember that all scripture will be fulfilled every bit of it such simple there is no remission of sin without the shedding of blood all the faith in the world will not remit since it is blood detriment sins but of course a pardon must be received by faith and the blood is applied by faith notice he again proven his word he decided in the Garden of Eden he would save how he would save man through the shed blood of an innocent one he's never changed it we try to change it through education through towers of Babel through great cities and everything like that we try to change it but it don't work we try to change it by educating the world in him we try to change it by denomination of people it never worked only one place God will meet to worship is under the blood your denominations will split you up but under the blood you're the same he never changes he now if he's the unchangeable high priests and the same yesterday today and forever he's gotta keep that word not because we said he didn't because he said he would ma'am now again you know he he goes right on while I'm praying now and he would talk about that blood being between him and and God and it was the blood that made him perfect so what we can do without the blood today you better not one moment on the Oh without the blood you're a year go you're finished he says here he said now when I'm praying God don't see me he just hears my voice through the blood of Jesus he don't see me he hears my voice and that blood this is this is 1964 heads of the seals and that blood there is to represent what I asked this he he hears my voice but he sees only the blood oh that oughta make you shout but what are we saying when you talk that blacks beats when you pray he he looks any seasons the bad interceding it's not you just a mere man making a prayer it's that blood interceding on your behalf and God can't turn down the blood of his own son it's the purchase price this is what brother Branham told you when you pray you present your token with your prayer because the token is a Holy Ghost which is which is the sign that the blood has been applied it's the life of the blood we do not have our bloodless religion because we got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the life of the blood and when you have the Holy Ghost you have the blood so what are you doing you're praying through the Holy Ghost amen it's not you speaking anymores Oh somebody help me preach when you go to pray and it ain't you speak it anymore it's the Holy Ghost beacon you're calling on God and God's moving on your behalf and we know this if we ask anything according to his will he will do it it is wills his word he wants to heal he wants to deliver he wants to answer your prayer you want the Holy Ghost he wants to give you the Holy Ghost you sick you mean he wants to heal you you say well I I'm 80 years old doesn't matter you might be past 90 but the Holy Ghost of Sinda a servant he is all the way across he took tires off of a car get over there - man past 90 and raised it my friend from a sick bad day and healing so I'll shake your hand in front of the Blue Boar restaurant hey man you saw him - old to be healed brother Tim well brother branham said Abraham was past a hundred and he said God said I'm El Shaddai I he said you're my child you to me I'm the eternal one and you're just a baby looking at a lot of old babies hallelujah I mean look at yourself like what God looks at you you're not all that old you're a baby in the side of eternity you're just an infant they mention nurse on the breast of God throw yourself under some the Old Testament I am the Lord God to heal earth all of that diseases a man he was wounded for my transgressions by His stripes I was healed hallelujah man hit full on that side reach over here draw promised from the other side Lord of God a man if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover whatever you ask in my name I will do it in my name you shall cast out devils you speak with new tongues if you drink any deadly thing or yourself worried about all the chemical drink doesn't say it'll not harm you Wow yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil with me they comfort me Oh hallelujah while there's enemies all around you sit down the table and eat eat of that good Word of God amen renew your strength for cause the lord's mighty in battle hallelujah amen now when i'm praying god don't see me he hears my voice through the blood of jesus he does hears my voice he don't see me hears my voice and that blood is there to present to represent what I ask then he hears my voice but he sees only the blood he don't see me so I can't be dirty when I'm under the bud the blood cleanses he's the bumper between me and God and promise ask the Father anything I'll do it you've been do you believe that has to be true now this this quote meets all the criteria it was priest after the seals and it was preached in the tabernacle and he wasn't preaching to denomination he's preaching to his folks it meets all the criteria you have no reason to doubt it man there's a black bumper for you and for me Oh hallelujah the blood cleanses the spirit is a token that the blood has been applied this is from theirs now is from the token message the Spirit is the token that the blood has been applied until the blood is applied the Spirit cannot come but when the blood is applied then the Spirit is the token the sign sending it back to you that your faith and the blood has been accepted and your fare is paid your fare is paid it's all over the case is closed you're a Christian you're a believer crisis and you and you're in Christ I am man so now how are we the blood of Christ well you know that we don't have the chemistry of the blood today and then we have the life that was in the blood and then the chemistry went back into the ground and maybe was a sorbed into the wood of the cross or into the ground I don't know we're all in it went maybe if some of us peeled up on his garments there went a hundred different places we don't know where the chemistry went but we know where the life with because the life that was in the blood raised him up on the third day a man ascended into glory and here he came back the life of the blood came back on the date of Pentecost - by that hundred and twenty first initial one to be filled with the Holy Ghost so that makes every born-again believer of every age the blood by the spirit they were in the upper room they were the blood by the spirit today we are the blood by the spirit know brother Branham said the church is the blood of Christ by the Spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his body there recognizes only his body his flesh his word then we'll read you something from the seventh seal now we we come from God in simplicity and we're here now on the last seal even question answers has already been done come to the last sermon seventh seal brother Brennan said I thank God for his word I thank him for Jesus Christ for without sending him for the perpetuation of our sins we'll all be in a big muck of sin with no hope but by His grace his blood cleanses which is present since all sins just like the drop of ink in a bucket of Clorox you'll never find the ink again and when our sins are confessed it is foot in the blood of Jesus Christ they'll never be known again God forgives him there never was even done and as long as that sacrifice oh listen now seventh seal and as long as that sacrifice is layin there in and atonement for us then that's all that's it we're not sinners no more we're Christians by the grace of God hallelujah now you may have wondered about some of the things that he said but he couldn't write down the end and sums it all up and he says let that sacrifice his lay in there as an atonement for us and then he would prove it time and time again by invoking the high priest and the theme the theme throughout the seals was that we have a blood that is a bleach for sin that will change every chemistry of it of sin every molecule of it and send it back through the working of that bleach until it lands back on the head of your accuser [Applause] hallelujah amen what sins are you talking about hallelujah we'll dip them in the bleach and they ain't no more and they've been changed every every molecule of it until it leaves on the accuser and he will go to hell not you and he will be punished not you why because he took my punishment vicariously on the cross that's the atonement the original atonement brother Branham would teach this principle nice sitting here in counseling now do you think he would lie to people when he's counseling 1964 just before he preaches the masterpiece I want to interview a few moments ago I speak into person in the room that's present now his sister Georgie Bruce you can you can go and listen to her a recorded testimony or not testimonial brother branham speak into her and she said but brother Branham I have so many things that I know that's wrong and he said a godly little woman wouldn't you like a prophet to say that about you that's what God says about you there's no one greater than Jesus and I said but look sister don't look at yourself it's just what your desire isn't what you try to do and if you really love the Lord you try to serve him with all your heart but since the seals is open there's no more mercy and there's no more grace and the lamb has left the seat of intercessory and now that ain't what he said you try to serve him with all your heart how many's there how many is there that's your testimony this Mon you trying to serve him with all your heart and then all your mistakes how many get there but I made so many and all your mistakes is here in the blood of the Lord Jesus Wow you say brother Dilma I've got a lot of folks right I'm in the blood in the blood well I see a cleansing stream of blood it froze from Calvary it's waves which reach the throat of God are sweeping over me hallelujah well and those condemnation comes you say I sinned there's no use to pray that's what Satan says no used to pray I look away to Jesus and he tells me to say I see a crimson stream blood thank God for the blood the message brought you back to the original autonomous are you with me now a man you say not me brother Tim I'll tell you what now I'll tell you I don't need no blood mmm and I'll tell you what I'm I'm maturing perfect and hallelujah I moved my way to heaven higher I'm now we've our grow this bleedy sacrifice we don't need nobody up there like that well here's what brother Branham said now you you know what you and you wouldn't believe how many false prophets preached that kind of nonsense have you ever seen such a time of such arrogance sixty-three after the seals any man it is subject to mistakes now Christian does not willfully sin but he does make mistakes you made a mistake this morning when you didn't really pray you didn't do a job Jesus said we should often pray that sin sin of omission brother Brandon would often pray God forgive me of my unbelief that's where we all get faced with things and we wobble and wandering vacillating brother Branham would have to pray himself after seeing millions hundreds millions thousands whatever number multitude without number of miracles and would still have to wrassle with unbelief Satan would come to him and say you ain't nothing but a fake and these miracles you're talking about isn't real and brother Brent said I listen to him for a little bit and he said after a while I got tired of him and he said Satan I resent you coming now you get out of here in the name of Jesus Christ and he said he fled from my room and he said after that here come a real sweet spirit in the room and it said to me don't never fear to go anywhere or do anything but that never-failing presence of jesus christ is with you wherever you go I say hallelujah what a consolation he will never leave us or forsake us in the darkness of the midnight I hear Satan come around you're not winning the battle you're just losing ground and then I hear a voice saying pick up your sword hey man any man is subject mistakes he's subject to error because he's human he's subject to the violation of God's law and remember offend at one point you're guilty of Arlen that's Bible he is subject to many things because Satan tempts him and he's just a human being and if God oh listen this and if God ever lifted his hands he would fall that's all and I've heard people say Oh Satan can't do that yes you just let God lift his hand one time and watch what happens I constantly please God don't send him have mercy on me keep him away from me I need God's mercy and we all need that brethren Aegis out there that needs God's mercy it's all of us in here that needs God's mercy and I didn't just need it at the altar when I got safe I need it every day we're not saying I needed today I needed tomorrow I'll need it the next day I need mercy his mercy / mercy no don't ever think that Satan's Eden brother Branham says dissin meets the criteria 265 Jeffersonville Oh God help us to be pure in the sight of your Lord no matter what man thinks about us what other people say Lord let our conversations be holy let it be seasoned with God's Word so Sita milord that there's no guy on that means no dishonesty found in us while we plead in our own mistakes that the blood of Jesus Christ will stand between us and God that he'll look down upon us through the blood of Jesus not upon our own righteousness or who we are or what we've done but upon his merits alone aren't you glad for the blood hey man now then brother Branham had some of the same thoughts you did had a friend a brother supporter and there's meeting the young preacher he got under roof I guess he was working sidewall mashed him down underneath that and they said he was gonna die his liver were buzz bursted his spleen was knocked out of place tons had fallen on him brother Branham was concerned about this and he said you know I talked to my wife at breakfast I said you know what you you wife you know if Jesus was here you know what he would do when he sponsored me he said I believe that word and he was sponsoring Christ I said this is a trick of the devil I just want you to realize things that are happen to you or trick of the devil and I said if Jesus was here he'd go lay his holy hands upon him and that boy would get well I don't care if his liver is bursted he would get well because Jesus would walk in there knowing exactly who he was he knew his call and and the Scriptures was right vindicated in him he knew he was not a shadow of doubt he lay hands upon him and say son be well we'll walk out there and I said then enough Devils in Hell to kill that boy he would get well but you see honey he was Jesus the holy hands of God and I was I'm a sinner I was born sex of birth my father mother were both sinners I'm just no good nothing many times that's the way we look at ourselves you're not a no-good nothing you're the purchased of his blood there was an old man one time story of an old man that got run over he was he was a kind of a really poor lived in a little poor place but he was a Christian you know Christians ain't always rich we go Paul said sometimes I'm in need of one and you know I'm a need of food I'm in need of shelter I'm in the there's many times God doesn't make us all the same man looks down upon them bases man's worth by his wealth by his clothes God looks at the heart and this whole man had he had he'd been a street preacher and preached for years and years on the street passed out tracts somebody young people carelessly come and I turn the corner too fast and hit him they picked him up thought he was dead took him into the hospital and said you know he's an old man the doctors were talking among themselves said listen he ain't worth much he just thought on the street there we you know it is life just about over with anyway and you know he's just a poor boy couldn't pay and he said you know what we what we do is we just kind of you know just do the minimal we can for him because he's not worth fixing up well the old man wasn't as dead as he thought he was he spoke up in Sybil Circe you may not think I'm worth much but I'm worth the purchase blood of Jesus Christ cuz my Lord went to Calvary and he paid his room and gave his own blood for me and I'm worth a whole lot more than what you think I am I think sometimes you need to remind the devil you're worth you're worth something to him because he gave his whole life for you said you know but you know what if the Lord would just give me a vision and send me down there then then that would be different so I'd go down there and lay my hands on him he'd come out of that bed if he'd give me a vision said then I got to thinking after all it was if it was a vision what was it if it's the same dirty hands on him same man praying for him same dirty hands then I began to think I'm his representative then God doesn't see me that blood of that righteous one lays it there on the altar it makes intercessions for me he is my sufficiency he is my prayer he is my life the only thing that made me put my hand on him with faith because I had faith in the vision and without the vision the same faith would do the same thing so I can recognize reckon myself nothing and reckon him my all and all he is my life he's my commissioner no denomination sent me he sent me hallelujah I go in his name I lay my hands upon him I walk down there and laid hands on that boy Oh hallelujah Amen laid hands upon that boy and he said that night he was in the meeting oh yes he is that fountain no other fount I know nothing but the blood of Jesus I'm a stinker I'm a renegade every one of us are bub God we're perfect being therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect how can you be because a perfect one represents us there that fountain is there every day fresh not some stagnated something but fresh every day that washes away all my sins he is that fountain hallelujah aren't you glad that we have the resources of that fountain aren't you glad that he said whoever blesses me will be blessed and whoever curses me will be cursed hallelujah aren't you glad that we have the right man as a believer they're not putting our unworthy hands but all but take him because he made us worthy by his blood and bless my brother in his name hallelujah that's his promise Wow he heard me through the bad he didn't hear me as a mere man but he heard me through the blood and he cannot turn down the blood I'm glad for that oh you said well now now I'm not anymore brother damn man you know Christ is no longer an intercessor you know what brother Branham said he took the book of redemption in his hand the bloody lamb stands on the altar of sacrifice where's this priest it reaches a criteria pretty good six seal then how'd that any man anybody just say that Mary or Joseph or any other mortal could be an intercessor you cannot intercessor unless there's blood there yes sir there's one mediator between God and man and that's Christ Jesus and that's what the scripture said there he stands and until the last soul has been redeemed and then he comes with the claim what he has redeemed when when the last soul has been renamed a man now then he says now I've always taught that in the mouth do you this cook continued then the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established and the scripture just like you can't take one scripture and prove nothing let's search something else goes with it see I can take one scripture and say Judas went and hung himself take another and say you go do the same but you see it won't blend with the rest of it and when we go and cherry-pick our quotes and make it something that the rest of the word doesn't say hey man well what are we doing we're doing exactly what he said well you know we we are we're cherry-picking it were that Judas make it we're what Judas wouldn't hung himself go thou and do thou likewise putting your scriptures together like that brother we are to rightly divide the word of truth and when you rightly divide it we find out we have a high priest that can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities we find out that there's a blood and then that there is a lamb the paid redemptions price a man we find out man the cold creats can never bring us to a real harvest we've got to have a church that's washed in the blood of the Lamb and then we got to understand that we have been called back to the original atonement and standing there under that blood we have been justified you said brother Tim you said we don't need the blood anymore because we're now justified and we never did it in the first place yes brother Brennaman did say they did say that he took away your shame and he put it in the sea of his forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood life so don't tell me you can be verges without the blood that's why we're birches this morning a man that's why we have an atonement it's because there's a crimson stream of life because there's a provision made at Calvary and because through that blood we can get any prayer answered any time amen when we pray he only sees the blood when I see the blood I'll pass over you amen let's bow our heads together that the musicians come you're the pure virtuous sinless bride of the Son and living God every man and woman that's born of the Spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word stands as though you never sinned that the first place you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ aren't you thankful thank you for the cross Lord thank you for that crimson blood amen thank you Lord that you never leave us or forsake us thank you that you're here with us always a man thank you Lord that we're perfect we come back to the original atonement oh man was to try to make it somewhere you know just a Baptist faith just a Baptist profession just a claim to believe but Oh church the blood is an experience from Calvary it's the coming of the Holy Ghost in your life it's the lighting of your candle you can never be the same and when you can touch it nothing else matters let let your life touch him today reach out reach out to him father we speak today Lord we invite your presence we just have Lord your minister to hearts and lives Lord that you'll just help us O God to realize who we are as sons there were the people of the book and we returned to the land of the book to come back to the original atonement and the availa on valent of god has revealed to us Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever take these
