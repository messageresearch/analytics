for your glory and for your honor we pray lord we commit this service to your hands lord everything to be said and done ask god to just continue to move in our hearts we ask it in jesus name amen amen let's turn to mark chapter four amen like to continue on a little bit and follow up from last wednesday hey man i'd like to speak to you on undisturbed undisturbed mark chapter 4 and verse 35 it says in the same day when the evening was come he said unto them let us pass over to the other side and when they had sent away the multitudes they took him even as he was in this ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat the ship so that it was now full but he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and said unto him master carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the whim and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm amen we'll let you be seated i was studying this scripture a little bit more this week as as i was looking for something to minister to tonight and i ran across across this quote and it really jumped out at me brother branham and melchizedek the great prince and king he says faith never rushes itself faith always knows what it's talking about he said you never seen our master excited about anything standing by the grave of a dead man he was just as calm as he was when he sat on the mount and looked over jerusalem standing on a ship in troubled seas and the waves tossing him around about he was so completely resting in god until it never even paid he never even paid attention to attention to the storms enough to wake him up see faith is always undisturbed he said now we find here that the reason that we can be undisturbed because we have been given a promise through our father abraham to his children and the god who gave the promise he swore by the oath that he would keep the promise that he gave to us amen a faith that is undisturbed so to have a place of faith that is undisturbed the faith has to have a resting place faith has to be at rest and we find a very interesting story as we read it again tonight of of a crossing of a sea in it and you know it seemed like everything was going wonderful and everything was maybe peaceful as it started out on the journey and they find themselves somewhere out in the middle of the sea and and we know the devil as he knew what was taking place and he saw maybe a chance to to take them out and he began to get into the winds and to the waves and and to cause a storm to come up but in the middle of this storm was really a paradox that was taking place when the storm was beaten against the ship so much that the scripture says that it had filled the very vessel they were in and it was about to sink and here right in the middle of a boat filled with water and it was tossing around it was a man that was at rest a man that was sleeping there in the ship and so as you look at this there had to be something in him that was greater than the physical uh mannerism or the physical the physic physicalities of his being or his thoughts or or his reasoning because no man with you know how it is you'd be laying in bed one night and you hear a little thunder rumble and it wakes you up or are you beginning to get worried about is it a tornado is it this there's all kind of thoughts run through your mind when you hear these things taking place but here he had spoke the word let's go to the other side and he had enough faith in that word that that word was going to come to pass that when he gets in the middle of a storm and he gets in the middle of the chaos all around him it does not worry him it does not fret him he does not get concerned about it he continues to be at rest and i believe we can we can gain a great lesson from this because we also face storms we also face trouble sometimes we're in one of the most troublesome times that's ever come upon the face of this earth and so we also have things in our lives and if we're not careful we go to our own thoughts our own humanistic ideas our ways our reasonings and we begin to become become uh you know unrestful or weary or are tore up about situations in our lives and that the thing we could stay in is in the word of god that the word of god is going to come to pass no matter how much satan fights against it no matter how much hell screams and how much waves comes no matter how how tumultuous it may seem his word will come to pass he's kept every promise he's kept every word amen he stood for us against every sickness and disease he has conquered every sin let me let you know in on something god has got this amen maybe you need to look at your situation and tell your situation god's got this he's greater than my problems he's greater than my struggles he's greater than the things that i'm going through maybe you're facing some great financial struggle he's greater than that maybe you're facing the greatest of great sickness nigh unto death he's greater than that you know he would tell us in luke chapter 12 and verse 24 he would say consider the ravens for they never sow nor reap which neither have storehouses nor barns but god feedeth them and how much more are ye better than the fouls hallelujah amen about a raven is not he don't have a barn somewhere and he's looking at it and it's like wow i need to go do something about it my barn's getting low he's not even concerned about a barn amen he knows he has a heavenly father and that heavenly father is going to watch over him he's going to provide for him he's going to take care of him he's going to give him what he has need of and and he says how much more are ye than the fowls if i'll take care of a little bird or a raven or if i'll take care of the the the the the things of this earth i'm in the the the animals of this world how much more will i take care of you amen and which of you can by taking thought add to his statute one cubit if you then be able to do that thing which is least why take you thought for the rest if you can't even do that why worry about the rest of it amen consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin not yet i say unto you that solomon in all of his glory was not arrayed like one of these if then god so clothed the grass which is today in the field and tomorrow is cast into the oven how much more will he clothe ye o ye of little faith seek not you that which you shall eat or what you shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind now if you look at this doubtful mind it's actually very interesting it's actually the same metaphors taken from the metaphor of a ship that's being tossed about going up and down up and down up and down one day it's high next day is low one moment it's on the top of the way the next day or the next moment it feels like it's about to crash to the bottom of the ocean he's telling us don't have that kind of mind but have one mind the mind of christ amen the mind of christ will go to sleep in the middle of a storm he'll be at rest amen because he knows god will keep his word amen that's why we can we don't need to get all tore up about sicknesses and things and it's very easy to do but don't get tore up about it god will keep his word amen so don't be of doubtful mind it's to lift one's soul or it's to buoy up and down with hope i hope it's going to be okay i hope i'm going to get well i hope i'm going to get out of this problems i hope this is going to happen it's got to move beyond hope because hope is up and down hope is like a buoy on an ocean somewhere and you're up one day and down the next amen you want you don't want to be of a doubtful mind but you understand that he watches over the lilies that they grow amen where does the lily come from it comes from the very bottom of the of the pond and the ma the most mary muck you ever seen in the darkest place but there's a sun up there and it begins to call for life and it begins to bring it out of that muck and out of that stuff and bring it to the top of the water until it can burst forth its flower oh i'm looking at some lilies tonight amen you wasn't down in some very dire situation very dark very dismal and god called you out of that well if god called you out of that you can rest assured he's going to take care of you he's going to provide for you he's going to do everything he can for you if he would take care of a bird he'll take care of you [Applause] so don't be of a doubtful mind tossed about by the winds and the waves because it causes one to waver or to fluctuate in the mind it's to agitate or harass with cares is to make anxious amen make anxious amen brother and we'll say it like this he says see faith doesn't look at the present time faith doesn't see what's right here faith looks to what god wants and it works accordingly amen your site sees what's right here your site sees the problems your site sees your bank account your site sees this your site sees that it sees all kinds of issues that ain't what faith looks like he said faith is a long-range vision amen faith is a long-range vision it never lowers its sight oh come on now that ought to make you shout right there faith never lowers your sight it holds to the target he said you get a good shooter and knows what he's talking about or ever done any long-range shooting he said it's like binoculars he said you don't look you don't look you don't look around real close with binoculars you don't look at your watch through a pair of binoculars amen he says you look at things that are far off he said faith does that faith picks up god's binoculars both the old and new testament and it sees every promise that he made no matter what's right here in front of you oh hallelujah right here in front of you might be cancer it might be every kind of disease of the world amen might be every kind of issues maybe all kinds of things but faith will pick up the word of god and look at a promise come on now amen faith sees it out yonder faith chooses this regardless of what present tense says regardless of what it looks like regardless of what the doctor's report says that matters not to faith faith is looking at a promise faith is looking out there and it's saying it's now he's the lord god that heals all our diseases now by his stripes i'm healed now my family is healed and it never drops its sights down to look away i love that when faith is centered on a target they ain't a devil in hell they can say you know what you need to lower your standards just a little bit you need to lower it down a little bit man he said he said your offspring well maybe that just means one of them not all of them but maybe just one of them maybe just a few of your children is going to be saved the rest of them is going to be low maybe maybe it just means the healing is just for some of them lower your sights down just a little bit amen get it off you that's not where it belongs no your faith keeps it right on the target and it says by his stripes i am healed doesn't matter what's present tense doesn't matter what the doctor says doesn't matter what any devil says it keeps the crosshairs dead center on the word that's what faith does amen but see unbelief will catch reasoning well you know reason you know it reasons away the word it reads well you know we don't we don't have to have church tonight we just haven't just come together and have a good little time and go back home we're all right and that's not what faith says faith says i need something from god and i'm going to get something from god faith reaching out there and grabbing it said faith always looks to the word that is its resting place unbelief relies on reasonings present day things present time things what's going on right now that's what reasoning is relying on that's what reasoning will always take you back to is what is happening right now what did the doctor's report say what does it look like what is the child doing right now what is going on right now at your work what's happening right now reasoning is always taking you to present tense faith is looking long distance amen that word still the remain remains there and this is where jesus faith led let's go to the other side his faith was already over there on the other side where a little heart was crying out for help he wasn't looking at present tense and the storms and the winds that was trying to keep it he wasn't going to keep him from making it because the word already said let's go to the other side come on now listen you can look at present tense or you want to but the devil is not going to keep this bride from taking a body change you can look at all the problems you can look at all the situations you can look at all the false doctrines you can look at at all but i'm looking by faith his word said i'll never pride without spot without wrinkle without blemish she's going in a rapture so it does not matter what present tense says faith looks to the word faith puts itself upon an unmovable rock faith does not look at reasoning he said i don't care how much you can show it would be better if the word says no faith rests there it's the sanctuary of faith's resting place the word is amen faith come by hearing hearing by the word of god amen see faith finds the word its sanctuary of rest it moves right on to the top of that eternal rock christ christ jesus the word and it lays down there and rests undisturbed it lays down there and rest it's resting on the word amen we don't have to be all tore up about this body change we just need to rest on the word we don't have to be torn up about being healed or not rest on the word his word said it he said it i believe it the resting place for the christian amen when it's laying there on the word let the winds have let the storm shake she is safe oh hallelujah if you rest on the word that's where faith genuine christian faith rests the rest in place is the word for it knows that god will ever prove himself superior over every one of his enemies no matter how bad it looks how many enemies there are how it looks like you're defeated faith stills knows you're going to overcome faith still knows you're going to have victory faith still knows your children are coming back faith still knows my body is going to line up to the word of god that's what faith declares he said now do you sick people how i'd like to drive this home is that when you catch that faith that you're going to be healed every circumstance all signs and all symptoms everything can point that you're dying but you will never move you're resting undisturbed sleeping while it's storming hey man it took me a long time to do that i used to work for a pirate company for quite some time and you hear a storm coming there tonight you know he's about to get caught up and called out so you just get up wake up lay there and wait for your phone to go off i i quit there probably six seven years still storm come i'm expecting my phone to go off took me a long time now i love to hear thunder you know i may have this thought go to poor brother phillip and ain't poor brother timothy no more amen amen but you know you find yourself at rest it can be lightening it can be all kinds of things going on but i'm not worried about it no more amen and this is where we have to get to if you want god to do something for you you've got to find that place of rest you can't be up there up about it and down about it this way about it you got to stay there on face resting place and that is the word of god and when the devil comes with reason you do like jesus you go back to the word of god he comes with torment you go back to the word of god he goes with mind battles you go back to the word of god and just because you got the holy ghost does not mean you're not going to have mind battles jesus had them just as soon as he left the river being baptized with the spirit of god the first man that the spirit of god would descend upon and stay in david it came down it left it came down and left amen but here's the first man that it came into and it stayed and he was taken up into the wilderness to be tempted somehow we get the idea that we're gonna we're gonna fight we're gonna get the holy ghost and it's all going to be over with no sir that's when you're really getting into the battle that's a good sign that you have received something from god when the devil's trying to take it from you but let me tell you something the devil will never take from you what he didn't give you when god deposited that on the inside of you there ain't a devil in hell that can take it from you so you can rest take him back to the word don't get stood up and stir it up and say well i just lost no you ain't lost nothing keep fighting keep holding keep staying there in the word stay there upon that on that eternal resting place not make belief genuine faith not hope but faith hope is there hoping it was in faith is already in oh man i hope you caught that i i've read these over and over and i just kind of caught that one myself he said hope is looking in there hope we're hoping it was in there wishing it was in there he said faith is already in there looking out amen when you look at these scriptures with hope you're hoping this is my name you're hoping this is who i am you're hoping i'm the one that says by his stripes i hope that's me but when you have faith you're in the scripture looking out you're in there and say buy your stripes i am healed never take your hands off of god's property i never belonged to you in the first place but all signs all symptoms all circumstances everything can point that you're dying but you won't move from it you won't move it's resting place you find the rest undisturbed that faith take when there's that's where faith takes its resting place it's done right it's done for it knows that god will never never let the enemy right over the top of him he never has faith knows that regardless of what it looks like god noah knew the ark would float certainly did daniel knew that god would close the lion's mouth the hebrew god children knew god could stop the fire jesus knew god would raise him up again because why the word said so i'll not leave my soul in hell neither i suffer my holy one to see corruption he knew corruption would set him with 20 72 hours within three days i'll raise it up again what was it hid by faith he rested on a word reason we tried his best to recognize well this system is bound to be better this is that but it looks it looks better because you're looking with the intellectual mind you can prove reasonings by your intellectual mind you can't prove faith if you can prove it it ain't no longer faith by faith but faith knows only the word and the promise and it looks to that thing that you do not yet see faith sees things you can't see with your intellect faith sees things you can't see with your mind your own your own physical attributes that's the reason you can rest assured because you're not no longer looking with these eyes you're looking with faith by faith we can go through the scriptures but you know even death itself can't shake faith men stand right in death right in the face of death and shout the victory of the resurrection oh death where is your sting oh grave where is your victory christ will raise me up see faith makes the word of god its sanctuary of its eternal rest and it lays in the word of god it does not lay in how you feel it does not lay in how you think it does not lay in how you how you imagine things it does not lay in any of that it only lays in the word of god amen amen he would say in john 14 and verse 1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me this trouble is to be agitated or troubled by parts by the movement of parts moving to and fro it's to cause one inward commotion it's to take away his calmness of mind is to disturb your presence of mind it's to disquiet you or make you restless or to stir you up or to be troubled or to strike you with fear and dread or to render you anxious or distressed to perplex your mind by suggesting doubts let not your heart be troubled this is what he would tell the disciples as he's leaving but it's also to us because he's coming back and he said it because in my father's house are many mansions kind of imagine brother timothy that's something about this tall some brown hair some black-haired ones some red-haired ones ain't gonna be no gray-haired ones no bald-headed ones amen some blond-headed ones ain't gonna be no purple-headed ones pink headed one green headed one ain't gonna be none of that hey man ain't gonna be no highlighted ones fakely done ain't gonna be none of that there's mansions there and if it wasn't so i would have told you if it wasn't true i'd have told you there ain't no hope for you but i'm telling you this so you know there is a place provided for you so you can be at rest let not your heart be troubled amen there's going to be all kind of problems he didn't tell him about all that he didn't tell them about what they're about to go through he didn't tell them about the crucifixion they're about to face and the scourge and the boiling pots of oil he didn't tell him about none of that he just said let not your heart be troubled because i got a place for you hallelujah and this is what he wants to tell you tonight again let not your heart be troubled you'll face perplexity of time you'll face sicknesses you'll face every kind of thing but i ain't got to we ain't got to worry about all that i've already got that taken care of i have a place prepared for you a body not made with hands a body that never sinned in if it was not were not true i would have told you but i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i've got to go do this so i can come again if it wasn't true he would have told you but he told you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also and whether i go you know and the way you know thomas said well lord what are you talking about i don't know what you're talking about where you're going and i don't know the way jesus said unto him i am the way this is why you know it i am the way i am the truth i am the life and no man can come unto the father but by me so i have made the way i have provided it i have set it all up for you let not your heart be traveled let not your heart be troubled i have spent a place for you not only have i made a place for you i'm going to come back and i'm going to receive you unto myself that where i am you can be also that you can experience the same peace that you can have the same joy that you can understand what i understand that you can know in fullness how i know that's faith's resting place if you hadn't known me you'd have known my father also from henceforth you shall know him and have seen him and philip said to them lord show us the father and it suffices us and jesus said to them have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that has seen me has seen the father and how sayeth thou then showed us the father believeth thou not that i am the father and the father in me and the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the work believe me that i'm in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake barely breathe out saying to you he that believeth on me the works he that puts his faith in me faith's resting place this is believe in faith he that puts his faith in me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go to my father and whatsoever you ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name i will do it if it wasn't so i would have told you faith is just as positive as your eyes sight is here even more faith is more real than your eyesight or your feelings to even know this desk is here how many knows this desk is right here can you see it i can feel it i can see it it's produced to me by my senses but what if we had put something here before the service and said the desk is here the desk maybe ain't here then what your faith couldn't declare it or your site couldn't declare it because you wouldn't be able to see it let's see there's a bottle of water there how many believes that bottle of water is there how many believes it you believe me somebody some of you say you can't believe me unless i'm behind the pulpit so maybe [Laughter] mercy but i told you it's there so why do you believe it's there because i told you it's there let's see if it's there well i'll be it's there if you'd believe the ma the words of a mortal man that a bottle of water was sitting there how much more can we believe the the words of an immortal god that says by my stripes you're healed amen what puts it there faith puts it there faith in his word that he's never told you a lie he's never done you wrong he's always been there for you he brought you out of the mirey clay set your feet up on a rock he took care of you this far i can believe what he says and if it wasn't so he would have told me but he told me it was so cause he said it he put it in his word so it has to be there even though i mean i see it right now he said it even though i can't put my hands on it he said it oh hallelujah amen you may not be able to put your hands right now on your healing but that does not change your healing you may not be able to put your eyes or your thoughts or your mind on your healing and grasp it with your feelings or grasping with your thoughts but your faith says he said it i believe it he said it i'm gonna stand on it i'm gonna rest on it i don't care how bad it gets i don't care how hard it rolls the winds may come and the waves may get higher and higher and higher and it seems like i'm sinking i'm just going to rest undisturbed when you have that kind of faith you know it's going to happen you know it's going to be there and nothing can take it out if the doctor stands and say you're dying the next hour you know you're going to get well he might tell you you're covered over with cancer or leprosy's eating you up that wouldn't scare you one bit you can be at rest hey man look at paul when he was in that ship there and it was about to go down i've been waterlogging raining for days and days and days all hope was gone they've been chunking stuff over the ship trying to save themselves and paul amen goes in there and begins to pray and the angel comes and speaks to him and says paul amen you're going to be brought before caesar don't worry about it stay with the ship it's going to be okay amen and it goes right out in the middle of the storm and he runs outside and he's shaking his hands with everyone and screaming it's going to be okay be of good courage don't worry about it there's an angel that said you don't have to be afraid amen we're going to go right before caesar and we're going to be okay stay with the ship and i'll say this in the name of the lord whatever you do don't get out of the ship stay with it it may seem like it's going down it may seem like it's about to go to the bottom it may seem like it's impossible and you're not ever going to come out with that but don't forget who's resting in your ship amen and we know the story amen the ship as they stayed there they were saved and they got on the island and they began to build a fire and a snake bit him and he just grabbed the snake and he threw it off in the fire amen just threw it off in the fire and they were all amazed why could he do that because he had faith in the words of an angel he had faith in what the angel had spoke to him you're going to stand before caesar and the words of an angel were greater than a snake bite hallelujah i'm here to tell you the words of your savior it's greater than any sin it's greater than any sickness it's greater than any disease by his strife i am healed so tonight let's shake that snake off in the fire the words of our savior's greater than the poison of the snake ship was pitching just as hard as it ever was still no stars still no moon still no days passing he said paul didn't worry a bit he said boys i need another sandwich i'm hungry walking up down the deck glory to god we're not far from land see no matter how dark it got a whale he said might have come and turned the ship over and sharks following that well by the hundreds that wouldn't phase paul he had the word of the angel he knew what god had said he believed that god he believed what god had said wherefore brother be of good courage for i believe that it should be it'll be just as he showed it to me see there's faith go out on the aisle there he picked up a bunch of sticks through in the fire no snake bit him but he didn't phase him he just shook it off and kept going that's faith you set your course your course is set you know exactly where you're standing and you just keep on he said see when if an individual can pray till you strike that same place there isn't enough doctors to tell you you is going to remain sick that's right he's in this covenant and he said see what happens is you got to get to that place to where you can be undisturbed well i just need an angel well we've already got the word of god i believe his word he said it i believe it we could talk about israel how they lost their covenant lost their freedom or loss of freedom not the covenant but when god made the covenant with abraham isaac and jacob he swore by himself that he'd save abraham and his seed after him and god's duty bound to keep that promise and he's just as duty bound to you on that promise as he was to abraham's seed on the promise if you're abraham's seed how many does abraham see we became it by christ amen heirs according to the promise then god is just his duty bound to you as he was to abraham amen so if he changed abraham's body just as duty bound to change our body amen say see say that would take that should take all the scare out of you god don't want you to be scared of nothing rest solemnly upon what he said he said well you know uh what about i just don't know about if you can air he said if you can ever get the scare out of the church and let them realize who they are and what they are positionally he says healing will be the simplest message to be preached he said but we're scared we're afraid he said what is it you don't realize who you are you're sons and daughters of god not now not will be you are now sons and daughters of god not way off in the future we want sometime in future set in heavenly places we're now seated in heavenly places well now we're sons and daughters of god it does not appear that what we shall be in the hymn but we shouldn't see him and we'll have a body like his but now we are the sons and daughters of god a covenant made by abraham and to his seed amen see god didn't tell abraham if you do this then i'll do that if you do this i'll do that he said i have already done it and we are under the same covenant so we can be undisturbed we can be at rest because it ain't what i've done is what he's already done he already paid my my pri the price for my healing i don't have to come up with the money to pay for it i don't have to come up with the money amen to pay for my salvation or anybody else's salvation it's already been paid for he's already done it it's time we start looking at sicknesses amen with the eye of god and say it's already been paid for this has already been paid for we ain't got a beg we ain't got to plead we ain't got to get on our knees and crawl for miles we ain't got to get bloody knees and bloody hands to get it it's already been paid for it's already been given to the church of the living god see healing is not what a man can do healing is what god has already done salvation is not what a man can do or what a church can do that salvation is a finished work your faith in that finished work that christ completed everything amen christ redeemed it all back he paid it all every sin every sickness ever hello cancer you're in that every disease has already been paid for and right now we see him sitting at the right hand of god making intercessions upon our profession or our confession no matter how much you pray how much you cry how much you agonize how much you do it won't be accepted god can do nothing for you unless you accept it by faith first say god you already done it i'm just here to claim it that's the only way god can act now is when you act first because he's a high priest make an intercession upon your confession of faith in his finished work that's the basis of divine healing he would say again about abraham he said see abraham took god's word he believed god he called those saints which were contrary to the promise god gave him he called them as though they didn't even look at them he took god at his word and when the days passed the weeks passed the months passed the years passed that didn't faze abraham not one bit hello the scripture said he staggered not at the promises of god but was strong in the faith amen didn't phase him one bit amen and everything seemed to every day it simply seemed to grow more difficult and more difficult and more impossible and more impossible but instead of getting weaker he got stronger job it seemed to get more difficult and more impossible and more weaker i mean more situations arose and it got worse and got worse and got worse but job didn't get weaker job got stronger amen i believe that there's a bride here on the earth it's not getting weaker he said where are you brother man we'll say we say we're looking at how bad the world's getting he said what you need to be looking is how powerful the church is getting and how much more powerful the church is today than what it was before amen the waves may be getting bigger and it may seem like it's getting more impossible for a rapture to happen but it's going to happen not because i said it because he said it and if he said it i'll believe it so instead of getting weaker we're getting stronger well these are falling off and that's following where they went out from us because they wouldn't none of us so it makes the church stronger difficulties seem to rise but god's promised it it seems to be more impossible but god's promised it so instead of instead of cowering back we ought to stand more firm than ever on thus saith the lord it ought to be settled when god says something amen it ought to be settled when god says something well what did he say well read your bible i'm not saying god can't give dreams i'm not saying god don't give vision he still does he still gives visitations of angels he still does that but don't forget god's got a whole chock full of promises laying here and he said it and he always waiting on somebody to say you know what that's me i'm not out here looking in there i'm in there that's me abraham called those things which were as though they were not because they were contrary to the word so the symptoms and the circumstances and the problems he didn't pay no attention to it he just goes on you're going down i thought this was interesting this is a fundamental foundation for faith it's a really wonderful sermon so we hear so many people say well if i only had faith he said now faith doesn't mean long drawn out prayer meetings he said it doesn't mean long fast faith is an unconscious thing your real faith you're unconscious to it you don't know that the faith you you don't even know the faith you've got it says unconscious matter to you could you imagine jesus questioning whether he had faith or not to stop the wind or steal the waves or have faith enough to raise lazarus up he never questions his faith first thing before we can have faith we got to have some foundation for faith there has got to be something behind it so we don't we're not having faith on some wisdom whimsical thing some man said what's behind our faith is what god said faith is always there and we've got to find faith's resting place faith is looking for somebody that'll grab it and hold on to it no matter how bad the storms are raining brother timothy is bad yeah sure is you couldn't tell the disciples and winds and waves wasn't real they was real jesus knew they was real he knew the dangers of it but he also knew the power of the word we know the dangers that we're living in it's a dangerous time just got word today that one of our brothers just got released brother caleb just got released from the prison there just a few minutes ago he's an on-time god he's greater than the storms god's doing things he's moving in impossible situations this ain't the time to jump out the boat an abandoned ship and think it's got too rough it's too bad it's too deep it's too this is too that no it's the time god steps to the bow of the boat and he says peace be still do you know the peace be still i'm looking for is there one bright and shining morning you're talking about peace he steps to the brow from the on the brow of eternity and he says peace be still and all of our wars and all of our strife that we've been through in our sicknesses and the things that we've been carrying and fighting just all melts away think on them things for a moment let me end it with this he said he says this and that's one of my favorite quotes and i i i this this one gets me he said the stabilizers has been put on the ship he says great fearful ways are out here before us but we know just beyond that last wave yonder we're nearing the shore we're nearing the shore just stay stable just stay at rest just remain undisturbed just stay in the word stay with god no matter how you feel what anything else is going on stay right with the word let's stay stable when you see all these great old clouds around the storms are coming bombs and the hangers everything else they're talking about but our stabilizer is right straight tied to the word god said it would be here and we're going to crest every wave that comes come on somebody if that don't give us pump in your heart an extra step in you to say when that wave comes i'm going over it that wave's coming i'm going over and one of these days that last wave is going to come and we're going to go over safely on the other side he said see they're going to come right to us but we're going to crest they can not sink us oh hallelujah they cannot seek us they cannot drown us you put us in the grave we're going to come out again ah that's just all there is to it there ain't no way in the world it's going to keep us down there we're going to crest every one of them because our chief captain is calling on the other side and we're anchored in jesus the storms of life i pray i've anchored in jesus i'll fear no wind
