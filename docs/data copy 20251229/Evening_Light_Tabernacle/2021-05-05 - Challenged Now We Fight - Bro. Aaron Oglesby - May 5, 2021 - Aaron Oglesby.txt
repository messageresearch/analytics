tonight you can meet any devil tonight you can overcome every obstacle put in your way i'm telling you with him going before his church with him going before us he told david he said when you hear the sound of a going when you hear the sound of a go and then go out and face the enemy what was the sound of a going if you look in and it was actually angels footsteps when you hear angels marching when you hear the army of god going out before you then it's time to strike what have we been hearing in these services what's been taking place all over the world there's angels marching there's angels marching before you he's gone out before you now let's take courage tonight take courage in your battle take courage in your struggle and let's go out and meet the enemy tonight you will have victory you will secure victory because he's already gone out before you i hear the sound of it going i hear angels marching i hear almighty god moving in this place church i'm ready for victory i'm ready for the bride of jesus christ to rise up and say enough is enough enough is enough let's take our positions tonight the battle is set in a raid who will go who will go here i am send me [Music] heavenly father lord god we stand in your presence tonight lord god thankful lord knowing you are here filling your presence amongst us lord lord and even if there was no feeling your word declares it and that's enough for me your word declares that you're here lord and you're here to do battle you're here to set the captive free you're here to save the lost you're here to heal the sick that's what you do lord and we're thankful and we're under great expectations tonight lord lord because we know you've shown up and you do not show up without purpose but lord you show up for victory we're here to take it tonight lord we're here to fight because we've got the greatest leader the chief captain lord the prophet would tell us he's never once seen you go into battle that you didn't come packing out the victory and here we are lord it's time for battle and we're expecting nothing but complete and total victory but we ask you now to take control of this service you knew every soul that would be here before the foundation of the world lord this isn't just a church service it's a predestinated moment lord help us to step into the vision as it were to remove ourselves out of the way and let you operate in the way you intended when you foresaw this service i ask you to take control now father of each and every part in jesus name we pray amen [Music] if you'll turn with me in your bibles to first samuel the 17th chapter first samuel the 17th chapter will start at verse 1. very familiar scripture very familiar story will be coming from tonight brother craig it's wonderful to see you and your family god bless you it says now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at shoka which belongeth to judah and pitched between shoka and azika and aphis diamond and saul and the men of israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of elah and set the battle in a ray against the philistines and the philistines stood on a mountain on one side and israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines named goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders and the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam and his spear's head weighed 600 shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him you know i read that and it struck me that was just another man bearing his shield his shield bearer was just another philistine but the one that went before david was almighty god the one that goes before you tonight it's just not another person carrying your shield he is your shield he is your buckler what do we have to fear and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in a ray and not i philistine and you servants to saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me and if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then we will be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall you be our servants and serve us and the philistines said i defy the armies of israel this day give me a man that we may fight together when saul and all israel heard these words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid may god had his blessing as you have your seats tonight i'd like to take a simple thought entitle it challenged now we fight challenged now we fight you know i feel like sometimes that we think that we are waiting on god to move on our behalf in reality god has done all that he needs to do for us he has already paid the price he has already healed the sickness he has already saved our souls and he's waiting on us to respond to the challenge he's waiting on us to step out in faith and do our part brother branham would say time after time that if the lord jesus was here in this very suit tonight he couldn't do no more for you than what he's already done he's already met the challenge he already knew what you would go through he's already provided for the situation that you're in tonight and we're sitting back going god move god move and he's saying no son i've already done it for you you move you step out tonight you do your part you come out the boat and walk on the waters that thing's not going to harm you because i've already taken care of this situation and so he's waiting on us to take a stand he's waiting on us to take a step and ever since the fall in the garden of eden that's how it's been man has had to battle the enemy for every inch of ground we know that that the enemy came to eve and with his lies he deceived her and she fell and then in turn adam also fell and because of this fall all of mankind was sold into sin relationship with god and fellowship with god they were all cut off they weren't how they once had been brother branham says that then angel battles come down to earth and they become human battles he said that satan come to destroy what god had created he said the battle came to earth and it began in us and it has been raging ever since i'm telling you church the battle that started it has been raging ever since it is a daily battle it is a daily struggle sometimes we don't know how we're going to take the next step but let me tell you tonight how we're going to take the next step we're going to take it through the power of the lord jesus christ we're going to take the next step because we win we're going to take the next step because satan don't have enough tonight to stop you it doesn't matter what he's put you through he's not going to stop you you are predestinated you are anointed to overcome you are predestinated and anointed for this moment he cannot stop us but man's position became a contested position and even though everything that was lost it was restored there at calvary brother brown would say every redemptive promise of god was restored back to us we still must constantly fight for it it's been restored but you're gonna have to fight for it down through the ages every man that has ever obtained anything from god has fought for it he has put his shoulder to the wheel he's put on the armor of god he's gone to battle and he's fought for everything he's ever gotten every man that ever overcame every man that was ever healed every man that ever received the baptism of the holy ghost they fought for it they fought for it they went to war for it it was a constant battle of faith it constantly is at war and it's not going to be any different in your life tonight church you see something that belongs to you you see a promise you see something that that god has restored to us and you say that's mine i'm gonna go get it and i agree with you it is yours and you do have rights to it but you're gonna have to fight in order to obtain it you gotta be ready to fight not only to get it but you're going to have to fight to keep it when you get your healing the devil is going to come tell you you didn't get your healing when you get delivered he's going to tell you that you're not delivered when you come and you want salvation he's going to say you can't get it and then when you are saved he's going to say nothing really happened you're gonna have to fight for everything god has given you and then you're gonna have to fight to keep it church this isn't a picnic but we are in a battle we're in a battle and there's a challenge that's gone forth who will come out and fight this enemy who will face the goliath who will face the god of this evil age i believe i'm looking at people tonight that's willing to step out into the valley willing to face the enemy and say i'll go because i've heard a call i know who i am and i know what belongs to me brother branham says now remember he gave them the land but they had to fight for every inch of it god told joshua everywhere the souls of your feet sets that i give you footsteps meant possession now to you people that was prayed for all of you last night was here somebody laid hands on you and we prayed the presence of the lord came down revealed himself right with the word so to show that it was true he's here there's no fooling there's no mistake it's here it's the truth we don't presume anything else we lay aside reasonings we cast them down we take the word we take the word and move on the word said so now you say then the promise is mine sure but you'll fight every inch of it to your will you'll take you'll take every step of it it's a battle the promise is yours that was a promised land they had to fight to get every step of it and the promise is yours tonight but you'll fight for every inch of it i was called by god to preach the gospel 31 years ago and i fought ever since every inch of ground i fought with the sword of god taking the promise and cutting away oh brother aaron i'm surrounded tonight just cut away and take another step ah there are thousands of devils cut away tonight and take another step swing your sword tonight don't leave it in the sheet but swing the sword and if that don't get you far enough swing it again and swing it again and swing it again and keep swinging till freedom's yours heal is yours deliverance is yours every promise is your swing to sword tonight church man has had to fight for every inch of ground satan challenging them at every turn constantly in your ear you don't deserve it you can't attain it you can't receive it and satan is determined more than ever now on this last day to fight you to lie to you to battle against you to keep you from attaining all that god has promised for you in their last days listen we didn't get all the way down here to the end and satan goes you know what they're right they keep telling me i'm defeated they keep telling me they're healed i'm just going to back off no it's not going to be that way listen i was sitting there praying with my dad in the hospital the other day and he looked at the app at me and he said the devil just don't quit does he no he don't but neither does my god my god don't quit and his people don't quit and his anointed don't quit and we keep going and we keep fighting and we keep pressing on because our god is greater greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so let him do his worst let him come let him fight but somebody's going to take his head off tonight [Applause] so he's going about now like a roaring lion he knows his time is short and he's going to challenge you and he's going to fight you and he's going to scream and he's going to kick all the way down you're going to be tested your faith is going to be tried your courage is going to be proved listen he challenged jesus he challenged the apostles he had challenged every great man down through the ages he challenged brother branham he's going to challenge you brother branham says and as it was then so it is now that when god's people starts to go to do something the enemy always has a challenge he's always going to challenge you for it but let me tell you something we're fighters we're not quitters we're the kind of people that even if we've been punched and beat and knocked down and kicked and dragged and we're gonna sit down in the corner and we're sitting there like a boxer between rounds and they're putting the water on your face and they're giving you instructions you know when that bell rings if you stay sitting right there the fight's over if you stay sitting right there they say he didn't answer the bell but obtain the bell ring and somebody's coming out the corner somebody's coming to the middle of the ring and somebody's gonna keep fighting somebody's gonna keep going somebody can take the devil's best points and say is that all you got i'm coming out the corner tonight i'm answering the bail the fight's still on we're just now reaching the championship rounds come out the corner and answer the bear answer the bell tonight i say challenge accepted somebody says challenge accepted we're fighters [Music] january 4th 2020. i've been struggling with some health issues in my body and i received a text from brother ron spencer said take courage buddy we are fighters january 13 2020 barely a week later i found out about his cancer diagnosis and i wrote him a text just trying to encourage him and we're praying believing god has moved for you before he'll do it again just simple text and he wrote back one sentence inspiration for what i'm even preaching tonight he wrote back and said goliath has shown up now we fight goliath has shown up in your life your life has shown up on your promises your lies have shown up in your field in your house and your children go out to showed up with depression and sickness i say now we fight now we fight i'm not giving in i'm not backing up i'm not sitting in the tent listening to your goals listening to your lies but now we fight in the name of the lord go for it comedian tonight meet him right there in the valley and take his head off it's time that the hearties of the living god answer the veil answer the talents you've been challenged now we fight [Music] sure satan has a challenge he always has but god always has somebody he can put his finger on that will answer the call he's always had somebody that would answer the bell just like satan didn't get all the way down here to quit i can tell you one thing i didn't get all the way down here to quit i didn't get all the way down to the end time that right before the rapture of the church down in the seventh age the rapture raised the bride age the lay of the sea and age i didn't get all the way down here just to quit we didn't come all this way through many dangerous toils and snares just to give up here in the last day listen some of you he's been telling you for 30 years you wasn't gonna make it some of you he's been telling you for years you is going to give up he's been telling you you're not going to make it you're not good enough you're going to quit you're going to quit you're going to quit some of you all need to look at him in the house tonight and say i'm still here i'm still here you've been telling me that a long time but devil i'm still here i'm still fighting i haven't went nowhere yet and i'm not going anywhere each time soon except in a rapture except for victory telling tonight i'm [Applause] [Music] god has got a people that is willing to rise to the challenge of this hour willing to face the enemy and say get off my property get out of my life give me my health back give me my joy back give me my victory back listen it ain't just for preachers it ain't just for deacons it ain't just for singers listen it's for it's for teenagers it's for housewives it's for boys and little boys and little girls it's for everybody in the sound of my voice it is for you that victory is for you that deliverance is for you that healing is for you that salvation is for you that devil is a liar you have not gone too far you wouldn't be here tonight he wouldn't be taking on your heart if you've gone too far but you're right where you were supposed to be he saw you here before the foundation of the world and he said answer the call answer the challenge it's for you [Applause] we've got to be more like israel israel don't take with allowing trespassers one footstep into their property one rocket launched one attack and they said we retaliate we're going to fire back it's time some of y'all picked up the rocket launcher of the word and fired one right back at him too long we took shells too long we took bombardment too long we sat there and listened and we began to listen and believe that's the problem that's the problem this to me faith comes by hearing but doubt comes by listening as well you can't constantly give your ear to the enemy and then expect to overcome it uh you've got to turn your ear away and when he lobs a lie at you just lob it right back at him get that rocket launcher and fire one right back and say no this is my territory that's my border i believe it was brother andrew glover said draw a line in the sand and if he near dares come across it just launch one i'll tell you what if he even gets too close to it go ahead and launch one at him he deserves it anyway just go ahead and launch one at the enemy tonight fire one adam protect your land too many times we're facing the things we're facing because we didn't do anything because we waited too long because we didn't think it was that big a deal listen he doesn't belong in your land it's your land therefore it belongs to you he has no right there it doesn't matter where he is it doesn't matter what part of the land he's on it doesn't matter if he's just out there in the outskirts it doesn't matter if he's just barely nibbling at your joy barely messing with your peace just a little bit barely trying to disrupt your home just a little bit and you're going that's not that big a deal it is a big deal because that's not all he wants that's not all he's after he's just looking for a foothold he's looking for an opportunity to come in and destroy to rob to kill to take everything god promised you if he's even trying to touch a little bit of my promise i say blast him i say take the word and go on the offensive tonight and run him clear out of the country run him out i don't know why this has came to my mind but i used to tell my kids the story of three little pigs and jackson loves it and the story ends with the last thing you saw was the big bad wolf running over the farthest hill and he never came back again but too many times we just run him out a little bit and go that'll do i mean no taste that big bad wolf out of the country chase him until he's too far away keep him on the run keep him going stay on his trail sinking go after him let him have no peace tonight [Applause] amen don't minimize the devil's presence in the land because you seem you deem the situation no big deal it is a big deal i've said this before let's simplify it because sometimes was that that big a deal and did brother branham really mean that and he says listen if it's in the word if it's in the message brother browning was here for a short period of time there's eleven hundred and something sermons on tape if god deemed it important enough to take up space on one of them tapes in the short amount of time he was here it's a big deal if he deemed it important enough to put it in this word i don't care if it's one word to it it is a big deal quit minimalize it just because it ain't a big deal according to what you think it's a big deal and if he's trespassing on your land even if it's the edge of your land it's still trespassing don't dismiss the issue and act like nothing's happening don't wait till he's inside your house to try to deal with it don't wait till your family is in danger go after him now go after him tonight leave no doubt where you stand we're too passive you know it would do wonders for your children to see daddy go to war with the devil it would do wonders for your marriage for your spouse to see you go to war for the marriage vow you made years ago it would do wonders for your family if you would take to take down the goliath that's haunting your life instead of just dealing with it and making excuses for it because it sets a trend and it sets a cycle daddy lived with it daddy never overcame it i guess i'm not going it's like i try to tell people don't let those family cycles follow you don't let those family cycles bring you down i say all the time it ran in my family until it ran into me it ran in my family until it ran into me listen you go to the doctor and they want to know all about your daddy's health all about his health issues and your family health issue why that way they can take something and pin it on you oh you're probably going to have this here let me tell you something a little bit about the history of my father my father overcame death he overcame hell he overcame the grave my father is a mighty conqueror he is victorious none can stand before him none can stand before him that's my family history that's my family history let me tell you about him he is almighty he is powerful he is glorious he is savior he is healed he's coming back from me that's my father that's my history hallelujah stand up for what yours be the leader of your home have a backbone come on now stand up against that makeup coming into your house stand up against the tight clothes stand up against the hours and hours of worthless movies and things stand up against those things come on face the challenge it's not easy it's never easy stand up and face it tonight it's not easy but eternity's worth it i say eternity's worth it your family is worth it your soul's worth it take a stand take a stand and fight tell that devil you're not going to rule me brother branham says i'm telling telling you it sent the rock to the killing place and down went goliath you know what happened then the israelites took courage in a way they went they cut philistines plum to the walls it just takes one person that's got enough courage to step out and say it's right and god said so brother you'll down a goliath and your whole family will go to cut cutting philistines the first thing you know is make this a family affair make it a family affair go out there and start cutting some philistines heads off start doing some overcoming start being victorious hallelujah what a mighty god we serve what an awesome god we sir there is a people a chosen people called for this day called to stand and satan has stepped out in this age and declared his great challenge satan says i've made this world too easy to evil i've made it too evil i'm too powerful i filled the world with doubt i filled this world with fear there's not going to be any overcomers you're not going to rapture there will not be a victorious church you will not receive the baptism of the holy ghost but judging by some of the things people are preaching and teaching today a lot of preachers agree with the devil he's challenging anointed services he's challenging the moving of the spirit he's challenging the creating of an atmosphere that allows those births to take place trying to rob the life right out of services against worship against the moving of the holy spirit listen that's why jude had to say there in the first verse beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints it was already they were already coming in they were already trying to change it they were already trying to formalize it listen that's a great challenge in this day it is a great challenge that the devil would come in and try to formalize things jude says contend for it fight for it challenge accepted now we fight we will not stand for that in evening light tabernacle we're not going to stand for some formalized religion we got to fight for it we can't let it slip away we can't let man's ideas come and twist it up listen we got to learn from the mistakes of the past ages from from the past moves of god at the very first age in the ephesian age the wolves came in with that nicolaitan spirit and they began to try to formalize things and already do away with the experience of pentecost that had just come only a few short years before that they tried to do away with that and at first it was called their deeds but very shortly it became their doctrine it became the doctrine and it began to rob the life out of it to where each church age got more and more formal more and more formal listen it's time we square our shoulders back i don't care who it offends i'm not here to offend anybody or preach against that's not what i'm doing i'm just saying square your shoulders back and say not on my watch it's not going to happen on my watch that's some cold formal denominational spirit listen to nomination is it some church name somewhere with soup suppers on tuesday night and family no denomination is a spirit and it tries to come in and tries to rob the life out of a church and i say no no sir not today satan not in this church not in this bride not in this revival it's our time it's our time listen you ain't gonna take away the opportunity of my children to have a backside of the desert old-fashioned tongue-talking lick of fire whoa sound of the russian mighty wind baptism of the holy ghost my kids can have it too and i will fight for it i'll stand for it and i'll answer that bell all day every day [Applause] that's a devil i'm not calling no man or no minister of devil by no means but the spirit that wants to rob the experience out of a church brother branham called it antichrist then so it's antichrist now it hasn't changed look i'll fight for that look that unchurch ordered the leadership of the holy spirit right out of the services can't have no song written after 1957. i don't know why 57 i don't know because that was old every move of the spirit is labeled pentecostal person that that moves and gets excited and maybe they shout and dance and run and we're quick to wonder i wonder if they just got in the flesh i mean i wonder why are you wondering why do you care how about you just taste and see how about you taste it why am i worried about if they got in the flesh that's not my business that's not for me anyone i'm just thankful they're not sitting there dead i'm thankful they're not sitting there asleep i see a young person running around the bed i wish i'd ran around the building a few times when i was a young person i wish i'd have cared enough i wish i'd have been involved enough it blesses my heart every single time i never once i thought i wonder if they're in the what then you obviously are because you ain't caught up in the worship enough to even be where you're worried about who's running around who's worshiping who's doing this i say be free i say be free i say let the spirit move i say if he moves and tells you to run run if he tells you to shout shout just praise the lord praise the lord brother branham said here in the tabernacle we want you all to know these things here when god begins to pour out the holy spirit upon people now notice this is god pouring out the holy spirit when he begins to pour out the holy spirit upon people sometimes i know i've seen people get in the flesh when they were under the anointing of the spirit so notice it's not that the spirit's not on them it's not that the holy spirit didn't pour it out on them he said in other words i've seen them get so excited they didn't know how to contain themselves and they got in the flesh a little bit what's he going to say about that oh he's supposed to blast them they don't want god in the flesh oh they're probably never coming back to the tabernacle i've seen them get in the flesh when they were under the anointing of the spirit i've seen them go to extremes with things but don't you say nothing about it but don't you say nothing about it you respect it what you respect it bow your head you might not understand it neither would i but i want to respect it anyhow we must have respects to god and when god pours out the holy spirit i just say thank you heavenly father you have done something for that poor precious soul and they just want to go to your home like i do someday so if you got a problem with it the prophet gave you pretty basic instructions just bow your head and respect it i love that quote i woke lydia of the night 11 30 listen to this look what i just found out you're going to like it just listen be careful what you criticize church be careful what you run down around your dinner table your child may have a gift of speaking in tongues or any other gift i'm not elevating that specific gift or playing music or being a singer but because they hear you constantly run down the movement of the spirit and run down being free in church they begin to cover that gift up and they develop a complex and that gift is never used for the glory of god and you will answer for it be careful what you run down the moving of the spirit is being challenged the experience of the holy ghost is being challenged our services are being challenged your healing is being challenged your victory's being challenged your deliverance your salvation it's all being challenged and i don't know maybe others have said around for 40 years or 40 weeks or 40 days or 40 hours or whatever it was and they sit there and listen to that and listen to that but i believe i'm looking at a people that say you know what i think i've heard just about enough i think i've heard enough of you running down things i'm telling our young people they can't have the holy ghost of telling me i can't be healed i've heard about enough of it and i'm here tonight to shut your mouth i'm here tonight to answer the challenge listen the problem was saul and his men listen too long they listen too long i'm not gonna listen for 40 days i'm not going to listen for 40 i'm not going to listen for one more minute to the lies of the enemy it is no edification to me it's nothing but lies and it's filled and i say tonight satan i will answer your challenge i'm not listening anymore to you spreading your lies and spreading your fear don't listen another minute listen they're your promises they're yours i believe listen there may be another generation that wouldn't accept it but i believe there's young people today saying that's mine right there i'll take that there's people sitting in this church tonight that say i won't be robbed of my opportunity at a revival i won't be robbed of my healing i won't be robbed of my deliverance if no one else will go i'm going in the valley tonight i'm going down there to meet that devil i'm going to meet that goliath i don't care you can all stay in your tent i'm going down there i'm going to shut him up once and for all in every age he's put forth this challenge in every age the enemy is boasted and in every age god has somebody that would arise to that challenge whether it was in the old testament whether it was down through the seven church ages the enemies always challenged the people of god and most of us were never going to face what they may have faced down through the dark ages different trials different times different people different anointings but we should never forget what those people went through for the sake of the gospel when the enemy roared his boats they stood facing torture they stood condemned to death they stood and they're watching today because they know that they without you can't be made perfect there's going somebody's got to answer the challenge we did it we stood we answered the challenge who down there is going to do it who's going to answer in this day they're counting on you tonight to face that challenge there were men and women burned alive young people who were not who would not recant even though they were tortured even though they were being killed how but then how how did they do it they were anointed for the age they were anointed for that challenge and they rose and they stood and they met the challenge of that day brother branham says but when you think of that little group whose members were sawn asunder fed the lines persecuted and driven from pillar to post and yet stayed true to the word now definitely that would have to be god how they survived their battle of faith and carried on still he says a few weeks ago i walked into the catacombs where old bones and skulls just about that much of them left where saints and martyrs died and i stood in the area where they fed them to lines and everything else and without batting an eye they went to death knowing this that they knew they knew him in the power of his resurrection that someday shaking from there they would come forth as the blood was saints of the living god oh church what a testimony and what about us what about the things we face i say we ought to be able to stand it's a shame if we can't stand it's time we stand because god has always got somebody to put his finger on i say lord here i am put your finger on me lord lead me guide me give me the courage i need to face what i have to face he says you know god always has a remnant of the people that's going to believe him somewhere he always has a remnant someone he can lay his hands on always has always will see every age had its challenge and yet in every age somebody stood and although we're not living in that type of physical persecution and although we're not under that ox anointing as it were that's where we physically have to lay our lives down the challenges that we face are no less real the challenges that we face and spiritually speaking they're no less difficult spiritually speaking this is one of the most challenging hours that man has ever known as a matter of fact you are facing the greatest challenge that believers have ever faced there has never been a more unbelieving age in the age that we live in right now churches around the world are dying and amongst those that do still have church doors open and those that still go to church there are very few that actually believe in the power of a supernatural god a god that'll heal and deliver and save and change your life there's very few that still believe those things no one has faced what this generation has to face when it relates to doubt and as it relates to fear because this is satan's eating it was the very first thing he did in the original even eating as he made them fear he brought fear and it broke that fellowship and once again how many times the people brother and i'm afraid fear fear fear fear fear it's a weapon of the enemy and this age is full of it it's infiltrated this age and it's also the age of unbelief brother branham said in 1964 unbelief is the most horrible thing there is in the world what unbelief he said if you can only take a spiritual looking glass and look into your soul you doubt and you find out what it looks like and the greatest devil the chief of all devils is unbelief the chief of all devils is unbelief the chief of all devils has infiltrated the age of laodicea he's done it in every avenue of our life he's infiltrated schools he infiltrated science he infiltrated entertainment he's infiltrated religion he's infiltrated and permeated everything that surrounds our life it's in the news listen church you must have the seal of god you must have the seal of god in order to stand and meet the challenge in this day i thank god there's been a message that was sent that turned our hearts back to the fathers that lifted up faith and allowed us to the faith of the father to allowed us to stand that has allowed us to meet the challenge without this message there would be no one to rise to the challenge of the age without this message listen we should cherish it we should feed on it we should read it we should listen to it we should take part of it god went through great trouble and he did extraordinary things to make sure you had a message that would deliver a message that would allow you to meet the challenge of the day because satan has taken 6 000 years since the fall of man to study you to find every weakness every temptation that would catch a man's eye every temptation that would attract a woman every vice and every temptation that would appease the flesh and he's figured them all out he's figured them all out exactly he's put it all right here in the closing of time and then he created a society where those things are now looked upon as being okay as looked upon as being good listen i've said it before there's the evil has always been here homosexuality has always been around and sex sins and evil and all these that's always existed but the difference is even going back to when i was a kid those things were done in the haunts and the shadows and in the dregs of society those things weren't done out in the public but now it's become mainstream and you're the oddball if you're against it you're weird if you think something's wrong with it it's come right out in your face and that john has walked right out in the valley right before you and said is there anybody that'll stand against me is there anybody that can call right right and wrong wrong and he's walking right in front of you and in front of your children and he's challenging them saying can any of you stand can any of you resist the temptations and the filth of this world i say yes i say there's a people that can stand i say there's a people that will accept the challenge i'm not going to bend i'm not going to bow i'm not going to back up keep the fire seven times harder o king but we will not bow down we will not give in it is the most evil age and the enemy is making his boast that's right he's come out and openly declared war on you first samuel 17 10 and the philistines said i defy the armies of israel this day give me a man that we may fight together when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid and he boasts i have created an eden that crushes faith 200 million demons released from the river euphrates and they have one target you and he boasts you will not rapture you will not overcome i have torn down the traditional family structures in this last day i have replaced prayer time with social media time i have come in and made everything else of great importance and he boasts anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the united states affecting 40 million adults in the united states 18 and older 17.3 million americans yearly struggle with depression and he boasts one person every 40 seconds will commit suicide and he boasts it is the second leading cause of death among teenagers and he boasts the u.s has 13 million single parent homes 35 percent of downloads from the internet are pornographic 40 million americans say they regularly visit pornography sites 70 of men age 18 to 24 visit a porn site at least once a month one third of all internet porn users are women and he boasts one in every five mobile phone searches is for pornography my kid don't deal with it you better wake up you better be real with yourself not be afraid to meet the challenge not be afraid to deal with things that's coming in the home listen i don't know how to word this exactly it ain't a shame for young people to struggle with things it's a shame that won't nobody stand up and try to help them it's a shame that people won't go to war for them it's a shame people won't fight for them instead they'd rather go i was a good boy i agree with you i believe your boy is the son of god but i believe right now he needs deliverance and the baptism of the holy ghost and i believe parents need to step up and accept the challenge and go to war form and go to prayer for them and not be afraid to fight how many times we have kids come up needing deliverance and they'll be sitting there at the altar and mom and dad don't ever even show up might embarrass my boy if i go up there let me tell you what to be real embarrassing when he turns and looks at you on the day of judgment says why why'd you fight for me why don't you draw your sword he's boasting and he's after you he's after your spouse he's after your children he's after everything we hold dear but somebody's gonna say no not on my watch not on my watch i'm going to fight you tooth and nail i'm going to fight you too i got no fight left in i tell you what look i believe we win but my daddy always told me something when i was in high school he said son if you get in the fight you don't have to win i understand sometimes you lose fights he said but that person better not ever want to fight you ever again he said he better know he's been in a fight and he better say oh i might want let me tell you what it's going to be just that we're going to wear that devil out i'm going to wear him out from one side to the other i'm going to wear him out up and down i'mma give him no rest i'ma give him no peace i guarantee you one thing when he leans here he says i don't ever want to fight those people again i've had enough i've had all i can take i say give him some tonight if he wants something come and take it come and get it challenge accepted i accept the challenge oh you shouldn't talk to the devil that way i am not afraid to talk to the devil that way because i know where i'm standing i know who i am i know what i've been called to do i don't have that saw mentality cause i'm a little bit worried no sir there's a different set of ears here tonight and i say i will accept the talents being put before me tonight i don't care how evil the world is there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle that's thus saith the lord somebody's gonna rise to the challenge because somebody's gonna fulfill that scripture by the way 71 percent of teens admit to hiding all their online behavior from their parents let me tell y'all something that you don't like to hear when it comes to these things your kid is smarter than you sorry they are let me tell you what we got every firewall and every block you can imagine on computers at school and i bet once a week some kids getting in trouble because they don't got around it and looking at things they ain't supposed to i'm talking about stuff it would take a hacker to do and that sixth grader who can't pass english is in there you got to guard the door you got to apply the token list don't nothing come through that door that you ain't aware of that you don't know about listen we're not perfect there's going to be times that things come to your attention it's in your home that make you go what it's going to happen but don't let it become so common that you've become used to it being in your home it should shock you and appall you and make you go to war should make you go to battle make you draw your sword and he boasts and he does this day after day after day chapter 17 verse 16 and the philistine drew near morning and evening and presented himself 40 days and the challenge goes forth who will stand in satan's eden send me a man send me a woman send me a young person send me an old person send me someone is there no one who will stand and fight listen if you think you're just going to sit around in your tent while goliath marches back and forth through your promises and over your valleys and through your heels and robs your joy and rob your victory and you just peek it out the tent and you're just going to stay there to wrap your day and then you're going in a rapture that's not how it works all right those people ain't going to know the rapture happened because their tents closed up they're not even going to know i'm gone they're not even gonna know the battle's been happening in the valley you've gotta come out of the tent you gotta have victory you gotta overcome those things that are tormenting you you were put here to win you were put here to fight this isn't about having a better doctrine than other people and having a better lifestyle than other people it's about overcoming every single devil in hell it's about being victorious it's about being the bride of jesus christ and the bride of jesus christ is not afraid to fight [Applause] well i believe the message brother aaron i know god sent a prophet i had an experience back in 78. awesome i'm glad you did you had one this week have you been in the presence of god lately have you made your call in an election sure have you see have you been seeking that refilling have you been seeking to walk daily in his presence because that's the only way you're going to be able to fight it's the only way you're going to be able to stand look where are the soldiers where are the anointed ones i say it's time that we begin to prophesy to the devil like david did on this day no i'm not going to deal with it tomorrow but david began to prophesy and then he walked into the prophecy that he prophesied he said this day will the lord deliver thee into my hand and i will smite thee and take thy head from thee now notice he didn't just stop there he didn't just promise to speed goliath carcass he says and i will give the carcasses of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel we like to talk about a living god but somebody's going to display into the world somebody's going to say on this day i'm overcoming on this day i'm casting down depression on this day i overcome those sins that have so easily beset me that the whole world may know there is a living god an evening like tabernacle there is an evening there is a living god in tennessee a living god in virginia a living god in connecticut a living god in texas it's not an evening like tabernacle revival it's the bride's revival all over the world he's getting abroad ready to go hallelujah this message came in power and demonstration night after night the devil challenged and night after night he was defeated it showed that satan is powerless before a son and daughter of god listen this message met the challenge this message will meet the challenge this message is power this message is deliverance i don't know i said devil you showed up in the wrong valley tonight you showed up at the wrong church service tonight because there's a different set of ears in the camp tonight these years have heard the word of the lord these ears have heard that they will possess the gate of their enemy these ears have heard that this is how you overcome these ears have heard that they will take a rapture these years have heard that we will not go down in defeat we have heard that the word of god will defeat the enemy any place anywhere anytime under any circumstances you showed up at the wrong place tonight there's got to be somebody to say on this day i will take your head off this challenge to my health it will not go unanswered this challenge to my deliverance it will not go on answer this challenge to my salvation it will not go unanswered goliath has shown up so now we fight you can't let the challenge go on answering listen there's deliverance for everybody not just for young people i'm not picking on anybody but it seems like most of the time when somebody comes up for deliverance it's young people it's always young people no people just sit back there y'all don't have any battles i don't i mean i'm not trying to encourage everybody to run up for prayer that's not what this is about i'm just saying deliverance is for everybody not just for the listen some old folks you know i'll count myself there i messed up before with the whole age thing look you've had your victory stolen for so long you forgot it was gone you don't know any other way than the way you are right now some of y'all never got delivered when you was young and so now guess what young person problems young man problems become grown man problems young girl problems become grown woman problems there's no such thing as well i just grew up so that devil went away oh you gotta have deliverance listen i'll tell some of the young people right now if you don't get delivered of that pornographic or that lust spirit it'll follow right you into your marriage and it'll ruin your marriage it'll destroy your home that lust that follows families if you don't get it dealt with right now to follow you all it don't go away because you're 60. and just because you get married doesn't mean all of a sudden that thing goes away it'll ruin you it's time to get deliverance no matter who you are it's time to get deliverance no matter what age you are it's too late to play church it's too late to have pride it's too late to go up it's too late but i can't go tell them i'm going through that sure you can like i said earlier there's no shame and having lost the battle the shame is sitting there in your in your defeat the shame is when there's deliverance here and the water's troubled and your pride gets in the way of the eternal destination of your soul i'm telling you it's time to meet the challenge tonight quit playing with the thing and cut its head off i don't care if you're 15 25 35 45 55 65 victory can be yours tonight lay your pride aside let what people think the signs say i will meet the challenge i will be free i will be loose to serve god and spirit and truth let me tell you what young folks that's just had an experience with god the lord's been really moving in our young people it stirs my soul to see what he's been doing i mean if you just started your walk goliath's going to show up and he's going to tell you it was nothing he's going to tell you it was just emotion he's going to he's going to tell you that nothing has really happened in your life and if you sit there and you allow him to talk and you begin to listen to him and you begin to reason it out he's going to begin to shake you he'll begin to make you wonder did that really happen listen don't give him time to make his boast when he begins to talk you stand your ground and you meet him with the word you know what happened you were there you know the change that took place you know the way your desires change don't sit there and allow him to talk you out of those things you know the deliverance that you received was real but you're going to have to be willing to fight to keep it because he's going to come back and tell you that you didn't the fight to get free is only the beginning now you got to fight to keep your freedom listen he paid for it brother joe did a wonderful job sunday i found my freedom in you that freedom is available and you grab it you take it but we begin to listen and we begin to get pulled and little by little we give that freedom up no sir not tonight anchor down buckle up meet the challenge meet him in the center of the ring answer the balance i'm not giving it back my deliverance was real my experience was real my holy ghost is real and it will hold me it will hold you tonight but you got to be willing to fight for it i'm going to try to move quickly first samuel 17 23 and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the armies out of the armies of the philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard them i've always loved this i love how brother branham talked about a new set of ears he said there was a new set of ears in the camp and that set of ears tonight belongs to anointed people that set of ears tonight belong to people that have seen god move listen we're not some dead group of people that don't know what it's like to see the power of the supernatural god working these people here have seen the bearer of cancer raise up and they have seen it come down these people here have seen the line of suicide raise up and they have seen that line be slain they have seen that giant of lust raise up and try to take our young people and they have seen the head of that giant come off satan let me give you fair warning tonight this is not just some other denominational group this is not just some man-made move of god these are god's people this is god's bride this is a people ordained of people anointed oh i don't feel anointed brother and that's okay i promise you when david walked out there there wasn't still anointing oil dripping off running down his neck it had happened a long time ago but he knew he knew his experience was real he was there when the anointing happened and he stepped out and tonight satan you've picked the wrong group of people to torment it's time that we torment the tormentor it's time that we bring fear to the one that's trying to put fear upon us let him know we are meeting the talents tonight these are sons of god these are daughters of god these are people that ain't afraid to swing a sword church you are the people you are the people that's got to meet the challenge we can't perpetuate the ages there's not another age to come it's you it's your time you have to do it you are the heroes of faith of the laodicean age you are the called out you are anointed for this challenge and it's important that you recognize more than ever who you are and what you're called for because in knowing who you are in christ you know your position in him and therefore you know what belongs to you listen the problem with saul is saul and his men had forgotten who they were it says in 171 now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at shoka which belonged to judah this was theirs it was their possession but sometimes we forget well i have every right every redemptive promise is mine that's my promise we we have amnesia and the devil's walking all over something that belongs to us and we're just standing up there taking it and saul forgot what he was called to the men forgot what they were called to be that that philistine was in their land on their promise and they forgotten that they were god's people called for this very purpose to drive the enemy out of the promised land to drive the enemy off their land listen that's the same thing you're called to tonight you're called to drive him out of your land off of your promises you're called to torment the tormentor listen at calvary the price was paid you owe the devil nothing you owe him nothing he has no rights to your health he has no right to your mind he has no right to your family he has no rights he has no rights to put those complexes on you that are literally sucking the very life out of you that complex came from the enemy and he has no right to put that on you robbing you of your joy that god intends for you to live and we're not to walk around depressed and beat down the joy of the lord is our strength he batters against you and he brings self-esteem issues he brings feelings of worthlessness feelings of guilt oh why didn't i do things differently i say meet him in the valley tonight and shut his mouth i'm not gonna let the devil torment me on my own land i'm not gonna stand here with him standing in my property in my yard on my promises and let him run his mouth and torment me somebody's gotta say enough is enough is enough you are predestinated to be here for what brother and why am i pronouncing to meet the challenge to meet the enemy look you need to remind the devil tonight that he needed the lord jesus needed somebody to overcome and he chose you you're not very important really because god decided that i must be the i'm the best because he put me in the last age the final voice to the final age and guess what he chose you he chose you god needed somebody to rapture who'd he choose woohoo he chose you and we're gonna let the devil tell us we're not worth very much we're not very good we're not listen god chose the best of the best of the best and he put him here in this last age and i know you're having a hard time doing we're not supposed to build ourselves up we're not god did he told you you were called he told you you were chosen he told you he was you were his bride he said it he said it it's his word and if he says i can be the bride i'm not going to argue with him i'm just going to say yes lord i accept it i'll take what you've given me i accept the calling i accept the challenge if that's what you want me to be lord i accept it tonight i accept all that you have for me lord he chose you brother brown says look i want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers and then in order to have the believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age you see it he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age did you get it did you feel it did you see it do you understand it that's what's happening today he prayed predestinated it to this by his foreknowledge when he predestinated malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and predestined anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so when he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated abroad she's going to be there going to be a rapture she's going to be there he predestinates it by his foreknowledge see there's nothing going to stop it now where's that uncircumcised devil at where's those lies that now he's been telling you he predestinated you to be here to meet the challenge and the prophet of god said there is nothing going to stop it absolutely nothing that devil's been telling me i'm not going to make it does he not realize that the very reason i exist is to make it the very reason i breathe air that very reason i was put on this earth i was put here by almighty god to make it brother aaron am i gonna make it that's why you're here you're gonna make it you are gonna make it that's why he's put you here this isn't some in general thing this isn't well we're going to overcome the challenge of the age well we're going to defeat goliath no it's got to be you you got to be ready because you're going to face your goliath and you're going to have your challenges and your giants you are going to be the one that has to face it you're going to face the enemy but listen you can rest assured that when you do if you do it standing on the word you will be victorious you will win brother brown said many times i've been challenged all over the world and he has backed me up and met the challenge every time and you got to have that same assurance that you know that you know that when you meet the enemy he's going to back you up every single time because let me tell you church you don't know when goliath is going to show up you don't know thinking things can be going pretty well and the next thing you know you're staring at a giant it's never going to be when you expect it it's never going to be when you've planned for it look what the scriptures say about david in verse 17 and jesse said unto david his son take now for thy brethren and ephi of this parched corn and these ten loaves and run to the camp to thy brethren and carry these ten cheeses under the captain of their thousand and look how thy brethren fair and take their pledge david's just going grocery shopping he's just on he taking some cheese he did not wake up that morning and go today's the day going to kill goliath now he's like i gotta kick this cheese and this bread i got delivered there boy i'm just a little errand boy how many times i gotta wash these dishes i gotta fold this laundry i gotta go to work it's just another day i'm tired of teaching middle schoolers they're really getting on my nerves it's just another day it's just another day of laundry it's just another day of mowing the grass and goliath shows up all right well you're telling brother aaron you better be ready that's not the time to get prayed up brother brandon would talk about shamgar he didn't have time to learn how to fight he didn't have time he just got enough he just had enough he just got tired of dealing with it he got tired of being robbed he got tired of the enemy trespassing he got tired and one day they showed up it was just another day it was just tuesday and they showed up our problem is they only brought 600. listen i know we say it a lot it's one of my favorite things the devil ain't got enough if he'd had enough he'd have sent enough but he sent 600 and guess what it wasn't enough goliath wasn't enough the lion's den wasn't enough the red sea wasn't enough and whatever he sent in your life tonight let me tell you it is not enough he does not have enough because me and god is a majority you and god is a majority there's more for us than there is against us but there's 200 million million i don't care it ain't enough to stop the bride of jesus christ from going in this rapture he don't have enough but goliath wasn't enough even though it was just a grocery run it wasn't in some powerful youth camp it wasn't in some powerful service he was taking bread and cheese to his brethren but we never get to choose when our battle comes we never get to choose when it's our turn but you're gonna have a turn you can't just go along look in the part act in the part play in the part and think you're gonna make it because there comes a day when looking the part playing the part acting apart ain't gonna stand up to goliath there's a reason saul couldn't face because his experience wasn't up to date if you're having a hard time facing your giants where's your experience at david could walk out there in confidence he didn't bat an eye because he had experience upon experience upon experience and it was fresh it was a fresh experience can't play the part can't just act the part saul had the army looking good if you looked out there you said that's a tough army really they ain't come out of their tents in 40 days because they're scared of one guy but he had them looking good their armor was shined up they knew all the restored doctrines they knew all the message terminology they knew all the buzzwords they had eagle belt buckles and 270s galore but not enough faith to pray for a toothache not enough faith to stand there when they're challenged and called out get to the point where the only thing that the ministry becomes in some places is to bash other ministries saul you need to repent because there's a reason that your church your army is still stuck in the tent and they hadn't went down it took somebody from somewhere else that had an up-to-date experience to come in and show them how it was done are you talking about from i'm not talking about nothing i'm saying if your experience is up to date you can face the enemy that's what i'm saying saul had them knowing the doctrines but one day goliath walked out look you can watch others all you want go through things you can say all the right things we can have faith for others we can say i'm praying for you i'm sorry this is going on everything's going to be okay and you understand they're going through a battle but brother when it's you facing the devil when it's your turn all those little cute sayings and things don't really mean a whole lot it does coming from other people i'm talking about your lips you better know the word you better be ready to stand for the word you better be ready to fight because when it's your turn and you are the one that has to walk down into the valley then where are you gonna be then what are you gonna do you better go back to the word that's what david did he went back to the word he came to him in the word what does the word say tonight by his stripes i'm healed you can have perfect peace love casteth out fear i can have the holy ghost i will overcome meet him right there in that moment with that word do it day one don't let him talk listen day one was the best opportunity that all them men had there to kill goliath if they would have went out on day one there were thousands of men there that had the opportunity to be the champion of israel they were given every opportunity and of all those thousands there there's very few of them who you know their name because men of courage leave legacies men of courage leave behind a legacy and they left behind nothing but an army that was scared to face the enemy that's what we know of them day one was their best opportunity the very first time he made his challenge every one of them there were seat of abraham all of them called all of them chosen to possess the land and yet fear gripped them i believe that any man in that army if they would accepted the challenge and went out there to fight and met the goliath in the name of the lord the same way that david did they would have been victorious but they had listened so long to the lie of the devil that they began to believe his lies oh i'm not going to make it oh i'm not good enough i am just a nobody oh i'm just a new christian but there and you don't understand i'm just a new christian listen david had been in the army five minutes he was as new a recruit as you could possibly be green and he went and killed goliath it's not about how long you've been here it's not listen if you just gave your heart to the lord while ago while i was preaching then you have the authority and the power to face any devil of hell and overcome him right now you can face any enemy you can face him and stand on the word of god and you will win church what am i telling you tonight go out and face the enemy meet the challenge you will be victorious but as long as you stand back in fear as long as you stand at the tent as long as you're willing to let the devil come and disrupt your home and come in and bring sickness and fear and unbelief you will not live in victory you will continue to live in the torment of the enemy saying you can't you can't you can't even like tabernacle you can you can because he did he's already won that victory for you he's trying to keep you in your tent tonight but i say goliath has shown up and now we must fight listen to bring this down to a close right now church tonight you are the winner listen to me you are the winner you are the army of the living god and you can not lose listen you must accept the challenge because you are the only ones who can accept the challenge because you hold the promise oh brother aaron but i can't yes yes you can the prophet of god says the hour is close at hand they don't need to do anything else but go to work give them material whatever is in their hand some might sing some might preach some might testify we don't know but what's ever in their hand sampson only had the jawbone of a mule but he slayed a thousand philistines chamber had the ox go and the philistines was coming he didn't have time to train to know how to fight the spirit of god come on him he took the ox goat that was in his hand and he beat down hundreds of philistines david had a slingshot goliath had challenged but god was with the slingshot oh i'm so unimportant i'm so unworthy i don't have much all i've got this little slingshot it's okay if god is in the slingshot he will direct that rock right to the killing place every single time the problem is too many of us are leaving the rocks in our pocket and the sling in our take it out tonight and just begin to twirl it begin to try by his stripes i'm healed by his stripes i'm healed he sent his word and healed them the promise is unto them to as many as let it go tonight let the arm of faith take control god is with the slingshot turn it loose one time and see what happens turn it loose one time oh but brother aaron he's roaring tonight he's roaring tonight he told me i'm gonna die he told me i'm never gonna be free of depression he told me i'm never gonna have peace listen the closer you get to victory the louder the boast of the enemy will become the closer david got out there the more he boasts and the more he challenged the more he got out there the more he tried to bring fear the more he tried to bring unbelief that just means you're right there at it don't stop don't turn around now it's nothing but a bluff keep pressing towards it keep marching at it keep going there he's look the angel the lord is just looking for somebody tonight to pick up a stone somebody tonight to pick up a promise and to put it in the slingshot of faith and turn it loose one time for your healing for your deliverance for your salvation for your loved one meet the challenge tonight oh you're right there at it don't back up don't back down push through break through oh goliath threatened more than ever he said and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy in a fair countenance in the philistines said to david am i a dog that thou cometh to me with stays and the philistine cursed david by his gods and the philistines said to david come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beast of the field reminds me every time a demon is about to get cast out how they begin to try to run their mouth they begin to try to say things and snarl and try to bring fears because they're about to come out it's because their head's about to come off and the goliath begins to boast and bring fear i say challenge accepted i say challenge accepted tonight what's it matter brother aaron if i'm struggling with this what's the matter nobody else knows it's only me not true it affects everybody in this building it affects everybody look what happened when david killed goliath what happened musicians you can come i'm finishing right here your life your victory your battles matters to me it matters to the person next to you matters to everybody in this building because david hit him right between the eyes and he went down and he goes over there and he picks up this sword that's too heavy for him he raises it up over his head and then he just lets it fall and he grabs that head he lifts it up over his head he turns and shows it to all those children of israel that had been too afraid to come into the valley on their own they had been too afraid to overcome that depression they had been too afraid to face that anxiety too afraid that they were going to be struck down with lust the rest of their life too afraid they couldn't receive the baptism of the holy ghost and he turned around and he showed the entire congregation and he said if i can do it brothers and sisters if i can do it if i can overcome my fear if i can overcome my anxiety if i can overcome my trial overcome this so can you so can you you can be victorious tonight you can win tonight and right then all the brothers and sisters drew their sword and they charged into the valley and brother branham said they chased them into the corner and they slaughtered philistines your victory matters tonight your victory matters tonight i say goliath has shown up now we fight challenge accepted challenge accepted i'm watching i'm watching and when you kill him lift his head up for me to see can't let this head up for me to see oh hallelujah it does something to me to see a young person get free it does something for me to see an old person get free lift his head up tonight let the world know i have accepted the challenge no more will he come in and torment me but tonight i'm coming out my tent i'm going into the valley and now we fight it's what sons and daughters of god do we don't back up brother brown says they don't know what retreat means we're going forward tonight church we're going forward there will be victory there will be deliverance there will be healing and ultimately there will be a rapture there will be a rapture i'm going home to be with my lord i'm going home to be with my lord the greatest victory ever is when i leave this body and i step into immortality but between now and then i know with that devil up one side and down the other he will have no peace in my home he said he wasn't gonna let my home have peace no sir you come into my house you will have no peace i will torment you i will fight you i will kick you i will call you will never want to fight me again i say let
