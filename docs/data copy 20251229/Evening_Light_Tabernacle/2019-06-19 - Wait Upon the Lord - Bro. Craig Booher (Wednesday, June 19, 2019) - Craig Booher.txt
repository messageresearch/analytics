not I'm not hearing out of it so if you could go ahead I don't want to blast anyone back here but I'm going to need the monitors tonight it's good to be in the house of the Lord let's turn in our Bibles if we can to Psalms chapter 37 verse 34 Psalms chapter 37 verse 34 I'd like to read down I see here make sure I get the right the right scripture here just second I see chapter 37 verse 7 I'm sorry a second there we go okay yeah I've got my scripture mixed round here just a second yeah Psalms 37 verse 7 it says rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass cease from anger and forsake wrath and fret not thyself in any wise to do evil for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the earth and I want you to go down to verse 34 it says wait on the Lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shalt see it I want to preach tonight on wait upon the Lord and I would like to subtitle my message tonight on exalted to inherit the land may God bless the reading of his word you can have your seats I want to take my time this evening Moses his whole Commission his whole purpose his entire ministry was to take the people out of Egypt and bring them into the land of promise and to a land that flowed with milk and honey and I'd like to read in Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 1 referring to a lot of scriptures tonight if you want to write those down deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 1 they said all the commandments which I command thee this day you shall observe and do that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your father's and thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness to Humble them to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffered the to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knowest not and neither did the fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord death man live dine raiment wax not old a palm be and neither did thy foot swell these 40 years thou shall also consider in thine heart that is a man Chason at the Sun so the Lord chasing at thee therefore thou shalt keep the commandment of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to fearing for the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land a land of Brooks of water in the fountains and of depth that spring out of the valleys and the hills a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates in a land of oil and oil olive and honey a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scare sness and thou shalt act that shall not lack anything in it a land whose stones are earned and out of those whose hills thou mayest big brass and when thou has eaten and thou art full then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given you what a wonderful place this was what a wonderful the nation that the exodus was but you know in order to get there Moses had to have patience because it was only a four days journey out of Egypt a four-day journey that would take 40 years and you find that Moses had to have patience he had to have patience with the people who did not understand what God was doing that did not understand the way that God had led him and the people had become impatient they beat the Bible said they become impatient because the way was hard and they didn't understand why a good God that loved him that would call him out of bondage that would call him out of slavery what God would lead them into a wilderness of sin a land a wilderness where and wherever they turned there was no water there was no food there everything was the rough way and that's the way God's Way is you find the people misunderstood and Moses he had to wait for the land that God promised him he had to be patient with the people and he had to wait for the people to catch the vision and he said now that Moses he said I give you the land I give every bit of it to you it is yours I give you the title deed you your name is on the deed but when they got there they found the whole land was swarming with Giants and Hittites and parasites and Philistines had and they begin to faint because of the size of the Giants that was on their god-given land and they begin to cry with a glass how person aside and and die maybe God didn't look at that detail that try and fill this land and we are not warriors we're simple family people we can't take and the people brother madam said the problem was not with the promise of God the promise was with the mixed multitude because caleb rose up and stilled the people and said they're bred for us we are more than able cuz God said so but it was the mixed multitude that calls to everyone to be upset and to begin to question whether the land was really for them or not how many knows that that was a type and shadow of the day that we're living in and then this message is to bring us into a land of promise and beautiful promises of God and to the full Pentecostal power into the full character of Christ into the full love of God this message is to bring us here to embody change it is an exodus out of out of unbelief into true faith it is an exodus out of artificial Christianity into the real genuine experience but the call come out of her brought a mixed multitude and we got to be patient in these times you're writing it down Psalms 37 verse 3 said trust in the Lord and do good and thou shall dwell in the land verily thou shalt be fed Psalms 27 verse 13 said I have fainted unless I believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage heal strengthen your heart wait I say on the Lord you know a lamb all he does is follow the shepherd all the llamas got to do is faithfully follow and the and the Shepherd will leave you man but when we begin to question the promises of God and begin to become impatient with the promises of God then we find ourselves in trouble as brother Branham said impatience is one of the great ruins of our American heritage because everyone is in a hurry every one of us we wake up we go to work we race to the day we race back home and it's just like a busy hamster wheel he said everybody is in a hurry people flying around you he said pressure is because it's a neurotic age and everything is under pressure and we've got to meet certain criteria we got to make certain demands and you know all of our easy livin we just cram more into a life of easy living turn our minds can't even keep abreast or keep up with the demands of society and social media communicate with 15 different people at one time and it's pressure and brother branham said even Christians are under pressure and he said what pressure dances make us make decisions that we normally would not make if we were not under pressure it makes us snap but one another it makes us you know keyed up and and in a hurry and I just want to get it behind me and brother branham said if satan can get you pressured you're just about whipped and he said our age is an erotic age why he said because god is left out and when we become impatient with our daily life when we become impatient even in our own little world that we live and we begin to leave God out of our decisions and leave God out of our daily life when we leave him out then we become impatient and we begin to do things that normally we wouldn't do brother Branham said after 31 years of ministry after the toils of the field I want to make my testimony to this and I've seen disappointments I've seen the time where I asked things I cried for things I bet for things and I didn't get them but if you wait patiently upon God then know that it works exactly right it'll come out exactly right if I wait patiently upon the Lord how many I would love to say lord help me not to be impatient help me to wait upon you every day writing it down in Hebrews chapter 6 verse 11 he says and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself surely his blessing I will bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise how wonderful notice this Abraham was given an immutable promise by God that could not God could not go back it was an unconditional promise meaning no matter what happened whatever he faced no matter what Abraham is gone to enhance this promise but we find that Abraham is sitting on a barren land Locke took the wet water plays and Abraham as brother Peter said Sam is cranky that day because Lot's wife is down there were the caravans all the new hats and all the new bonnets and hell all those things in this godforsaken desert flies are in my kitchen that creaky step is driving me crazy Abraham had to fix it I'm so sick and tired air conditioning the flats on the tent ain't even working right they don't even open zipper stuck my kitchen it's hot in here flies are everywhere talking about a promise son I've heard it 25 years there's a reason why Abraham was on the outside of the tent [Applause] Abraham learned he had lots a good communion out there but the backside of the desert what day as he waited he grew stronger I'm not giving up he's gonna come he swore by himself he looked at one day they saw three men coming brother branham said he kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere they said when he looked the men had deft on their clothes as they were walking I love the way God operates he could have just passed it off is another day it's another pilgrim that's another Wednesday night service just another day but he was spiritual and he knew one day that church would service would be different one day God would come by himself and he was faithful brother Branham said he run out to meet him Bible said because thou has kept the word of my patience he said that word he said why the word patience after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you see the Spirit is speaking about the word to wait for the fulfillment of that word requires patience as it did in the case of Abraham he enjoyed seeing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word was finally fulfilled and this is the way God teaches his people patience see if he fulfilled the word in a physical manifestation the very instance you pray you had never learned patience but you would become more impatient with life he said let me show you the truth of this so he goes into a Joseph how until the time that the word came the word of the Lord hiding so meaning though God gave Joseph a promise he had to patiently wait for that promise to come to pass and then God gives us exceeding precious promises his promise to fulfill every word and from the time we pray till the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patience and ourselves for only of patience do we possess life may God help us to learn this lesson he said we read the history of lives of great Christians and what a contrast we see between their lives who is so patient and so quiet and today we are so overcome with impatience and haste God has sent us a message that will bring us right into the rapture God has sent us a message that will bring us into the body change he has restored the word and with the restoration of the word he will restore all power to his people can you say man and it's at those times that we are believing the Lord that we must be certain of God you must be convinced that this word come from Almighty God you must be confessed that the Prophet is the prophet of Malachi 4 you must be convinced in yourself because if you're not you're gonna fall when the trial comes or when the delay comes so you must be certain in your heart just as certain as Abraham was and would you believe it then take a deep hole don't you back off fall to that word don't let nothing move here and know that this word is going to change your body this word is gonna heal your body this word it's gonna come inside of you and materialize hey man but God loves to test us do you believe that God loves to test us in the trials then it brings her faith to a showdown brother Branham said every son that cometh to God must be tried and he said if you get a little heartache after you're born again a little trial upsets you somewhere you run back to the world it shows you wasn't a child to begin with if any man wants anchors in his heart his heart against Calvary all the Devils in hell will never shake him notice he cannot stand test Iseman he is illegitimate if he claims that God is his father then he's not tossed about with every wind of doctrine he's not thrown about with every trial that comes he's not in one day and out the next he is stable he is that fast he has short put it he has a foundation that doesn't move when we get in a hurry we miss gone when we get impatient we miss God I want you to notice this brother Brennan said I think many a good man have done it he said you get too much in a hurry and you want to do it yourself many a man they go out impatient believing that the time yeah and they tried to do it within yourself wait upon the Lord for they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength see Sara doubted that's what she laughed at the pen she doubted the supernatural birth she became impatient and she tried to help God out so when she tried to help God out she chose Hagar she goes to the same church and you know I mean it's spiritual why don't ever have be with her and we will call that the promised son and put this behind us and you find when she gave Hagar and Abraham's bosom she brought forth Ishmael which was a wild man an untamed man like a wild man running to the desert his hand was against every man she brought forth a persecutor of the world because every time we tried to pick something with the Word of God it produces death it produces chaos this isn't the promise ishmael become the muslim rice and he's a persecutor who fights against all man you watch the spirit of it claims to be the seed of abraham but a final because Sarah could not wait on God and she wanted to produce it in her own strength this is the natural seed versus the supernatural seed so two seeds are fighting against each other but the Bible tells us to wait upon the Lord can you say man she Sarah produced a loud man but what did God produce when she waited finally that man came and he said I will visit you according to the time of life saris milk veins were tried she had a hump in her back her hair was gray her her throat her voice was weak but when God visited her all the sudden the milk veins came back the heart started pumping right the womb became fertile the hair became black again the sparkle came into the eye her body began to change when she waited on the promise how many say Lord don't give me a substitute let me wait on the promise of the Lord she looked at Abraham Abraham was spending their six-pack V Sara hey his chin Scott he's rippling with muscles head to foot I'm feeling good this morning you're looking at this morning so are you Sara because the time came where God was going to change those helpless bodies into something he could use you know there was absolutely nothing that Abraham and Sara could give that's exactly the way God wanted he loves to take something that it's nothing and make something out of it he never asked us to produce a rapture he never asked us to produce a revival he never asked us to produce Christianity he asked us to believe his word and receive his word and let him live it through us I'm gonna say Lord live it through me pulsated my I live in my thoughts live in my life [Music] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength Abraham renewed his strength Samri nudist strength they mounted up on wings like eagles strengthened from the inside out how many say Lord start with me tonight you know God wanted to bless Israel and God just hovered over them over the pillar of fire he busied himself he fed them with manna he gave them water from the rock everything they needed he provided their clothes who never got old their feet never got sore God healed all of their diseases and one day brother Branham said they got to looking at their neighbors and they wanted to be king like they had brother Branham said God was going to give them a king in the person of Jesus Christ and he said and he said but he said they were in a hurry and he said God was going to humanize himself in the person of Christ but they got ahead of God and Satan put in their heart to get ahead of the Lord Wow the devil put in their heart to get ahead of God's program and Samuel said you don't want to do it he'll make your children slaves he'll actually put you in bondage you'll serve a man you don't want to be like the other nations you want to be something different and they refused the counsel of Samuel and you find that God raised him up the king by the name of Saul brother Donnie preached a masterpiece on that one night about the Unser endured heart and he said Saul went out and was waiting on Samuel Samuel didn't come yesterday and then and the people were shaking in their boots because the Philistines and you'll find that when Samuel was just a bit late what happened with Saul women begin to sacrifice unto Lord and brother branham said as soon as he did it it took the leadership from God and put it on a man and as soon as it did the Prophet turned us back and God turned his back and he said he will every denomination that turns away the Spirit of God he said God will turn his back on it God will turn his back on us if we reject the spirit brother Branham said give God time God is in no hurry we're the ones that get in a hurry just give God a little bit of time you'll see those prophetic wheels and cogs come right up it'll develop like a picture you know the Bible tells us though Jesus was a son yet he learned obedience to the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto them that obeying in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering according to Paul he was left his church a measure of suffering that they to by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer terrain the reason for this is character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can train because power apart from character satanic but power with character his fit to rule and since he wants to share even his throne on the same basis he overcame and has sat down on his Father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him this little temporary suffering that we go through now it's not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that is to be revealed when he comes oh the treasures that are laid up for those that are willing to enter into the kingdom through much tribulation Peter said think it not strange concerning fiery trials that is to try you see that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants to develop christ-like character that comes through suffering we all have trials we all are tried and chasing the sons not one but goes through it the church that is not suffering that it's not being tried is not of God for whom the Lord loves us he chastens Jesus learned obedience to the things that he suffered if you watch the model of Jesus bear with me tonight if you watch the way Jesus handled himself as a lamb of God when Pilate inquired and had him scourged you never seemed glare at Pilate you never see him lose his temper he was always calm and collective his faith was unconscious faith undisturbed faith he carried himself like a Lamb of God through the trials he never fought back he always looked to God knowing that the trial come from God Paul said be patient in tribulation patient him and suffering enduring and waiting with the determination they say Lord give me a determination in the heart he said because your tribulations worketh patience and that's why John and the olive practise said I John your brother and companion in tribulation in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ John was preaching the gospel John was the word made manifest and it stirred the region's till they thought we can't have this man in our society he's a witch because the power of God moves around him so they tried to kill him brother Branham said they tried to burn the Holy Ghost out of him and when they put him in a vat of oil the power of God protected it amen he's a wall of fire about us so they banished him till now of Patmos the one who Jesus loved how can God love John and send him to an Alcatraz how can God love John he laid in his bosom he gave up all of his family and friends for the message of the hour how could God do this to him the one whom Jesus loved and all night long banished like some sort of criminal just lizards and snakes of praying you know it was like heaven was shut off but you know God has a way of making our trials of blessing brother Branham said this this is remarkable when John lived he said people were coming from all over he was the youngest so all the Apostles died before him and so people were coming John how should we do this with our church how should we do the music platformer what did Jesus say about this what did Jesus say about that and life was very busy for John he said so he called John away sanim on an island so he could get quiet and it was about the time he got alone with God visions begin to break and those visions he penned for one people in the seven church ages it wasn't for summer no it wasn't perfect IRA it wasn't for the for our Philadelphia it was for you and I when God would open the symbols that was in that book to give you faith to give you courage to let you know you are on his mind God has a way of changing our trials and making it a blessing he said in revelations chapter 2 verse 19 I know thy works and thy charity and thy service and the faith and thy patience and thy works to be last more than the first he said now he does not say like he did in the Church of Pergamos you hold my faith he said he's commending them for their faithfulness see he mentions patience and faithfulness because they go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness because the trying of your faith worketh patience and there is absolutely no other way to gain patience it has to come by the trial of your faith how highly tribulation Romans 5:3 tribulation worketh patience and how highly God regards the outworking of patience because he says in James 1 for let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect entire lacking nothing see it's God's will for our perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on God waiting for God this is the process of character development how highly god commended those Saints in the Dark Ages as patient lambs led to the slaughter lovingly and faithfully they serve God that's all they wanted out of life just service to their Lord and how great was their reward and as darkness of the age increased and the martyrs grew length here day by day they worked harder they served harder and their faith increased nothing is said of increased labor of love in other ages but in this age in the darkest of age they served him even more what a lesson there is no season of his gracious surface of love unto our Lord but rather an increasing of it and that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart the service of the Lord and our reply his increased service and when we faint and are crying in fear that's the time to shout the victory hey that wonderful you know Paul wrote to us a lot of these words about tribulation work and patience Paul had an ambition to be a priest from the time he was a young boy he was groomed to be a priest yet a lot of zeal had a lot of potential it was tied up in the young man brother Branham said about from the age of 8 or 10 up to the time he was 35 when he was finished with college and he said his mom and dad paid a great sum of money to put him through school and you can imagine how disappointed all of the priests were all of the educators his mother his father all of his friends and his circle how disappointed they were when they see Paul turned his back on all of it and looked at it as it was done because the pillar fire changed everything in Paul's life the Bible said Paul was an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God Paul never called himself God called Paul you find Paul turned his back on everything and immediately he began to preach Jesus as Christ but you know instead of being in with the up and ups being a fancy name and having clout and power everything God does it the opposite way he makes him a reject he makes him a preacher of heresy he makes him an outcast of society and so one day he casts a devil out of a woman who brought a lot of gain to the city and they they fell upon him and they wit Paul and Silas they threw him in prison the Bible said in the inner prison way down in the bowels of it brother Branham said in this place stinks with rats and disease they put him in stocks no doubt their ankles for sore it was dark it was musty it was godforsaken what a place for a preacher whose bats are burning from being whipped because he's trying to be true to God what a place for what we call the Bride of Christ who's trying he turned this back on the church he lost everything wasn't there enough then I left my career wasn't enough that I left everything and now my back has busted to pieces I've been stoned and I'm in this godforsaken place could have been in into the Marriott her some nice motel had I stayed with my plans now I'm way down here in the inner dungeons who stalks rats running over me brother Branham says something amazing he says not one complaint he said no not one complaint they were faithful to God in their condition not one word of murmur not one word of complaint how many would say help me Lord but rather imagined it Silas turned over grown at all and he hears a jingle of a chain and Paul said did you hear that Silas hear what that jingle he shakes it he shakes his chains there is power power wonder-working power hit the blood of the Lamb Silas says yea there is power they get up they can't stand up all the way they begin shaking their trains there is power wonder they didn't shut up Silas joined in with it there is power power wonder-working power imagine angels began to come down from heaven and circle that little church in the blood of Jesus and they're singing praises unto God and all the sudden the place begins to shake I want you to look at this miracle those walls did not come down on top of them those walls fell away from him and it took their stalks off of them and God said you're free to go if you want they would have been selfish they would have run but there was a soul in there that needed saving and the man was gonna kill himself they say you know what help yourself you nasty Roman you know that's a lot of the attitude today you know your you deserve Sodom let the fire fall not Paul his home man come in Triplette and he said do yourself no harm there's love for you thanks grace for you no matter what you've done God is reaching out what must they do to be saved he said believe on the Lord Jesus died in the house shall be saved but man should think of it their feet their hands their neck they were set free he said that heavy Roman prison never broke in on him all the shackles fell off see that's our God hold out faithful he said stay faithful in your call how many believe that they never doubted the word even in those conditions they remained faithful faithful means loyal means constant means devoted unwavering steadfast Paul said of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one second Corinthians 11:25 thrice was i beaten with rods once I was stoned thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and a day I've been in the deep in journeyings often in paths of water in perils of robbers in perils of my own countrymen in perils by the heathen in pals in the city perils and the wilderness perils in the city perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger in thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness beside those things that are without the burden of the church who want to sign out who wants to be a preacher the Bible said in Acts chapter 14 22 he came by and confirmed the souls of the disciples exhorting them to continue in the faith of persevere in the faith that we must through much tribulation enter the kingdom of God Paul knew how to wait on the Lord all that Paul and Ord and he's on a ship storm comes up it's being thrown all over the sea for 14 days no stars no moon the winds are howling the sails are tore things are out of control the Bible said salt Paul was cut down and the bow of the ship for a long time finally he comes out and says brother and you should have listened to me before we left read he said but the angel the Lord whose servant I am just spoke to me and said I must appear before Caesar I love it because and the whole ship has been tossed people are throwing up from seasickness and Paul said I must go before Caesar the winds are still howling the ship is still being tossed but Paul knew that God's work must come to pass people thrown up over the side of the ship and he said God is going to give the life of everyone on the ship finally just exactly the way God said it they come up to an island and there they're called down to the bone and he's gathering wood and a Viper comes out of bites Paul thanks No Paul didn't even recognize it his mind was so on that word he said I must go before Caesar whether it's poisonous whether it's a bear he could spend before machine because God said he must go before Caesar can you say man don't be afraid to stand on God's Word hallelujah hold fast the Bible tells us behold I come quickly hold fast to that which thou hast and let no man take your crown in other words God said hold fast to my word I'm gonna reward you on the day of the resurrection heroes are going to raise up out of the earth men that stood on God's work more than their own life God has a crown waiting for them which represents you will reign with me through the millennium and hold fast he said that promises to those who suffer with him on earth who endured patiently knowing that God the just judge would reward them they who gave up all for him committed all to him will sit down in his throne and share his glorious Kingdom oh we have a word for us it is hope fast that is persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of God and use every weapon every gift at our disposal and look ahead with joy because we're going to be crowned by him who is king of kings and Lord of lords brother Branham said that there is always a crowning time for the word of the aged you know Paul was a total rejected hated and so forth but brother Branham said Paul stayed true to God and demas forsake him for for second all men for cooking and brother madam said when God servant stays true to the word the world is gone to forsake you people are going to hate you when you stay true to the message that God gave you every true saint the Bible has been forsaken for standing by the word but they that wait upon the Lord they will renew their strength Elijah was rejected by his age to the place he thought he was the only one left but he stayed true to the message of his day Daniel stayed loyal to God Daniel stayed true to God in the time where everyone else was compromising all the preachers were compromising every all of his family members they all turn their backs on God but Daniel said I will not defile myself and he stayed true and you find God crowned him when he stayed loyal to God because there is a crowning time for believers who believe the Word of God how many believe that brother Branham said Paul when he walked down to the chopping block he must have faced off with Nero his head was cut off and he said the old Dungy place down there a hole in the wall he said he walked down there Little Creek back there slammed his body into it and he said Oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory I fought a good fight and now there's a crown laid up for me not only me but those that loved his appearing stand truth to the message stand true to the coming of the Lord stand true to the Bible stand true to the blood they gave her children's to true and their crowning day came Moses stood true to the Word of God and his crowning they came the Bible tells us in revelations chapter 19 13 and the Lord was coming in in the third coming he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood his name is called the word of God verse 14 and the armies which were in heaven followed him the word on white horses fine linen white and clean see these followers here are the overcomers that stood for the word in their day and notice this the word is coming back to the earth and the followers are the followers of the word and in Revelation 17:14 his said and they that are with him are called chosen and faithful because they are faithful to the Word of God they were chosen in their age and they are faithful to the message that God sent him how many are followers of the word you'll be following him into the Millenium you'll be following him through the city because you are a follower of the word and he that endures until the end shall be saved notice this now can I go just a little longer way back in the beginning when God traded Eden he made the birds and the paradises whose beautiful God placed his masterpiece the crowning of his creation in the garden brother branham said that Eve was actually only potentially Adams wife for Adam had never known or he says that in 1965 in the power of transformation just like Joseph was married to Mary but she was only potentially as he never knew her his wife Adam never knew his wife he said like the church now and I know he uses those types differently but in the spoken word is the original seed brother Branham said that Adams bride not wait because be fruitful and multiply was an oncoming promise to bring forth sons and their likeness and brother Branham said Adams bride could not wait and Eve direct quote if God in a hurry and took wisdom instead of the promise and brought forth a child of death a child of the beast and brother branham said like a man that would find his bride already pregnant that's what Christ found as the church started virgin on the day of Pentecost he said but it wasn't long till Roman Dogma was found in her and she was pregnant with the Crete's and darkness and teachings of men and brother branham said she went after wisdom and he said just like the church has gone after psychology and theology and mental reasoning man's thoughts he's gone after wisdom and brother Branham said Eve did not know it and neither do they know it they think they're right and she would not bring forth the word manifested and the churches would not receive the message of this day to make the words make flesh and Eve was defiled because she could not wait on God and she disbelieved the word and brother Branham said jehovah's wife did the same thing and was put away because she could not wait and christ's bride was put away in divorcement because she could not wait and he said the Pentecostals have done the same they he said but there is going to be a bride predestinated not to fall when Christ comes she'll be like the Virgin Mary who takes this message into her virgin womb that waits on his word and brother Branham said do not get ahead of the Lord because they produce isms they see promises they try to produce it in their own power in their own strength and it brings forth isms it brings forth chaos it brings forth death but this church is the womb of life just like there was one virgin and the prophecy of Isaiah went down through eight hundred years until it anchored in the womb of a virgin so has this message went down to the aegis until God found a church to anchor the message of the hour into her womb many of wit often isms had tried to produce the manifestation of the sons of God and many have tried to do it and it isn't produced Christ at all but brother Branham said this bride will bring forth the finished body of the Lord direct quote this bride will bring forth the finished body of the Lord in other words he cannot return until the body is complete and this is the hour for a bride without spot without wrinkle if we wait upon our lover brother Branham said remember let's remember why were obeying the spirit one great lesson we never want to be hasty if we ask God for anything God answers prayer and he does it in his time and he makes it work just right when they come into the land I will hold you much longer bear with me when Moses was commissioned to bring the church into the promise you find Moses was a type of denomination who glorified himself he said must we bring forth water out of this rock brother Branham said he broke every type in the Bible he was a lawgiver a type of denomination that cannot bring the people into the promise so God turned the mantle over to Joshua as I was with Joshua so will I be with thee so Joshua now a type of the Holy Spirit is going to pack the people into the land of promise and a notices now Joshua was always waiting on the next move from God so brother Branham said Joshua comes down to Jordan and this is the age of Jordan crossing over into the land where every promises made manifest all that Adam lost is in this land every power of God is in this land healing is in this land joyous in this land peace is in this land he turn a life is in this land her new body is in this land that's where this message is to take us so Joshua comes down and he sees the Jordan River it's swollen it's the worst time to cross over brother random said Joshua's engineers could have said we've made a lot of bricks we've made a lot of walls we know all about it and there's no way we we understand weights and volumes and so forth there's no way to get across this river why don't we wait just just a couple months and this thing will be crossing as we could go right over top of it and Joshua said but God said three days we're not compromising three days in three days we're going over but Joshua shut up but but Joshua did you shout yes sir three days he said sanctify yourselves get ready we're crossing over none of us can swim Joshua everyone of us was born in the wilderness and there's no water out there none of us could swim but you know what he said he said he put the word in front of them he said that's exactly the position where the word was supposed to be and he said he didn't put the preachers in front of him he put the word in front that's what brother Branham said he said yes it was carried over the hearts of the Levites but it was the word that was going in front and so as they touched the water the waters just moved back and as the waters moved back and they waited upon the Lord they all crossed over on dry land ain't that wonderful brother Branham said but the one thing is do not get ahead of the word I don't care what you think in three days we're going over and he said the trouble is as we try to get ahead of the word we bypassed the word to make it fit this and to make it work fit that but the word led the way and when it got to Jordan she opened up and they went over let the word do it and notice every campaign they fought they put the word in front of the fight how many say help me Lord put the word always in every trial in every battle every family circumstance let me take this word and keep it in front of me you'll come out victorious and then brother Branham said now and pick up your pen and write notice the harmony of the father and the son the son did nothing but what the father showed him the bride has a specific work to do at a specific time and brother Branham said let us stand like Joshua and Caleb because God did not let Israel go over until an appointed time and he said that there were people that were like Joshua you've lost your commission we ought to go all and the land is ours and he said same pressures same problems that this would be repeated in the last day he said but whatever you do don't be pressured stay behind the word can you say man and he said now caleb represented those who stayed true to joshua how many want to stay true to the word now watch this watch this now they win over everyone and they took the land without a scratch because they let the message of the hour go before him they were able to wait on God God has sent us a message this message is to forerun the second coming of Christ Christ will come in a physical body and many have tried to produce revivals and many have tried to produce God manifested in his fullness in his people it's caused all kinds of different isms that are different as the East is from the West but our job as lambs is to be faithful our jobs as lambs is to wait for God to fulfill his word and to believe his word brother Branham I'm going to bring this to a close brother Branham tells the story in the sixth seal of a ranchers great ranch from Chicago he owned ranches out in the west to Colorado he had a son miss sunny he was wanting him a wife but all the city girls of Chicago he said they like to party he couldn't find the character and the virtue that he was looking for someone who'd make him a wife someone that would care about him so he went out west up to Colorado I believe it was and all the he there was a a know ranch not an owner but a ranch caretaker had five daughters they all heard the rancher son was coming brother venom said these girls they were like kind of T Annie doing her hair up and their eyelashes up they were all one he used the word ramping they all learned to vamp a Missa they knew he was coming he was single rich and powerful and handsome they were all excited he said but there was a little orphan girl lost her mom and her daddy and she come to live with her uncle and she wasn't accepted she was an outcast among those arrogant little cousins and he said that they she had to do the dishes and she was treated like a slave not like an equal and he said she worked real hard and she missed her mom and she missed her daddy and she was stuck in these conditions when this man came to town brother branham said they put on their best they threw a party like you never saw the music was going and the honky-tonks were gone they were shooting their guns and flirting and dancing and hold-down and boy they're having themselves a party the man said these girls are just like the ones in Chicago he said after about three days of a hoedown and a big time he stepped down and he looked over the corral and he said Here Come this little Walsh girl he said she come out and she threw the water out she's barefoot ragged and he looks at her and something said on the inside he preaches this on second coming of the Lord as well he said he looks at her and said that's her you know how some people not everyone but some people look don't ever pre-conceived that in your mind you might mess make a big mess up but some people look up and say that's her well it worked for him and this time he said that's her boy his interest wasn't in the party house anymore he'd come out after tonight he'd watch her for a little bit he noticed she was faithful she was working hard he said one day I'm gonna get down there and I'm gonna talk to her one night he finally timed her and he knew how to get down there he made sure he was in the right place at the right time she went to throw the water and there he stands oh excuse me she puts her head down excuse me he said what's your name she feels uncomfortable he said hey what are you doing out here doing the dishes weren't you up at the party she said I got I got work to do gets the talk and turn he finds out she's an orphan finds out these things about her and he watches her night after night something begins to move in his heart he said she has virtue she has character that's someone that had make me a home that's someone that I'm interested in so one of the last nights he came down he met her again he said you know why I'm here I'm here to find me a wife they said and I see in you something that I've been looking for oh I imagine she turned ten shades of red me who I'm an orphan he said will you marry me but I'm unworthy don't you ever feel that way out of all the churches in the world you ever feel why me why would God show you truth why would God call you who were we the whole world I go through Japan and there's literally thousands times thousands and I look at brother George I said how are we gonna reach a mall how how can you thousands times thousands of people and we're country people but when you go into those cities you're like my god they're everywhere but yet God in this age take this message right to you how many said Lord I feel so unworthy he said but I see something in you I see something well I mean she had to be speechless what could I say but I see something in you that I want to share eternity with and he said will you marry me I don't have nothing you don't need anything will you marry me Who am I I want you to be my wife yes yes I will that had to feel good she probably said excuse me yes he said you listen to me little girl he said you see them trees there he said it was wintertime I said about the time they start to bud I want you to put your dress and you make ready and I want you to come out every night right here to this gate and I want you to be looking down the road because I'm a-comin when you see the buds on those trees you know that I'm coming for you she said I'll be ready and he left you imagine when she had to face her cousins when she had to say they said what are you doing she's making him 75 cents a week and she scrub it and working and she's saving every penny in her jar she's gonna make herself a dress he said can't be very fancy when it don't matter God owns at all but he said you make ready and by golly she's gonna do the best she can so she's scrubbing floors she don't mind doing dishes she don't mind mopping the floors she don't mind being laughed at she don't mind being called a Holy Roller up my dressing like a woman she don't mind living godly because he made a promise and she knows he's good for his promise she's a mop on the floor she's a Chinkin she's a Chinkin six months goes by she can buy some fabric she's a Solon at night she's doing it just exactly the best she knows how I want it white I want it really white it's not fancy

white with righteousness she's iron him she's sewing all the needlework in it and when the cousins find out you crazy that case you have washed too many dishes you have lost your mind but he promised like he's going to marry you if he was going to marry anyone he would marry me but he promised why did he choose you over me I don't know I'm just telling you what happened all I know he looked like a mighty angel coming down with a book in his hand and a promise and he told me he's coming back for me brother branham said those cousins they started dancing how do you poor silly little kid he'll never come he's making my pray to you you ridiculous every night she saw buds coming on those trees no my mom penis those days are soon to be over all my slavery is soon to be over all my troubles are soon to be outlook she walked out to the road and she's awaiting and she's imagining him flying over that hill and she watches the Sun sets and he don't come did she quit waiting she heard maybe it's maybe it is just a fable anyway no she had something on the inside she had a little perseverance she had a little faithfulness about her yeah a little passion about the word she went in all of them laughing all of them laughs I told you told you told you she folds it out she hands it out her hangs it up rather tomorrow night she mopped the floors like she always did she scrubbed and made sure

forsaking all others keep him only to you I do you may kiss the bride imagine the power of the Holy Spirit fell upon him as he kissed her in front of her accusing cousins the Bible says he will prepare a table in the presence of the enemy oh those kids laughed at though she's ridiculed she waited she was faithful she stayed with the light put her up in the Buffy yeah and as they took off those cousin's mouths were hanging over the hill they just saw a hand go like this one of these days the trees have already budded I hope every one of you or at the end of the street everyday watching
