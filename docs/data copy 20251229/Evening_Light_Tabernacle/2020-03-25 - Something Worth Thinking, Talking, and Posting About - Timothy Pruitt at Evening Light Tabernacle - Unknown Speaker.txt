things going as usual Lord we need you to come father and comfort the hearts lift up the spirits Lord Lord help us Lord to think on the right things Lord in the Word of God it's a word that never fails and it won't fail now Lord it it still provides what we have need of Lord and God we just ask for the hands that were lifted Lord that you would touch each and every heart Lord if there be depression is trying to fall upon someone that that demon would be driven back tonight Lord but if there be a sadness or a weary spirit that had just moved back and let the presence of God coming to the heart Lord we pray we commit this service to you Lord everything to be said and done Lord we just give it to you for your glory and for your honor in Jesus name Amen amen let's turn our Bibles to Philippians for a man Philippians 4 and verse 6 he man god is good all the time amen and all the time God is good doesn't matter what kind of circumstance we find ourselves in he's still good amen is still able it says here be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good port if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things those things which you've both learned to received and heard and singing me do and the God of peace shall be with you he meant I'm thankful for the God of peace Amen we let you be seated this this thought has been on my heart this week is you know how it is your mind that devil wants to try to get you on every sad news or bad news or every kind of thing that comes up and pops up and and news articles or self-help whatever so many things right now especially is being put out there and and and so I begin to think on the word of what God told us to do and he said whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just pure lovely and of good report if there be any virtue or praise think on these things and I I'd like to speak to you tonight on something worth thinking talking and posting about Amen been posting about you have to update it sometimes because now they have weird and the day age we live in there's a lot of social media and and it's got as good their ways we use it for the glory of God but it's also got the bad things it comes along with it just like anything off the tree of good and good and knowledge of good or the knowledge of good and evil but you know I think in this time that we're in especially even more important than ever is to just to get to thinking about Christ is to keep him on your mind you know as we said that there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things and you know brother Brennan would speak upon thoughts and negative thoughts and positive thoughts and and you know right now there's plenty of negative to think about there's plenty of negative this throat up in your face either by what somebody says or a text or a post and things are getting shared around that we don't even know it really true or not but you know or passed on as being the truth but I do know one thing this word is true as word as has never failed amen and I said still producing even in this time that we're living in you know and he said you know when you have a thought coming if it's a negative thought he says to get it off your mind think on things that's positive never let a negative thoughts stop keep thoughts positive Jesus and I believe that there's a thought that we ought to be thinking on right now that's Jesus because what he has done for us he's never left us alone he's been there for us every step of the way and I don't see him leaving us now I don't see him moving away from us now but he's ever with us as his word promised he would be and he said you know don't think sitting there in a wheelchair or well I'll just say whatever position or place whether it be maybe a financial situation or whatever struggle he said don't don't sit there thinking you're hopeless don't sit there thinking that you're helpless you're not don't let that negative thought pass through and let know especially don't let it anchor there he said sometimes you can't help it from coming through your mind but that's that's right but don't let it stay there amen turn to something that's positive he said you know it's like an old farmer he said I can't keep birds from flying over my place or my house he said but I can kinda have a double-barrel shotgun I can sure keep them from roosting he said you do the same thing don't let that thought roost there and begin to breed more negative thoughts amen he says here's a shotgun to use you have the both the New and Old Testament a double-barrel shotgun and he said is still as potent today as it ever was it keeps him all away you know blind Bartimaeus was sitting there in his blind condition and a very seemingly terrible place and it was a terrible place born blind but he said what happened was he begin to think and he and he said thoughts begin to pass through his mind and he's you know thoughts of if I could have been there when the great prophets of the Walker when if I could have been there you know for in the times of the prophets or have one of them pray for me and I believe Jehovah would give me a sight and he says you know we said in that same place amen and our meditations and sometimes our meditations are thinking about church affiliations or our meditation is taken by work or some superstition we have in our mind and and man but then we but if we can take them from that and place our meditation upon him and its presence he will come and do the same thing he did for blind bartimaeus if he would do that amen if we can do that if we could keep him on our mind and right right now Satan's having a heyday with people in their thoughts in their mind and the things that they're going through and be putting these sad weary spirits of depression and things upon them but you have to turn from that and think about what Jesus has done what Jesus is doing and what Jesus is going to do because he has a come upon in our lives he saved us when we was lost he healed us when we were sick and he's going to change it so vile body one of these days and he noticed when they was walking on the road to Emmaus and it was when they begin to think on the things of God and they begin speaking about him that's when he appeared to him amen we got our minds he says onto many things of the world oh my that's true today we got our mind so many things with too many things of the world he said if we could just throw that away for a moment and think about him and his soon coming he said there'd be more revelations and power in the church hallelujah I believe that's what our goal and our ambition should be during this time it's not to get our mind on the world events and you know we get in full and fine being formed but don't let that be all that you feed upon all that you're out drawing from but get your mind on Jesus turn back to the Word of God and feed on the word of God and feed on the things of God and let God speak to you during these moments hey man we begin to think about him he said when we keep thinking about you know what am I gonna do tomorrow what I'm gonna go do next week will I hold my job well it will I people will they sink me for provided he said get your mind off of them and on things that are in the hands all things are in the hands of God hallelujah all things are in the hands of God this world has not jumped out of the hands of God now and in somebody else's hands everything is working according to his plan he's got it all in control he's got to know he put it there in place he put the stars in the place he put the Sun in his place and it's still there today by the spoken word of God and if he puts you in your place he puts you in your position you will be held there no matter what winds of Hell push against you no matter what doubts come no matter what floods come you will be held there by the Word of God hey man but we're so quick you know in this day to pass on the latest dire news story or the latest of what we heard how to cure something or the the latest worst case scenario and you know Satan's made that very easy to pass on negative news and to feed on negative news he said you know you but you know it doesn't take long to see what people are feeding on come on now you look at their posts history you can look at things going on and what they're putting out that's what they're feeding on hey man we need to change our diets I've seen some of you need to change your diet amen and during this time don't feed on Fox News are seeing it sure being full but feed upon the Word of God listen to the tapes read your Bible and pray get closer to God than you ever been before change your thinking and think on the things that have virtue and praise amen Satan is working overtime through news and emails I mean they've gotten emails on this thing I mean everybody's sending out emails and bombard and whatever to send out this propaganda of fear and there's some true fear and some real things I'm not trying to play down on it but listen just because it's the internet don't mean it's true amen somehow we get that in our mind because this news article popped up it's got to be true because it's there on the internet I mean you know you sure like I said be informed but don't let it be what you feed on don't let it be what you wake up to or you go to bed to feed on the Word of God start feeding on what is true and the only thing true in this hour is the Word of God and in these moments be certain of God he'll listen that take today be certain of God be certain he can still provide no matter how bad the circumstances hard be certain he can heal no matter the disease be certain he can deliver no matter the sin be certain he can set free come on now he is set free amen no matter how deep in prison you are walls don't hinder him disease will frustrate him sin does not neutralize him Devils can't stop him he's still the same car today he's still the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] circumstances does not change him sicknesses are not staying him plagues did not change him hallelujah amen in a famine he provides and stormy seas he's walks on them think on these things not on Fox News or CNN or whatever news but on the good news the gospel of Jesus Christ and we also have a responsibility as Christians to publish the good news to encourage to lift up to build up to speak faith oh it's easy to speak faith when you're in when you got a well body or speak faith when everything's going good but in the valley speak faith no matter where you find yourself speak the Word of God because I read in my Bible he's also the god of the hills is also the god of the valleys come on now finally search it out read it it's there he meant when the enemy come and said well we know he's the god of the hills but he's not the God of the valleys God came and spoke to a prophet and he said you since the enemy has said that I'm not the god of the valleys this is what's going to happen hallelujah he's the god of the good times he's a God of the bad time he's a god of pee at the times of peace he's the God in the times of war he's a God in the time of hell he's a God in the times of sickness none of this changes who he is he's the same yesterday today and forever think on these things hallelujah hey man and Fleeman 1 verse 5 he meant speaking about Paul speaking to Philemon he said hearing of thy love and faith amen this week I want to ask some people how many's heard of your love and faith have they heard of you fear and your anxieties and your depression and posted this news article and they've heard what you found over here what you've been researching over here but have they heard of your love and faith hey man they're mean Paul wasn't even living in the time of Facebook and he heard of this man's love and faith come on now and what which thou has toward the Lord Jesus and toward alsace that the communication of thy faith oh come on now a man we are to communicate something the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus this effectual means a powerful active energetic full of knowledge of faith for we have great joy and consolation in their love because the bowels of the Saints are refreshed by thee come on now refresh that would this be a refreshing Christian amen a refreshing Christian i refresh means to have regained strength or energy aren't what you putting out is that allowing somebody to regain strength come on what you're putting out or what you're doing or how you're acting or how you're leading is that is that portraying faith to believe that no matter what's going on God's got this and he's going to handle this and by you living and moving the way in acting in your actions people are regaining strength and regaining energy hallelujah it also means to exhilarate or to reinvigorate or to rejuvenate or to replenish or to revive to stimulate to brace up to cheer up to enliven to freshen to quicken to restore to revitalize to breathe new life into are you a refreshing Christian hallelujah I want to be accused of being a refreshing Christian hey man so let's move the sadness away it's a spirit that's trying to attach itself to you during uncertain times so to remove that you got to take your eyes on what's causing the problem and get your eyes on what fixes the problem and what fixes it is turn your eyes back on Jesus come on now and keep that sad spirit away from you it's a demon hey man God wants us to be happy and to trust him in these times this was shared with us this - I believe it was today or yesterday evening with random speaking to a lady he said the lady suffers with extreme nervous condition she's wanting prayer for eyes because her eyes are getting dimmer and dimmer they're going out it's a hardening of the nerve of the eye the optical nerve is dying which is shutting off the life but you're all upset about something you're weary you even wonder if you're actually saved you're having trouble with that you're doubting your experience of being saved but I tell you now your are but this was caused by a call some kind of shock you've had some news that shocked you all at once and calls that he said I think it was the death of your husband last fall but he said god bless your heart lady let's move the sadness away everything's gonna be alright hallelujah let's remember that tonight everything's gonna be alright if the economy crashes everything's going to be alright whatever we lose their job everything's going to be alright if I find myself in sickness everything's gonna be alright cuz God will provide what I have need of in the time of my trouble he's done it time after time after time and he's not going to stop now merciful God he said I stand before this dear woman knowing there's a sad spirit around you around her maybe there's a sad spirit around you but hear the prayer amen I asked for that divine mercy and guidance laying my hands upon her and I charged that sad spirit to leave the woman because Christ lives that's enough to drive the sadness away he still lives he's still on the throne he's still the same yesterday today and forever he who made the promise still can keep his promise he said I will never leave you or forsake you hallelujah Christ can no more take back a word though then he said to nothing because he's God he knows everything before he says it and he said I condemn the spirit that would harm this woman in Jesus name and I also condemn that old sad spirit that wants to come in our realms in these moments and push his way in and attach itself to some bad news or some little shake-up going on I condemn that thing and I Drive it out of homes drive it away from lives by driving away from hearts by the Word of God think on these things sums nineteen verse 14 said to let the words of the eye of my mouth and today we get updated and let the words of my keyboard and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight listen if words we speak and the people get the idea that somehow they're detached from what they post you're not detached from what you post people got that idea so anything behind a keyboard but you are very much attached to what it shows you what you really are I mean you can see it in people as they would comment on news articles or whatever you can see the bow that set is there they may be good Baptists may be good crew so-called Christians but in them in the middle of them a man there's something pushing out of him hatred and violence and all these kind of things there might be good message people come on now and they push it out let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O Lord for mice you are my strength and my Redeemer Psalms 141 said set a watch o Lord before my mouth and keep the doors of my lips proverbs 6 2 says thou art snared with the words of our mouth and thou art taken with the words of thy mouth 13:33 says he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life but he that openeth why his lips shall have destruction proverbs 15 forces a wholesome tongue or is a healing or health tongue a healing tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit 18:21 says death and life are in the power of the tongue so it's very important what we speak or what we say just because of the thought that enters your mind don't mean it's the word that's got to come out of your mouth or a word there's got to be put out there on the on a forum somewhere some social media for Matthew 12 verse 37 says for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned so we don't want a negative testimony Alleluia amen he would say this many times with libretto speaking about negative and positive he says if your number is called tonight in the prayer line if God reveals your heart and speaks to you and gives you deliverance in here don't ever have no kind of negative testimony but only he healed you because if you do if you one time testified to the other side the negative side it'll come back to you worse than it ever was let him this week say I'm strong but I don't feel strong he didn't say to him that feel strong say you're strong he said to him that's weak to him that knows him saying you know in humanity you find very quickly how fragile humanity really is you find real quickly how fragile our lives really are what we think are important or very fragile all we want is very fragile and one day can be there in the next day it'd be gold but let him that's weak say I'm strong because there's not me the liveth it's him that liveth within me just say in your heart now I'm strong I've now accepted Jesus as my healer and never have a negative testimony just believe it God is under obligation and Jesus our Jesus Christ is sitting at the right hand of the Father to accept you for he's sitting there is the high priest of your confession to make good before the father anything that he died for and that you're confessing that he done healing is not something that you say well I guess I believe it I believe he said that's all right if that's the best you can do mentally you know I see I believe I accepted that's then you're accepted on those basis keep saying it over and over and say it out loud say it over and over and just keep saying it I'm healing I'm healed I'm healed I'm healed some of you need to say I'm happy I'm happy I'm happy amen say it until you actually believe it and when you believe it something's going to take place don't have a negative testimony every time when you confess I feel bad you go right straight back to the same rut you was in the beginning there's not a man or woman here there's baptized with the Holy Spirit but what you start your convention I believe I've lost the Holy Spirit I believe it's gone from me he said but don't never have no negative testimony because you will go right down when you do testify positive jesus healed me I'm will go ahead and receive your healing no matter what you're feeling you go if you go you're feeling and you're gonna you're never going to receive it you got to go back every time do you have a you have a negative testimony every time you look at your symptoms you're following away from it there's not a Christian here no matter how solid you're on your faith if right there how you something to happen to get a hold of you and tell you're not a Christian you start out there testify I'm not a Christian no more you'll drop right away you're no more Christian anymore as soon as you testify that you drop from grace you've fallen but you got it your own speech begins to tell what you are and your posts tell what you are hey man it's a strange thing that you smoked so much thought of people say well I'm weak my faith is not much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're talking his language you mustn't ever say that don't let your testimony being take it up let it be positive all the time I'm saved I have God in my heart I believe in with all my heart no matter what the circumstances are do you believe in here with all my heart and don't let your testimony be negative or your thoughts be negative never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts don't entertain it you said well I can't help thoughts from coming but you can head sure stop them from staying and that's a good thing you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them no sir you say Jesus Christ is my Savior all things remind by him I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify them God can only bless you as you confess he's done it for you a man see he's the high priest of your confession is that right he said he's the high priest of our confession we'll make your body open your confession hallelujah God will make your body come right into what you are confessing if you say you're a drunkard and want a drink don't worry you'll be one soon if you say you're a sinner wants a sin you'll be right at it if you say you're Christian believe it all along God will bring it your testimony will bring it right to you if you believe in healing believe that God has healed you confessing and got to make your body obey your confession for he is the high priest of your confession setting at the right hand of the Father now with his own blood to make intercessions upon our confession amen go out and testify I'm saved I'm healed I'm delivered amen God will make you her body obey what you speak so something to think about to talk about or to post about let me give you some thoughts to start thinking maybe he fox news's got you thinking all kinds of stuff and seeing in and who knows what else that gets passed around but let's just put all that out of her mind for good put it all out of her mind let's start thinking these thoughts I'm saved I'm here and I belong to Jesus hallelujah amen I'm saved I'm his and I belong to Jesus I'm forgiven I'm redeemed I'm justified I'm bought with a price I'm purchased my body is his temple you didn't let the devil know my body is his temple my mind is his my heart is his everything that I am is his I belong to Jesus I didn't never belong to the devil yes I was caught in his own way one day but I don't mean I ever belong to him but I always belong to God because I was in his mind before the foundation of the world hallelujah you know I had something today happening whatsapp somebody put me in their big group it was a church group he was obviously what they was doing a friend of mine a brother was making a church group where he it was called encouragement and he was making this big group and I could tell all the ones besides me and him and and maybe a couple of others I knew but I didn't know any other phone numbers and so I didn't say anything and it wasn't just for a few moments maybe an hour later all of a sudden said he he's kicked you out or whatever says you know we're

weapon formed against me will prosper whoa write it down no weapon against me will prosper he wants me to prosper God's God sent trials are for my good therefore in the middle of my trial I can I am blessed I can be happy and I'm blameless in him I was listening to brother Branham today speaking of job and the sacrifice that he offered he knew he had offered a sacrifice and we know in this day we have a perfect sacrifice were found blameless in him therefore the forgiveness that I receive is the forgiveness I can give I can forgive others right now's a good time to start forgiving people some

can do what I need to do through Christ I can ask in his name and he'll answer me if I submit and resist Satan he will flee from me when I overcome I inherit all things he will change my body he will never leave me in his presence is fullness of joy he will preserve me and I was thinking the day as I listen to them be certain of God and in that time there was a little woman that was preparing her last meal and she was making her last meal before hurting the boat was gonna starve to death but brother brother man spoke he said a prophet was sent out of the mountains where he'd been fed by some Ravens and a broken God said go to a certain town and in a certain town you'll find a certain woman and I asked her to make you a meal and when he came and she was standing there and she was gathered the last few sticks and getting the last bit of meal and the last bit of old and making last cake for the last meal and it was going to be over with and seemingly going to die God asked her a request give it to me trust me can you trust me maybe some of you tonight he's asking you can you trust him can you give him all that you got can you give him everything can you give him your finances in your house and your job and your worries and your fretting and your and your mind battles and your your depression and everything give it to him give it to him and see what he can do with it she gave her she made that last cake and gave it to that prophet she brother Branham said she must have been I believe he something like this he said of the same material of all as Elijah she believed in the middle of a crisis and you've been asked to believe not doubt not post doubts and fears and and worries and this that and the other I mean we can we can preach faith there in faith at times oh we can preach it but what about faith during the time of crisis what about speaking faith in the time that that my goodness toilet paper is gone and things off the store is gone and situations are happening maybe we losing jobs and I don't know what's going to happen all I know is nobody God hadn't left or left somebody else in charge he's still got it in trol he's the one who spoke this thing into existence he's gonna bring him back down to the right kind of end and the right time and although it's in his I had in his hands it's not mine it's not knitted for government it's not in anybody's head it's only in his hands and she gave him the last and then in turn he gave her a meal barrel that wouldn't run out in a cruise all crews of jug or whatever they used a little maybe a pottery and every time she'd go back they'd be more there he's Jehovah Jireh and he's still Jehovah Jireh today it don't matter what's going on he still will provide he will change my body he will never leave me in his presence is fullness of joy so if you found yourself out of joy get back in his presence amen that's the solution you know quit worrying about the problem and start looking to the solution the solution is if you found yourself out of joy because he said in his presence there's fullness of joy get back to his presence whatever it takes pray read your Bible seek God in these time amen and God is the fullness of joy he will preserve me he will hold me with his right hand and help me and therefore I will be delivered from my enemies I have helped in trouble and I am delivered in trouble he will deliver me from sickness and affliction I have divine guidance I have divine protection this is your Bible amen he makes me dwell in safety I will lay down in peace and sleep hallelujah hallelujah just got a text from a brother the other day that said he was having to take something to sleep and to pray for him we prayed and reported back as I didn't need any of it I've been sleeping

promises of God I am an attribute of God God predestined me to the same prayer desolated me to the same no one can take my place I came from the mind of God I'm a growing Christian his present is with
