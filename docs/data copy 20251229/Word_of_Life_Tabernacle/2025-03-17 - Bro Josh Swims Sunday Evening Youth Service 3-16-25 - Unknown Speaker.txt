you would meet with us now in a in a special and a mighty way we ask it bless these young people now in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you this evening it's good to be here brother Ben's asked me several times to come and it just hasn't worked out for us to be here but it worked out this time so we uh we just try to surrender and yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit if we could let's turn over into the book of uh Luke chapter 7 um and we'll start reading here at verse 36 and just a a very familiar scripture to us tonight and a very simple I'm just going to be a very simple message and I'm not a very complicated person I'm a very simple person and so you know I believe that uh you know before brother brandom he could preach the seals and things he brought a message of God hiding himself and simplicity and so sometimes we uh as message Believers because we have so much available to us we think on high high levels but God's down here with a with the children you know he said you know to have a childlike faith and so let's uh let's just look at this little scripture here tonight for for a little while and here it says and one of the Pharisees desired him he says that he would eat with him and he went in into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and it says and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner he says when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping says and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with ointment thank you Lord says and when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it notice he said he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet say he would which had bidden him he said saw him he said spake within himself if this man was a prophet he would have known who what manner of woman that this was that toucheth him for she is a sinner yeah says and Jesus answering said unto him he says Simon he says I have somewhat to say unto thee says he saith Master say on says and there was a certain creditor which which had two debts says one owed him 500 p and the other 50 says and when they had nothing to pay he says he frankly forgave them both and then Jesus says he says now tell me therefore he says which of them will love him the most and Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave the most he says he said unto him thou Hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon he says seest Thou this woman he says I entered into thine house says Thou gavest me no water for my feet but she has washed me my feet with tears says and wipe them with the hairs of her head says Thou gavest me no kiss said but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet says my head with oil thou did not anoint said but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment says wherefore I say unto thee he says her sins which are many are forgiven he says for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little he said unto her thy sins are forgiven he says and they that set at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace thank you Lord praise the Lord Lord with that His blessings you have your seats this evening as we're looking at this tonight and those that come with me I preached this at home here a few weeks ago but you know it's something about whenever you get out it's never the same message that that you that you fir that you first preach but you just have to just as a as we look at these things and you know how that brother brandham he would uh dramatize uh uh picture uh he would try to draw you out a picture in the Bible of a of a story like this and we're going to try to do that uh in the Simplicity of it if we could tonight but here you know I took this thought and I was thinking about these things here a few weeks ago and I was in this this instance in the Bible it come to me you know this woman she was on the outside of the church she was on the outside of the of the house and she was looking in and she she had a different perspective of those that were sitting within the congregation because here she was looking at this in in a way that you know that those that were entered in they were they were mingling with one another they were having fellowship with one another they were they were rejoicing they were they were clanking their wine glasses together they were having a wonderful time brother Bon but this woman on the outside that was looking in yeah come on she seen something more important than having all the fellowship that they were having all all the all the the wonderful time that everybody else was having she's seen something different Church she seen Jesus over here in the corner an unwelcome guest in the in the in the house of the Pharisee sir her being a sinner yeah come on right she's seen something different Church see there was something the woman she was curious as she was walking by the house she started to hear commotion and you just just bear with me for a moment we're going to try and you just picture this in your head especially you young people you picture this in your mind as this woman she's walking by the house and you know many times and I just speak quite frankly with you I know some of you young people you probably don't even want to be here tonight I was that young person one time mom and daddy drugg me to church but you know God has a way of working things out and here this woman she was walking along the road and she heard a commotion y she heard something brother Joel she that attracted her attention and so she walked up and she she knew that she was not welcome at Simon's house but there she was she was able to gaze through the window of the house and she no doubt she looked around and she seen all the people that had made fun of her that had all all the things that they had said about her and all these things were going through her mind and she seen somebody A peculiar somebody in the corner yeah said what is this and there was something within her heart that her heart started to beat there was something within her her heart started to move with compassion she there was something taking place that that she had never she had never been had had happened to her before right amen and so as she's looking through these things and she sees that the different ones having a wonderful time yeah she sees that the the the the ones that they were everybody was welcome but one yeah come on and it troubled her now why would this trouble a sinner woman like her come on why would why would this but there was seed there was a seed that was laying there from before the foundation of the world that there was something taking place within this woman no doubt maybe she was raised in Message Church put it just put it in my own words tonight cu no doubt many of you have been raised in a message church here tonight many of you are maybe two or three generations raised in a message Church some of you older ones here tonight I I was raised in a message Church 36 years old and so we we we're many generations maybe that's been raised in a message church maybe this woman she was raised in a message church and somehow along the way she thought well I'll do my own thing I'll go out whenever and we're all like that sometimes we when we get 16 17 18 years old we want hey I'm going to go do my own thing I'm going to do what Mom and Daddy said I can't do no more come on now some of you older ones can testify to it there's a sister in the back that raised her hand she could testified to it we've all done those things and so here maybe she was raised in a message church and she was she she she was just and it come a point that she said you know I'm going to do my own thing I want to I'm going to seek what the world's got to offer I'm want to I'm going to see what how all the friends that all my worldly friends all the good times that they have out there I'm going to somehow she got on the outside and she become an ill-famed woman she become somebody that nobody else wanted to be around and see that's what sin will do to you tonight you young people it will take you further than what it ever what you had ever imagine that it would see it's so important that we stay in fellowship with God it's so important that we stay in fellowship with the word of God tonight amen and it come to a point that there was something beating within her heart as she was no doubt she was walking by Simon's house here she seen somebody an unwelcome guest in the corner and this was somebody this is what this is the person my mama was telling me about come on this is the one that my grand parents were telling me about this is the one that the preacher used to preach about on Sunday mornings and on Wednesday evenings and this is this was the word of God it's something within her it started to attract the attention of this young woman and she noticed that he was unwelcome he hadn't been kissed he hadn't been anointed he he he was not welcome in the house of Simon brother brandham and you just forgive me for giving this little backstory here but brother brandham he he Illustrated this for us and and he broke it down and he he would say here he says see he says a home of that type in the Eastern country of Palestine and and just I want to let you know because of the of the severity of this it it's a very severe thing of what Simon done to to Jesus I want you to understand this tonight he says that it's in the Eastern country of Palestine he says the lowest of the low yeah he says a funky said he he meets you at the door he says he goes to one of the wells and he draws him a Great Basin of good Clear Water yeah says he removes your shoes and he sets your shoes up across his knee and he he saids you feeted up across his knee and he begins to wash all the dirt says and the dust and the dung and all the stuff off your body says and then he takes another towel and he wipes your feet and he washes them and he sets them down says and then he takes your sandals he says and he sets them up on a little mantle along the door of the entrance then he goes over and he finds a pair of fine satin says silk slippers he says they're soft says and this is the compliments of the host says he does that and he says he has them sitting there said he puts them upon your feet until he finds one that fits you comfortably says and see then your Feet's washed says then he passes you to another place says and there's a man that meets you at the door says and he he has a little Basin in his hand he says a little picture like that says and you take it and you pour some of the oil in your hands says and now that oil he said is made of a very fine nerd and he goes on to say he said it's very expensive and it it costs very much money and he says oil it would get old and he said it'll smell bad in a few days but he said they they put this spot nner in there until it has that Aroma for years says then they give you that he says and you wash your hands with it says then they give you a towel and you wipe your hands says and then then the next thing he says they give you he said it's more of it and they they put it on your neck and you put it on your neck and he says on your cheeks and on your forehead he says both men and women in Palestine must do this because the sun rays are so hot says and so they do that and it creates a smell it creates an aroma says and then after you wipe it he says the most of it off he says you're refreshed now so now your feet has been washed now you you've been you you you've been washed and now there's a refreshing says so he goes on to say he says feet is washed he says you are washed he says your hands are clean your face is clean says then you're taken into the Chamber of where the host is he says then says when you meet him he takes his right hand he says he puts it on your left shoulder yeah he says and then you bow says then he then you take your right hand and put it on his left shoulder and he bows then he kisses you says from one side of the cheek to the other side of the cheek he says that's the welcome oh my says that's the right hand of Fellowship amen says and when the host kisses you says you are a brother he says you are welcome amen yeah see the flunky church sure he was very careful to wash the doctor's feet yeah come on yes see the important you see the importance of of of being being welcomed into the home being washed and being kissed and welcomed into the home the flunky was very important to wash the doctor's feet the flunky was very he he he he made sure that he washed the celebrities feet come on but here set Jesus in the corner of the house come on as an unwelcome guest and this woman as she's observing this there's something within her how can this be come on there there's something within her that's that that's rising up yeah there's a change that's taking place within This Woman This is Jesus this is the this is the one that walked the shores of Galilee this is the one that's restoring the word to the people this is the one that that just bringing healing and salvation and deliverance come on and he sits in the corner unwelcome come on now Jesus but everybody else that was in the house they were having a wonderful time right they were having a party yeah they were having a jubilee everything was perfectly fine but one that was on the outside looking in oh Jesus right they didn't have a sincerity for the word of God come on they didn't have a they didn't acknowledge the things of God they didn't acknowledge the importance of the things of God is it like it tonight Church oh my have we come to a point in our lives come on and I pray that it I I don't believe this it's like that here but have it come maybe Have We Become lukewarm in our lives to the point that maybe a television show is a little bit more important than the word of God yeah come on I don't I left my de my cell phone in the back but maybe a cell phone is a little more important than the things of God oh my come on now come on come on you young people you we got do we make time for prayer do we make time to read our Bibles do we make time for the things of God or have we put Jesus in the corner as an unwelcome guest where is the sincerity of the people today Church isn't it funny how a sinner woman that's standing on the outside looking in how that she could see something different than those that were having supposed to be having fellowship with the word of God yes has the things of God become just ever so casual to us us come on think about it church he was unano with dirty feet how embarrassed Jesus had to be at that time think about it the Pharisees was having a big time he was busy entertaining the Great Men of the city and to know Jesus was was unentertained oh help us how come how can he be there with unwashed feet how did he make it in without being washed without being welcomed think about this woman here as as she's looking at these things and there's something within her her her her heart starts to beat yeah come on there's a warmth that starts coming upon her she starts to think I've got to do something oh yeah I I've got to do something myself right come on I've I've got to surrender myself oh yeah oh yeah she made her money in in an ill Fame way and she she went maybe she started with while she's thinking about this she's walking back to the house she rushes back to the house and she starts thinking I've got to do something I've got I've got to make Jesus welcome come on and she she goes to the house and you know as brother Bron would illustrate it she starts creaking she starts walking up the stairs and of where she was living and she the stairs are maybe creaking and and clattering and as she's getting up there she she pulls out a little treasure box that has her wages that she's made and she she pulls out the money and she's looking at the money she said oh he'll know how I made the money and she puts it back in the Box great now and she steps it back she says I can't do it oh my but she says something's got to be done come on surely surely he'll understand the situation uhuh and and she takes the money back and and she heads down the street to where that they would where where they would purchase the the spot nner to the the ointment that was needed to be purchased and she walks in and as as brother Bram would illustrate it he he would he would say maybe there was a a Jew behind the counter and he's he's grouchy and he's upset because he ain't made enough money today to be able to pay the rent and here this woman walks in and you know an ill Fame woman she's not even supposed to be in the presence of of the of these people and she walks into the to the store to buy this ointment and he maybe snarks off and said what do you want cuz everybody knows her in town everybody knows who that she is everybody's made fun of her everybody's talked about her yeah but then she takes out all the money and she sets it on the table all right all right his attention changes brother Joel right oh how can I help you ma'am he his attention changes at that point because here is the money that he needs to pay the rent for the day here's the money that that that he needs to be able to do whatever it is that he wants for the day the money Chang the situation right and she said I want the finest ointment the finest spikner that you have on the shelf right and he pulls it out and he sets it on the Shelf she didn't argue with the price right price didn't matter church because there was something that needed to be done amen the price of it didn't matter the money of it didn't matter there was something there was a warmth there was a there was a rejoicing that was in her heart there was something taking place amen money didn't matter the reputation didn't matter situations around her didn't matter no more amen the circumstances that that her life had fallen in it didn't matter no more oh it was all over with amen she didn't argue with the price she picked the bottle up she left the money there and she headed back to Simon's house oh yeah amen something was taking place she started to yield herself unto the Lord Jesus she she started to yield herself and that's the way it is with us tonight young people as you start yielding yourself un the Holy Spirit you're your your your your attitude will change toward the things of God your your abilities toward the things of God will change you'll start wanting to go to church you start wanting to surrender your life to God you'll start wanting to you quit wearing makeup or quit cutting your hair and whatever else you start wanting to live a righteous life type of a lifestyle amen that attitude that you had around 16 17 years old 18 years old it'll go away amen come on I had a terrible temper whenever I was that age and those the youth that are with me I've testified to them about it one time that you know I had such a terrible temper that one time my daddy he was a an alcoholic and and he just had a way of being able to get to a point that it would just so frustrate me and there was a time that I instead of hitting him I haul off and I hit the the wall of the house and it was right on the edge of the wall and Dad he didn't have the these fancy trim pieces he had one before around the the edges of the door and I haul off and hit that broke my hand and my pinky and everything else and terrible temper there was something as as a teenager look we were all teenagers here at some point those of you that are past that point and some of you some of you are going through trials and situations right now you're going through attitude adjustments and changes and things that are happening with your body that you can't even fully comprehend yet I was there too come on Budd but you know there's something about the presence of the Lord oh yeah whenever that whenever the Pres when you come into the presence of the Lord it'll change that attitude it it'll change that that that thing that once held you back come on I was as I said at the beginning here I was that one that Mama had to force to come to church she I was the last one in the church doors and I was the first one out she made me be there yeah didn't have fellowship with nobody as soon as church was over Brother David I headed straight to the car I rolled up the windows I didn't want to talk to nobody I didn't want to be there but there was something see as this woman that I'm tell telling you about this this this this ill Fame woman here oh my she was going through that same thing she started she had a she was in a state of rebellion she was in things that her whole life she had been fighting against the things of God maybe some of you middle-aged ones or some of the older ones I realized the other day that I'm middle-aged now brother Ben I'm 36 you I'm my my life is about half over so I'm middle-aged now some of us middle-aged ones we've been fighting against the things of God some of you older ones you've been fighting against the things of God maybe you've become a little lukewarm or a little mossback Christian what brother Brown called it and we we we need to refreshen up amen and we need to quit fighting against the things of God we need to surrender and yield ourselves under the Holy Spirit tonight is This Woman This ill Fame woman that's walking by Simon's house and she's just observing in the window yeah oh my those that were in the church they were happy they were rejoicing they were they were having Fellowship yeah come on they weren't having fellowship with Jesus they weren't having fellowship with the word of God they were having a good time yeah but they didn't know the Lord Jesus they had placed him in the corner right and they didn't know Jesus come on see she was experiencing something that we all have to experience in this life she was experiencing something there was a a a warmth that was coming in our heart yeah come on that seed that had been placed there before the foundation of the world it it was starting to come to life there was something that was happening with and she didn't even fully understand it come on she didn't fully comprehend what was taking place but it was happening nonetheless come on and as she walked in she bought the ointment that she had bought and she started back down the road to Simon's house and no doubt she probably stopped two or three times I don't know that I can do this I don't know that I can go in here and all in front of all these people they know who I am how am I even going to be able to get into the house how how she she had to press her way into the house it had to come to a point just like the woman with a blood issue she had to get to Jesus she had to press her way through the crowd it come to the point that this woman here she pressed her way into the house no doubt the FL wased flunky he tried to stop her think about it brother David no doubt he tried no ma'am you can't go into the house the one that would would anoint him with oil no man you can't go into the I got to get in with Jesus where is that desper that desperation at tonight church we got to get to Jesus amen we have to have that desperation tonight I've got to get to Jesus she bypassed Simon and somehow she got to Jesus she pressed through the crowd and the moment that she got into the face in the presence of Jesus she started crying oh yeah all right she started yielding herself into the Holy Spirit she she's just wholeheartedly everything within her she just she just started breaking down come on I don't the Bible doesn't say exactly how old that this woman was but no doubt she had lived a terrible life before this she started breaking down she started repenting Lord forgive me oh come on Lord have mercy upon my heart and my soul merciful to me Lord oh yes she just starts weeping and she just starts crying just just surrendering herself unto the Holy Spirit yes there's something about when you come into the presence of the Lord Jesus yes you can't help but to cry you can't help but to weep you can't help but just to just to feel that presence it does something for you you just start yielding yourself into that Spirit yes she breaks open the spot nner yeah she starts anointing the Lord Jesus she starts just pouring it she didn't hold back any of it Church she didn't hold it back it didn't matter the cost of it she starts just pouring it everywhere the the the oil starts going everywhere it just starts it just starts flowing everywhere she you know yeah some of the Pharisees might have looked at her yeah said what is she doing come on some of those old back Christians come on so what is she doing come on yeah don't she know we could sell that don't she know that we we could we could take that and we could sell it and give it to the poor all right right yeah that's what they're thinking how who if he knew what manner of woman this was he wouldn't allow her to touch her right I thought he was supposed to be a prophet thought he was supposed to know the beginning from the end thought he was supposed to know who these people are they start thinking about all the things that they could do with the money that she has wasted anointing Jesus what is she doing why is she interrupting our party to anoint this man who is he all right she didn't care come on it didn't bother her who was looking at her anymore see you young people many times there were when when the presence of God is amongst us we get to worried about well what's so and so doing is my is my is my friend they got their hand up the preacher asked well let me see a show of hands do you do you want to do you repent right right come on now we've been there what's so and so done are they got their hand up are they are they going to go to the altar are they going to are they going to get baptized what what is so and so yeah not this woman come on it come to a point that all that didn't matter no more she she was surrendering herself unto the Lord Jesus Christ it didn't matter what brother was doing no more it didn't matter what sister was doing no more didn't matter what mama was doing no more it didn't matter what Daddy was doing no more amen she was surrendering herself under the Holy Spirit right said it didn't matter who was looking at her no more she was yielding she was crying she was weeping she was anointing Jesus and she started wiping Jesus's feet with the hairs of her head she was just completely surrendering herself unto the Lord can we do that tonight Church talking about having church tonight if we could just surrender ourselves unto the Lord Jesus Christ it would change every one of us it would make those that need a refilling they would get that refilling those that need the Holy Ghost to begin with they would get the Holy Ghost amen if you have need of healing you'd receive that healing salvation Deliverance whatever it is that we have need of there's no need for any of us to walk out of this building tonight without whatever it is that we have need of Amen way brother Brandon was yeah come on he said whenever the presence of the Lord would come down and he would get to praying for the people and he would call out this one over here call out this one over here but this one back you back there in the back and he then all of a sudden he would say oh it's just starting to get so milky in here the presence of the Lord just falling down is he not the same yesterday today and forever church amen I believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the Jesus that was back in Moses's day in Abraham's day the one that was back in in the days of brother Brian he's the same Jesus today man you have need of healing or Deliverance or salvation whatever it is that you have need of you can have that tonight that's what this woman at Simon's house she started to realize that there was something that was taking place within yes it didn't matter what anybody else was doing no more come on she was surrendering her life and everything that was unto her it didn't matter what nobody said about her no more it didn't matter what what what what the spectators were saying no more right she was falling in love with the Lord she was yielding herself un the holy spirit thank you Lord didn't matter Church yes come on brother Bram he says here he says the holy spirit will speak to your heart says and you'll say I want nothing to do with that Oh my he says you blind Pharisee he says you prostitute he said what's the matter with you come on he says committing adultery with the world he says that's what you're doing and you got remember he was talking to denominational people here but he says he said oh I belong to church he says and so cold and indifferent he says you you say your pretty prayers he says he says oh I hate that feric thing say oh you pray and you make every Comma just perfect and every period just perfect oh you pray so beautiful says and you can talk to God like that says you're listening to what you're saying and you're punctuating your prayer say oh God help you to turn loose once and pray says stop saying prayers he says oh fa es says plenty of them he says Pharisees he says you say I belong to church he says that's all right sure you do he says but what attitude do you take towards my Lord he says when he wants to come to you and bless you he says and you won't do it said oh no I don't believe in that kind of a stuff he said that's the same group I'm talking about he says very religious he said but very feric he says what did I say he says they was in the beginning he said says actors says quit acting religion he says get oldfashioned experience of regeneration he says Born Again says my Lord he longs to see you he he's waiting for you he says he takes the little place in the corner he never rebukes you for it he loves you he says you go to church once or twice a month he says you think you've done your duty say oh if you only loved him he said you'd go every night and every day say somewhere and he says and talk with him says if you loved him he said but the trouble of it is well get this come on he says you just act Church oh my oh my oh my you just act religious yeah he said what a Pity he says and it's too bad that we still have it yeah here we are what 60 years from when he said that how much worse is it in the day and the hour and what we're living in yeah come on yeah how much worse is it Church we're what four generations five generations since that time yeah sure since the since the message actually begun we're you know I was thinking about it brother Ivy mentioned something about it this morning I was thinking about it brother Ben and you I think I'm I'm a fourth generation message believer yeah in my family yeah how much worse how much more cold have we grew since the seals have been opened since the since the word has been opened unto us listen Church there has to be a ferency within our heart there has to be an Awakening within us that we long to get in the presence of the Lord Jesus that we long to have fellowship with one another that we just there there there's an urgency there's there's something within us that I've got to get with God's people oh gred Lord I've got to get to the Lord Jesus Christ yes that's not just here that's every day in our everyday walk in our everyday Journey we we ought to be in a constant prayer and constant fellowship with him seeking the Lord seeking his guidance seeking wisdom from him making time to read our Bibles right and pray is that what brother brand said how that's how we get closer to the Lord Lord if we read our Bibles and we pray We All Fall guilty of it hey I'm just as busy as the next person maybe sometimes more busy I feel like sometimes I work all day got seven kids and one on the way and we we're always doing something we're always going we always got things happening but sometimes we just need to step back say Lord I've got to make time for you because we're all busy aren't we we're all we're all always like this right here yeah or is it just me come on now we're all like that true buddy if we're not working if we're not talk if we're not doing something else we're like this yeah and if we're not careful we don't make any time for this I'm not trying to rebuke you tonight I'm just we we got to check up we come to church to check up right amen I I want to be right with the Lord I want to make a Rapture I want to get out of here yes sir I don't know if you've looked around but this whole world's done gotten crazy politics are crazy everything is corrupt people's gone insane we see all the storms and the the hurricanes and the the earthquakes that are happening the brother was back here in the back was telling us you know this town over here got hit with a a tornado and earthquake at the same time that the Earth the world's going crazy what did what does the Bible say was it in Matthew 24 when these things start to happen look up for your Redemption draw us now it's time that we start looking for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen it's time that we start having a hunger and a thirsting for the things of God it's time that we look we can we can come to church we can have a good time and I believe in having a good time when we come to church I believe in singing and worshiping brother Jason appreciate the special he thought he was going to pwn it off on the kids on the way here and he end up having to do it himself and you know we long to hear good worship and being able to come together and good preaching and all those things but if we're just coming together as the Pharisees did and tipping our wine glasses together and having a good time and Jesus is back here over here in the corner we didn't come we didn't have church amen we have to have fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ we have to have fellowship with the word of God we've got to get our old cold Stony heart to the side take on a heart of Flesh that we can feel we can feel the the the presence to the Lord Jesus whenever it comes about whenever Jesus is with us we can feel his presence and this in be in the serenity of the spirit we just give ourselves over to him amen truth I don't even know where I'm at in my notes but you know brother brand he says he says here in another place he says he said oh you Pharisee nudging somebody else he says look at your own self once he oh you might not he says you might not be sexually wrong in your actions you might not drink liquor he said but you blind Pharisee he says what he said what you doing in my he said what are you doing to my Lord oh he say what do you do to him he said you could uh hardly he said you cold-heartedly hypocrite he said you turn him down you you think the preachers today preach hard brother Ben we don't hold a can on the window brother brandham brother brandham was hard he says you turn him down says what do you do for he says how can you do it says to see his presence all around you to know he's there wanting to bless you and Entertain You he says but you're too good he said oh you never become wretched he says you ought to look at yourself in God's looking glass one time and see how you look oh that how dirty are we when we look at God's looking glass he said you're self-righteous all your little forms and and Petty things will fade away say little Traditions he said I can see her he says she must hurry it's getting late he's talking about this this woman again and there there's an urgency there there's a sincerity there there's got to be something I've got to hurry I've got to get to Jesus and when she gets to Jesus she just starts giving it all unto him she didn't she didn't hold back brother Joel she didn't she she opened every door of her heart to she didn't try to C sometimes as young people we try to well you can have this Lord but you can't have this see you try to give the Lord Jesus ultimatums I open every door but I got I want to keep this one thing come no doesn't work that way come on even some of us older ones it doesn't work that way we can't we can't give Jesus everything but hold on to one thing right come on cuz you know there's nothing we can keep from him anyways he already knows about it yes come on he he already knows what you're doing in in in behind the door somewhere he already knows what you're trying to hide you might as well give it to him anyway so we get so caught up in fleshly things and so car so carnally minded all the time that we come on we think God don't see we think that he doesn't know see got we have to come to a point in our lives church that it doesn't matter no more it doesn't matter what somebody else thinks about me no more come on it doesn't matter what what it doesn't matter what the preacher thinks about me no more it doesn't matter what Mom or Daddy thinks about me no more preach come on I've got to come down to the Altar and I've got to give myself unto the Lord I got to surrender my heart my life you know what when you get up you walk a little differently oh yes you'll behave a little differently I I was that one whereever and you just forgive me for being personal I don't know how else to preach other than just be that way but you know what I was that one whenever and I've gave this illustration before and you you just forgive me for it but I was that one whenever I walked into the door I thought everybody I thought I was the best thing in the room brother be you Josh is here hello but you know there's something about you come on when you give yourself unto the Lord right he'll take that Pride away from him oh yeah he has a way of breaking those things down yes he does he has a way of changing your walk I had a walk whenever I was a teenager I thought I was the hottest thing since sliced bread and I had a walk about me to prove it but you know I remember whenever I I gave my heart to the Lord and the Lord had he knows how to get a hold of you young people I I was raised in a message church I never abided by the word of God I never wanted to surrender over to the will of God yeah right you know I was 18 years old a senior in high school and one night I had a dream and in that dream you say well God don't know how to get a hold of me God knew exactly how to get a hold of me yes he does he gave me a dream one night yes sir and in that dream it was my grandpa talking to me he'd done been passed off the scene for many years and he said Josh he said I remember whenever you used to come over to the house all right and you would read Revelations 10 and he named off another scripture and being raised in the message I had never read Revelations 10 do we do you know you young people do you know the importance of Revelations 10 yeah and I got up that morning brother Ben and I got up and I found my Bible yeah what what is the why would why would I have a dream like this knowing I've never read Revelations 10 before never read this other scripture before yeah I got up the next morning and I found my Bible and I read that scripture yeah and there was something there that from that moment forward right something started changing in my life I started hungering for the things of God picked up a seals book and I started reading the seals book and at the time I was going with a Baptist girl going to the Baptist Church I didn't quit going to the MST church I was going to a Baptist Church going with this girl and all of a sudden I started getting this urgency I need to get baptized well how do you baptize how do we what do we baptize in and so I talked to the to the Baptist ministry and he starts talking to me about the way they baptizing the Trinity and all these things and here I am reading the seals book and brother brandom he's he lays it out but I couldn't see it in in my carnality couldn't understand it and just all of a sudden one night I was reading and it's like the Lord flipped on a switch yeah all right I had to go get baptized I went the very next Sunday and I I went to my pastor I said or the local church there I said I got to get baptized something within me had started to change thank you Lord there was a seed that had been laying there since before the foundation of the world it started to come to fruition it started to come to life God knows how to get ah hold of you young people he knows how to get a hold of some of you middle-aged people some of you older ones that maybe have grown a little cold in the message he knows how to get a hold of us tonight church amen we we all need to to to to check up we all need to to be refilled with the holy ghost from time to time amen we need that we need that refilling of the Holy Spirit to be be revigor and be on fire for the things of God Amen we have to have those things God knows how to get hold of you just like he knew how to get a hold of this woman right yes she he placed her at that appointed time come on God knew before the foundation of the world yeah that that woman that night all right would be walking by Simon's house and there was something within her yes sir that would change from that very point Thank You Lord God knew before the foundation of the world that you would be here tonight something could change tonight within your heart and within within your life amen there's something that could take place brother [Music] brandom he says here see this woman had an experience a transformation and maybe this this maybe this is my own words here that could not she no one else could fathom yeah come on she had been Justified yeah she had been Sanctified come on and she had been baptized with the Holy Ghost her past were filled with transgressions that's right it had been washed away yes by the love and the mercy of Jesus Christ thank you Lord see yet the people in the house including Simon they watched her with disgust come on they could not understand why Jesus would allow such a woman to touch him and let alone wash his feet and dry them with her hair yeah and as she knelt before Jesus her tears started streaming down her face yeah come on she poured out all of her sorrow all of the Gratitude she had been shown love that was pure and unconditional oh yeah a peace that surpassed all understanding yeah see it was a longsuffering and a patience that only the Divine could possess see it was the fruits of the spirit were evident in Jesus sir every action toward her Jesus he could have pulled his feet away brother Ben that's right he said no come on what are you doing yeah yes sir but he just sat there yeah he did he allowed this woman to do this yes yes see the room it buzzed with murmurs of disapproval yeah that's right all right how could he let her do this all right they whispered yeah doesn't he know what kind of a woman this is but Jesus saw beyond their judgment right thank you Lord he saw a soul in in R need of redemption a heart yearning for forgiveness oh yeah he knew that that woman despite her past had a faith that was pure and genuine see it was in that moment Jesus he turned to Simon and to the others do you see this woman he asked oh yes I entered into your house Simon and you gave me no water for my feet right yeah but she has washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head you gave me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in Simon come on has not ceased to kiss my feet oh yes you did not anoint my head with oil but this woman has anointed my feet with fragrant oil the room fell silent as Jesus spoke what once was loud and wine glasses clanking together they were dancing and they were rejoicing now as Jesus as the word is speaking to them the room is silent oh my come on he says therefore I say to you her sins come on which are many he says are forgiven thank you Lord for she loved much says but to whom little is Forgiven the name loves little uhuh he says then he turned to the woman and his voice gentle and full of compassion oh yeah could you imagine at this point as this woman she just she's slobbering she's crying yeah uhhuh she's completely beside herself come on and as she hears the voice of Jesus yeah he says your sins are forgiven oh yeah your faith has saved you go in peace thank you Lord that's good see it was in that moment the woman felt a weight lift from her soul Oh Glory to God the Judgment of others no longer mattered come on didn't matter no more Church she had been forgiven by the only one who had the power to truly cleanse her of her past yes sir she left Simon's house with a heart full of joy her spirit renewed by the grace and the love of Jesus Amen see yes it's this story at s of the woman at Simon's house it's a powerful reminder Brother David of the transformative power and the forgiveness and the boundless love of the Divine it teaches us that no matter our past some of us have a some of us have a very hard path we can find Redemption and peace in the Embrace of Grace yes we got to have love for one another church yes do yes that's right reach out when others are hurting yes come on get rid of our pride all of our anger all of our bitterness and have love one for another we have to surrender and yield ourselves in the Holy Spirit Come on could we just maybe as the musicians would come could we just could you just bow your heads with me oh maybe you don't know the Lord Jesus Christ tonight like this woman here I'm not going to ask for a show of hands or anything like that but maybe the Lord's dealing with you as he dealt with this woman as she was walking by Simon's house maybe your heart is burning within you I've got to get to the Lord Jesus I've got to to surrender and I've got to yield myself unto the Lord I've got to have forgiveness of my past I've got to have forgiveness of the things that I've done maybe some of you young people you've never truly had an experience with the Lord it can happen in a moment just just in the blink of an eye he forgive you of every sin every trans transgression he'll change your attitude he'll change your walk he'll make you a new person you just have to surrender and yield yourself unto him maybe some of you middle-aged ones or
