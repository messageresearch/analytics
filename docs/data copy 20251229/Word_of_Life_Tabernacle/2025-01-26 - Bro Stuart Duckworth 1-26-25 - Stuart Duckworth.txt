move upon every life Lord we pray we just ask these things now in Jesus name amen you love the Lord this morning we turn the scriptures to Second Peter 1 and one certainly enjoy the Pres pres of the Lord so far this morning second Peter 1 and one just kind of speak of just a title of inspired by the Divine Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious faith I like that with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given us unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the Cor coruption that is in the world through lust amen you can be seated this morning he's talking here to partake of his divine power and his divine power has given us all things he says here to be made partakers of the divine nature and I just kind of something that I thought of of what are we inspired by are we inspired more of of of the things of this Earth of the things of this life or are we inspired more of the things above and I just trust by the end of this service we're more inspired by the things above amen but what you just think of what are we inspired by what or who is inspiring us to do the things that we do to say the things that we say what are our um motives and OB objectives what are our what are our desires what what is sitting on the control tower of your heart and for the Christian for the believer that should be the Holy Ghost That should be the one that's motivating you the one that you know uh when the humanity there's always going to be Humanity there but that that Holy Ghost has our Humanity in check and he's the one that's uh ultimately controlling us and inspiring us and and influence influencing Our Lives yes and is that how you want to live that is that how we want to be we want to be more uh controlled by the Heavenly than by the Earthly because the Earthly will will keep you down it will drag you down but the Heavenly amen the portion of the word that has been allotted to us that portion of Heaven has called us and it is should be drawing us up higher and drawing us from the things of this life so what is motivating us what is your and what is your attitudes what is your attitude towards him this morning what is your life testifying of Are We drawing from him or are we drawing from the Earthly are we drawing from him if we're drawing from him from him is it's life it's sustaining life it's victory it's overcoming power and from him if if we're drawing from him it's that sustaining life and brother R says here 1963 testimony he said there there's a spirit behind everything yeah and I I don't know if I'd ever even listened to this sermon I I've listened to a lot of them I feel like I listened to most of them but um this sermon was just such a a faith Builder but he says here the church was put here for a purpose there is a spirit behind this church where he was preaching at certainly there's a spirit behind your home behind every building behind everything there is a spirit a motive and objective and this church here uh comes here to greatly exalt some human system or something then its motives is not right but if it's put here to try to achieve something for the kingdom of God then the motive and objective both is right and the motives if the motives is directed that way isn't that what we want our motives to be this morning not to build up ourselves not to build up uh this church and what we can do not to build up our idea but to do something for the kingdom of God that's why we're here this morning that's why we serve God is to do something for Jesus do something that would bring him glory the only thing that you're that's going to matter over in in heaven over in glory on the other side of the Rapture is what you do for him not what you can do for yourself or build up but what you can do for him right those are the ET etal things and those are the things that that are going to last the people that you can influence the people that you can that you can help and and and we as the children of God Amen we should treat each other with respect we should treat each other as Sons and Daughters of God as the Sons and Daughters of God that we are we're here to help that's the purpose of the church is to help and to to carry on to be the body of Christ to be what he was when he walked the Earth we are brother and said we We Are The Reincarnation of him back on this Earth in in your life in my life from the greatest to the least by the Holy Ghost it's him back in you but I I just begin to think that you know what what has influenced me as as a man as a as a young child as a as a teenager um you know I grew up around the message I grew up hearing these things and and and what what drew me what what has inspired me why do I believe what I believe and and we know that that we are identified by this word with this word not just by just by somebody handing you a book or or you opening your Bible and and reading a scripture and something but but we are identified because we are the gene seed of God and because uh we are the word we were able to receive the word and so we are identified in that way but but by the way of of ministry and by the way of of of the seventh angel and and the Elijah Prophet we have been influenced and I believe this morning you should be inspired by the message of the hour you should be so inspired that you want to feed upon it that you want to listen that you want to listen to it that you want to hear it that you want to open your Bible that you want to receive inspiration amen from from the word of God yes and let that rule your life let that be what motivates you because brother renam said he said our motives and our objectives everything that we are our desire should be on Jesus Christ but I begin to think that you know what what is the n what is the nature or the spirit behind the message of the hour uh and I I believe it was not to build up a man or to build up a Ministry or there was something that we could make a relic out of and so something that we could just simply point back to but I believe it brought us something I believe it brought us something that would Inspire Our Lives amen for the for the rest of our lives that once we came in contact with it we could never be the same because it was something that changed us something that inspired us it was something from Heaven something that was a man-made come on right so I look the very Spirit of the message itself was to point us to Jesus Christ brother Bram never pointed us to himself but he always tried to point us to Jesus Christ never pointed us to his own ideas but he would try to take us back to the word back to the word point us back to that right to have the right kind of Faith so the spirit of the message itself to me was to glorify Christ to point us to him the spirit of the message is to point you to him and inspire you and draw you to God you begin to see the things that you know as a as a young person or as a young adult or whenever you receive the message or come in contact with it no doubt we' seen the picture of the pillar of fire and how the supernatural identified itself with this message with this ministry and that has inspired us that's something that we look to and it's something that's different than nobody else had that the the scientific that came the lens caught that and it took a picture of that and for after 2,000 years God identified himself back in that form again why because he was identifying himself he was inspiring a generation he was inspiring amen Sons and Daughters of God right good yes we seen the pillar of fire how it has identified itself we begin to look at the manifestation of the son of man and how that Ministry from the Scripture it had to come Jesus said whatsoever I the things that I do shall ye do also so that Ministry had to come Jesus spoke more of his second coming than he did his own death and mean he talked about the return of the son of man when that Ministry would come and that Ministry man when it when it was manifested there was nothing like it there'll never be nothing else like it why because it was sent to the church it had to come back to the Gentile church and inspire you and I amen something from the heavens something from the scriptures something Divine amen not something from the Earth but something Divine inspiring you and I that we could see God manifested that's what should Inspire us yes we we've seen the manifestation of the son of man we've seen the supernatural we've seen the the the we've heard about the things and we we we've heard testimonies of of the supernatural that was so identified in the Ministry of Elijah and the ministry of the seventh angel and me as a as a young young young man I you know you would hear it sounding so strange you'd hear squirrels were spoken to existence and this was spoken to existence and this cancer was spoke out of existence and I just couldn't understand that as a as a child squirrel why would God do that but God had to vindicate his word in this hour he had to inspire you and I amen and that that is what has inspired us amen such Supernatural such creating power amen amen and brother Brandon would identify that as a third pool Amen in that third pool a as as those things were being created it was identifications it was to let us know what was coming and he would say the third pole is the opening of the word the fullness of the third pole the fullness of that Ministry was to give us an open word something that would Inspire us something that would turn our Hearts back amen because it is these Mysteries these divinely revealed Mysteries he said that that will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers not to not to build up a kingdom not to bring us to another denomination but to bring the power of God to bring the Divine Among Us amen something that would change your nature amen these precious great exceeding precious promises these things that were manifested to us amen that we might be made partakers of that divine nature amen that Supernatural wasn't just for brother brown but that Supernatural is for you this morning amen when he spoke those things amen it wasn't exclusive amen but whatsoever you say you say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea you can have whatsoever you ask for but you got to be inspired by something this morning amen those scriptures inspired the word is inspired but you yourself have got to be divinely inspired this morning that's what we've been inspired by the ministry of the seventh angel the sounding of that voice the ministry of Elijah literally turning our hearts back to be influenced amen and in that message testimony you should go listen to it brother randam he starts out he starts talking about the tapes and how they're recording the tapes he said I went back and listened myself amen yeah trying not to say Amen a bunch this morning I'll try come on but he himself went back to listen to that voice yes because there was an anointing speaking through him there was a voice Beyond his voice and you got to look behind Beyond the Veil of the man this morning to see the voice of God to hear the voice of God and if you can look beyond that you can receive inspiration this morning amen you can receive inspiration when you turn on turn on a tape and you begin to feed on the voice of God for your day you're not feeding on a man he said we're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man you can go listen to Christ the mystery of God revealed I guarantee you can go listen to it a hundred times and you'll hear something new amen every time you here there will be something fresh when you turn on the message if you come with an Earnest heart say God inspire me by the revealed word of this hour turn my heart let my heart be turned back in this hour to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers all right one I guarantee you there'll be something fresh yes that's good sir amen yes there will be something fresh for you this morning if you if you desire that there's something something fresh amen yes sir good so that's the nature I believe that's the nature of this message it was the power of the spoken word it was the opening of the word and these things have inspired us that's what we identified with this morning yeah in 1964 then Jesus came and called he says Identify yourself in your present State now where you're standing with some with some Bible character where would you have been where would you have lived in Noah's time where would you have been where would you have been in the days of the Lord Jesus when he was here on Earth in his flesh what group would you be identified tonight just think of it he said just look back in a Looking Glass we can see where whatever we what we are now that's what we'd have been back there that's what we'd have been back there because the spirit that's in us now identified back there that's the same spirit that was on them back there yes amen how would you be identified this morning amen would you would you would you be in the ark would you be there building the ark with Noah or would you be the one of them just laughing at him yeah and and the message the message was it's going to rain we've got to build an ark we've got to build a boat something that will carry us over and this boat was was something that was designed by God a certain way that would carry them through would you call that fanaticism would you call it crazy so you got to look back and see the spirit that you're under now and that will tell you then when Jesus begin to tell the disciples the truth he begin to brother R say he begin to let the hammer down to clean out the church he begin to let the hammer down and the 70 walked away and Jesus asks his disciples will you go also and Peter there said under the inspiration said Lord to whom would we go is that would that be your response in this hour is that your response when the word comes and it cuts and it cleans amen and it drives away and it cuts away the things from our life amen can you handle the truth in this hour because that's what the message does that's what the message it sets you apart in this hour if you can take the cleaning out of God Amen if you can stand there as a son and be perished amen it sets you apart in this hour good yes it's trueu to not leave to not leave but say Lord you have the words of eternal life you have the words of inspiration we've been touched by this ministry we've been touched by the things you said it cuts me it hurts sometimes but we've been inspired Amen to stand and to stay with the truth truth and to identify ourselves with it yes sir good and we just want to look here in inspired by the Divine and I want to say this morning that you've been divinely chosen yes preach with me this morning you've been divinely chosen and our opening scriptures to them that have obtained a like Precious faith and we're going to get into something a little bit different here but but I I think it'll be good to them that have obtained a like Precious fa faith and we want to we just want to stir up your mind this morning to uh awaken you Amen to these things just that word obtain means to be one's lot to cast lots to obtain by a lot to receive by Divine allotment obtain to cast lots determined by a lot so we look at casting a lot there and stay with me here in the Bible times many things were determined by casting a lot and and it would be like today or you know flipping a coin we're going to you know we're going to see uh who's going to buy a lunch so we'll flip a coin you know it would be kind of something like that or rolling the dice as it would be and so casting this lot and and in those times they would way I understand it they would take stones and just to maybe make it simple you would write a y on this Stone and n on this stone for yes and no and and maybe have another one with a why and a no on on each side and you would throw that and you would bring your question you would bring your desire or whatever uh answer you needed you would bring that and you would cast that lot and it would let you know what to do and so they would cast these stones and and Aaron would cast a lot on the day of atonement to determine which goats they use for sacrifice Joshua divided up the land by casting lots Nehemiah used lost to determine who carried the wood used to burn upon the altar at Jerusalem's Temple Jonah after he ran trying to get out of what God told him to do got on this ship going to going to tarus got on this ship trying to avoid the task but they're on that ship they ran into a storm and they was in jeery of of of losing the ship and those on the ship used lots to determine it was Jonah and his behavior that had put their lives at risk and the winds and the waves after the prophet was thrown into the sea that they finally turned calm Jesus Matthew 27-35 and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture they did cast lots so here in a in an evil away they gambled away Jesus's garments two young ladies had made him brother R said two young ladies had made him this garment it was without seam it was one piece they had made this this garment brother Ram said he he went he lived in this this garment he went to sleep in it and he died in it this Was His Garment and they fulfilled the scripture that it might be fulfilled and they gambled away they they cast lots and so they were inspired to do that I want to say this morning what are you inspired to do are you inspired to to lift up the word are you inspired to to to to turn away from the word I I want to be inspired to lift up the word amen when Judas had betrayed Jesus and faed they cast their loss this where I'm trying to get to they they cast their lost for replacement in Acts one before the Holy Ghost fell before the leadership of the Holy Ghost they cast lot and it fell upon maias and brother Brown said the church chose Mathias but God chose Paul and he says here in the sign of this time he said look even the apostles after they had tried to choose one because of Judas Fallen the cast lots and the fell my th and that was the best that they could do with the Keys of the Kingdom before the Holy Ghost and there is not a scripture wrote where mithas he says did anything he said but God chose Paul a little ill-tempered fellow but he had to throw him on his back one day let him look up a while and he said I'll show him the great things that he must suffer for me he said see the church chose Mias but God chose Paul and see that's the difference God always does the Choosing by his election his election God does that by his election and by his for knowledge amen amen it's God's election that does the right kind of choosing you and I we can make the wrong decision but God's decision is always the right decision it's not by man's choosing or by chance of casting lot the church would have never chose Paul they would have never chose him he was a murderer and and persecuting them but as that word obtained it says but but by Divine allotment by Divine allotment by by divine inspiration God knew the plan that he had for Paul he knew the election and the the destiny that he had for him and by Divine allotment and the counsil of God's own will he chose Paul to be his messenger by his own counsel by his own advice he didn't need to ask nobody about it but by his own advice by his own counsel he chose Paul amen chose Paul above the others Paul said I was like one born out of season he never knew Jesus in the flesh but he met that Pillar of Fire he chose Paul to be one of the Seven Stars in his right hand to reflect the light the power of Jesus Christ to reflect divine inspiration good Budd we look here Peter these scriptures here be Peter being one that cast a lot from meas no doubt in this epistle was somewhat he somewhat had Paul in his mind speaking of those you this morning that obtained by Divine allotment this precious Faith through the right ousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ amen the the world may Overlook you the church May Overlook you they may have overlooked you the world may have overlooked you I may overlooked you but the Holy Ghost this morning the Holy Ghost knows who he is by God's election he has called you in this hour and just as Paul was was called to represent the light and every messenger that came was called to represent the light for that day but they passed that light on and we become light Bears they were light bears under that influence of that light and that that word that portion that came and we become amen we become inspired by that same portion and I want to say this morning Be Inspired this morning by what God's given you be inspired amen not by me screaming and shouting and yelling amen but get into the word get into Christ amen there's an anointing in this message there's an anointing a Rapture anointing that will lift you up from the Earthly and bring you to the Heavenly yes oh come on buddy it's good good preacher the Holy Ghost knows this morning who's his are you his this morning amen you identify yourself with him and he identifies himself with you he knows who are his we just s to look at Paul's experience of divine experience acts 9 And1 and Saul yet breathing out threatening and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they be whether they're men or women he might bring them bound into Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near to damasc and suddenly there shine round about him a light from heaven so here was Paul here was Paul though he was elected here was Paul running as hard as he could riding as fast as he could with these letters full of hatred but there he was struck down by a voice by a light from Heaven amen he was struck down to the Earth by this light at the sound of this voice screaming Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and so we look there that whatever you do to the elect of God that's the same as doing it to Jesus Christ Jesus wasn't walking in the face of the Earth but as the church was being persecuted they were persecuting Jesus and so whatsoever you do to the least amount Jesus said you've done it unto me and we should always watch how we treat one another always watch what we say in the church age book he said elect can't persecute elect elect doesn't persecute anyone right that's right but we look here Paul he didn't know he was elected he didn't know yet but he was about to find out you had that moment where you found out come on right you're running as hard as you can yeah you're running away from the things of God you're you got hatred in your heart towards this one and that one but something struck you down you came in contact with the light with a voice acts 9 and5 he he said who art thou Lord and I said he and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and he trembling and astonished said Lord what wil thou have me do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and as shall be told thee what thou must do yes so after this Divine calling and inspiration Paul's life was completely changed one minute he's riding as hard as he can one way in that direction and the next he's going to complete opposite instead of him looking to persecute and kill he became the one being persecuted and hunted but that's what happens when when you turn to God Amen we were running as as hard as we could the other way we were running towards hell we were driving 100 miles an hour towards hell we were going that direction nobody could talk us out of it but a lot shown in your path one day someone a Christian somebody somebody just came and spoke something to you and Shine the Light to you somebody said why don't you come to church and that little bit of hope that little bit of glimmer uh maybe maybe God does care about me to send somebody my way amen that's the lot of Jesus Christ shining amen through you and I is to give hope to a dying generation come on amen amen nobody ever talked to you nobody ever preached about you against you what what does God really think about you right if he's correcting me that means he loves me that's right right that's right so he was going one way and he turned around and going the next and we were running as hard as we could and when something changed in us we didn't we didn't try to go back that way we turned and we went the other way yes right right and when you start serving when you start serving God and begin to obey this revealed truth all hell gets upset brother R said all hell is against this truth all hell is against this teaching all hell is against the move of God in your life friends will forsake you family will forsake you but I want to say this morning if you're divinely inspired by something greater than yourself if you're divinely inspired by the power of God and by the nature of God there's nothing that can turn you back amen you'll either fight you'll either fight your way to hell this morning or you'll fight your way to heaven boys you can make up the decision you can you can figure out what you want to do young ladies you'll fight your way to hell or you'll fight your way to heaven I say let's take up let's take up our swords this morning let's take up our swords in this hour amen and fight our way let's press our way press the darkness press the battle in this hour it's going to be a struggle one way or the other right either which way you go it's a fight you just got to choose this morning what are you what are you being influenced by are you being influenced to goow this way or that way amen so it's and it's it's by this Divine allotment that God has called you and I obtain this precious Faith Divine allotment God not by chance not by Rolling of the dice not by this brother's choosing and this sister's choosing of of who's in and out but God divinely alloted God divinely chose you in this hour from his thinking you love the Lord this morning amen Lord I how long have I've been preaching only 10 minutes feels like an hour Revelations 181 this is what we've been influenced by revelations 18:1 and a strong Angel claim proclaiming with a loud voice come down from heaven proclaiming with the loud voice B said he had great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory this was the ministry of God upon the Earth it's the Cry of the holy spirit in this hour in this last days and that cry was come out of Babylon come out of the confusion of this world and his false systems and it goes on there how how the The Babylon this this system this world this world this chaos it had become the habitation of the devil of every foul and unclean Spirit the spirit of hatred the spirit of hatred for the revealed truth amen that would clean and purify their souls unto God and this is what I believe we we should we've been influenced by revelations 18:4 and I heard another voice just as Paul heard that voice we've heard another voice from the scripture saying come out of her my people that she be not partakers of her sin and that she receive not of her plagues amen that's the voice that called out in this hour that's the voice that has spoke forth in this hour a Ministry the voice of the Holy Ghost that come to the Earth Amen to to call out a Church to call out a people Amen to influence a people to inspire people to come out and brother R says here does God change his mind he says the church itself that the word church means called out come out those who have come out come out of her my people be ye separate sayith the Lord and I will receive you unto myself touch not the their unclean things the Church of God is called out of the world out of the chaos you're no more of the world and when God calls you out out when God calls you out he doesn't call you out so he can lose you he doesn't call you so you can go back and get all muddled up and get filthy again but when God calls you out he calls you out and he sanctifies you holy and he fills you holy yes right yes and me he brings us to himself good buddy he brings us out by this divine power and places into us this divine nature as Peter talked about amen and that nature will it changes your old nature it changes your old ways it changes your old filthy habits you had a nature to sin we were born with a nature to sin but when that new nature comes when that divine nature comes it's his nature and it kills out that old sin nature amen and it gives you the nature of God and when that nature of God comes in it begins to influence your spirit it begins to influence your flesh and you begin to alline up with the word of God and when you get out of the way when you get out of Step amen It's Quickly there to line you back out that's right we've got to stay yes under that inspiration that's right stay under that influence more than the other I hope this is all right this morning let's read you a quote here 1963 almighty God we thank thee tonight from the depths of our hearts for the love of Christ that's been shed abroad in our hearts in these last days by the Holy Spirit we thank thee because that we have the the privilege of assembling ourselves together and worshiping thee and having this Blessed assurance that someday you're coming for your church we thank thee to be the lightbearers of this age to be here ready to manifest the promised word for your age that we're living in knowing that in the beginning you allotted out your word knowing the end from the beginning each age you allotted your word to that age and he says somehow we don't know how it ever happened but in each age each of those ages as we look back upon th word and we see there was an anointing that come in that age that fulfilled that word and we can look here this morning we don't know how God's going to do it how's he going to Rapture his church how how's he go make make it all work out how's he going to line everything out and and manifest every promise but there's an anointing amen if you can look back if your faith can look back as the prophet said if we can look back every time that anointing came down to manifest that promise that alloted word that's good so we're depending upon that anointing the anointing of that of this age yes and the days that we're living in he says there's an allotted word I promis for this age and we believe that the holy spirit is here on the earth now trying to find Hearts to manifest and to bring it to pass by vindicating the word that's now prophesied for this day and this hour I say this morning the holy spirit is still calling he's still searching for hearts he's still looking for somebody that can he can anoint the devil's looking for somebody that he can anoint somebody that he can influence and if he's on the scene God is that much more on the scene this morning if you can if you can look into the world and see how influenced they are God is here searching out and trying to influence he's searching for heart this morning he's searching for young people he's searching for middle-aged people he's searching for adults I'm not trying to evangelize everybody here this morning but maybe there's there's one person amen I would like to let you know there's a glimmer of hope if you have a desire to serve God if there's a little inclination in you this morning I pray you entertain that I pray that you come today in the coming days and the the things that are spoken today I pray that that hope of Jesus Christ anchors in your heart that there's still a chance this morning there's still a chance the holy spirit is still calling in this hour amen is here upon the Earth come out of her my peop amen the word of this age the anointing is here to manifest it to you this morning he's looking for somebody he can influence and Inspire by the things he's done by the infallible proofs what great infallible proofs we've seen yes they've inspired us come on now they've changed our lives we can never be the same right you can never be the same when you come in contact with this light you can never be the same right amen looking for somebody this morning that he can hide away amen he could take the sinner just as Aaron went into the holy of holies he took that Dead stick in the Old Testament there he took that Dead stick in the holy of holies or that sh kind of Glory was and there that Rod that Rod begin to Blossom from that presence and that's what he does when he takes the sinner we're dead in sins and trespasses but when you come and you come become hidden away in Christ when you become hidden away in that presence it begins to to bring a fruitfulness in your life there's a refreshing that comes there's a life that pours out from you and it begins to shoot forth from that which was dead and it brings forth life yeah and it yields only from that presence the life that was in that Rod it was an almond stick and it brought forth almond and from that divine presence it brought forth almond and only from that divine presence will it bring forth love will it bring forth Joy will it bring forth peace will it bring forth a clean life will it bring forth a filled Sanctified Holy Ghost filled life only in that presence oh he's searching for hearts this morning that he might feel that he might refill that he might bring a fresh and inspiration for the Rapture amen 1959 what was the Holy Ghost given for say Amen what are you going to do each person sitting here is filled with something you're filled with something you can't sit here and be full of something you've got a life in you and that life governs you and that life is governed by Spirit he says here you might be full of the world loving the world and the things of the world he said God be merciful to you you might be full of Creeds of from some church and and some little prayers and I think to pray to some dead person and do some sign of the cross but God be merciful to you you may be full of religion he said that's worth saided having a form of godliness but denying the power of he said then again you may be full of the Holy Ghost you may be full of the Holy Ghost and I hope you are he says and if you're not I'll hope you give full you can be full this morning you can be full amen if you've never been filled you can be f if you want to be refilled you can be refilled amen it's not an emotional workout but if you want it this morning it's for you I mean we can stand up here and act like a bunch of idiots preaching amen but God's got something

hope in these children and these young people and somebody that's been out of the way I'll stand up here and look like an idiot amen but there's a God if you desire in this morning amen he's here

chosen in this hour his Divine allotment by God's choosing his Divine allotment brings us the faith or the divine inspiration that we need from the Holy Spirit and faith in the inspired word produces

have need of healing amen amen the power of God is present to give it to you I pray today if you're dealing with a sickness you're dealing with a trouble I pray the supernatural god of the message the

supernatural God of Elijah is on the scene this morning you can have it if you just receive it if you accept it and believe that it's for you yeah that's true the god of Elijah did not go off the scene in 1965 but he's the same yesterday today and forever amen we'll never have a Ministry like that but I if I can bring you a little bit of hope this morning healing is yours salvation's yours everything that the the every Redemptive blessing that Jesus Christ died for is yours this morning sir all right it's yours this morning it's yours this morning yes we ought to come to church like

washing machine not just a new fancy car amen but amen rapturing faith is yours this morning amen rapturing Grace this salvation for your children is yours this morning healing from cancer healing from diabetes is yours this morning we've been inspired D to believe these things we've been inspired by the supernatural by the opening of the word we've been inspired by the third pole the power of creation to believe for these things 1 Thessalonians 1:4 knowing Brethren beloved your election of God for our God gospel came not in you in word only but also in power in the Holy Ghost and much assurance and as you know what man of men we were among you for your sake and you became followers of us and of the Lord re having received the word in much Affliction not easy to receive the word hard sometimes right but you receive it with Affliction we receive it with the joy of the Holy Ghost that word election there means chosen the act of picking out you've been divinely chosen this morning thank you Lord goes on there choosing used of the act of God's Free Will by which before the foundation of the world he decreed His blessings to the certain persons the decree made from the choice by which he determined to bless certain persons through grace through through Christ by grace so it's determined amen he's determined this morning he's determined before the foundation of the world he picked you out he chose you and it's determined by Grace this morning amen God is determined and that word determined means firmly set in one's decision a course of action especially with the aim of achieving a particular goal extremely motivated and unlikely to quit or change their mind that's the God we serve this this morning God is extremely motivated amen he's extremely uh he's extremely uh interested in your life he's extremely motivated in bringing amen you to where you need to be and God can never change his mind he's determined he's characterized by great determination this is who he is he's determined to get it done just like Donald Trump he going to get the deal done the walls going back up to day illegals are leaving he's determined to get it done but he going to be he going to be done in four years somebody else is coming in but in four years God he'll still remain the same he'll still be the same yesterday today and forever don't put your faith in politics am man I hope they do everything they can do my faith not in Donald Trump my faith isn't in JD Vance a Catholic we're under a different influence this morning we're under a different Spirit we've come out of the system we've come out out of the politics and these politics they're going to unite themselves against the church amen the world is uniting itself against the church amen and the bride is uniting itself with the word that's good want say again this morning God picked you you weren't just a thought of God you didn't just remain in his thought but he he that's his very character he was determined and so he's he picked you he said he specifically placed you he specifically picked you you didn't just stay in his M but he picked this one out he said they're supposed to be right here they're supposed to be in the last day they're not supposed to be here when I'm walking Earth but I've chose them to live in the hardest time the hardest age and I've elected them to stand in that day amen he chose you in this hour to partake of his divine grace and salvation Be Inspired this morning amen it came not in word only it came not in word only but it came in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost the word is inspired this morning if you can be inspired this morning you can have what you asked for amen it came not in word only it came not uh the Rapture message amen uh we cherish these books we cherish these things but it came not in word only but there's an anointing that comes with it amen to bring forth the result amen of what God has spoken this hour and if God said you can be healed amen walk in his grace walk in his love amen shed every fear shed everything amen that would ender your faith amen and walk and believe that it's for you this morning yes sir yeah it's good so it's more than words on a page but it's a love letter it's a love letter to you and I this morning if you can read between the lines if you can put your name in there that's a love letter to you this morning yes sir it's God's love to us and so look here the power of divine inspiration amen his Divine love it's inspiration to see who you are and to have faith in his word to believe Divine love produces the faith perfect love will produce a perfect faith brother B said look what you were look what loved you were how how low you were what done that that was perfect love that came your way and It produced a perfect faith in you to see what love done when you were unlovable love came by love was projected and it brought forth of faith when that love was projected it brought forth a faith a perfect faith in a perfect God and So Divine love produces Divine faith and divine love and joy in the Holy Ghost and it the Bible says it came with much Assurance Divine love 1956 and when Divine love has been projected I love this and it comes to his destination Sovereign Grace takes its place yes and now he said now can you think of that now ponder over it he says so we get it real close now when Divine love is projected and it comes to its Destiny then Sovereign Grace takes it over and brother Brandon would use St John 3:16 when God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life we needed a savior we needed a redeemer and God's Divine love projected produced Jesus Christ amen Sovereign Grace came and It produced Jesus Christ to you and I amen God so loved the world that he projected that Divine love he projected that Sovereign Grace and It produced a savior It produced A Healer It produced a redeemer that whoo whosoever whosoever should believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life and so when Divine loves it it come when hey brother said when Divine love comes to its end get this now when it comes to its end Sovereign Grace takes over and his grace this morning it's unmerited favor that means you didn't do anything to deserve it that you couldn't work it up that you couldn't work it over but by God's election amen when when when when love come to its Destiny when it come to the end when you were at with in and you didn't know what to do God sent his love and it projected Sovereign Grace it came to the destiny it came to the predestinated seed of God in this hour and it changed your life yes sir true you may think this morning you're at the end but the Grace will be there Divine love has projected it to you and I yes when you come to the end and you don't know what to do you're at with in you don't know what decision to make we don't have to cast a lot but we can go to God we can come in faith with the perfect Faith this morning that knowing at the end he'll meet me there it'll be there so God has called you this morning to glory and virtue not Grace enough to do whatever you want and live any way any old way but to stand in the end stand in the end under Divine love under that Sovereign Grace stand in the end and give him honor and give him glory to stand at the end and give him worship give him glory we're not at the end of the sermon yet you can do that later on but just stand here in faith at the end stand in faith believing that whosoever Jesus said whosoever believes shall not perish amen whosoever believes whosoever can have faith this morning whosoever can can get a little bit little bit of inspiration of the Divine love little bit of inspiration of The unmar Sovereign Grace amen they shall not perish they shall not be destroyed amen your end won't destroy you but that's when God steps in Grace was there to give you life when you were dead you were at your end you were at your worst how was that my worst when he stepped in we was at the end I I got to a place God wasn't speaking to me I come to church voice of God wasn't speaking to me I thought oh no I've heard about this I've heard about this amen but that wasn't the end that wasn't the end Grace stepped in election Came Calling and I have to believe that you have to believe that for yourself amen that that when it seemed like the end his grace was enough yes we look I believe it'll be there at the end and as we have come to the end brother R said in the seventh seal he said the seventh seal ends all things we'll try to get to that we're at the end of the end he says we're at the end and when the end of the mystery when go when the mystery of God has been finished according to the scriptures and it was declared that time should be no longer yeah and the seventh seal he says we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time it's of all things that's right these these things written in the seven seal book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption from before the foundation of the world it it every bit ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling world it's the end of struggling nature It's The End end of everything in there it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vows it's the end of the Earth it's the end of time but I want to say this morning one day that end will come one day that that's the struggle will be over yeah one day that last name the last name on the book will be called and at the end of it when the struggle is over he'll be there do you believe that this morning we're here standing in the morning this morning at the end of it all we're at the end of the end and he'll be there his grace will be there Amen to bring us up to bring us out I believe that this morning Amen to anoint the church to bring us out in a Rapture and Grace I believe that Grace will be there when it winds down when we're to the final end of the end yeah that Rapture and Grace is going to be there I don't know how he's going to do it I don't know how it's going to happen but I believe it'll be there why because Divine love has been projected amen whosoever Shall Believe in him shall not be destroyed you shall not going to tribulation and and that that scripture can be applied Amen to everybody anyone that can receive salvation but many are called but to you are chosen you've been chosen you've been elected in this hour you're of a different class in this hour yes sir right sir yes good yes sir Rapture and Grace will be there I don't believe a one's going to be lost it's meant to be there not one's going to be lost do you believe that this morning amen and and he would go on and Christ The Mystery of God revealed and and what a sermon that is what a sermon that is and if you can go listen to it go go go be inspired by it go go listen to it get under that but he says in there in one part that we have the answer to the devil's question and it is Christ in you the hope of glory when you're at your end we've got the answer to the devil's question we've got the answer this morning to every sickness we've got the answer Amen to every disease every problem every everything every doubt every fear we've got the answer this morning we've got the answer to the Rapture I don't know how he's going to do it but it'll be Christ in you the hope of glory we've got the devil's answer this morning it's Christ in you yes that's true influencing you inspiring you yeah yes sir we're here this morning under his divine power divine nature we're here this morning we're here during the the Le of the age the age of lukewarmness the age of of indifference where he has been rejected by the world but the Bible says in Peter we are a chosen generation we are a royal priesthood and that word Royal is kingly amen man we are a Divine priesthood under divine inspiration amen with a divine power with a divine nature in us we've got the answer to the devil's question this morning won't you rise up in faith won't you rise up and be inspired in this hour yes sir amen amen we've been called to be a royal priesthood a Divine priesthood that we might show forth the Praises of him who has called us out of darkness in this Marvelous Light I say it's the most Marvelous Light that's ever shown there's never been a day like this day there's never been a light that shine so bright Amen in the evening time there shall be light I was listening Amen to the to the funeral of brother Brandon yeah and I I didn't know this but they said the moon sat there in the evening when he died and it it shown forth a light and there was just it was almost blacked out but there was a little glimmer of light amen the light has Shone in this hour as it was just a little glimmer almost amen and you were identified in that glimmer of light in this hour you identified with that Ministry you're identified with that amen and the light is still here the light didn't go away in 1965 but the light is shining forth in this hour that we might give forth praise amen you listen may seem kind of strange I'm I'm sorry if it is I'm a different bird you go listen to his funeral those men were so inspired by this man they were so inspired by that Ministry there was no shadow of a doubt but they understood his ministry they may have not understood what he said everything that he said but that light is shining in this hour we have no doubt what God has send in this day amen that Ministry was to declare that he is here that the Holy Ghost is here and the Holy Ghost is calling this morning yes he's calling this morning one of them said we we were so inspired by that Ministry so inspired by these things yes he says here in in perseverance 1963 he says just then I thought what is this all about I seen the Rocks tumbling off the side of the Hill rolling down and I looked up and there was a white circle above me there circling around and here come seven angels moving down out of the air they picked me up and said go back to your home to the east ride away and bring those Seven Seals for there's the seven mysteries for the complete word is revealed now in these seven Mysteries he said if you never heard it I and if you ever believed I ever said any sermon in a sermon inspired he said you take them tapes of them Seven Seals he said I'm not a tape salesman if you ever heard anything that's really as I can say thus sayth the Lord get those what an inspiration even he was under being caught up by those seven angels amen it didn't come by a word only but it become power and demonstration and the power of the Holy Ghost that came from the word amen to inspire you and I amen a prophet was caught up in that constellation there had to be something inspiring there had to be something greater than looking back of what somebody else said about the opening of the word in the Seven Seals amen he he had to forget every bit of that he had to forget every bit of that and he sit in the room every night amen he had when that angel would come amen it would begin to show him what that meant and
