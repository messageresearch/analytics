========================================

be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind judgment right i'm i mean we see the world rallying around causes we we see all these social justices and all these social movements and all these political platforms now you go try to talk to them and get their thinking or understand where they're coming from but they don't make any sense but you you go to a couple of them and a lot of them they're all saying the same thing they all believe the same thing they've all united under one little cause um that's true you know all saying the same thing but that's the sign of the times we're living in we're living in ladies it's a time of people's rights and women's rights and equality and and all of these movements that have sprung up you realize that's just a sign of the times we're living in the world is united you understand the tares are being gathered together to be burned all the religious systems and the world systems uh it's fearful signs that we're seeing out there all the calamities all the sickness all the governments all the nations national sides all these things are all adding up why because there's another u19 going on there's another gathering going on there's a people that are gathering together and they're all saying the same thing the prophet would say it like this in the uniting time and sign he'd say where all the uh all the nations are united we see national signs we see out here in the world earthquakes and diverse places different things uniting bringing the world together bringing the people together all the churches together all these things and while all that this uniting's been going on there is another uniting going on amen that's what i want to point out to you god is uniting his bride she is coming together from the east and the west and the north and the south there is a uniting time and that's on right now that's in 1963. what is she uniting for the rapture what is she uniting for the rapture why have we gathered here this morning for the rapture why do you believe this message why are we following out there why because we're going in a rapture god's getting her ready yes sir united what is she uniting with with the word for all heavens and all earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away she's uniting herself with thus saith the lord regardless of what any denominations or anybody else says she's uniting herself she's getting ready are you getting ready or have we gotten a little complacent have we have we kind of allowed all these little apps and things to kind of enter into our life and steal our time and rob us of prayer rob us of studying the bible rob us from scripture oh my tell you what the devil is crafty i mean you know we got so many things now to make life easier make everything so much faster yeah of course we've heard it all said we have less time than we've ever had that's right you try to you try to download something or buy something to make make it where you can have more time and it just takes more time for you to figure out how to do it i think sometimes it behooves us to shake ourselves and to see if we're really getting ready why why is she getting ready she is the bride that's right and she's uniting herself with her bridegroom see the bridegroom is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the church and the bride and the word is becoming so one until the very word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom oh maybe i'll read that again because something in my heart says lord if that's your word i want to manifest it lord if that's your word that i believe you've called me to manifest that and the church the bride and the word is becoming so on until the very word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom that's what you've been called to that's what this uniting is for it's united you to the word of god that your very actions would be the actions of the bridegroom oh i say brother being helpless oh god to come into a united with the word that where our actions are the actions of the bridegroom that's why he's placed you here that's what he's called you for it's to be the word made flesh in this hour you are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life power of his power you are the hands you are the feet you are the eyes you are the voice the final voice to the final age all that your works would be the bridegrooms amen you see it's a united not join a church not more of this but flee from everything and be tied to jesus christ oh my that's what we're being united to do church being united to the word if you ever catch a revelation maybe just a little revelation of what was received in the end time not a denomination it's not a man's idea it's not a man's way of thinking but it's none other than the person of jesus christ wanting to have communion with you and if you could just lay aside your differences in everything that you heard and say okay lord maybe i've heard this all my life but lord if this be true reveal it to me lord and you come with a sincere heart i tell you what you got you're in for you're you're in for a treat by god's grace i got converted a little over 20 years ago and it's been the greatest joy i've ever had to be able to walk in the light of the hour and walk in the knowledge of this message and amen we'll just move a little further here matthew 24 27 says for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be how long have we been brother ben we haven't been long third 30 minutes all right are y'all all right all right just a few more minutes we're good i don't i don't want to i don't want to my first my my first time preaching here i don't want to close the door on myself for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall the coming of the son of man be for wherever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered thank you lord there will the eagles be gathered that is what we're feeding on is the body word son of man the prophet would say this is we just come to a close he says we see the nations uniting we see the world united we see the churches united we see the bride united with the word why the word is god as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hearer of the word they come together in a union they they they unite like a wedding see they're getting ready for a wedding they become one the word becomes you you become the lord oh my you the word becomes you you become the word i say believeth now this believeth now this oh is there something in your heart that says you know what the the word becomes you you become the word believe us now this what are we talking about we're talking about going in a rapture we're talking about being united for a rapture and going in a body change believe us now this oh i like it how there uh martha said to jesus she said uh he said he said well lord yes i know that as we're at the resurrection but what did jesus say he said i am the resurrection [Applause] see we're always looking to the rapture as an event we're always looking to the resurrection as an event but the worry is saying that the resurrection is a person and you are part of that person the way therefore you the word that has been made manifest in this day you are the resurrection you are part of that word you are the word that god has birthed on the scene in the end time to manifest the spoken word he said i am the resurrection you are that word the word becomes you and you become the word believe us by this we're so caught up in looking for an event to come down the road but the lord has descended with a shout out what is the shot it's the it's the bread of life it's the message gathering together a bride for what for the rapture the prophet said the lord does all three of them while he's descending that means he's already descended we have heard his voice he is uniting you together with that word oh praise god hallelujah you're part of that resurrected word here in the end time the prophet said i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith yeah because what we got right now wouldn't be able to do it there is something now right now that that other messenger is saying what you got ain't good enough but just follow the word all the way through you say what we we we got to take a step further praise god there's a step further to take we we can't even have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and swept up out of this earth and we'll find that after a while this is the first seal but it was through the revelation of those seven seals and those mysterious thunder that's producing rapturing faith in the bride oh don't make it too complicated what does the word say is faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god god has equipped you with the necessary word to bring you into that rapturing faith we just got to be willing to feed on it if you feel like you're lacking if you feel like you don't have what you should have look just forgive the things which are behind you and recognize that god has sent a message to you to produce a rapturing faith to change your body to go into a rapture you don't have to you don't have to work it up all on your own i mean i think that's the problem many times we feel like the egyptians yeah not the egyptians the israelites that were in bondage in egypt how are we ever going to get out of egypt how are we ever going to do this well what did they do they started to sigh and they started to cry and the scripture says the lord had heard their cry and i love that scripture in exodus 38 it says and i have come down i want to tell you jesus christ is here he's here to meet you in your time of need he's here to manifest the word in your life but he said there in exodus 23 20 said behold i sent an angel before thee to keep me in the way and to bring you into the place which i have prepared how are we going to have rapture in faith how are we going to possess the land how are we going to do this is how is our body going to be changed behold i have sent my angel before thee to keep me in the way i have come down oh praise god we're always looking to to what we can do about it we're always looking to how can i do it amen but it's not up to you he's the one that said it he's the one that promised it it's up to us to take him at his word the prophet of god said we're entering into another age he said we're entering into the raptured age he said the move is on for the bride and that's thus saith the lord that's invisible union look something is taking place right now something is happening there's a people that's being united together jesus christ has come down with an open book he's called your name he's revealed the mysteries of the seven seals which has given you rapturing faith that you could be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's what all this uniting time's about that's what that pillar of cloud that was taken there in february 28th is all about it was the lord coming for redemption claims coming to claim his bride coming to take us home coming to take us into a rapture oh praise god oh hallelujah paul would say behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we shall be changed yes sir oh we're going in the rapture church believe us thou this we shall be changed and i believe that even right now little by little we're being changed we're just asking musicians to come that doesn't mean we're ending but what a fellowship or pet doctrines no more creeds no more big eyes no more little use not a way of thinking not a not an explanation but the but the the life of the word living in you the life of the word change in you molding you the scripture says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus say well brother matthew that's that's impossible well it would be impossible if god hadn't given us his mind but god made a way in the end time and has revealed his word and given us his very mind that's what he said the the bride of christ has the mind of god and knows what he wants done with the word she has thus saith the lord or she stands still now now don't shrink back from that right that should encourage us to know that there's something laying there in the word for us to obtain friends it's there for you to obtain you've got to be able to obtain it and he didn't lay it there in the word and say it was unobtainable he didn't put it there and place it there and just put these stuff out like a carrot in front of you and say oh you got to be perfect be there for perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect but you'll never be able to do it no these things are put there in the world and he actually put you here to manifest the word that he prophesied and he wants us how long will you hold between two opinions quit looking at the ways of man we're looking at the ways of flesh start looking at the word and saying lord that's for me i'm going to manifest it i believe it i'm going to rise up i'm going to be united under this word because i'm being caught up into a rapture oh thank you jesus oh my just start playing something please oh praise god [Music] praise the lord aren't you glad you've heard the message aren't you glad you've heard the shout aren't you glad you've been gathered together with the people that's come out from all the nonsense there in the world not depending on a man's way of thinking but we've actually received the intelligence of god we've actually received his mind and those are the very things that i just want to encourage you that [Music] we've been united together for a rapture and the devil so much would want to try to come in and cause division amongst the church and break down the fellowship and we could all say oh we believe the message and we're all going to rapture but if that unity is lacking in the body [Music] then it completely defeats what god is wanting to accomplish he's he's joining you together fitly join every need and every joint supply of but there's such a love amongst the brethren and the sisters that you're taking each one's need and each one's burden to heart and we're coming into that that atmosphere of love we're coming into that stature of christ and that capstone of love is settling down upon the bride and if you live like that if you're living what does the prophet say eternal life is living for others [Music] i say we ought to start looking out on the needs of one another the prophet will say this as we stand [Music] but the church has received a heavenly sign an astronaut amen jesus christ in the form of a pillar of fire that he was in the old testament that he was when he met saul on the road down there at damascus the same jesus here today and what does it do does it bring fear it brings love a uniting of one another amen a feeling for one another it brings the love of god oh united us and brings us the body of christ into unity as a bride amen let's just sing this [Music] in this life we've been made victorious [Music] through the blood of jesus christ [Music] we've been made victorious [Music] through the blood of jesus christ [Music] in this life [Music] through the blood of jesus [Music] victorious through the blood of jesus christ [Music] victorious through the blood of jesus christ would you bow your heads with me for just a moment maybe this morning the words just spoke directly to your heart and somehow you you feel that that desire to be united with the word more in your life and and maybe you've been a christian or you've been raised in the message and you consider yourself a christian today and we don't want to take that away from you but perhaps there's something there that's calling you to a deeper walk with god brother matthew preached this morning some of the same things that we've been preaching on as well god must have wanted you to hear it he must have loved you enough to send you a word that you could hear and you could know and would you just talk to him for just a moment and maybe you'd lift your hand and say lord i i want to be closer to you i i want to become that word in my hour i realize it's more than just just uh saying it or saying i believe it but it's becoming that i want to become it so much to my family knows it my my wife knows it my husband knows it my children know it lord i want to have that unity i want to have it so much i don't care what they say about me i don't care what the world
