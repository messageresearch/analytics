========================================

you see his presence brings peace in a time of storm peace there's no peace in the world today but john 14 to 27 when he's talking about this comforter he said peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid these things i have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world it's a peace that passes understanding in philippians 4 7 that the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus shall keep in other words it will keep you from going the places where you would have gone in your mind the holy spirit is a comforter that that won't let you go there in the sense of you might you might be so despondent as to give up but the holy spirit doesn't give up you might be so in such despair and such sorrow as to just let it all go and lay it all down but the holy spirit doesn't do that amen aren't you glad that when you get when you're down to your last rope and the last inch of your ability people talk about fortitude and the ability to stand up to trials but when you've got nothing left to give and you've done everything you can do it's in that moment that the comforter comes and he stands for you and he stands in you and he causes you to realize that your redeemer liveth amen hallelujah you see he provides peace he provides the words we don't know what to pray see because we're poor comforters we don't know how to comfort other people we also don't know how to pray for ourselves that's what the bible says many times we don't know how to pray and the bible in romans 8 26 says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities our weaknesses for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself i love this amen he makes intercession for us one standing by us an attorney an advocate somebody standing there that speaks in our behalf i heard someone say today that there was a politician actually but it really intrigued me what he was saying he said what people want is somebody like them but who can put it better than they can put it right so you want somebody to say to reflect you but you want somebody that can put it better than what you could put it because if i was standing there in washington i wouldn't be able to to bring a i'd have all kinds of thoughts going you know all kinds of things but you want somebody who can put it better than you can put it the holy spirit is the one hallelujah when your prayer gets jumbled and you don't know how to pray for what you really need that's why we need to pray in the spirit we need to we need to preach in the spirit we need to worship in the spirit because when we do these things in the spirit of god the holy spirit actually is the one who knows how to put it better than you do he rearranges the letters that the little boy pray in his abcs and the holy spirit takes that makes it mean something how many times have i preached a sermon i thought was a complete flop honestly i walk away from the pulpit and they i'll never touch that subject again and somebody come up to me late later and it did something in their life you think why because it wasn't me it was because the holy spirit come and took the words and put it better than i could put it hallelujah aren't you glad he still does that today that's why we believe in live preaching even today because the holy spirit gets into it and he carries the words to the hearts of the listener and puts it better than what we could put it hallelujah amen he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god now watch we have comfort it gives us comfort we have comfort through the word as we said the comforter is the word john 14 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come now there was someone in the scripture that really had to deal with with suffering and all of a steel as i said was suffering i don't want to particularly point anybody out tonight but if you're here you deal with with suffering but some of you have dealt with suffering on a level that i can't even comprehend i think job probably dealt with it in a way that none of us can really comprehend because it was just such a massive loss and some of you would understand joe better than i do but maybe not completely and brother brown said there was a prophet one time by the name of job and he needed some comfort and his church members come condemning him now there's something interesting and brother branham puts this he must have had experience with this because he puts this like a pastor like job is the pastor of a church and i think we could all put us in there put ourselves in there not just as pastors but whatever office you feel in the church whatever part you are of the body and here here job has done nothing but try to help these people right and try to preach to these people and here comes his his congregation you know says job you're doing pretty bad got covered you got these balls and you got all these these problems you must be doing something wrong i think god i don't have a church like job did i don't know what i'd do with people like that but alan they were his friends i can't imagine the ones that were against him i know what they said but his best friends come up to him and brother branham said that was his congregation and he's job you're just not right with god but see church members don't always understand and there's nowhere in the scripture that says that these were ungodly men right they were not men that were just out there somewhere these were good godly christian church members what we would call them today but they don't get it and they can't they didn't lose all their kids in a day right they can't know what job is going through and they even they're they're arguing with job they're getting they have the wrong argument it's a completely wrong argument that they have until elihu comes along being the youngest of all of them and is actually able to represent christ to job and bring the argument up to a different level because there was some things that job did wrong in that and i've heard that recently someone said well god was rebuking job's three friends when no god never said anything to his three friends he come rebuke job but he did it in a in the right way right where the three friends didn't understand church members don't always understand the people we go to church with don't always understand they just don't get it sometimes they're just it's impossible for them to get it look they condemned him he said but he still needed a comforter his wife couldn't even comfort him and sometimes we if we're not careful we we raise our expectations of our spouse i can just preach tonight i don't know if they got the streaming fixed or not but i'll just pretend it's not fixed they got you know his wife come to him and we think that we elevate our spouses to the point where my my husband's gonna fix this my wife's gonna fix this sometimes they can't right there's some things you need somebody standing by you who knows you better amen then even your wife does i'll say that this time that we spent and coveted was different from last time in the sense that me and my wife kind of got closer together and and i enjoyed this time some respects i know the kids didn't enjoy it much me being home and them not being able to go to school but but and they're still not able to go to school because now the school shut down but for the next couple of days but we we got actually closer together but as close as you can get your wife doesn't know everything i hope you're hearing me tonight and and some people say well if i just had a wife if i just had a husband then there would be somebody i could talk to and it is a great comfort it is a great comfort i won't deny that but there's somebody that knows you better and sometimes that'll cause problems in marriages because we think well if they would just if they could understand me better no don't don't lay that off on them the holy spirit knows he knows you better than you know yourself and he knows what you really need no they condemned him and his wife said she said job you ought to curse god and then die to death but he said they'll speak us like a foolish woman and job stayed with it until god provided for him a vision of jesus christ he said it said when the vision came he said i know my redeemer liveth at the last days he'll stand upon the earth and i've said many times and and i've never really looked at it i guess and i've heard this sermon before but i guess i never really looked at it the way brother branham is looking at it here exactly but i have said many times that job you know god never explained to him why he went through what he went through he never told him why he just showed him a vision right he showed him his redeemer but now watch the way brother branham puts it i guess i haven't put it in this way that i remember before but he says now remember the vision is he said he saw jesus and jesus is the word then when job needed a comforter god sent him a vision of the word amen that's why we've got to have the holy ghost in this day and hour because it's the holy ghost that comes on the inside and it's the inside teacher to teach you the word that's not just about the millennium and about about the the three comings of christ and those things he's not just teaching you about that he's teaching you amen how to be comforted how to have peace that passes all understanding he's teaching you when friends go away from you and family goes away from you and everything's going wrong he's teaching you i'm the god that heals all your diseases i'm the one who's got your kids held in the palm of my hand i'm the one that's got it all in control he's teaching you that insight i can tell you those things but when he tells you those things it's something different what happened what did god do for job god sent him when job needed a comforter god sent him a vision of the word oh hallelujah he said that's the comfort i get is reading the word believing the word what the word says jesus said let every man's word be a lie and mind be true he says i don't care what someone else says i respect what they say but when it comes to believing if it's contrary to god's word i don't believe it he says he says i do not believe nothing but what god's word said for man shall live by every word that comes out of the mouth of god not just so much of the word i've tried to live my life like that god help me to continue to do that that i love people there's nothing brother brandon put it this way he said you believe that if something else if you want to but i've got to stay with the word i'm not going to not love you because you believe something different i'm going to continue to love you and pray for you but i've got to stay with the word with the revelation of the word that we've been given in this hour i've got to stay with the word you go on do whatever you want to do i'm not going to put you out of the kingdom but i've got to stay with the word because the word is the comforter that's the only i don't see a way out of life without the word you know life is brutal i'm not sugar coating it tonight but it just is i got to looking at my calendar in there and this is just a little thing but maybe it'll give you a little example what life is like and and i looked at my calendar and i thought man our december calendar was messed up everything we tried to do got changed at least once and and and the services that got canceled and the ones we thought we were going to take certain ones off and ended up being out of church forever and it just seemed like isn't it good to be back in the house of the lord amen for those of us that could be tonight and i understand why some people wouldn't be able to come and some are still sick and and some are afraid of getting sick and again i have absolutely no judgment on that because i know it's a difficult time but you understand that that just being able to be together is a big deal because we don't know what tomorrow holds and that calendar really doesn't mean anything i have it to try to keep my thoughts organized to remind me what to do but he jesus could come tomorrow then what good does my calendar do right and sometimes the rain just comes and i come across something today that said well said the best thing to do if it rains is just to let it rain isn't that right sometimes you just have to let it rain and find some good in it i remember as a kid we'd go to the cafe and the farmers were always in the cafe every day every day the farmers would be in the cafe if it was hot they complained about the heat if it was raining they complained about the rain if it was if there was a government surplus they complained about the government not giving them any of the surplus there was a government deficit they complained about that didn't matter what was going on in politics what it was they always gathered together to complain but the best thing to do about rain if it's going to rain let it rain figure out how to use the rain amen you must need it oh god it's a hard attitude to take but but you know there must be a reason why things happen the way that they do and and i'm not big enough to figure out what that is that's why we've got to stay with the word because if we start attaching meanings to things beyond and give them a significance beyond what they actually have what we end up with we end up putting ourselves over in in the tribulation period we end up with a gloom and doom gospel we end up where nobody's going to make it but i know somebody's going to make it the bride's going to make it no one else may but the bride will who's the bride with the bed i don't know but i'm going to believe for every one of you huh why wouldn't i why would i want you to go to tribulation why would i want myself to go to tribulation i'm going to believe for every one of us and then what the other pastor could you know take care of his own church right does that make sense there's no reason to live in a gloom in doom and despair and all the all kinds of things coming on the earth and some people live in that apocalyptic worldview where everything's coming everything's going downhill as fast as it can go i'll tell you what i know one thing that's not going downhill if all the things that are going downhill there's one thing that's not that's the bride of jesus christ the bride of jesus christ is going up it may get darker before it gets lighter but i'll tell you this there is a bride on the earth today that is going up every step they take is pressing forward it's going upward it's not falling down this bride cannot fall i'm going to be a part of that why would i believe anything different if i don't make it i pray that you have the faith to make it but why would i believe anything differently it makes no sense to live in a doom and gloom now look you see we have a comforter the word always come back to the word but the branham said he said all the word the whole bible through man shall live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god and he said no that's how man lives that's god's provided way for him to live he said and job was the prophet that lived even before the bible was written notice he was a prophet and the word of the lord comes to the prophet and when he wanted comfort he could find none he went to his church and his church didn't have any comfort for him but accusation against him but he stayed until god showed him the word by vision and then he was comforted he didn't have the written word like we did but he had a vision amen he was a pray hallelujah aren't you glad we're able to see we don't necessarily we don't necessarily have visions ourselves although i believe a person could have a vision but but we're not prophets major prophets you understand we're not seers i don't know that there's anybody here that has visions but i'll tell you this we were able to stand on the shoulder of somebody who did hallelujah and god showed job a vision and then he was comforted he stayed on his feet and the lightning's flashed and the thunder's roared he said though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh till i see god he said he talked to me let death or anything else strike me it doesn't make a bit of difference because i'll see god i saw the vision of his word oh i wonder tonight have you seen the vision of his word you see colvin you see you see the world going downhill like it is but do you see the vision of the word that vision said the bride's going up the vision doesn't deny that there's a worldly church that's going down that vision doesn't deny that there's standards are going downhill holiness is a is a by bygone thing for many people but there is a bride on the face of the earth that's going up we don't deny those other things are true but there's got to be a bride hallelujah i'm getting into sunday sermon here we'll we won't get very far in that but now look let's go back to this comforter he said the comforter now i want you to notice something about the comforter and i'm kinda i know i don't have very long tonight so you just bear with me i'll be done in 20 minutes whether we're done or not the comforter will correct you do you know that that inside teacher will correct you he come he even convicts the world of sin that's his job but he will not accuse you the comforters he joe's friends brought accusations the church members bring accusations the comforter will never accuse you he don't play that role right in god's great drama he's the attorney not the prosecutor i want you to understand something about the holy ghost the holy ghost will never accuse you he will convict you but he will not accuse you oh my many people think they're under conviction and and really living under condemnation and the bible says there is therefore no now no condemnation that are in christ jesus you walk after the the spirit and not the flesh now look satan is the prosecutor the holy spirit the comforter works for the defense and this word comforter means advocate again literally the one standing by you but it's the legal term it's the one who stands there and voices on your behalf to the judge you see satan is known as the accuser in revelation 12 10 he said the accuser of our brethren is cast down the accuser which accused him before our god day and night right that's his job one thing he does he never fails to accuse the brethren but the holy spirit is not an accuser i hope we get this today it's one way you can differentiate between true and false ministries right false ministries take on the attitude of the accuser right now it doesn't mean that the true ministry won't preach things that are very straight but they don't take on the attitude of the accuser i hope you understand this here's how brother branham talks about that he said have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear they say that if the people don't do what they say or if they leave i hope you get a revelation of this tonight because every time something bad that happens i'll tell you what you think because the same thing that i think what did i do wrong and then the accuser comes by through some preacher or through some person as well if you hadn't done that and it may have been something not even that we're not talking about sin we're just talking about some decision you made well if you hadn't done that you've been okay don't let the accuser talk to you in that way he's taking on even if there's a person that meant well but they're taking on the attitude of the accuser what if you hadn't done that that's not the way god holds people to him he don't hold people he don't first of all he doesn't bind them people to himself as well brother branham says that in the church age but not for one moment he said do i do that i don't he didn't come to bring a message to bind us to him but to bind us with love bonds to christ if brother branham was a cult leader he was very poor at his job right because with a gift like that if you were going to be a cult leader you could have held the people by fear you absolutely could because you knew things about people and knowledge about people is power that's why some pastors are able to hold people and you wonder how do they keep so many people in their church for so many years and they're not and all they do is preach nonsense gloom and doom and catastrophe constantly and they get to where they don't even have to preach hardly be gone half the time handle the money any way they want to excuse me for preaching like this tonight but you spare with me i'm preaching it myself i guess you know other pastors here that i know of but look how do they get you've always wondered how do they give people because they know a lot of things about people and if somebody raises up and says something they'll preach at them for about six weeks right until the voice quietens down well i really did do that i really was like that i really don't worship enough you know when the pastor he come preach when he saw that i was raising up to have a different idea than he did then he preached against people who don't worship enough for six weeks and i guess i'm just not you know i'm not qualified to have that that position you've all i'm sure you've been there if you haven't i have i come up under the best they say if people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow what is that an accuser an accuser and it's a way of because you know things about people but if brother branham was to go back to my original thought if he wanted to be a cult leader he could have come out with true things about people he knew these things he could have known things about people that they didn't even tell him because the holy spirit knew the secrets of the heart but brother branham never used it in that way i think of y'all just bear with me for a moment but brother perry green tells a story about brother branham knowing something about him and one of the things that he and brother branham never says this publicly brother perry was a great man of god but brother perry and he'll he would tell you this while he was alive when he was young he had a it was a very passionate man he had a problem with bad thoughts and brother branham knew that about him not because brother perry told him but brother perry he discerned that about brother perry he said brother prayer you always have to keep that guarded brother perry told him on himself brother branham never told it it's important that we don't mind people by fear they say if people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow they are false prophets no matter how long they've been preaching right they are false prophets for a true prophet always lead one to the word and bind the people to jesus christ and he won't tell the people to fear him or what he says but to fear what the word says amen amen listen we have an advocate not an accuser aren't you glad for that tonight an advocate not an accuser listen first john two and one my little children these things right unto you that you sin not and if any man's sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous i should tell you right there that the holy spirit is jesus christ the spirit of christ and he is the propitiation for our sins so he's not only the advocate but he's actually the propitiation he's the one who paid for it hallelujah not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world but branham said what is the holy ghost it's an advocate what is an advocator what does it do it makes an advocate it has mercy hallelujah it stands in your place oh listen to this tonight church it does things that you can't do hallelujah it's a propitiation for your sins it's your right oh somebody ought to preach with me tonight it's your righteousness it's your healing it's your life it's your resurrection it's all that god has for you he's an advocate hallelujah he said how we could go into details with that and break that down of how that when it makes intercession for our ignorance sometimes he said when we got the holy ghost we ignorantly stagger into something have you ever done that we make a decision and we get six months from now we look back at that and said now i got no time to pray i got no time to read my bible why did i do that we ignorantly stagger into something but the holy spirit is there oh hallelujah just don't want to make me go out and make bad decisions that once it makes me want to love him that much more give him that much more time hallelujah the holy spirit is there to make advocate for us he is our advocate or he stands he's our attorney he stands there and pleads for us we don't plead for ourself because the holy ghost in us pleads for us as i said he puts it better than we could you realize that's the only difference in you and an attorney you know many of the basics of the law but the attorney knows how to put it in front of the judge amen in such a way that it will convince the judge listen the holy spirit knows how to hey man how to advocate for you hey man he stands there and pleads for us he we don't plead for ourselves because the holy ghost in us please for us the holy spirit giving utterance sometimes with words you can't understand and he makes intercessions for us that's what the holy ghost is listen what what i really need when i'm really in trouble when i really what i'm really i appreciate all of you praying for me and this week like i said it was much better than the first time you got to get covered twice might as well do it like i did it but the first time was much harder than it was this time but i'm glad you prayed for me what i need when i'm in a dark place what you need when you're a dark place it's not so much somebody that can come and present to you the right words and that's what job's three friends didn't get job needed amen to get a vision of the word and i can't give you that but what i can do is i can speak the word and then i can and i can say the things that the holy spirit inspires me to say but i can pray for you and when i pray for you i know when i get in the spirit that the holy spirit knows just how to put it amen i might pray for you for something you don't need you might come and say brother ben pray that i get at this new job and i'll start praying about that and the holy spirit maybe won't tell me whether it's a good thing or a bad thing but he knows how to put it he knows exactly how to pray on your behalf amen listen brother madam said the holy spirit given utterance sometimes with words you can't understand he makes intercession for us that's what the holy ghost is when i walk into anything watch this i walk like a little kid you feel like you're walking like a kid and i'm not talking about these big boys sitting up here wherever my daughter is right now when i walk into anything i walk like a little kid like a little kid that's just learning how to walk you walk like a little fellow that's how we walk with god what do you do when you what do you do with your little child your toddler these boys can run around we don't bother with them with a little child just learning how to walk what do you do you grab their hand the one standing by you is not your pastor the one holding your hand through the most difficult moments of life is not your pastor though i want to be there for you but it's the comforter are you with me now it's not your church member though church members though we would love for to be able to comfort one another and we should do that as the body of christ but the one closest to you who's able to hold you up as you walk like a little child is christ the advocate who walked perfectly he's already why man he's walked perfectly see i haven't walked perfectly so you can't this was the problem with the man becoming the message right when i make my life the example for everything that you go through that's a problem even brother branham's life can't be used like that because when a man becomes the message in that sense right when a man becomes a message in the sense that we just look at his life and try to emulate him he didn't walk perfectly nobody did amen but christ did and when i can hold the hand of jesus christ i know he'll lead me exactly where he wants me to be but we walk like a little kid you walk like a little fellow we're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything you say oh i'm afraid i'm afraid to take christian life i'm afraid to do this i'm afraid i'll do this but joel we talked about this before you started preaching look many times you walk in and you're asked to take an office in the church you're asked to do something to help out and you become afraid because you're afraid how you act you're afraid of what you might do the rest of you may have halos but i don't you don't want to disappoint the people again well i'm afraid i'm afraid to do this i'm afraid i'll do this don't be afraid we have an advocate oh i'm so glad he's right here by me you realize well give brother branham the confidence and he deals with this in this sermon when he talks about the comforter he deals with the fact that how he's not afraid to say whatever the holy spirit tells him to say he's not afraid when he says he said brother madam aren't you afraid and he says no he's always there with me hallelujah he said and he promised me he would never leave me he said wherever you go i'll be with you like joshua he said he said be of good courage i'll be with you i'll stay with you and so he said he had the confidence that the angel was there listen even when you can't feel him even when you can't see him he said i'll be the one who holds your hand i'm the comforter i'll be the one that's closed by you hallelujah and this is why i said it's expedient for you that i go away because while i'm here in a body i can only be physically present when i'm actually there but there will come a time when you'll be scattered to the four corners of the earth and i'll be with each and every one of you walking in your homeless walkings while you work walking with you while you go to church walking with you while you trying to preach walking with you why are you trying to deal with your loved ones walking with you while you walk through the valley of the shadow of death he said i'll hold your hand hallelujah i don't know i can't like i said i can't put a value in your suffering but he's with you yeah though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death hallelujah oh i believe he is i believe he's walking with you today amen now look don't be afraid we have an advocate he stands by us he's in us and he makes intercessions for us the holy spirit constantly making an advocate for us all the time what was the devil doing all the time satan was an accuser day and night what's the holy ghost all the time being an advocate now and i'll touch this last point just briefly and then we'll go but he said when the comforters come in john 15 26 whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me now what does that mean he'll testify me it means he'll he'll manifest me he'll manifest me so one of the ways that the comforter works in our life is by manifesting the word of the hour in our lives and in the lives of people around us that we see and when we see that manifestation it gives us comfort that's right now brother brown said he would give us another comforter i want to speed through this so just bear with me for a moment but he said in the days of paul he talks about how he said if one come in among you and you all speak with tongues there's no interpreter then the unbeliever will say you're mad but if there'd be one prophesy and reveal the secret of the heart fall down and say truly god is with you he said here we are in this day with that same comforter manifesting himself in the same way that he did then he said what a consolation with a promise now what was it he cared so much christ did for his disciples that he manifested himself to them brother branham brought that out and he said he cared so much for the message of today that he allowed himself to be manifested in a way that we could see that he's still alive are you glad for the message of the hour do you realize that the manifestation of the sign of the son of man helps you through suffering think about it oh my it helps you can you imagine that first church age what it must have been like they went through they were dragged they were torn apart by dogs they were poured hot hot oil poured on them and you think why didn't they give up why didn't they give in well many of them had seen god in his reality they'd seen him manifested in christ on the in the flesh but even the paul himself had never seen christ but he saw god manifesting himself in his own ministry and because he saw jesus christ manifesting himself and doing what he promised that he would do oh church we could only see the reality of this today it brought a comfort he said death where is your sting grave where is your victory i can walk through it because you manifest yourself to me brother brown said jesus cared enough for the message of today to bring these same things to pass as he said till he died and rose again to send them by the holy spirit the comforter to show his ministry today that he's still alive very bad he said he cared enough to make a statement he cared because he loved you he cared enough to do it to send the holy spirit to make this ministry today hallelujah i like this and paragraph 152 if he cares do you care he said now he sent the holy ghost and in this day of intellectual conception that he might by the same holy spirit prove through us that he's still the messiah prove it in the same way the bible says we're we are the epistle of christ written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart listen he said how can i comfort my friends how can i comfort my relatives by becoming the manifestation of the word for your day when they say hey man oh isn't it a great comfort can you you've been to funerals where someone began to talk about the life that someone lived and it's a great comfort isn't it what is it the manifestation of the word come on you know that's true you see it and sometimes that's hard because a person you just have to have faith for that person but listen you manifesting the life that you live to your relatives and friends means something it gives them comfort amen oh god you realize it gives your grandkids comfort to know that you come to church on wednesday night yes it does it gives them comfort to know they may not be living the life that they need to live but they know that granddad's in church grandma's in church i hope you hear me there's somebody there who can pray for them why because you become the word in flesh there's somebody there who reads their bible oh man it's a great comfort to know it's a comfort to me if we don't have streaming tonight my mom won't hear it but i know my mother prays my mother has a lot of faults just like all of us do but i know my mother prays it's a great comfort to me to know that my mother knows how to pray it's a great comfort to me to know that some of you know how to pray it's a great comfort to me oh my to know to see christ manifesting himself among the people if we never saw it if it was just word only and we never saw the manifestation we we would wonder what's taking place but now we see the manifestation bio the word doing exactly what he promised he would do it's a great comfort to us to know that there's a there's a manifestation of christ at the end time the bride is what god says it would be she would be i want to leave you with this tonight musicians go ahead and come you ever had somebody you felt safe with what i mean by that is you just felt like you could say anything you didn't have to guard your words but joe there's not very many people like that is there you think about it you just feel like you could you could bear your soul and it would never go any farther you just stay right there you wouldn't be judged in a you wouldn't be accused and i know some of you wish you had a person like that a friend like that but that's what the holy spirit is there's a writer i don't know what led me to literature but i believe that god actually speaks through literature he speaks through art and music but the branham said sometimes we think of that as only christian art and christian music but sometimes god expresses himself in in ways that even people that are not saved but a writer put this like this in a children's book listen to these words he said oh there's a it was a lady that wrote this and she said oh the comfort the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a person having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words but pouring them all out just as they are chaff and grain together certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them keep what is worth keeping and with a breath of kindness blow the rest away every one of us want a friend like that don't we you that kind of comfort i think we ought to strive for that ourselves to be like that to be that kind of a friend but we have that kind of friend the one standing by you knows every one of your faults and he hears all your words he hears when you say things you don't mean sometimes we do that he hears when you pray for revenge when when you know you shouldn't when someone treats you badly and you get in a bet you have a bad attitude about it he he hears that he knows that but he weighs the thoughts you pour them out to him oh my there's somebody you could talk to tonight oh there's somebody i think we need to really get back in touch with our prayer lives maybe that's why covet has happened the way it does so we could get back in touch with our prayer lives there's there's somebody you can talk to a person or a real person you can talk to that you feel you can feel safe with that you can pour out all of your thoughts the chaff and the grain together and that faithful hand will sift them out keep what is worth keeping with the breath of kindness blow the rest a way you can rest assured he doesn't accuse you of one thing that you do he sees everything you do and he accuses you for none of it oh my aren't you glad to have a friend like that let's bow our heads together as i said i don't know how to weigh how to measure the value of what you've been through but i do know somebody who does he knows exactly what it means he knows how to deal with your heart in the moment how to break you down how to build you back up like i said i have to be careful with my words because i realize i can tear down and if i tear down i need to know that it's going to be built back in the right way so you have to be word careful with words that tear down but you've got one standing by you today he's on the defense team he's not there as an accuser i see people they get the wrong idea of the holy ghost they keep coming back and back and back because they feel condemned all the time no the holy ghost is somebody that's on your side yes he'll convict you of sin but it's because he's on your side he'll steer you away from the things that would lead you down the wrong path it'll cause a preacher to preach something maybe that's hard sometimes but it's because he loves you you can see his hand in it he's leading you he's comforting you he's guiding you into all truth someday you're going to know even as you're known but while we're here if we're walking through the valley of the shadow of death we can know that he's there [Music] i always want to be there for you if anything this covert has taught us we're not always going to be able to be there for the people we want to be there for and that's just life that's just the way it is i've not always been there for my family like i want to be but i know one who is always there if i'm not if i'm caught in the wrong position in the wrong place at the wrong time and unable to care in the way that i should maybe with a bad attitude or something like that but i know that the holy spirit that lives inside of you is able to come and comfort you won't you lean on him tonight won't you just lean on him just just let him weigh your thoughts in your pour out your heart to him don't don't think badly of other people because they don't understand but just just pour out your heart to say lord i know you understand i know you get it no one else may but i know you do heavenly father we love you tonight we thank you for your comforting peace thank you for your comforting presence thank you for the comforting word lord that comes to us lord you remind us of it just in that hour of our darkness in the hour when when maybe we were just about to give up we just thought nobody loved us and

with us help these people lord help them to see beyond their pastor beyond the ministry lord though we are instruments used by you many times used by you but sometimes lord we get in the flesh sometimes we don't know the right things to say or the right things to do lord we know that you always do that doesn't make excuses for us but or we want to be like you we know that you know exactly what's going through may we be led by you lord may we be guided to say the things that we say and be led to pray the prayers that we pray oh god i pray for the ministers in this church lord i don't carry this burden by myself lord i carry it with them oh lord would you just reach down lord and maybe their prayer life lord it's just not what it should have been and i know ministry is frustrating oh god would you help them lord would you help me lord to realize there's somebody we can pour out all of our thoughts to we don't have to take out our frustration on the people the lord we can pour out everything that we're going through to the one who knows the one who stands by and says i know i know your heart i know what you're going through i know why you struggle oh god help us each one to
