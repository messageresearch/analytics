on a Sunday morning and Worship the Lord it's thankful for his presence we just felt it in a very real way the last couple of services and we're just expecting God this morning Amen to meet all of our needs Wednesday night the Lord just just come down just in a in a peaceful way in a very quiet way but just just was melting Us in his presence and I'm thankful for that I it's not all about feeling we've got to have faith whether we feel it or not but I'm so glad that I can feel him because I believe him because I have the faith amen I trust that you do as well Isaiah chapter 1 and verse 18. be in prayer for the meetings try to be here this is primarily for us but so I want you to be here and I don't want you to be here because I just want you to listen to me because I won't be preaching but these brothers that we're having in they're just God called men and I believe it would be a help to you and maybe all the rest of your life would be a help this one meeting that we'd have we'll talk about the value of that this morning but especially Saturday morning this year is not going to be a youth meeting it's going to be a regular service so Saturday morning at 10 30 brother Daryl Ward will be preaching and that I'm not sure yet of who's preaching what services but I know brother Daryl will be preaching that service and it may be the only time we get to hear him this weekend if that's so then we we need to we need to be here and he's coming all this way to preach and and just try to be here if you can be on Saturday morning I believe it'll be a blessing but all the services whenever you can come I'm sure will be a blessing to you amen Isaiah 1 18 come now and let us reason together saith the Lord aren't you glad you've been invited to the meeting with the Lord though your sins be a Scarlet they shall be as light as snow though they'd be red like crimson they shall be as wool may the Lord add his Blessing to the word you may be seated in our text God is calling his people together for a meeting or what brother random calls a conference yes yes he wants to have a meeting with his people he said come come reason with me come talk to me I want to talk to you I've got something I want to tell you and in this day and age you know I think there are people we we lose sight of why we have meetings why why do we even have church which the the main spiritual life of the church is our regular Services that's that's the main spiritual lifeblood of the church and and I would say it's the most important that we're faithful to that and yet at a meeting time there's something special about that and and the reason is because God wants to have a meeting with us see he wants to talk to us see he wants to have a conference with us all the way back in the Garden of Eden god Set an instituted meetings he he had a conference there brother random called it the Eden conference in the Garden of Eden how that he met Adam and Eve after they had sinned and and they'd gone away from him and and done what the word said not to do and they went out and got fig leaves and tried to cover themselves up with religion to be able to uh to present themselves before God and yet they realize the Fig Leaf was not sufficient to be able to to bring them into the presence of God and so they fled from the presence of the Lord and the Bible says they hid themselves and God goes down through the garden the spirit of God brother says he didn't send an angel he didn't send a second in command but he come down himself into the garden and he began to cry out Adam where are you he was advertising for a meeting he wanted to meet with his children he said I want you to come together I want to have a meeting with you I want to have a conference with you I want you to know what I want to be able to speak to you and find out what's wrong why there's this distance between me and you oh I think we need that kind of meeting today many times we get called on God and we try to cover ourselves up with religion we try to cover it up but we just need to come to the house of the Lord and have a meeting with God have a conference with God people have always gathered together we're sheep there's no such thing as a Lone Ranger Christian there's no such thing as a as a loan she if there's a lone sheep that's a dead sheep because he can't protect himself on his own he needs a shepherd and he needs other sheep oh my that's what we need we need a Shepherd we have a Shepherd the great Shepherd we need each other as well but God's people always gather together the Patriarchs built altars and worshiped with their families and their servants around the altar when they died the people the Bible says every time a patriarch dies it says they were gathered with their people I heard what the random say this morning he said when he went uh beyond the curtain of time he said that the one that was speaking to him said you've been gathered with your people oh my you've been gathered with your people you've been assembled that's what going to heaven is is to be actually being assembled with the people of God he says you've been assembled with your people he said are all these randoms he said no these are your converts to Christ so now the even in the Tabernacle in the wilderness in Moses state it was called The Tabernacle of the congregation or the Tabernacle of the assembly yeah it was not the Tabernacle of the Lone Rangers right right it was not the Tabernacle of those who couldn't couldn't even stand the side of one another wasn't the Tabernacle of those who wanted to just do their own thing but it was the Tabernacle of the assembly God's got somebody that you can agree with on the principle of the atonement he's got somebody you can fellowship with somebody who you can talk to some of you say well I'm all alone in the world no God's got somebody somewhere and he says come let us reason together let's assemble together around the Tabernacle of the congregation the Israelites had seven feasts during the Old Testament during which they gathered at the Tabernacle and later the temple to worship they called it a solemn assembly when they would come together and God always did that when he was about to do something yes he's always had a gathering of the people and we know that the true Gathering today is a spiritual Gathering how many know that today brother Branham preaches on that the true Gathering is the spiritual Gathering which is because we know that Christ is God's provided place of worship that's God's provided place of worship when he died on the cross the the temple veil was rent why showing that the presence of God was no longer inside the holy of holies in the temple but it was there on the cross The Mercy Seat was no longer inside the holy of holies but The Mercy Seat become a person and The Mercy Seat came back on the day of Pentecost to live in a people that's where it is today be it Christ is God's provided place of worship he is God's assembly place he is who we rally around here's who we talk about he's the theme of our meeting are you with me now he's the theme of our church so it's bigger than Word of Life Tabernacle it's bigger than just a Ben Pruitt or Joel Pruitt or Stuart Duckworth or whoever might be preaching it's bigger than us but it's but it's God meaning with us he is God's provided place of worship Genesis 49-10 the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shallow coming unto him shall the Gathering of the people be Deuteronomy 12 and 5 but unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there even into his habitations shall you see and then Thou shalt come and here come Jesus and he come down among them he told them he said if you destroy this body tear down this Temple and I'll build it again in three days he wasn't talking about that Temple Made of Stone that Herod building was talking about his own body that was the place where God put his name he said I come in my father's name and God put his name in Jesus Christ so brother Brandon said he said I'll choose the place to put my name in the name was Jesus and Jesus is the word Saint John 1. he said that's the place of worship in Christ the word I come in my father's name again he said in my name this shall cast out Devils that's the name of the father he put his name in Jesus Christ in him he meets oh I love this where do we want to meet this weekend we want to meet in him where do you want to meet on a Sunday morning or Wednesday night we meet in him he is the word amen he said in my name in him he meets to Worship in him he meets the cast out devils in him he meets to heal the sick I mean he need healing this morning in him he needs to heal the sick Hallelujah an enemy meets the same in him he needs to fill with the Holy Ghost that's God's only place to meet people for worship in Christ amen again he said when and where will the people of God gather for the last word in Christ amen for the last day they'll Gather in Christ he said don't forget that now we got a gathering place we got it just exactly it's not Hardy Arkansas or Jeffersonville Indiana or Tucson Arizona or any other place that you can name but the Gathering Place is in Christ and yet we have a desire to meet together why we've been together before I don't want to get ahead of myself this morning but you know you are the thoughts of God all of the thoughts of God were assembled in God before the foundation of the earth and now you've been expressed on the earth and you have a desire to come together because you're one of those thoughts now in the scripture tells us he said don't forsake the Assembly of ourselves together you say well that's Sunday morning church but Paul didn't limit it to that but he says as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching I'll say this honoring the Resurrection on Sunday morning is the least that we could do but there's a desire in her heart and I don't say that there's any biblical mandate that you come together any more often than that but there's a desire on the heart of the Christian that cries out and says I want to be with other Christians especially even more as you see the day approaching in the book of Acts the disciples gathered almost constantly in Acts 2 46 they continuing daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did ether meat with gladness and singleness of heart if you've never been overseas uh on in missionary work sometimes it's hard for us as Americans to understand this because when we get done with the service a lot of times we'll get in our cars and go home but what they did over there is they they lived together by a necessity if nothing else they couldn't just drive back to their house or whatever so they got together at someone's house and they worshiped God at first in the house and then they would take the chairs up or whatever and some of you've been in churches like they had in meetings like that take the chairs up and then you eat in the same place and and you have Fellowship all day together remember when I was in the Philippines there were the wrong malays I sat there in the house the church is right across the street from the house and people started Gathering early that morning they started they'd come right to the pastor's house and they all started together and pretty soon the house was full it's about four or five stories there I think some of you have been there the Mike's been there and and the people started Gathering and it was Easter Sunday and they just saw they're touching tits fellowship if you've been in those kind of places where in the Philippines in Africa when we were in Egypt it's just an intense Fellowship it's day and night people coming and going that's the way that they were why they loved one another they cared about one another and in our individualistic Society we lose some of that and I don't say that we shouldn't have boundaries I think that we should but I do think when when they're when God when we want to have a meeting let's come together and let that wall put the walls down and just spend time with one another yeah because that's what they did now Catholicism killed the meeting I know there's message preachers today will tell you you shouldn't have meetings but look what killed the meetings Catholicism killed the meetings right go back in church history Catholicism killed the meeting it made it a formal Affair it made it just a priest stand up there with a wafer and you gathered around and then you all went home maybe you come every day and did math but that's all you did and so you went home and you just was obedient to the church they swapped Church obedience for the Holy Ghost and so what happened is pretty soon the only Gatherings that they had was Gatherings of Bishops and Gatherings of cardinals Church councils to try to figure out Doctrine that's not what God wants us together for we're not called together to figure out Doctrine who's right and who's wrong I'm not called together we're not having a meeting to straighten everybody out make sure everybody's on the same page with us that's not the purpose but the purpose is to get together and fellowship together and worship God together see an atmosphere our children can be born in Catholicism killed it so anything that kills the meeting or the Assembly of God's people together today is a child of Catholicism it's a daughter of Catholic thought right because they didn't want the people assembling because that was a threat to the mother Church so the people sit back and watched the priests and obeyed orders brother Brown talked about it he said they got through their only weapon was argument and they got to where they're cold and Powerless and formal the Ephesian Church lost its first love brother Branham says this in the church age book he said but there's something I got against you that you've left your first love you left that love that you once had for them good old-fashioned Holy Ghost meetings and you begin to kind of slide backwards into that formal come in with our father nonsense yeah I say we ought to worship God according to dictator we don't have to do it like the Pentecostals do it we don't have to do it like some church down the road does it but let's worship God in the freedom of the Holy Ghost whatever God tells us to do with Isaac that's what we need to do not what everybody else does let's let's be ourselves this morning just let our hair down because those of us that do have hair let's let her hair down and and just relax in the presence of God we talked about that Wednesday night you know brother Brandon when you have somebody come up before him he'd say now relax that that you feel he said the pillar of fire standing between me and you the filler fires all over you he would tell him he said just relax that feeling that warmth that you feel is just the presence of the Holy Spirit the presence of the angel now methodism really Luther began it but methodism really brought back the idea of having a conference or or meeting Wesley was convinced with George Whitfield to preach in the open air and ever since then evangelicals have held what they call protracted meetings conferences conventions and Revival services and I'll say this that even that can become a form yeah right it can become a form we don't want it as a form we want a reality of it but brother Branham you know held meetings and all over the country that's what he did for more than 20 years and all sorts of tents and halls and churches and theaters arenas and he even talked about going into football stadiums and different soccer stadiums he held services in motels and restaurants right and sometimes you can hear them putting down their Forks well brother Brown was preaching right and and in his first meeting when he come back to Jeffersonville he liked to hold a meeting if you study the message very much you'll you'll begin to watch where brother Branham comes back to Jeffersonville he begins to hold meetings in Jeffersonville and he explained several places why that he come back and did that he said in Israel in the church brother random come back this first meeting coming back off the field was in 1953 at the early years he only come back every few years for a meeting come back for Individual Services but he said a Revival to my opinion doesn't consist he said of bringing in new members a Revival doesn't consist of a bunch of conversions although those things go along with her Revival but a Revival is to revive what you've heard he got just to get them revived yeah we'd be doing good if we got these revived isn't that right that's why we want you to be here we want you to be revived hey man and and so again when brother Branham comes back in 1954 he come back for the mark of the beast seal of God seriously he preached that series of meetings he said and he preached the seven Church ages as well in one service that night he said these type of services if God willing he said it's directed to the church for the benefit of the church where we feel that is so greatly needed at the time everywhere for the edifying of the body of Christ in eastern 1957 he come back and Branham always tried to have Easter meetings and he'd come back and he said it seems good in our soul that we return again tonight to begin another one of those old-fashioned revivals where Sinners call out for Mercy where the backsider makes things right with God again don't you want to have a church service like that don't you want to see a meeting like that he said the holy spirit is the main person in the meeting well I'm looking forward to seeing my brothers and sisters I'm glad for the preachers that are coming but the holy spirit is the main person in the meeting who takes hold in rules and brings us to us the bread of life through the word and we pray that he'll minister to us night after night in this revival heal the sick and the need he sanctify every believer and get Glory out of these efforts that we put forth again in the Holy Ghost series Brandon comes back to preach what is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost given for and and then preached another sermon which they didn't take on how you know that you have the Holy Ghost he says I believe that we're so close to the coming of the Lord Jesus and it behooves us to do all that we possibly can to bring every soul to the kingdom and to bring the kingdom to the people oh my to bring every soul to the kingdom and to bring the kingdom to the people that we might be healed of our spirits now watch this we need healing in our bodies I asked you a while ago who all needed healing and many hands went up because we always almost perpetually need healing in some cases worse than others especially as you grow older and you just constantly your body's breaking down so we need healing but brother Branham taught us that he said the sickest body that I know of is the body of the Lord Jesus on the earth the church says the sickest body that I know of he talks about that and so he said I want this to be a meeting so we can be healed of our spirits oh would that be your cry today let it be a meaning where old grudges are settled and an irreconcilable differences are done away with and people that would be unwilling to even sin across from one another are willing to sit and forsake in the kingdom of God let it be a place where forgiveness is where the power of God breaks down all the barriers new healing yes yes we need healing of spirits president preaches the church agents the seven Church ages and the seals as meetings in his church and what I like to think as the first message meetings were in the junior high school in Jeffersonville in 1965 it's the first time it was primarily messaged people that come together and they come together to hear Brother Branham on marriage and divorce he announced he would be preaching on that it begins at Wednesday night in the uh in the Tabernacle and begins with a man running from the presence of the Lord and he goes on he preaches all those Services who is this Melchizedek and and all those services that weekend to several thousand people that were gathered at that meeting to hear the word I know there were people from this area that went to that and so they come to hear something new they come to hear something revealed right because he was different when brother Brandon had a meeting it was different because he was a prophet right and they knew that there would be something some something fresh from God now we don't come for that because the Mysteries have been revealed right right but we do come for more Revelation yeah of the word that's already been revealed so when I go to a meeting I don't expect brother Branham to get up in the pulpit but I expect the preacher to get up in the pulpit and preach to me what the what the prophet said yeah and so I can be inspired to it so I can be thrilled by it so I can be personally have the stimulation of Revelation so I want to hear the word at a meeting yes not not just a pump up or or try to make you feel good but I want to hear the word preach because the word is a discerner the thoughts and tends of the heart right so but today we rally around that message yeah the same message that Drew them from all over the country to go and hear it we had that same message just alive today it didn't die in 1965. it's still living yeah same message still alive today now we go to the why go to the trouble and expense of having meetings think about it that's it's a lot I appreciate you so much I want to tell you that ahead of time in case I forget to tell you later how much I appreciate how hard you're going to work in these meetings haha why go to that trouble and expense I I like to think of it this way and then I will go to several reasons but I like to think of this as our love gift to the other believers in this area that this is our love gift to them that that and not just ourselves because we ourselves but we can be blessed Sunday morning Sunday night Wednesday night but we want it primarily we do want to be blessed ourselves and healed and in that atmosphere and things but but we want Fellowship it's a love gift that we have and and and it takes uh it's hard sometimes to give when you give out of the out of the gladness of your heart when you give willingly there will be you can't cast your bread on the waters without it coming back more than what it was and brother Brown calls it buttered he said cast your bread on the water it'll come back buttered yeah yeah so God doesn't forget what you do so one me one purpose that we have is fellowship yeah yeah and this is one way we've found to have Fellowship is to call a meeting that's what God wanted the Garden of Eden he said I want you to Fellowship so he called the conference and fellowship isn't trivial we were we were born to Fellowship Psalm 133 and wants to behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of His Garment as the Dew of Herman as a dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion amen for there the Lord commanded the blessing even life forevermore brother Branham picks the same thought and kind of puts it in a in a another way and he talks tell us a story about the Bears and I heard about this that recently reminded me of it brother Brandon was talking about the Bears he said that got into his Camp you remember the story he said the Little Cub got in his camp in the mama bears and he said one the mom and one of the Cubs left and they went off by themselves and and he said oh my I said they like to make things rattle yeah he said they are Pentecostal to the court and I know some people say well you just have meetings to stir people up well sometimes we need to be stirred up there are moments we need to be stirred up he said they are Pentecostal to the core that way so they just love that so they get in and knock us a stovepipe down just mash it up he said I'm talking about noise he said well I better leave that alone he said I can prove anything it hasn't got emotion and it is dead so if your religion ain't got any emotion in it a little emotion in it you better bury it and get something you have to have a motion to be alive he said brother Branham also said that uh Still Waters Run Deep yes he did he also said that a loaded wagon runs quiet it does right and we've preached we've tried to preach both sides of that because I'll say this if a preacher won't preach everything that a prophet said I'd be wary of that I'd be careful of that right and so we tried to show both sides of that but you know what the difference is it's the audience that you're preaching to yeah somebody some of us need to be stirred up well we need a stirring and other times people just running around and making noise and not do anything and then you need to quieten it down and let them know Still Waters Run Deep so that they're both valid things but we preach the whole counsel of God Amen so brother random talked about that bear making noise he talked about how he had an old rusty pistol and and there was a tree he was going to climb up and it's a great story he said but he said but however this little bear the little fellow got his Pawn got this bucket open he said they love sweet stuff you know he got his little paw in the Molasses bucket he didn't know how to eat it with his hands so he just smear him and lick you know he said he would smear and lick after he got the bucket all somped out I said get out of there I kept hollering at him he wouldn't even turn and after he got the bucket sucked out he turned around looked at me you can't hardly run people off from a meeting if they ever get their hand in the molasses he said he couldn't get his eyes open from the top of his ears from down this little belly he was just full of molasses I thought that's right there's no condemnation he said that's just like a good old Pentecostal meeting when you get your hand right down in the Molasses bucket or Honey Jar up to your elbows and just shouting praising God he said I don't care what goes on you don't hear it he said but you know the strange thing was after he got over it and the rest of them standing up there scolding him when he got over there the rest of them had Fellowship oh you may not everybody may not get their hand in the in the Molasses jar but you can all have Fellowship Oh my he said it's like the anointing oil it just runs all over everything the Molasses run all over everything he said when they got the rest of them had Fellowship they all licked him he said now them people that didn't attend this meeting they can just lick your molasses when it's over to God see now that's Fellowship that's a reason to have a mean good reason we have meetings to serve others eternal life is living for others it ought to be the greatest privilege in our life serve our brothers and sisters in the Lord I I found that if you become inward focused too much what happens is you begin to bite and devour one another because you just always focused on the n-word and we need to focus on the n-word sometimes but most often we need to focus on other people you really want help you want spiritual healing start doing something good for somebody you want to be happy I found the way to be happy I was talking with someone about that the other night the way to be happy is to make somebody else happy all right that's the best route to happiness you want to be happy as a dad make your kids happy you want to be happy as a as a husband make your wife happy you want to be happy as a wife make your husband happy and if we could learn to serve others in that way it would be it would be just a communion that we would have with the real bride of Jesus Christ Galatians 6 and 10. he said as we have therefore opportunity but what is this what is a meeting what what is a time when you go to a meeting or you or you host a meeting it's an opportunity to do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith especially unto them who are brothers and sisters he said now the first thing I want to say is brother random speaking he said Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life how many believe that today that's eternal life you mamas live all your lives for your children but that's what you're built for that's what you made for live for somebody else eternal life is living for others he said when you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life for yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others another reason as we move through these quickly now as we get towards uh I won't hold you that long this morning or this afternoon because we've got things that we need to do but we want an atmosphere we want to be in an atmosphere I want my kids you know I was I'm not a fanatic but I've talked to people about this for years I don't want my kids to not know what it's like to fill the presence of God in a service I don't want them to grow up just as intellectual church kids come on who learn about the message and learn who their Pastor is and learn about this that or the other but they never get lost in the spirit of God they never get drunk on the spirit of God they never experience the power and the presence of God we've got to keep a balance but we don't I don't want my kids to grow up and never know yeah oh God so we'll do our best to create an atmosphere yes and part of creating an atmosphere is inviting other people to come in Among Us who are atmosphere builders all right we want preachers who can preach in an atmosphere we want we want people who can worship an atmosphere now why do we do that it helps us it helps them as well because you have an atmosphere Your Atmosphere Builders but it helps you now what did they do on the day of Pentecost and see what they were doing is they were experiencing the presence of the pillar of Fire as we talked about Wednesday night the warmth brother said you could you could feel the warmth of it even though you couldn't necessarily see the light of it they were feeling they were experiencing the presence of the pillar of fire the Bible says they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing body wind and filled all the house where they were sitting and they're appearing to them cloven tongues like it's a fire and it's said upon each of them the pillar of fire divided itself and would set on every human being in that Upper Room and how he said brother said how did this great Pillar of Fire the angel of God the logos that went out of God explain that on Wednesday he said let the children of Israel through the Wilderness would it come among the people it separated itself and great licks of fire began to come upon each one as the pillar of fire began to break up and God dividing himself among his people remember God doesn't become less because he divides he's the only being that can do that he's infinite oh my and so when he divides himself in You by the better safe to take a spoonful out of the ocean he said it still has all the chemicals in the entire ocean does so he dwelt in each one by measure but together they were the body of Christ he said all that ought to tear the heart out of anybody God tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit with each one of us that all together all together I can be just as good a Christian and stay at home a prophet of God said you can't direct quote said you can't oh my you can't now look he said God tore himself apart and together Hold On Together he said you see what it means can you see now why I'm standing for Unity of every Church every Full Gospel Church every believer we ought to be one heart one mind one Accord he said no matter how much we different in the scriptures oh but brother Ben we don't want people that are different from us now wait a minute do you believe what you believe or not yeah are you taught well or not right if I if we're not taught well enough that our home Church to be able to keep us from some little funny something that somebody brings around then then we probably shouldn't go to meetings right probably shouldn't have meetings but if you're taught well yeah and you listen to the prophet and you know the message of the hour it ought to be able to and we should I would never subject you to false Doctrine knowingly especially from the pulpit this is a place of authority and it ought to be just the authority of the word preach right but but I would never do that but when you get around people that are different that's okay I hate to tell you this but your peculiarity about it might be wrong yeah yeah oh that hurts don't it he said we how much we different in the scriptures one might see it this way or that has nothing to do with it he said but in principle we have to stand one Great Mighty Army of God marching on because each one of you in your peculiarity yeah God has proved that he's ignoring your Doctrine because he give you the Holy Ghost there's some crazies are you with me now the Holy Ghost leading God into all truth right but look how out brother Brown places just in the way of Fellowship he said he said God has proved he's ignoring your Doctrine he said he said uh he give them the holy ghost that obeyed him so if you really got the Holy Ghost right he said no if I obeyed him in my peculiar way yeah yeah and you obeyed him in your peculiar way he give us both the Holy Ghost so we ought to be Christian Brethren and sister enough to arm up together and March on for one great purpose the gospel now brother Brandon man of communion service he talked about it and I think I've read this to you before but it falls in here neatly he said but now when we come together in this way their God comes down you ever thought about that we felt the presence of the Lord in a communion service have you ever felt that says sweet Spirit of communion service we're coming together we're doing one thing one purpose that ought to be every service every service that we had but the communion brother said the communion table is actually broken bodies of the body of the lord we separate Among Us now he said now that is the literal body of the bread that we break representing the body of Christ so the bread is not the literal Body of Christ but it represents the body of Christ he said did you notice on the day of Pentecost what a great thing we have there that God who led the children of Israel through the Wilderness there's that Pillar of Fire that great Pillar of Fire on the day of Pentecost this great fire fell and then divided itself among his people oh the thing I think about it church and somebody said well brother Ben you're not going you've got the wrong Doctrine well I have the pillar of Fire and I can prove it by the word yeah they take what I believe back to the word that's all that matters isn't it yeah I may not have the same peculiarities that you do your church teaches but I have the pillar of fire yeah oh you're not going to make it but Ben I got the pillar of fire yeah how do you know that I have the Holy Ghost right now he said that he said all the things he said how he wants us he said how he wants us to sit together in Heavenly places he wants us to sit together he said then each one enjoying that warmth of the fire of the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit cloven tongue sat upon them like fire licks of fire god dividing himself amongst the church he said oh wouldn't that though just set our hearts burning that's when we can come together in Heavenly places again he said now you see we're not a divided people we've got to be in unity because each one of us is holding a part of God and we must come together and then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness and the fullness of it see don't you see the Satan fought that he fought the fullness of God coming bodily into Christ he fought it so hard he had all the babies killed and everything else why wasn't Brother David he wanted the fullness of God he tried to keep the fullness from coming into a body don't you realize he's doing the same thing today he did the same thing in the early church the devil fought every way he could to get them out of that upper room and keep them from receiving the fullness and today he tries to keep us apart because he doesn't want the fullness the wholeness of the Gospel he don't want every lick of fire in this area to come together in one place because if it ever come together in a long place we'd raise the roof off we we'd cast some devils out he don't want to be cast out he's squatting on your premises he he's sitting there he's sitting there taking what's yours and you he knows if we all got together we can kick him out and he don't want to be kicked out so he tries to keep you apart and give you a funny feeling against somebody now he said now then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness and the fullness of it when this church sets together in the Heavenly places then the fullness of the power of God is in his church each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings that Pillar of Fire back again it's Church important absolutely our meeting's important absolutely again he said it takes the spirit of God to bring life that atmosphere what is the atmosphere it's just the presence of God the presence what is the presence the presence of the logos the purifier the word and the Spirit Worship Him in spirit and a truth together ignites the the word in our life the Holy Ghost and and as it comes together it gets bigger and gets bigger and gets bigger and it gets I'll say it this way it comes more and more towards our dimension right we gather together you come at home you can feel it but your neighbor down the road may not feel it at the same time but when you come together it just comes more and more into your dimension because he likes to have fellowship with his people look he's with you in your prayer closet he's with you because you you worship Him you Worship in Christ he's with you there but oh if we could just get together are you with me now that pillar fire comes becomes stronger you ever done that you take a fire put it on a fire put another fire on put another fire throw more sticks on and make it bigger what are you doing giving them more fuel yeah yeah the pillar of fire needs some fuel maybe that's sometimes why we don't feel it maybe that's sometimes why we don't enter in and that's sometimes why when we sit in the song service we just sit there and look at the singer well it was a good concert it's not a concert that's not what it's for it's for you to enter in it's for me to enter hand and if we ever enter in the presence and the power of God can be so real Among Us why it's got something to it's got fuel it's got something to burn that's why we keep the church quiet that's why we the deacons try to keep things in order that's why we come here and we worship and we sing the song what are we trying to do but pile up the fuel pile up the fuel because one of these days amen it's gonna light a fire oh we gotta light that fire every service every Sunday every Wednesday every meeting oh my now he said it takes the spirit of God to bring life and that life must not come out of just the intellectual Revival it's got to come out of the Bible word Revival so whether Brandon differentiates the intellectual Revival from the word Revival instead of that word it's the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and quickens you get the same results you did in Acts 2. he said exactly it always has it always will be because it's the spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere he said it takes atmosphere to do things that's the reason you men are always taught I'm glad he said that because we'll always teach it bring your children here so certainly that's right he said I'm glad to see my daughter Rebecca come in and sit down just a few minutes ago some of you see me weak at a woman it was my daughter she'd come in and sit down he said I want her to receive the baptism of the spirit and that's why she's here in the meeting that's what the purpose of it is it takes atmosphere we come together as well for cleansing for cleansing this is the kind of meeting that God wanted to have with Israel Isaiah 1 16 he said wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the Widow hold on come now let us reason together let's have a meeting about it though your sins be a Scarlet they shall be whiter so though they be red like Michigan they shall be as well but around talked about standing out on the shore of Lake Michigan and he was watching the wakes waves coming in and the Sea wasn't jumping on the waters and jumping the boats were rocking I thought what's going on I thought why the lake is having a Revival he said it's jumping and shaking why there's a rushing Mighty Wind coming down on it I thought well you know what there isn't one more drop of water in it right now than what it was when it was perfectly steel yeah no more water in it it's just all stirred up now what's it stirred up about he said you know what the stirring up for the water does washes all the trash out of it up on the bank I don't know about you but when I get in the presence of God I begin to get like Moses I begin to repent Lord I'm not much I've not been doing what I should be doing I can see my failure this way and that way and the other you get up high enough in the presence of God you begin to recognize what you are you begin to see yourself as dirty and sinful but you know that there's a blood that takes care of all your sin so you cry out to him in the presence of God and say wash me in that blood take away my mistakes and my failures take away my sinful thoughts let me be clean oh God wash all the trash out of me so I can be right all the unbelief that's what my brother Brown said the trash was unbelief he said washing all the trash up on the bank he said what do we need is a washing of unbelief out on the bank let the word of God have preeminence that's what we need a Revival wash all the unbelief out all the bugs and superstitions and things come out and see that God is still God that's what we have revivals for he said then I think again he said that's like the lake having a Revival it shakes it and jumps it jerks it around until all the dross gets out that's just the way revivalists let us come into the spirit of the Lord and rejoice all over the bin you can't Rejoice the prophet of God said I could make wrongs right oh brother being you can't repent but the prophet of God said are good Hallelujah and a closer walk amen I believe you can't have a closer walk prophet of God said I could I'm going to believe in a word of Authority for my hour I don't read these quotes to you because I feel like it because it makes it easier to preach I got plenty of things I can preach on I read this to you because a word of authority a voice of authority spoke in our day and he said you can have Revival personal Revival in your heart amen he said reconsecration of dedication all the things and doubts of the world are all thrown out on the bank and it's a good clear running from then on The Old Ship of life begins to serve through it or you don't have to watch so much because everything is out of the way yes yes why do we have meetings we're practicing for heaven yes I know some people don't like me to make some nervous it's gonna be a hard you're gonna have a hard time in heaven yeah it's gonna be one big meeting Hallelujah this brother Branson has been in a group like this it's the closest place to heaven that there is on Earth when here we are sitting togetherness when you say well I can do that at home but not like you will in heaven because when you're in heaven all your loved ones will be there yeah imagine somebody wanting to be alone in heaven think about it for a minute I know there's some loners out there and God makes certain people different people different ways I'm not criticizing you for that some people like to be alone but when we get to heaven we are not going to be alone yeah let me say this you don't need to be alone yeah yeah and I don't mean just physically you need to know that somebody cares about you you need to know that somebody loves you you need to know you said but brother Ben I haven't seen that from from the church I haven't seen that from from a pastor I've not seen that from from anyone else but God loves you yeah and he promised in his word he would be with you right then you're not alone right right and the thing is in a meeting sometimes I'll think about this you come in and and say that I had a certain I'll use myself as an example say I had a certain issue in my life that I had something maybe that that got me down maybe my my kids are acting up or that would never happen but got trouble at work I mean I'm doubting myself you ever doubted yourself I've done that I've been there and done that you Scout yourself you wonder early belong in church they really belong I'm just being real with you this morning am I really a bride God are you real you just start to die well maybe the message you know it's such a mess you know maybe it's just not what you're alone you're alone when God dwelt Alone he said it's not good yeah you need to start having fellowship with the word yes yes you need to start having fellowship with one another you didn't start having fellowship with the church and just just force yourself sometimes sometimes you have to I have to sometimes you have to just force yourself to be about around people people are problems yes they are but it's also a way out of your problems because what happens in a meeting is I'll come there maybe I'm dealing with something no one else in my church is dealing with but somebody else will come from somewhere else and they'll have that same issue that they're dealing with and and somehow in a conversation or just just knowing it about that person it'll it'll it'll do something to me because I'll see God maybe deliver them or bring them out of that and I think oh God if you did it for them you can do it for me and it builds my faith to see they had cancer they had that diabetes they had high blood pressure but God healed them and he healed them he could heal me they struggled in this way or that way or the other they had a past they had they were out in sin but God miraculously saved why do you think he calls preachers the way he do he don't call the best of the best but he calls sometimes the worst to the worst and he calls them out and says now you go preach the gospel why because they're people who have been there and done that and they know God is a forgiver so I've done things in my life I put myself in a place where I couldn't even do that anymore I'll say this you ought to be able to testify more than anybody God is still deliver because you're still in the house of God you're still worshiping you're still praising God every one of us ought to be able to worship God for that don't let the devil get you alone he wants to talk to you alone got to tell you that was the greatest test that Jesus went through in fact you had to go through it alone you don't have to right you realize he even went through Calvary without the father without the influence of the father that warmth that we felt on Wednesday night he goes to the Cross without it yeah no feeling of God's presence yeah no feeling and can you imagine for a person who lived in that realm Jesus was a man but he lived in that realm he was also God for him who lived in that realm to be completely taken taken away from him died like a sinner can you imagine can you imagine what that must have felt like why did he do it so that you and I would never have to experience that if you're experiencing that today it's because you just need to get closer to it you don't ever have to experience being alone right it's good brother says we are already dead here we are sitting together this morning we already did Satan can't kill us we are we already did amen that job is done over we're buried yeah he said then we are not only that we're risen again we are raised and in Christ in his resurrection we're part of it and now we're assembling together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus see we are in him by baptism uh that means something yeah yeah we are in him by baptism see by one spirit so not water baptism but by Holy Spirit baptism we're baptized in one body and here we are now assembled the body of the Lord Jesus and the Bible when it talks about heaven and Isaiah are the Millennium it says therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come with singing and to Zion it'll come with woe it's me and all of those things they come with singing why because they're gathered together that's why sometimes the spirit of the Lord moves in a special way in a meeting why we're practicing for heaven getting ready for heaven that's the way it's going to be up there God was singing and design these these musicians are going to practice this afternoon they got a job they've got more job security than I do because they got a job when they get to heaven are you with me now I may be able to sing by the bill up there as well praise God oh all the all the awkwardness will be done away with all the flatness will be done away with all the all the things like that I'd just be able to see the Praises of God won't be any critics whoa maybe I will preach you imagine singing to an audience with no critics in it it makes me want to shout and run to your house can you imagine playing an instrument it's in heaven the Bible said there would be we don't know exactly what kind they are but I don't know maybe a bass guitar I don't know what that harp was if they played back then might have been a bass guitar harp so you're gonna die if there's a if you could die in heaven you just die if you saw drums I'll say this everything was part of the word will be there right he said praise him on the loud symbols brother Brandon could believe for his dog and his horse I'm believing for drums man what is it Everlasting Joy shall be upon her it's all right to be happy in church [Music] it's all right to be glad in the house of the Lord you believe that today it doesn't mean you don't know what I've done you don't know my savior you don't know my redeemer he brought me out of the deep Maori clay he set my feet on a solid rock to stay I'm not I'm not relying upon what people think about me I'm relying on what God thinks they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee away are the brand I'm talking about that man complaining about the noise he said this is the quietest place you'll ever live I'll tell you that because if you go to hell there'll be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth if you go to heaven why even the angels Don't Stop day and night screaming holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty he said watch such Hallelujah said amens and praise the Lord you never heard such still you heard that meeting up there you want to criticize this for being loud you want to say we're getting in the flesh you never heard nothing until you heard that meeting up there I feel like David when he said if you don't like this what you don't like that watch this oh Hallelujah he said how do you know how do you know how it will act well I know how you acted before you became you in other words before you were expressed in a body of Flesh you act in a certain way where do we get that from well job chapter 38 and verse 7. the morning Stars saying together some of y'all going to sing for the first time yeah yeah might as well practice and all the sons of God they shouted brother Bill when I was a thought right and we don't believe in pre-existing bodies or things like that but the brand said it was a Mormon Doctrine what we believe is we were the thoughts of God whatever form I was in as a thought of God oh my Hallelujah in the mind and in the mind of God I shouted for Joy he said but brother Ben we can't bring that down here oh I believe when I get to heaven I'm going to cut up a rug I'm gonna run oh we can't bring that down here what does brother Brown say when he dedicated the Tabernacle musicians go ahead and come I'm closing this morning what a brother better say when he dedicated to Tabernacle he said let us purpose in our heart today that in commemoration and waiting for that Tabernacle to come that we will so characterize ourselves by his spirit that we will worship in this place as if we were in that other place waiting for that place to come whole church let's just let go and let God do what he wants to do is that your desire raise your hands with me oh let's just pray that way Heavenly Father Lord we believe that you're you're going to move in our meetings we believe you've moved here this morning we believe Lord that your God that's worthy of worship help us to get out of the way Lord help us to move aside from the things of the earth and the things of the world oh God let us let us be raised up in a Heavenly atmosphere Lord as we're seated together may we sing together oh God may we shout for Joy together Lord in the presence of God lord I know some people aren't emotional some people are but whatever way that you cause for us to move oh God I pray you to help us to do that
