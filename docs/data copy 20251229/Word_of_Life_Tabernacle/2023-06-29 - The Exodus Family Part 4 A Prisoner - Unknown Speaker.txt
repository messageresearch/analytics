day [Music] thank you Lord oh are you thankful to be in this church tonight not just in this church but in the Church of Jesus Christ amen part of the body of Christ so grateful to be here tonight let's turn to Exodus chapter 2 and verse 11. thank you for that music tonight bless our musicians we've got wonderful wonderful music I'm just always thrilled when we get to go back and listen to it and and watch it and I know there's several folks watching tonight and they're sick or have a need we'll be praying for you I also wanted to say we're going to have a little meeting on Sunday sometime probably after the Sunday morning service people just want to volunteer to do stuff at the meetings that move cars and park cars and help the deacons and stuff like that we're going to do that on Sunday and kind of tell you what's going to be going on also communion Sunday afternoon and we'll do our best to make sure it's not too hot but uh Sunday's supposed to be pretty mild day I think in the 80s so it should work for us now we've got a unit out but that's supposed to be replaced next week so thankful the Lord has worked that out uh so we'll have that replaced and we'll have have it cool again for you I I know sometimes you come in early in the morning on Sundays it's cold well there's a reason for that because it won't keep up in the afternoon so trying to balance it out so but we'll uh we'll we'll get there to one of our units went down but it served US 23 years so that's probably a pretty good record actually Exodus chapter 2 and verse 11. don't forget communion Sunday afternoon also Brother David Morris is having meetings this week if y'all would want to go to that I think the services start at seven in the evening and brothers Willie Smiley's going to be there I'm not sure what nights he's preaching but I enjoy brother Smiley's Ministry from Florida and there's some other brothers as well not sure about the other ones but uh as far as I don't know them haven't heard them preach but but I know brother smile he's a real good man a man of God and so you'd be welcome I'm sure over there it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown that he went out into his brethren looked on their burdens and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one of his brethren [Music] and he looked this way and that way when he saw that there was no man he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand and when he went out the second day behold two men of the Hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong wherefore Smite of thou thy fellow and he said who made the apprents and a judge over us intend to style to kill me and thou killest the Egyptian and Moses feared and said surely this thing is known and when Pharaoh heard this thing he sought to say Moses Moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian and he sat down by a well I want to speak to you tonight on the subject of a prisoner let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be in your house tonight so thankful to be Lord the church Lord the people of God to be your body here on the earth your hands your feet your lips Lord I pray God that you'd help us tonight to be that part of the body that we were called to be Lord to be ears that's the part of the body that we were called to be to listen Lord to to speak only those words that you called for us to speak Lord as we as we preach may it only be those words that that would be beneficial to your people we pray or we wouldn't want to do anything to to hurt anybody Lord we want to help we want to edify and so I pray that it would be so tonight Lord I pray for those that are sick those requests that have already been made Lord that the little children that are home tonight I pray you'd bless them and help them Lord some that are sick and are in need facing surgery and different things I pray you'd help them Lord Lord and that you completely work it for for their good as we know that you will we thank you for it now we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated Gabe I can't believe you're in church man God bless you you can come to church with a broken leg you can come to church right must seem strange to Moses when his human effort failed because Moses knew who he was he was the deliverer he he had been taught that by his mother that he was the deliverer he was the one who was supposed to do this and now he sees an opportunity to do what he's been called to do and it doesn't work it just doesn't work it doesn't happen the way he envisioned it people don't rally behind him all he ends up with is a dead body in the sand a single dead Egyptian he understood that he'd been trained and and protected for this role he'd heard the story of his birth of his unique birth and and how that he was singled out among all the the boys of that time the young children as being a goodly child he knew the faith of his parents and he also knew that it was the time the 400 years were up it was time for Israel to be delivered and and he knew that everything was ready and the cup of the iniquity of the amorites was full and he had made a choice we talked about last week to be identified with Believers and that's an important choice to make every one of us have to make that choice to be identified with Believers to be a part of a church to uh to be a message believer we have to we have to identify we have to not be ashamed of that he made a choice to be identified he knew he wanted to be a follower of Jehovah yet he had never met God for himself or been commissioned for the work so it's one thing to know that you're supposed to do it it's another thing to be commissioned for it and and part of the problem it was that brother Branham taught us he was not yet a prisoner to the word he was not a prisoner to the will of God for his life and I want to tell you today that I think our churches are filled with many wonderful people who who have had experiences and and who have made choices and who know that they're the bride because we've told them that as we should and we've told you you're the elect of God and you belong to God because that's who you are and and you know that but I wonder how many people are actually prisoners to the will of God actually prisoners to the word of God and that's what I want us to examine tonight Lord am I a prisoner I want to be a prisoner I I don't want to be a prisoner of my own will I don't want to be a prisoner of my own ambition I don't want to be a prisoner of my own mind or my own ideas but I want to be a prisoner of the will of God for my life and sometimes that means that I've got to I've got to not do things that seem like I should do because I'm waiting on the on the unction from God on the anointing of God on the blessing of God to do it because there's many things that we could do and yet maybe it's not the time right and so we wait until the time because we don't we don't want to jump the gun because that's what Moses did and he ended up with a dead Egyptian now Paul the Apostle Paul in the New Testament describes himself as a prisoner three times in the New Testament in Ephesians chapter 3 and verse one he said calls himself the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you gentiles and Philemon one he calls himself a prisoner of Jesus Christ in verse 9 he says calls himself Paul the Aged and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ I want you to notice he does not say I'm a prisoner of the Roman state although he was he didn't say I'm a prisoner because of the Jews he didn't say I'm a prisoner because of the people persecuting me but he said I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ for you oh my that's the kind of ministry that we want to have and all of us have a Ministry is that right well our ministry we want to be prisoners of the will of God for the people for the sake of the people now so he was not a prisoner of the emperor he was not a PR he understood that he was a prisoner of the will of God and we know that Paul had an experience with God when he got knocked off of his horse on the way to Damascus and he saw the pillar of fire and when he did you know people that don't believe in the New Testament have just never read it like they should because if you read the New Testament you'll find that it exactly it fits in with the Old Testament so well that Paul being a Jew saw a pillar of fire and knew what it was and he says who are you Lord and when he does say who are you Lord he knew it was it was God but he was surprised to see that that was Jesus amen some people are surprised today when they look and see that the god of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament he was surprised to see that it was Jesus but he goes down and he's filled with the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands of of ananias there and his eyes come open but then he does not immediately begin to preach he doesn't immediately go out and do what God had called him to do although God told him he said I'm gonna he said I'm going to show you the things you've got to suffer and you're going to be a light to the Gentiles but he doesn't immediately go do it right and so many times we get in trouble by human effort because we want to help somebody but sometimes we can't help and sometimes what we're doing is actually hurting not helping that person because it's got to be God's time you you can try to you can try to hatch that chicken out of the egg all you want to it'll never work the chicken's got to Peck his own way out of the shell and so sometimes all of our human effort doesn't work and how many times I can testify to myself brother Joe that how many times in my life have I tried to make something work and make something fit and make something make somebody a child of God you can't do it all you can do is preach the word and if there's a seed of God that's ready to be awakened it'll hear it and come to it and if it's not you can't make it happen right right now that there's not enough money in the world to make it happen there's not enough time in the world not enough counseling that you could do not enough preaching not enough Holy Ghost services that you could do unless it's God's time but when it's God's time it don't matter if they're on their way to kill Christians like Paul was when it's God's time that seed will come alive Paul says Paul says I I'm not going to go preach but he went down into Arabia to study the scriptures to study the Old Testament to see if it lined up with what God was showing him in Galatians chapter 1 verse 15 brother or the Bible says when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace oh he was the elected of God he knew it he said to reveal his son in me that I might preach him amongst the Heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood neither when I am to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again to Damascus no wonder he could say If any man preaches another Doctrine let him be accursed right Paul knew what he was talking about because he got it from God himself and brother random taught us that he come out preaching the same thing they were preaching right only had the light of the revelation of the the gospel of the Gentiles but he was preaching the same Jesus that they were preaching when he come out why because he got it from from Christ himself the word so now he being who he was yet he could not just go do what God had called him to do by human effort he had to be a prisoner to the word we find all the way at the end of his life in Acts chapter 20 verse 22 he says Now Behold I go Bound in the spirit Bound in the spirit what was it he said it's not the Jews that are going to take me it's not the the Romans that are going to take me but by the spirit of God I'm a love slave to God I'm a prisoner and I know the will of God is for me to stand before Caesar and Testify the gospel and because of that because he knew the will of God for his life he said I'm going Bound in the spirit to Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the Holy Ghost Witnesses in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me but none of these things moved me why because I'm a prisoner I I'm harnessed up to the word in such a manner not just the written word but to the will of God for my life to the to the present truth yeah are you with me tonight I'm so harnessed to the present truth that by the game I can't do anything else but live it even if it means me acting strange to the world I'm a prisoner now Moses had instruction it made his choice that he wasn't a prisoner yet and many times we grow up and as we're talking about the family many times young couples and young families and sometimes older people I've never really found that that thing that binds them that commitment that binds you to the word of God and I'm not trying to make you feel bad about that if you're in that situation tonight but you need to find it you put your anchor down somewhere right yeah you got to have an absolute somewhere yes it is an experience with God there is an absolute experience with God but even if you have an experience with God there must be a time and I think this is where brother Baylor said we don't believe in overnight conversions go listen to you must be born again but the brown said you don't take somebody out of the world and stick them up playing a guitar the night after because it takes time to grow he said you're not born a full a full-born Believer you're born a baby you gotta learn how to walk and we've talked about that you don't you don't treat them badly because they walk bad because they because they stumble every now and then it's a baby but there Comes A Time of maturity there Comes A Time of becoming a prisoner there Comes A Time of learning the voice of God and learning the will of God in your life and you've got to reach that point at some time at some time there's a time you can you can be blissfully ignorant of the will of God and you can just wander around and everything's good and everything's everybody's serving God everything's happy but you're going to face some bumpy roads down there somewhere you're going to face some opposition God knew Moses was going to face Pharaoh head on he had to have something that would hold him in spite of opposition he had sometimes there's something that would hold him in spite of the threat so Moses well it's not a prisoner yet and I just want to deal with some of these things and and we'll let you go quickly tonight now a man has to surrender brother said every ambition someone say every ambition every ambition he's got everything that he is everything his life soul body will Ambitions and everything else and become a complete prisoner to Christ who is the word to serve God now let me stop there and add a little disclaimer we do not surrender our Ambitions our life our soul our body and our will to the pasture right we don't we don't surrender it to the church we surrender to the will of God for our life we got to have a direct connection to God right so so that's the caveats that people will use that and say well you you need to do what the pastor says I I wish people you know I would like for people to do what I say but do it because it's the word not because I said it all right do it because it's right do it because you know the will of God for your life it's the will of God for me to be in the house of God it's the will of God for me to be whatever office that I'm feeling it's the will of God for me to be raising my children in this way find out for yourself so he said he had to surrender everything he was and become a complete prisoner to Christ who is the word to serve God now Moses knew that he was born to deliver he knew that and did you notice with the ambition that Moses had knowing his mother had told him over there she was his Nurse Mate now notice what he says the ambition brother around uses that word in in a prisoner uses that over and over and over again and because God can't do much with our ambition right as long as we've got ambition he gets in the way of God and it's not wrong in life to have an ambition to be something and do something but many times it doesn't line up with the will of God so we have to surrender that ambition to the will of God and wherever that ambition crosses the will in the word of God we we just surrender to God so many times God has to remove the ambition from us to use us because again that's what I found out is if you get somebody that comes in with too much ambition I don't know if you've ever been part of a company especially if you have a company that works in other words it's a company that the cogs are all oiled and everything is smooth and it's turning the way that it ought to and everything's running the way it ought to and then you get the employee with the ambition and he shows up he's going to change everything he's going to fix everything right but that don't always work like that it don't often work like that churches are the same way you get somebody with ambition sometimes they can do more harm than good and yet a person with no ambition never gets anything done but your Ambitions has to line up with the word so again uh so brother Branham begins to dramatize this and and he told she told Moses about his birth and she told him about how that she oh she put him in the in the little boat and and how he drifted down the river and the Gators wouldn't touch him and the Angels were all around him oh it must have been a a wonderful story that he liked to hear over and over about his birth and how he was protected and how he was the elected of God don't you like to tell your children things like that that you're a child of God son I would say when God healed you I was there when he filled you with the Holy Ghost you should have seen our family before that family curse was broken that cycle and now I've seen your life you're elected of God you're you're you are the you are the one who gets to lift the family up above that you've got a Deliverance in your life and it's a good thing to tell our children that he had to know yeah but in doing that it created an ambition in his heart and that ambition had to be surrendered to the word so brother Branham tells this he said Moses talking joke about is speaking to Moses Moses the doors are all shut honey you're 16 years old now you're going to be Pharaoh's son someday you're going to be the deliverer that's going to take the people out of here oh my we tell our kids you're going in a rapture if it don't happen in my generation look for it in yours I've told my children expect their body change expect God to do some things we've seen too many signs we're down at the end of the road Specter Revival we want our children to expect a Revival but you don't want to get our ambition mixed up with Revival right we want a Revival expect a Revival expect God to move expect the move of the spirit of God be careful when ambition gets in the middle of it so now he said she said honey you're 16 years old now Peter is 16 years old you have Ambitions when you're 16. Peter's ambition right now is to be able to drive and I've driven ridden wode with him a couple times I'm taking volunteers right now uh that's he's 16. and you got Ambitions when you're 16. I remember when I was 16 I was going to change the world I had an ambition to be an evangelist never had an ambition to be a pastor much but I had an ambition to be an evangelist I thought that was you know the thing to be because you get to preach and leave and if you preach long people just say well the spirit of God moved you know him so but you know here we have Ambitions Moses had Ambitions and she's telling him this is who you are someday you're going to be the deliverer come take the people out of here and the writer said Moses Ambitions begin to grow I'll study mother I'll study everything I can Peter hasn't had those Ambitions yet says you know what I'll do I'll I'll study how to be a military man I'll know how to take these people out of here I'll be a great General Bishop till I know how it's done and I'll take it out I'll get my PhD or ll I'll do it I remember those days gonna fix it we're gonna fix everything that's wrong fix some things that aren't wrong so then notice this that Moses got all the training because he knew he was so smart so educated so intellectual until there's nobody he could even teach the Egyptians he could teach their psychologists so psychology could deliver the people Moses could teach their psychologist why didn't he just use that he tried he ended up with a dead Egyptian he could teach their generals what military might was he was a great man and people feared Moses because of his greatness oh such a scholarship man he was a archbishoper maybe like a pope he was a great fellow he was a mighty man he knew that he was born to do this and trained with great ambition to do it and now we find out when Moses know is training and today with all the training making big Bishops and so forth great High ambition what will we do our Ambitions become just about like what Moses was he said God before he could get the man in his hand he had to strip him of his ambition oh don't you realize he's got to do the same thing to you and I today before he can get us in his hand he's got a strip of us strip us of our ambition he's got to take it off of us he had to strip him of all his training he said he did go out and he delivered he killed one Egyptian and you don't know he just took the opportunity to do it but maybe he thought it would work out differently than it did he thought maybe he would gain favor with the Israelites he found out real quick by human effort he couldn't gain favor with God's people and so he went out and he he killed one Egyptian and when he did he found out he was in the wrong he couldn't do that it wasn't that way and God had to take him out into the Wilderness into the desert into a desert place now we know that prophets always go to the desert and I've often wondered why why the desert because if God wants to speak to me why can't he send me to the mountains where there's grass and whether it's water and but they go to a place that's very difficult prophets would go to a place where there was nothing but sand and scorpions and sun and the reason why they would go to the desert is because God was going to beat some things out of them God was gonna he was gonna Scorch some things out of him he was going to cut he was gonna let him be hungry and be thirsty and they had to go to the desert even Jesus had to go to the desert to be tempted before he could begin his ministry and all of us I think at some point in our lives we go to the desert we go through desert places we we go into the desert we find that the desert and the Hebrews believes the desert was out of the will of God it was away from God and it was far from God because it was snow there was no rain and and there was no promise of no ability to grow a crop and so many of the prophets went out there because they had to be tried and tested before God could use them and just remember if you're in the middle of a desert today God's going to do something in your life he's going to help you in some way but he's got to put you through the desert first you got to go to the desert if you're not willing to go to the deserts you probably won't ever come out and and be a prisoner to Christ and Moses time he took him out of the desert kept him out there for 40 years we talk about training stripped him of all of his theology all his ambition now watch the trajectory of Moses life here is a baby he's he's placed in the care of his mother he gets a little older at some point brother says 16 at some point he goes back into Pharaoh's house and then when he goes back into Pharaoh's house then he goes from a Hebrew home and he goes to be a son of pharaoh and then he goes through all the training and the wars and Josephus says that he went down to Ethiopia and conquered Ethiopian did all of those things and in his life he becomes a great General he becomes a mighty man of knowledge and Science and all these things and and so he's a political leader and inside he's hiding the fact that he's a believer right but now he's 40 years old it's time to do something with your life it's time if you're ever going to be a deliverer Moses when you're going to do it and I'm sure those pressures were on him as they're on us sometimes if if there ever was a time that we have to resist status today because you can't afford to do something out of the will of God but the brown said the bride would know his voice and know his will and if she had thus said the Lord or she'd keep still and that's the age that we live in at the time of maturity yeah yeah but Moses was almost 40 years old and and he's thinking what am I going to do how am I going to make this work well he didn't have to make it work when it come time God would make it work but I love the fact that as long as Moses didn't make this mistake now think through it with me for just a moment if he doesn't kill the Egyptian he never goes into the desert if he never goes into the desert God can't train him right there's a reason why God doesn't tell us anything ahead of time everything ahead of time he doesn't tell us everything many times we make mistakes we go into the desert we go someplace maybe some some place we weren't supposed to be or some relationship that we shouldn't have been in or some kind of church that ended up being a cult of some kind and we end up in that situation we wonder why did I take that knee to her I was like going through that well God had to take and the only way he was going to get you to the desert was to get you to realize that you your place couldn't be found in Egypt you weren't going to be able to do it by human effort so you may just dig deep to your brother JT do you finally get back in the will of God what were we doing all that time well you're you're being trained oh my oh I've seen that hand of God do that in my life I see him do it in many of your lives and I think we can tell our children today just look out there's coming a time you may not have a lot of knowledge today you may have been taught a lot you may have been told who you are but there's coming a Time God's going to train you you're going to go through it but remember at the end hey man at the end there's an oasis when Moses gets through the desert he goes to a well and when he gets to the well there's someone there for him amen Hallelujah I just intended to read this tonight I got to slow down a little bit look at this brother Brandon says oh at a time God stripped him of all these things how we could look how he could look back and see his failure I think all of us could do that if we were just real honest right just take off the Halo and put it down and unattach the wings lay them down beside us and be real honest with each other every one of us could look back and see mistakes see failures he was still God's prophet he was still God's man he said how we tonight ought to do the same thing when we see our ambition he said look at the healing campaign see if the Lord did something a few years ago to start restoring healing to the sick and so forth he said everybody every organization is because it didn't come into their organization they had to get them A Healer and what have we done he said let's look at it just a moment we've done the same thing that Moses did we've went out listened and tried so hard to manufacture some kind of a miracle I smelt the disease I got blood in my hand and manufacture a miracle we need to be careful with God's men because if we're not careful we we pressure men of God who have gifts to perform a miracle and you can't just perform a miracle on a whim right and if you're not careful you'll push men of God into wrong things I'm thinking broadly now not just to you people sitting here but we'll if we're not careful we'll push men of God into wrong things until they smell diseases and got blood in their hands and stuff why because the people demand a miracle and Jesus goes down to the pool of Bethesda and he goes down to the uh to the among those five portions with thousands of people laying there and he weaves his way down through the crowd and he finds one man and he said people don't understand compassion because they think compassion would have caused him to heal all the sick that we're laying there and he didn't do it he didn't even look for the most serious one but he had one in his mind he had one that the father showed him that's the one you got to help it's the one the father shows you now he said we've tried so hard to manufacture some kind of a miracle what have we got some of the men in such hard strains broke up and become regular drunkards neurotic got their minds they switched all the way back to order from the Pentecostal objective back to making organizations and things again what have we done slew about one Egyptian that's right and we've tried we've strained we've paid we've labored if you if you think works can earn you salvation I can take you to some Wesleyan Holiness people that will prove you wrong because they outwork us I can take you to some Pentecostal churches some fire baptized Holiness churches that could outwork us ten to one we can go to some Baptist Churches that'll outwork us that's just the fact that there's some Baptist Churches out there that will completely outwork message people because they're always doing good works but that's not what we're called to do we're called to be conduits of what God wants none of our own works but the Bible said it was a type of a mule mule is always working but he's stubborn he won't do he won't follow the will of the master so now he said we've tried we've strained we've paid we've labored go all night long in prayer means to we had no voice try to manufacture something soup up something all these type of things and find it to be a total failure he said we need to going back to the desert he said crackings and struggles why not just give up I wish I wish we had more given up I've said that before you don't come to an altar when you come to to pray through you don't come you don't come to change God's mind you come to change your own mind you don't come to an altar to get something you come to give up something and get through yourself that's why we need an altar sometimes that's why we need altar calls you that's why sometimes we need to get get in the spirit get out of formality enough to where we can we can feel the presence of God and he can move us out of ourselves but it's not God it's not like we have to pray God down he's already here but we just need to get out of this veil of Flesh we just need to get away from this binding flesh that's all around us so what did they do they struggled he said why don't just give up why not just give me so much easier if you just give up to the will of God see where are you preaching what are you preaching preacher you're here you're trying to make us give up yes give up your own ambitions give up your own ideas give up your own theology it never worked it never will work we can I can show you thousands of shipwreck lives because somebody got some weird idea and ran with it and all it does is create shipwreck and I say that from experience today I know what it does to a family I know what it does to a church when somebody gets an idea for a different from the word and starts to run with it just give it up give it up and let God do let God fulfill his own word we don't have to figure it out and let God do that just preach the word he said that's what you ought to do so you go back and give up why have we done the same thing they did same thing Moses did it doesn't do any good after 40 years he found himself a prisoner of the word of God what do we try to do he said when the great blessing come out the manifestation of all these great things that God has told us about how that we must be born again how we must receive the Holy Ghost of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ all these things here he said you see people instead of staying to that word harness to it what did they do they started with their own denominational Theory which had already failed and try to manufacture something to look like the truth what have we got tonight but a nation full of organized people who deny the scriptures of God who would call the life of the Holy Spirit it was mental telepathy it would refuse to such succumbing to their church and they wouldn't permit you to mention one word of serpent seed eternal security the things that the Holy Spirit has revealed and proved to be the word what if they got the same thing that Luther had the rest of them flew in Egyptian what was it maybe he made some men stop stealing see you see the type he Sue in Egyptian he reformed somebody made some man stop stealing or maybe live true to his wife now that's a noble thing but what did you make him out of that a church member come and join our group that stinking dead man I love this speaking dead man was the only thing he could Point his finger to of success of 40 years of training a stinking Egyptian laying there rotten and dead he said that's about the way it is tonight the only thing we can point to this revival that's crossed over now he lived during that time when they were the Revival was Crossing into the charismatic world and had become into the lutherans and the methodists and the Catholics we've talked about that before the very organization that was that was promoting brother Brandon was also promoting Catholicism and going back to Rome and brother Branham called it out rebuked it demons should carry in some of those people that were there were actually promoting that we've talked about that what you have today with the great mega churches is a direct result of that charismatic move and so he says all we've got in that is a stinking bunch of church members that knows no more about God than a hunting talk would know about an Egyptian Knight he said that would tell them about the word of God he said they say I don't believe that say I don't care what you say I don't believe it that's an awful thing to have to point back to for all the strains and struggles and everything we got maybe we can point to a big school but it's dead we could point to an organization but instead sneaking it's just like the first thing we pulled out of like a hog going to swallow a dog to its vomit when we turn back it's one dead Egyptian and then he goes down talks about the will of God for Moses life and he talked about how everybody must have come out there people who knew Moses knew he was called and said Moses what are you doing in the wilderness you should have went back and done something why did you fail why aren't you doing this he said why aren't you out over doing this and why aren't you out here trying this why don't you go on with the rest of them he said Moses was out there getting stripped until he had an experience at the burning bush that declared the word I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I remember my promise I've come down to deliver them I'm sending you to do it that was it listen to this it's so important he's seen the word not the ambition of the people or the desires of the people that's that's what I have to do all right if I'm going to be a true minister of God if somebody yoked up to the word I've got to see the word rather than the Ambitions of the people of my own right I've got to see the word rather than the ambition or the desire of the people because that's very fickle it changes it'll go all over the place right but but it's and it's not because people are bad it's because they're not all called to lead Moses was called to be the one that led them out they would come out but he was called believe them out so he could not be bound to the Ambitions of the people or the desires of the people that's what's so hard about leadership and if you're any kind of in any kind of a leadership role especially your dad's in your homes you can't always bend to the desire of the people and you also are not a dictator so you can't just tell them what to do so how do you make that work leadership is about having making people follow thinking that was their idea that's what leadership is right you got to get them to buy in how do you do that live the life love your family spend time with them but make sure that they know what that you know what you're talking about same thing with the church you got to get people to buy in you got to get them to think that it was their idea because you can't always bend to the will of the people but the parents had never confused the will of the majority with the will of God now watch that's true of all of us all of us are leaders in some way he said then what did he become he did not want to face the Egyptians anymore you didn't want to face this thing anymore but it become a prisoner oh my 40 Years of running stripping down but then he become a prisoner at the burning bush the mighty Moses with all of his intellect the Bible saying Moses was a mighty man in a word or indeed down in Egypt but watch he said what the mighty Theologian did in the presence of the burning bush he only confessed his inability when he seen the genuine purpose of God he confessed that he was enabled to do it yet he was trained in all the theology that they could give him trained in their best school but yet what could he do with that Pillar of Fire hanging there in the bush he said Lord I can't even talk now he was getting somewhere Lord who am I that I should go look what 40 years had done to Moses 40 years on the backside of the desert he'd married a wife he'd learned some things brother said God gave my wife for the temper like his he'd grown up yeah it comes back by the Helen he says I don't want to go he wanted to go so bad he killed a man and now he's being dragged Kicking and Screaming back to Egypt yeah God said Moses you're the man he said Moses I have come down to deliver and Moses said good go do it he said nope you're gonna do it Moses you're going to be God to the people how can I be God to the people all I've ever produced in my life is one stinking dead Egyptian it's all I've ever produced but Moses you're going to be God to the people Aaron will be your Prophet you're going to speak and you're going to speak things into existence how am I going to do it God had to show him the supernatural to even build his courage up to go back oh my God he just he beat all of it out of him all of his ambition was gone he was about to become a prisoner of Jesus listen he said I can't even talk who am I that I should go get your shoes off Moses I want to talk to you strip yourself down even your shoes you're flat on the ground again I want to talk to you couldn't even talk finally elected prisoner a elected Prophet just like that Paul was elected Moses was elected delivered this is so amazing to me if you take free will an election and put them together you realize that you are absolutely going to do what God tells you to do but he's not going to make you do it how's he going to do it we've preached about it before he overwhelms us he overwhelms Us by his sovereignty he overwhelms Us by his grace he overwhelms us with love and he leads us right he leads us he allows us to get all of that beaten out of us and he leads us right back to the place where we were supposed to serve to begin with but it'll be in his time see he said he is finally God had his elected subject a prisoner to him oh Hallelujah he could only move as the word of God moved him so you notice his attitude he said who should I say sent me he wasn't saying now God this is what I've come up with this idea about who you are so what he said God said this is who I am I am that I am very bad he didn't he didn't try to tell God how God should operate or who God should be he said who shall I say sent me he goes against his better thinking now he'd been trained to command an army swords up about face trained to Go chariots all in order Spears forward charge that's how he's going to take over that was his training but he said what am I going to use he said what you got in your hand a stick come on they quit using sticks hundreds of years before to beat one another up with in Wars they've done they've done move past the stick yeah God said I'm gonna use a stick hey man so we got computers now we got nuclear weapons go take your stick amen God still uses the Bible do you believe that what do you got in your hand if you got the Bible God still use and said well you got in your hand you got a tape you got a book God still uses that what have you got in your hand you've got faith God uses faith [Music] stick got this thing's so ridiculous to the human mind see got a stick in his hand Whiskers hanging down 80 years old his wife on a mule kid sitting on her hip little old flabby arms hanging down what a picture stick a stick just think about brother Bill God met you in a burning bush today and he said Lord why did you have to wait until I got this age and he's walking along now Bill's pretty but the Bill's pretty big and buff you know he's strong man but Moses had been out in desert so long he probably didn't have too much to eat so he was out there just a skinny old 80 year old man God says Now's the Time pick up your stick go down to Egypt take over amen some of you Elders don't think God can use you anymore God can use you now he just got you where he wants you well JD just got you where he wants you Now's the Time he really wants to use you oh God that was the time but the brother said if I could choose to preach in any any area of my life he said I'd choose now he said because now he has the wisdom to be able to use what God gave him look he said he was a prisoner his head stood up for you thus saith the Lord why he finally got anchored he was a prisoner only move when the word moves me I don't only speak where the word speaks where are you going I got one commission stand before pharaoh and show him by this stick that God sent me what are you going to do after that he'll provide the next thing after I do this there you are you've only got one thing to do the first step tonight surrender become a prisoner don't think of yourself or something else become a prisoner Moses become a prisoner confessed he couldn't even talk finally when God got him in his hand where he could only move where God moved him where he told him the word he knew it was the word then he submitted himself to the word and the Holy Spirit their God harnessed Moses to the will of God oh is that what you want in your life that's what I wanted my musicians go ahead and come Jesus when he come to the Earth he told us this he said come unto me all ye that labor the tribe by human effort to produce something in your life and her heavy laden and I will give you rest that's a strange kind of rest because the next verse says take my yoke the yoke is a harness it's something that you you use to make somebody work but he's already said I'm going to give you rest to take my yoke upon you and learn of me I am meek and lowly in heart you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light I I read where they actually took an ox when they wanted to train him and they would take a great big mature ox and but again they'd put him right next to an ox that had never pulled a plow and they yoke them together and you'd think well they're unequally yoked but the truth was the load that they were carrying was just right for the big ox and the little Ox got to walk along beside he thought he was really working man he was really doing something all he was doing was getting used to the harness that's this life we go through all of life like that we're just getting used to being a son or a daughter of God he's harnessing us up to his will and we're just getting used to being what God wants us to be said God help us today not to kick against the Pricks like Paul was kicking kicking against the cattle prod don't do that don't stand there wish you were somewhere else his yoke is easy his his burden is light just walk where he takes you you got a big brother walking along beside you let him lead you my yoke is easy my burden is light would you bow your heads with me let God do it and sometimes you've got to let people help you being bullheaded is a sure way to poverty the sure way in business to Poverty it's a sure way as a Christian to have poverty of spirit just let God leads you get get in the harness Paul was harnessed up to the will of God until he could say I go Bound in the spirits of Jerusalem Lord I want your will for my life I don't want anything else but I want your will Lord it's a marvelous thing when you finally find the will of God for your life and then you just go do it the Yoke becomes easy don't you trying anymore it's God doing it [Music] I said God help me today I need I'll be honest with you I need to do better in this regard I need to let the big the big Ox my elder brother I need to let him pull the weight do less worrying do less grumbling do less complaining let him pull the weight maybe you're like that tonight I I just want to raise my hands to him and say Lord I I confess Lord I sometimes I pull against a harness but Lord tonight I'm surrendering it all to you but the parent said that was the first step then you become a prisoner to God would you just pray with me and and in that way Lord where I've not where I've been fighting against the traces where I've not been as burdened for the people of God as I should Lord let me let me pull oh God let it be with your effort Lord your will oh Granite Lord let me be completely surrendered to the will of God for my life Heavenly Father Lord we we lay aside ambition tonight we lay aside thoughts of what we want what we could have Lord and we want you take over lord take over walk with us oh God we realize we're not big enough to carry it on our own we can't make it to heaven [Music] how someone Lord that tried to pull on their own it would be so difficult to make it even to the end of the row but Lord with one who was built to do it Lord you who became a mature Son of God here on the Earth you can show us how you can come and live within us so God and work through us Lord help us to be yoked up with you tonight help us to be harnessed to the will of God or otherwise we'll just have dead Egyptians laying in the sand just a reminder stinking reminders of our own failures but oh God we want to do your will today Lord we thank you for sending us to the desert we we thank you for for putting us through the trial oh God because we're coming out pure as cold Lord I pray that you'd move in a mighty way I pray you'd help people to understand Lord there's some situations only you can take care of and Lord would you do those things we ask you Lord we ask in faith believing Lord we ask for those that are facing surgery those that are are Lord facing tests things in their bodies we ask Lord for those who are sick tonight and Lord they just let them give up oh God let you do the work Lord give up not not give up and said quit but Lord give up their ambition and their idea of how they'll be healed and just let you do it I pray you granted tonight oh Lord we feel your presence here in this place we we surrender everything all of our Ambitions all of our ways oh God May a Revival break out on this building tonight Lord Lord in every heart as we go to our homes Lord May there be such a Revival in our hearts Lord You've you've made me a prisoner God it's not hard to read my Bible anymore you made me a prisoner not hard to pray because you made me a prisoner oh God I pray you granted today
