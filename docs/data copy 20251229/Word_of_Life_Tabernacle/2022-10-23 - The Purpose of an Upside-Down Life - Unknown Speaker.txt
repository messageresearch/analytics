change lives we thank you for it we love you this morning I pray you bless those that are sick and in need bless those Lord that came and those that couldn't in Jesus name Jeremiah chapter 18 verses 1 through 4 and then we'll read Jeremiah 29 11. Jeremiah chapter 18 verses 1 through 4 and Jeremiah 29 11. good to see each and every one of you here this morning it's always good to be in the house of the Lord I think I saw my my mother-in-law back there good to have you this morning God bless you and each one of you that are here brother Joel's mother and father-in-law here this morning and good to have our regulars back many of you here this morning brother JT good to see you and uh we just we just want to enjoy the presence of the Lord don't we amen God bless you this morning Jeremiah chapter 18 and verse 1. as we approach the word this morning the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go down to The Potter's House and there I will cause thee to hear my words then I went down to The Potter's House and behold he wrought a work on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel has seemed good to the Potter to make it and then Jeremiah 29 11 just a wonderful scripture that you all know well this for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning sometimes life doesn't work out like you plan it someone dies a marriage fails you lose your dream job you're ruined financially no one ever wants those things you don't plan for those things it would be sadistic to plan for some of the things that have happened even in some of our own lives and yet we we experience those things and it seems like that when those things happen that our lives are turned upside down like you have no control anymore and really the control that we have over our lives is only an illusion anyway that really our lives are in the hands of An Almighty God of a creator that made us for a purpose and so God is going to show Jeremiah by taking him down to The Potter's House he's going to show him what he will do in in the lives of individuals but also in that time in the nation of Israel he's going to show him that they have less control over the outcome of the current situation than what they think they did he's going to show them that there there is a Potter and there is a wheel and there is clay and he's going to show them what their part is in that now as Jeremiah goes down to The Potter's House he's shown or he's there are three things that are pointed out to him to be able to see he sees that there's a Potter he sees that there is a wheel or Wheels he sees that there is a clay and it will work now we know that the Potter is god Jehovah God the almighty God the wheel is life or time if you can say it that way that's the wheel that that's what he works in works with and the clay is God's work or his people and so the Potter if we look at him for just a moment as we kind of want to background where I want to go this morning the Potter is completely in control of both the wheel and the clay right everything done to the clay listen to me this morning everything done to the clay is done by the Potter oh my and and so everything is done by him in Isaiah 45 and 7 he said I form the light God is asserting his power and his authority and his sovereignty over life situations here were the children of Israel they were going down into Babylon they were going to be taken away captive away from their land but God knew the only way to bring them to repentance was to cause them to go into a foreign land there would be much suffering there there would be much trouble there but it was the only way and God knowing that he wasn't reacting he already knew that they would do what they would do he knew they would serve other gods he knew they would leave the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and so what he did is he already prepared a Babylon for them to be taken captive by and when he prepared The Babylon for them to be captive by it was his will that they would go down there and actually be there and they didn't understand that and so Jeremiah is standing there preaching to them don't resist it go down to Babylon and they're saying why we'll put up a fight but they don't realize you can't fight against God he said I formed the light I create Darkness I make peace create evil now that's not saying that God's responsible for evil but he creates the substance out of which evil comes now think about it for a minute God created an angel named Lucifer that had the capability to fall and to go out of the economy of God he created him for a purpose now the purpose of Lucifer was to have a devil a Satan now but that to have an adversary he needed him for Redemption yet he would not be redeemed yes oh my not everything will be redeemed some things that are necessary for Redemption will not be redeemed are you with me this morning so he said I make peace and create evil I the Lord do all these things drop down you Heavens from above let the skies pour down righteousness let the Earth open let them bring forth salvation let righteousness spring up together I the Lord have created it notice he said woe unto him that striveth with his maker let the Potter strive with the postures of the Earth and he's saying it it's absurd it would be absurd for the for the pottery to say to the to the to the Potter right brother Riley makes Pottery and I don't think you've ever had the pottery speak back to you have you it's never sit there and said I want to be something different I I've got one of those mugs sitting in my in my kitchen that I drink coffee from I don't think the pottery has ever said well you know today I think I want to be a plate I'd rather be a plate rather than a mug and and it resists the wheel it's absurd for it because the pottery has no power over the potter the Potter is going to mold he's going to form the pottery into what he wants it to be oh my if we could just recognize this morning that we have no power over God all the only Power that we have is in a surrendered life yes oh my God so here that he said show the clay say to him that fashion is hit I want to be something different yeah what make us thou or thy Work he hath no hands in other words you made it with your hands and yet it would say to you well I have no you have no hands or you have no power no ability to make my life look at this again he is the Potter and no detail escapes him huh in Matthew 10 29 it says are not Two Sparrows sold for a farthing one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father in other words he's got all the birds counted and accounted for yes he said but the very hairs of your head are all numbered some of us said praise God the hairs of your head are all numbered and some of us that's not a very difficult job but for some it would be but he don't only number the ones that are there but he numbers the ones that you lost all right a sparrow doesn't fall to the ground he's infinite God you know there's an estimated I don't know how they come up with this number but it's a big number they estimate there's 10 quintillion bugs on the Earth ten quintillion bugs now think about that number for a minute that's a 10 with 19 zeros after it or one rather with 19 zeros after it that's a lot of bugs that's why it's so hard to get rid of them and I killed a mosquito last night it's already been freezing weather and everything else and the bugs are still out there just because there's so many of them so many bugs listen what brother Branham says about this he said God the infinite God who made the earth and the heavens and knew all things and knew it before the world was ever formed every flea every fly I can't even count the ones that come when we barbecue hahaha during the summer if you open a window you can't even count the ones in your house you thought you got them all out of the car and they're not either there'd still be some left in the car but he knows everyone in the world every Fleet every fly every Nat if you've ever stood out here during certain times of the year you know that the gnats are in such abundance and and they fly and they kind of hover around your head he knows every one of them and also every detail of their life going back for a long time right if you get uncomfortable this morning if you get warm you deacons might have to watch that these units were on uh on heat so we might have to turn them to cool if you haven't already done that maybe you all aren't warm this morning we get up and start moving we would be you know but you live by his word how many believe that this morning you live by the word of the man who knows everything about everything and every gnat and every flea and every fly and everything else you live by his word aren't you glad don't you realize how important it is if he said I'm going to make it I'm going to make it because he knows every fly he knows brother Madam puts it this way he said he knows every flea he said how many times it would bat its eye right he knows everything about everything and if he's able to do that then if he said for me to live a certain way or to do a certain thing Lord that's what I want to do that's the way I want to live that's the world I want my life to be because you know the intimate details of my life and I cannot plan better than you can plan I cannot dress better than you can dress me I cannot live better than you can live through me I cannot walk better than you can walk through me are you hearing me this morning I can't love people better than you can love through me that's right oh my we live by his word he knows everything about our our situation in life he knows and he cares oh my in Matthew 6 25 he said therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on it's not the life more than me and the body then Raymond behold the fowls of the air they sow not neither do they read nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are you not much better than they which of You by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature why take your thoughts for Raymond consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory well it's not already like one of these wherefore if God so clothed the grass of the field which today isn't tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe ye You O ye of little faith oh my that's the Potter he sees him you walk into The Potter's House Potter's House he has control over everything else it belongs to him he walked into The Potter's House and he sees Wheels now it was actually two wheels and if we look at the wheel as our life or our span of our life that were were being turned by life's circumstances and by the things that we go through and that wheel turns at the speed directed by the Potter depending on what he's making and what he wants to do with the pottery at that specific time and brother Riley is going to probably correct me after church but about these things but I looked into ancient pottery making and I began to look at that and I found that they actually had two wheels and there was a big wheel and a smaller wheel and then just a rod that went up between them and so it was an early axle in fact the first wheel that was invented was the pottery wheel before they had a wheel for a chariot or anything like that they had a pottery wheel it was to make pottery and so there was a a wheel and and it was but it was not a wheel it would move smoothly like a will maybe would today but the wheel would actually be unbalanced and it would be that way on purpose it wasn't sitting on the ground it was actually unbalanced it would move like this it wobbled as it moved and there was a purpose in that because it would actually keep the wheel turning if it if it wobbled as it moved it was a little bit unbalanced so it was unbalanced and we find that life is the same way our life is not perfectly balanced you'll find times in your life there will be happiness at times in your life there will be Joy at times in your life you'll feel like you're on top of the world how many have been there you feel like everything's going right and then there's times when you feel low there's times you feel like nothing can help you there's times you feel like everything's against you and you feel like you've lost everything but remember the wheels keeps turning right it keeps turning and it keeps moving as it turns to the Ebbs and flows of life and so we find that that's it's just a law of God that when we live on this Earth that there's a good and an evil and Paul put it this way he said I find a law when I would do good evil is present and so he said we would know it today it's the law of contrast whether it's good there is evil where there is right there is wrong and we will never no matter listen no matter what our environment may be ever be able to shake ourselves from the presence of either the truth we've got to learn to deal with it running never helps it doesn't help to run from our problems it doesn't help to uh to uh to just try to forget about it or try to drown it in alcohol or drugs or something else you got to deal with it why because it's always going to be there if you don't deal with it today you deal with it tomorrow if you don't deal in your lifetime your children will deal with it tomorrow so because when you would do good evil is present he said it's the law of contrast and so now in Psalms 126 6 it tells us that he that goeth forth and weaveth this is the law of contrast there will be seasons of your life when there is much carefulness and there's weeping and there's trouble but that's just that's actually the season of sowing now you would think oh my you would think the season of sowing would be a season of rejoicing but it's not the season of sowing is a very difficult season the season of sowing is a season of weeping because you're bearing precious seed and you know once you commit the seed to the ground a farmer that lives by his crop knows that when he commits the seed to the ground if it doesn't grow he's ruined right you're you're committing it to the ground and you can't go out excuse me and dig it up every day and try to see if it's growing or not right you got to trust the ground and Trust the preparation glory to God you've got to trust that the farmer knew what he was doing that the morning around the plow knew what he was doing are you hearing me today you got to trust God that he knew what he was doing by putting you here on the earth he knew by putting you here he said but I'm facing an insurmountable obstacle but as you walk through the season of weeping you realize he's the one who put the circumstances in place to allow you to sow so you you sow in tears but it says he that goeth forth and weeping bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing walking across the same ground but now it's harvest time now the seeds that have been sowed during those hard times the seeds that have been sowed when it was difficult to go to church the seeds that have been sown when there was conflict the seeds that have been so mine the seeds that have been sown when there was trouble those seeds he's going to come back one day walking across that same ground bearing precious seeds oh listen to me if you're struggling today if you're working if you're if you find it hard sometimes then you just got to put One Foot In Front Of Another remember the same ground that you're walking across as you sow will be the same ground that you walk across going the other direction when you're reaping one day don't give up don't give in to the devil don't let him talk you out of church don't let him talk you out of the things of God remember he that goeth forth weeping will come again rejoicing to be the Bible says it was true and the scriptures are the word of God we think only endures the Bible says for the night but joy comes in the morning thirdly he sees the clay watch as we background we're continuing to background what we want to say the clay is made into a vessel but as it's being made it's marred in The Potter's hands I don't know about you but I identify with this clay if we could think back over our own lives the clay is marred in the hands of the Potter it doesn't it doesn't stand in the working got out of shape some gravel or small Stone got in it and it made a breach in the part where it was found so the Potter was obliged to take the clay turn it upside down mess it up still in the hands of the Potter but the clay had a flaw now notice the Potter did not make a mistake the fault was in the clay yeah right the fault was in the clay the Potter already knew that the fault was in the clay I love this but He Didn't Throw the Clay Away he doesn't reject the clay he actually picks the clay with the fault in it because he wants to express himself as a redeemer oh God so he actually picks the clay that has a gravel in it or a stone in it or or sand in it because he wants he doesn't go buy it down with the Hobby Lobby he doesn't go buy perfect clay that's got everything the right to be tested in the right materials but he actually finds the clay from the earth and he picks the clay specifically because of the flaw oh I hope you hear me this morning and he wants because he knows that that flaw maybe it won't allow him to make the original vessel but his in his mind he's not thinking about the first vessel he's thinking about the second vessel he's not thinking about the first book the old book but he's thinking about the new book He's thinking oh my and so what he's doing he's going to take purposely pick up the clay that's got a fault in him and then he's not going to leave the fault in the claim because that's where many denominational people today will say well I got a fault I got these things in my life and I'll just leave him there that's not what the Potter does he's a good Potter he's not going to make a vessel it's all marred and disfigured and you can't use it for nothing but he makes a vessel defusable he makes a vegetable a vessel that'll that'll be worthy he makes a good vessel out of the clay so what does he do he takes it in his hands and Mars it now in God's original baking man was perfect except there was a rock in the clay now what was it think about it it was free will I want you to understand this morning that Free Will is the problem not the solution you say well I chose this message I was looking for something and I chose this message well then you might unchoose it someday I chose the gospel I chose Christ I was looking for Christ and I chose him no you don't find anywhere in the New Testament where Jesus where the disciples chose Jesus but Jesus chose the disciples right so by the Free Will is actually the pebble or The Rock in the clay all you ever did all I ever did by Free Will is turn away from God all I ever did by my own free will is mess up are you hearing me today I got myself into bad situations by my own free will I didn't I didn't serve God by my own free will I I snuck around did things that were wrong find my own free will but one day the platter got a hold of me and when I was marred in his hands and I and he made something new out of me he made something that by his own free will amen by his will he made something in spite of myself yeah you hear me today you don't do nothing by free will that's right but I have a desire for God because God put it there oh you ought to thank God for that desire don't take it lightly the Bible says it's not of him that willeth or him that runeth but God that shows Mercy brother Brandon put it this way so beautifully he said when we were sinners alienated without God in the world in that muck of mud as I talked about this morning he was talking about the Lily now the seed was way down in the muck in the mire of the mud he said God come to us God sought you you never sought God no man can come to me except the father draws him first and God came down in that muck can't you see the mystery of the Incarnation of Christ in this you can see the mystery of God of the godhead God came down he condescended came down in that muck everything man did by Free Will was just a bunch of of mire and muck and it was just a bunch of mud it was just a bunch of Filth oh my all righteousness were like filthy rags man tried to live the law and they couldn't do it they could not keep the law and so they had to sacrifice goats and bowls and sheep and oxen to try to make up for the fact that they could not keep the law but there come a perfect one and he come down in that muck of mud he said that he taught us God came down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out he said that ought to create a perfect love oh my I hope we have that perfect love for Christ today that ought to create a perfect love look what you was and look what you are you didn't become what you are you could be the most best Christian in here who want to serve God for the most years but you didn't become what you are because you've pulled yourself up by your bootstrap and set yourself up no you're a turtle sitting on a fence post you didn't get there by yourself you're there because God placed you there you're in the house of God this morning because God put you in the house of God he called for you to come he came down in the muck where you were quit resisting that call of God quit pulling against him he said don't Paul he said it's hard for you to kick against the pricks God came down oh my what did that somebody that loves you oh aren't you glad to have somebody that loves you today somebody that loves you he said can't you have faith in what he's promised you then he said real genuine love will create a confidence in his word oh man he said he caught me when I was nothing I'm still nothing but I'm in his hand see he caught me and he loved me when I was unlovable oh can't you see it this morning he loved me when I was unlovable he loved you and you was unlovable but he changed you oh my and he talks about the woman that come out and she testified she said I'm not what I should be I'm not what I want to be I'm not she she said I'm not to the place I want to be but I know this I'm not what I used to be I've been changed I've been reborn by the power of God amen by the brown state of God when I was an alien from him so love me go get you feel that love this morning can't not can't you see it from the scripture so love me till he stoop down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me and put you where you are by accident your life may be turned upside down right now but look at what he's doing he don't want to leave you there take the opportunity of that upside down condition to say Lord how can I yield myself to you who am I now watch he said he said if he picked me up it gives me confidence he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took beside you but he took you you drive by people every day who've never heard the message you you drive by churches that try to serve God and do everything that they know to do but they've never heard they don't know but you know why do you know why has it been revealed to you some of your own family members or people they just can't see it but you see it why because he showed you he wants you he wants you he that's his love to you he could have took many besides you but no one can take your place no one can take your place you're in God's economy no one can do it that's his love to you he's going to make a vessel out of you that he wants yes that's right because of your own free will yes yes he had to allow you to be broken so you could be made whole I know we don't like to hear that because we like the illusion of control I've preached on that before it's why people don't like to fly because the driving gives us the illusion of control but you're not in control a deer could jump out in front of you at any moment especially around here another car could come down the wrong lane it's by the grace of God that you're here this morning some of you barely escaped death by minutes and seconds and and you've been driving down the highway and some reason you got delayed or stopped and here come a car coming down the other direction you drive by a wreck or something and you don't realize the grace of God to you many things that you'll never even know about you could have drowned everybody could have been there could have been many things happen to you but you don't you don't even recognize and you sit here and say well God never did nothing for me here I am in this horrible topsy-turvy condition my life is turned upside down but can't you see what he's done for you by allowing you to stay on the wheel it means he has a use for you the reason you're still on the wheel don't give up don't let that devil of suicide get in your mind that devil of depression will try to come over and take over your life you're still on the wheel there's a reason for that yeah oh my god brother Branham tells us he said that's the way people today he said you don't like to get broke up see your own free will is what keeps us broken but you got to be broke up before you can be remade the prophet went down to The Potter's House to get broke up to get on the wheel and spun out something different if you're a sinner he said get on the wheel God will break you up mold you different shape your life up different shape your home life different you see it's it's so much better to have a broken Spirit than a broken life if God has to throw you on the wheel and toss you about he'll do that but it's so much better to have a broken spirit you'll have one or the other either we come to God in a broken and contrite spirit or if we're Gods we'll have a broken life because he is going to bring us to him oh my he and he already knows but he's going to bring us to him he said you know the prophet one time went down to The Potter's House to be broke up to be melded over if there's something wrong God don't just put a patch in anything he said you put a new piece in an old garment it'll make it worse than ever he said the thing to do is put the whole thing new so if you've done something wrong don't just get around a little and say well I'm sorry I did it I won't I'll try not do it again he said just break up yeah and get molded over again it's another piece see you can't hold on to part of the old and put it here with the new right now that that's true in doctrinal things it's true in in life and just things that you're going through you can't hold on to your whole life and try to bring that into the gospel it just don't happen it'll never fit that'll Rend the Garment will ring because it's an old garment with a new patch right it's new wine and old bottles it just don't work together to put new wines you've got to get new wine you got to have new bottles and so you can't bring the old into the new you can't take the old system that failed you and try to recreate that old system over and over again that old system failed let me let me let me say that with all about the old system failed let's not recreate that again let's not do that again let's do what the word says this time the old way failed the old many of you come out of denominational some of you come out of message circles where they taught a certain things it failed for a reason right and the reason wasn't well it wasn't the right people running it you know that's what they say about socialism I don't mean to get into politics but it's just an illustration they say well socialism doesn't work because it's never been tried by the right people well who are the right people because everybody who's ever tried it has failed and it's not just failed but but it's miserably failed for socialism to work it'd have to be run by angels it could not be run by human beings because human beings want more power and they're going to get it if they get at the head of socialism it becomes communism it always will fail don't you see it's the same thing with doctrines around this message with things around this message you got to come out of that in order to come into something that works you need to reject that theology that idea you got to count it all wrong and Paul said I counted everything I knew was done you said but there were good things in there sure Paul studied the scriptures he studied and and things he could use but first he had to reject it all in order to take what God Said around so off a different person with it was in there at work it won't work because it's against the word but he wants to make you a new creature aren't you glad to be a new creature today too glad he still made you new he wants to make you a new creature he he remakes you he said therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature a new creation old things are passed away behold all things are become new you realize he remakes the Earth in the same way now look he the Earth is an attribute of God we've talked about it before but in that being that attribute of God the Earth actually it was in God's thoughts so he couldn't destroy it but he's going to make it new so John in Revelation sees new heavens and new earth in Revelation 21 and in verse 3 he says I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men he will dwell with them and they shall be his people God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes there shall be no more death neither that don't sound like the world we're in at all but it's the same attribute yeah remade are you hearing me today it's the same attribute but in this attribute there's no more death and this attribute there's no more sorrow no crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away but the brand called us he burns up the atmosphere of sin oh my that's what needs to happen in our lives by the way the atmosphere of sin needs to be burnt up so we can be made new oh my God there will be no crying there'll be no more pain for the former things are passed away in Revelation 21 5 he said he that set upon the throne the Potter in The Potter's House to behold I make all things new and the whole earth is spinning on his wheel and one day he says time is no more he breaks it and remakes it oh my the purpose of an upside down world yeah so he can remake it in Redemption I hope you hear me today the purpose of an upside down life it is not useless it is not purposeless he has a purpose for it so he can remake it Jesus when he come to this earth was always eating with Sinners and tax collectors it's like eating with Democrats to be my political sermon for the year foreign I'll say this there's a vote coming up if you know what you're doing vote if you don't don't that's my politics for the Year bless God it's like eating some of us we had to eat with Nancy Pelosi there'll be some things said at that table tax collectors Jesus ate dinner with tax collectors politicians worst kind of Sinner there is sinners too many broken people but the Potter can't do nothing with a vessel that's already been fired and made the way it is he needs one that's broken it's the purpose of your upside down life it's the Potter needed one that was broken the purpose of this upside down this upside down world that Jesus came into was so that Christ could make it new he was going to make New Creations out of these publicans out of these sinners and he told him he said they that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are sick I came not to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance one of those sinners and I just want to talk to you for a minute before we close one of those Sinners was a Samaritan woman we've heard a lot about her but now think about her in this context you talk about an upside down life first of all she was a Samaritan the Samaritans were a mixed-race people who the Jews had nothing to do with the Bible even she said why do you ask me a drink I'm a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans won't even speak to them the Jews considered them worse than the Gentiles because they were half Jew and half Gentile and they brought some Pagan things into their worship yes and and we we saw recently in second Kings chapter 17 where he talks about how the Samaritans come from the king of Assyria bringing uh repatriating people into the land so it'd be like uh well I'm on politics this morning it'd be like border uh the the people from another country coming across the border illegal immigrants coming in and settling in the land so the woman at the well was someone who the Jews felt like didn't have a right to be there and that's found in Second Kings 17 24 that they placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel and they possessed Sumerian dwelt in the cities thereof and for these people were hated by the Jews brother Brown said the immoral woman that Jesus found up at sidecar she was a Samaritan which was rather an off-caste people that really believed God he said they was about half Jew and half Gentile and they were a race they believed in God and they were expecting a messiah and sometimes in a greater way than the Jews themselves were but this little immoral woman in her condition very marred by sin he said in one day oh God perhaps that got discouraged with all the traditions of the elders I wonder how many people we've discouraged from the message of the hour by the traditions of the elders pots and Kettles and Washings are you hearing me today pots and Kettles and what traditions of the elders discouraged by Pentecostal tradition discouraged by message tradition she got discouraged by that and she didn't go to church no more because she got discouraged because all she heard when she went to church was that this this group taught this pot needed to be washed and this group thought that that pot needed to be washed and this group taught to wash their hands at a certain time and this one taught something else but she never heard nothing that could change your life she never heard nothing of redemption oh my but there was a redeemer coming to God oh my who would be revealed by the revealing of the son of man this little immoral woman in her condition very marred by sin she gave up on the traditions of the Elder she went out one day to the same old Jacob's well and she was going to let down her bucket to get some water and she changed Springs you've got to change Springs change what you're drinking from you've been drinking out of that Old Spring that old that old tradition you've been drinking a little sinful water you need to change Springs today drink from the Water of Life he said oh how she can remember that there was one sitting there that said in him was living water he said what a thrill it was to her when that Living Well revealed her sins and told her where she was wrong and described what she had did to her and it put a message in her heart and set her on fire with the glory of God and into the City and to the men that's good and that brings us to the second thing that she had against her she was a woman in that day and age it wasn't something that people looked up to now we live in a topsy-turvy world where a woman has become the queen of the age but in that age the woman being a woman she nobody would listen to her but it didn't stop her but the Brandon said it wasn't really legal in that country for a woman to go through the streets especially a woman marked with immorality I mean we look hard on them but at the local prostitute come running down through Hardy the local ill-fained woman come running down through Hardy knocking on doors hey I found the message of the hour I found the truth I wonder what our response would be yeah well I'm glad you got help thank you see they needed the same help that she did if they wouldn't need it if they didn't need it there would have been no Market there have been no way for her to do what she did look he said he said in water he said I'm telling you he said a woman marked with immorality but I'm telling you she got cleansed and a drink of that fresh water he said you try to stop her it was like trying to put a fire around a house on fire real dry and high wind and dry weather was really blowing that Blaze and you couldn't stop her because she'd found something that was real her sins were revealed and when her sins and wrong was revealed she can remember tonight in glory she can remember there was a spring for her there was a place where all the Creeds and churches are you hearing me this morning there was a place where all the Creeds and churches had turned her down but yet she found an oasis she found a place oh my she found a place where there's someone who cared what a rejoicing and how we can Rejoice with her we who was bound oh how we ought to Rejoice today we who was bound down with Creeds that pulled us away from God we found a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins there we lost all our starchy conditions if you're still in a starchy condition you need to find the fountain again there we lost all our starchy condition and we drank from The Fountain and refreshed oh my she was a sinner oh my what a what a terrible life Jesus said to her go call your husband he goes right to the root of the matter he doesn't skirt around it he wasn't seek or sensitive he wasn't trying to save her feelings he said go call your husband come hither a woman said I have no husband she said Jesus said to us well said I have no husband for thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in that said Stout truly brother Brandon said that little woman at the well she'd seen so much Scruples about all their religion God help us today she had seen so much Scruples about all their religions and churches you realize what we're doing when we fight amongst ourselves we're keeping the woman at the well out she ain't gonna come into a place where they're fighting and fussing amongst themselves in the field you just need to give it up you won't hear somebody preach because you had a problem with them 20 years ago you need to give that up let that go you don't go to a certain church because somebody didn't treat you right or maybe you won't come here get somebody and treat you right at somebody you need to just let that go people are people they're going to be people they're going to be human but wait we want to be have a loving church we want we want to be able to accept everyone that will come and want to be changed that wants to be changed but people are going to hurt you at some point you're going to get because we have a sticky nature but you need to come back and say I don't want the Scruples I want the well I want the water hey man I'm sick and tired of all the Theology and the Scruples she didn't go to none of it he said don't know but she was just as well off poor child was maybe by bad parents let out on the street and should become a prostitute he said let me tell you there's a lot of bad women we know that but you can't be a bad woman without being a bad man you know so there has to be somebody make her bad so sometimes them kids are turned out by a bad Mammy run out to bar rooms and everything so he was on his road to Jericho he has to go up by the way of Samaria he came to the city sidecar about 11 o'clock or 12. he sent the disciples into the city to get some victuals well they were gone an ill-famed woman of the city came out maybe a pretty girl she had probably you know been turned out by her parents and everything and she had seen nothing in the church in church sometimes I think we're the ones that need to be at the altar God help me today I want in my life in spite of all the Scruples and things and being raised the way that I was in the church and and you know you're raised with a certain set of values and things but in spite of all that I I want the love of God to be able to shine she's seen nothing in the church and again that's not just forget that sales people you can do what you want to do not the love of God saying you had five husbands one you have now is not yours but if you'll come to the well I have water that if you drink you'll never thirst again or something real that you could have will take away that thirst you'd been turned out she'd seen nothing in the church so she made her living in a bad way by having too many husbands and and I think that the woman at the well is probably not an actual prostitute but she was a woman who jumped from one man to the other for their money or perhaps because she was mistreated or something else we don't know the story but based on what brother Brandon said it sounds like she was making a living by having too many husbands with all these things against her why would the Potter come all the way down from Glory and take time out of his short three and a half year Ministry to go out of his way and come sit by the well foreign it was no accident she was a vessel that by free will had gotten into trouble can you imagine her that morning they just come to my imagination as I was sitting studying these things and began to think if she was sitting there and you she was she was sitting there and she's getting ready to start her day it's hard when you when you suffer with those things you in depression because you can't get over some of the things that you've done I'm here to tell you we're all we've all done bad things but many times that's the depression comes over us and you get in a place where you can't just hardly get up especially when you don't feel like there's any forgiveness or there's no hope and and so she got up that morning maybe late she gets up and she goes into her room and and she looks at the mirror maybe a cracked mirror hanging on the wall and she looks into it and she tries to wash herself up the best she can and she has to wait because she can't go to the well at the same time everybody else does so she says well I gotta hurry I could be there by noon because I don't want to go in the morning because some of them come in the morning I can't go in the afternoon because some of them come in the afternoon so it was her every intention to stay away from church all right she wanted so badly not to have to face anybody and so she wandered through the streets and she picks up her she said well I don't know how I'm going to make it but I guess I'll just put one foot in front of another she had gotten so discouraged in life she'd been married five times she'd been through five divorces she'd been through five divorces and so the six times she didn't even bother getting married she'd gotten into so much trouble that maybe she felt like that morning well there's no point yeah might as well give up I don't know who I'm preaching to this morning but you might as well give up you you just you just can't make it you can't do it but she said well today one more time I'll go to the well one more time I'll put One Foot In Front Of Another placed herself on the Wheel I'm being spun on this wheel I'm turned upside down I don't have any hope I don't have a future one more time I'm gonna put myself on the Wheel she walks towards the well where Jesus was sitting and when she got to the well oh God the wheel of her life it's funner right into the hands of the Potter who was there when she was marred you see what she didn't realize is that she had she was a fallen thought of God how many know brother random said that I could read you the quotes I was going to bring them all in but I don't have time she was a fallen attribute of God and because she was a fallen attribute of God we talked about it recently God had moved Heaven and Earth for that Nation to be there so that she could be there so that she could be saved because she fell from God's thoughts and so here she was and she's sitting there and she and and here comes this woman to her and that that wheel spun her around and here was one she didn't know he knew her so she acts real religious she argues with him about Doctrine God many times that's what people do they they hide behind a cloak of religion she had a religious spirit but really she needed help in another way and she hid behind that cloak of religion and she was hiding there said well you Jews don't treat us Samaritans right you're just a bunch of losers anyway you don't you don't even worship Pride or anything if Jesus said we know who we worship foreign why don't you call your husband and come here oh God I'm taking too much time on this but just bear with me he was calling for someone in authority over her to come and speak to him because she could not deal with him on the things she would deal with him on so he was calling for somebody who had Authority knowing that there was no one because the one she was with was not her husband glory to God and the old man has got to die how many believe that today you there's got to be a separation a divorce from your old husband I'm talking about the world now in order for you to come to Christ so she realized Jesus speaks to her to make her realize that there's no one that can keep her yeah oh to God I've never seen that before just looking at it just now think about it she she realized there was no one that could keep her he realized there was no one he was her husband oh God oh who can who can lay anything to the charge of God to the ACT it is God that justifies who could speak for her her husband could not defend her because he was not her husband so she stood there all alone before the mind of God and she she said well when Messiah comes he'll tell us these things he said I am he and she didn't wait she didn't stop she ran into the city she left her water pot the Bible says she forgot what she was doing she ran into the City and she said come see a man who told me all the things purpose and I'm closing with this and I want to deal with one more thing and I'm done the purpose of an upside down life is to bring the clay to the point of yielding I think of Simon Peter when I think of this because Simon Peter was marred Clay and he was religious boy he had a revelation of the message he could tell you who the prophet was even revealed to him by the father who God was who Christ was he knew all about it he was the spokesman for the group he was the lead man head honcho bodyguard for Jesus himself and Jesus recognizing that he would be a leader he said Peter he said when you're converted strengthen your brethren and Peter says I'll never turn you down what are you talking about Jesus you're talking about going to trial I'm not going to let you go to trial you're talking about being crucified man I'll get on Facebook and I'll support you and I'll stand for the message I well I would never do that I know who you are it was revealed to me I got a revelation when you're converted Peter the devil wants to sift you like wheat but when you're converted strengthen your brethren so you all know the story how the Peter goes down and when Jesus he follows along when he's off and and Jesus is there and there he is sitting by the fire wanting to know what's going on with curiosity but not being man enough to stand up and face the music he's a coward and he didn't know he was a coward until that moment and so he he what he does he sits there and here comes somebody who says wait a minute you talk like a Galilean you're talking about a prophet and a message and all these things what are you talking about you're not what are you doing down here in this Camp you should be up there with him I don't know what you're talking about and to prove that he couldn't be with Jesus he started cussing he denies him three different times you know why I denied him three different times because the Lord had to prove to Peter that he was a mess God knew Peter was a mess Jesus knew Peter was a mess everybody else knew Peter was a mess but the Lord had to prove to Peter you're a mess and so Peter said to Herod Here Comes Jesus and he sees him afar off and as soon as that third time he hears the rooster crowing and he looks over there and Jesus looked him right in the face imagine how he felt he was a coward and everyone knew it now he knew that women had told him Jesus had rose again he'd seen the empty tomb but he comes back the next day and he's discouraged he said you know what he said I'm I'm going fishing Peter always backsid to his business whenever he quit preaching I'm going fishing so he walked goes back to his old trade they didn't fish for fun they fished for money and so he goes back to his old trade Jesus isn't here anymore and he can't be any kind of leader he can't take his place because he's a coward it was proof to him that he's a coward and he hears he sees a man sitting on the shore well I'm so glad for the mercy of God today his life is completely upside down but he sees a man sitting by the shore and a man speaks out that he says children have you caught anything no he said we failed we've I failed as a disciple I failed as a fisherman I can't do anything right and someone tells him said that's the Lord they cast out on the other side of the boat and they catch the fish and somebody that's the Lord Peter don't even recognize it but he does something about it puts His Garment on him dumps into the water swims to the shore he gets to the shore and Jesus just fed him with dinner think about it he didn't get right away into it he fed him dinner and then after he fed him dinner he sat there and he and he began to ask him Peter do you love me musicians go ahead and come I'm closing with this do you love me you know I love you Lord I said feed my sheep Peter do you love me feed my Lambs Peter do you love me and Simon got it Peter got upset the Bible said he was grieved because he said to him the third time loving somebody remember he denied him three times you imagine how he felt by this point or you just wanted to torment me why did you even come back just just to ask me if I'm faithful I want to be faithful I want to be I want to be standing there and be in church I want to do right but this old flesh it gets in the way it just it won't let me but Jesus had to Clay in his hands Peter's life had been turned upside down because of what he did by free will but Jesus was coming to him notice what he said he said Lord he said the third time and finally Peter just gives up he said Lord you know all things Jesus said feed my sheep and then Jesus tells him something interesting he said verily verily I say unto you when you were young you girded yourself and walked whether thou wouldest but when thou shalt behold Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry their wither thou with us not this fake he's signifying by what death he should glorify God and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me now I've never really understood why that in this moment when Peter feels so bad about what he's done why does Jesus suddenly tell him you're gonna die you're gonna die for the gospel but what's he telling him brother Joe he knew Jesus was telling him the truth what was he telling him he was telling him you're not going to give in again he took the clay in his hands oh my Peter do you love me Peter one day you're going to die but you're not going to die a coward oh Churchill we just recognize God wants to get you in his hands until he can Point At You he can look at you and he can tell you by his word you might give you might have a problems in life you might have circumstance but you won't give up you might have trouble but you won't give in amen you're gonna die on a cross but that just means you stood you won't do it again oh that's what he wants out of his church he wants to so remake us he don't want to leave us like we are the failures that we are the ones who have that besetting sin that we just can't get over and we keep doing it over and over and over again but he wants to remake you today he wants to remake you in such a way he said Peter you're when you get done in the upper room when the Holy Ghost comes into you and remakes you by the fire baptism of the Holy Ghost you won't be a coward anymore you'll stand until one day you'll actually die for me Peter would die a martyr crucified upside down on the cross and Peter you won't deny me again oh my that's what I want to hear from him don't you heads together [Music] oh God foreign I don't know why I preached this today and maybe it's just for me but let's just sit in The Potter's House for a moment Place ourselves on the Wheel Lord I know you want different things out of my life I messed up my life is upside down not what I should be but you're making me into something else you're working Lord there's a reason why I'm still on the Wheel still in life I'm still in time I know Lord you haven't left your throne of Mercy oh God [Music] but I know any minute that that will could stop [Music] so while I'm on the Wheel I want to yield myself to the fullness of the will of God yield myself completely to the word of God [Music] until I can't do anything but [Music] I'm sure the Flesh of Peter still wanted to be a coward there's times it even shows that after he had the Holy Ghost when he went over with the Jews and wouldn't sit with the Gentiles that meet the Flesh of Peter still wanted to be a coward but when it come down to it and the going got rough he would not do what he did before because he was not the same vessel he had been remade oh God we come broken and even into the world we come broke we we sit we're on the wheel today of time and we're broken and we've got to be remade why don't you just let him do it today let him remake you till you're not a coward no more you're not afraid of the

while I'm still on the Wheel of Time let me it's not too late I haven't done too much the woman at the well she didn't even want to make that walk to the well that day she she probably was so depressed and so worried that somebody might see her but she went anyway because it was ordained by God for her to be sitting at that well to come to that well while Jesus was there Jesus is here this morning he said we're two or three are gathered together I will be in their midst why don't you come to the well why don't you just receive from him today new life why don't you let his hands remake

strong that a coward would even stand when Peter come to that moment of judgment and the and the emperor said Peter you've got to give up you've got to give up Christ you've got to deny him he said I can't do it much as I would want to live as much as I would want to not be crucified I can't do it because I'm going to serve him with all my life and there's something in him his hands have remade me
