[Music] and lord you are more costly than gold and lord [Music] tonight amen nothing we can desire amen whatever meet him sing it from your hearts to him tonight amen [Music] forecastly [Music] you

song says i'd rather have jesus than silver or gold i'd rather have your presence in my life than anything else that this world could ever offer i believe that holds true for each one of us they're here on a wednesday night i pray you would come and that you would just touch every heart [Music] lord i can only do so much by speaking and by saying the things that i'm saying but lord you can do all things you're not limited lord in any way and so i ask you to come and just speak to each one those that are watching tonight and and couldn't make it for whatever reason i pray lord that you would bless them lord give them strength and also by the hearing of the word of god i pray lord that you would help us lord to keep fighting that battle that brother daryl talked about sunday night to be soldiers lord and to be willing to to fight for you because you are more precious to us than anything else thank you for all that you do heal the sick lord touch every afflicted person believe lord that you can do all things in jesus name amen amen god bless you we're going to be reading from first corinthians and i'll explain that in a moment first corinthians chapter 4 while you're turning there it's good to be back in the house of the lord there's several people missing tonight and there's reasons for that i had gotten a call from another local pastor before church and having to shut down again due to chronovirus and it seems like it's kind of spreading through this area now and so we're watching it we're being just as careful careful as we can be i would remind you to continue to do the things that we've been doing because it's kept us from having to shut the church down for many many weeks now and we want to keep that keep that going so you all have been very mature about those things and i appreciate that and doing what you've done and it's a blessing to work with you on that and i know it's tedious and i know you get tired i do and i'm usually the first one to forget to do something and i kind of set a bad example but you remind me if you see me doing something i shouldn't be doing as far as taking the measures we need to take wash your hands and and try not to get too close to somebody if you don't have a mask on things like that if you're sick stay home and we're just trying to get through this and and make sure we protect those that are vulnerable uh eventually just a lot of people are going to get it you know it's just the way it is and and uh but it's just part of it we believe god can protect us and keep us safe and keep it from being serious and even all the cases that are out there there's none in the church but there's people that have maybe been around somebody who has tested positive and so they're kind of staying away until they find out for sure what's going on so we're taking every precaution we can and again i really appreciate the effort but let's just continue to do that i know allergies are really bad right now too so if you see me sniffling remember i've already had it so i can't spread it to anybody but i know several kids and things have got allergies and things and then it's just there's no way around that but god bless you for being faithful tonight and we're the faithful few in the house of god but we're gonna we're gonna treat it as if there's a hundred people sitting here or 500 people sitting here doesn't matter you're here and i'm here and the lord's here and that's what's important i want to pick up tonight on our corinthians study i have not done this in the church with people present this would be the ninth part and we'll be beginning the fourth chapter of first corinthians and i feel like we're reaching a place in this that i needed to address the whole church when we talked about these things i believe it'd be beneficial to us and so i trust the lord would just have his his way in that and and that i have the leading of the lord on that we're gonna read from first corinthians chapter four and verse one and then we'll read on down as we go through the sermon tonight verse one says let a man sow account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god i pray the lord would add his blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated if you followed along and and there's eight previous videos that we've done through the during the week and taken some weeks off on the book of corinthians and went through the first three chapters if you followed along you found that paul deals with dissension in the church caused by colts of personality which had raised up because of carnal preferences of one minister over another now we would never deal with anything like that would we but they did these people did and corinth was a place and just kind of lay a little background here because i haven't dealt some of you may not have had an opportunity to to go back and listen to the rest of what we did so corinth was a city that was much like america is today they had things they had wealth they had the ability to do what they needed to do they lived comfortably in that time and they say that that was one of the greatest eras in history to live was during the the pax romana during that time when there was no wars at least close by and the people that were living there had wealth and all the money and things pouring in but it was a very wicked city and so it was amazing that there was a church there at all but there was some people who overcome that and and who were real believers and so paul addresses the letter to the saints at in corinth to the sanctified ones there was people there really lived godly lives in spite of all the excess around them and i think that's us today i believe that is i believe i'm talking to saints tonight so paul deals with that he deals with how that there's dissension in the church and he tells them he said hey we're all working on the same team he said i've planted apollos is watered but god gave the increase and and he tells the people he said you belong to god you don't belong to any certain preacher and we use kind of as a shorthand you know and so and so is church brothers so-and-so's church but you're really not you belong to god and so when we belong to god then god places ministry there to help us and they're not there as our overlords they're there to help us and they're responsible to god for us and so these calls of personality had come up because one liked the way this one did things and one like the way someone else did things but the thing is that we have to know how to what our attitude should be towards ministry and towards preachers and there's a biblical way that we should view ministry there's a biblical way to view ministers as individuals as as people and as differences in gifts and paul deals with that in in chapter four and so he starts off by saying let a man sow account of us or this is how you should view us this is the way that what your mindset should be towards us account of us as the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god so there's two things there ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god the ministers it literally means a servant and and if you'll go back and watch some of what we've done previously you'll find paul calls uh ministers servants before but he doesn't use this same word and that's kind of messed up but you can see a servant is an under rower an under rower now an underrower is a subordinate rower and that's the word he uses here he doesn't use it anywhere else in his in his writings a subordinate rower john wesley said this about it he said let a man account us as servants of christ and you can't see the whole quote but he says the original word properly signifies such servants as labored at the ore and rowing vessels and accordingly intimates the pains which every faithful minister takes in his lord's work and wesley ends it with oh god where are these ministers to be found and isn't that the truth if you've ever seen the old movie been her have you ever seen the 1956 i think movie it was when paul used the word underwear that's the word for the person at the bottom of the ship so paul says let a man account of us as ministers as under rowers as the the guys at the bottom that keep the ship afloat but there's two things about the under rowers that is very true that number one they they don't go they don't or they don't make movements to their own beat but there's a guy beating the drum and they make the movement according to the guy that's beating the drum and the second thing is that when one of them falls out from overwork they just replace him that's true it's true i guess that tells us we're expendable now these underwearers would go down with the ship if the ship went down the underwears went down they had a vested interest in keeping the thing going and ramming as hard as they could because they were chained there and you know we're not slaves in that way but we're loved slaves to christ and so paul said this is how you should view ministry as under rowers underrowers a subordinate rower and so he also says it's not a flattering description but then he says stewards stewards economos which is the manager of a household or household affairs especially a manager or a superintendent a freedman or a slave to whom the head of the house or proprietor has entrusted the management of his affairs the care of receipts and expenditures the duty of dealing out the proper portion to every servant and even to the children not yet of age so in relation this is how you should view ministry in relation to the people you are ministers under rowers in relation to god you are stewards god has he's hired us for lack of a better term he's gifted us and placed us in a position to be responsible for his property right and so you would understand stewardship maybe in finances or something like that but stewardship in ministry is we're stewards of a specific thing of the mysteries of god we're stewards of the mysteries of god the things that have been handed to us from god and we are stewards of those things we have to care for those things and to dispense those things at the proper time so adam clark says this he said the steward or oconomos was the master's deputy in regulating the concerns of the family providing food for the household seeing it served out at the proper times and seasons and in proper quantities he received all the cash expended what was necessary for the support of the family kept exact accounts which he was obliged at certain times to lay before the master he was responsible for it and so he had to think at certain times he was the steward of the mystery of god and we had to think at certain times in what manner he would dispense that and at what time because you've been given certain things certain revelations certain this whole book has been opened to us right but a steward takes the book and he paul says i've not shunned to declare unto you the whole council of god right so you can't just take one thing and say well i'll just feed the people this one thing the rest of their lives that's not how it works but every service you get the mind of the lord you you come before god and say god what what did the people need what what needs and so the steward would look at the house he'd see there needs to be a certain proportion of wheat given a certain proportion of corn certain proportion of oil a certain proportion of this at a certain time because something was about to happen so at this hour a minister has to be under the influence of the age that he's living in so he comes under the messenger of the age and and he begins to look and see what what does the church need right now and i believe god can make that so specific as to speak to us specifically at a certain time exactly what we needed and some of you experienced that sunday when a a steward of the mysteries of god come by and begin to dispense something and preach on sleeping at night and you think that's an odd thing to but but some of you are dealing with that huh and then about soldiers and so different things that we're dealing with and it just hits us because the the minister has gotten in the spirit of the master of the house to know what he wants to to be dispersed to the people it's all available but what needs to be given at each time i'll be honest with you i agonize over that because it don't matter if there's five here or 50 or a hundred it doesn't matter it's it's it's still important what needs to be fed because there could be somebody there that's the last time they ever come to church it could be somebody that's the last opportunity they ever have to hear the gospel so maybe i'd say something that would be different than what you might think that the church needs but but maybe it'll be something that actually i don't even know about but it's something that's a real need in somebody's life so we pray that way that god would would give our stewards wisdom in the mysteries of god to preach the things that we need now brother branham says it this way and i apologize some of these got messed up and i'm sorry i did that i'm not real good at using that program yet so i'm some of these you're only reading the first half and i apologize for that it's not brother robert's fault it's my fault it worked earlier but it's just the way that i put it in there and i knew better now he says and now this is brother branham talking about stewardship he said now while we're here together and all of us longing the same thing he said make us true stewards and i love what he says here he said may we shape our lives by self-control shape our lives by self-control that will know by the help of the holy spirit to have a full confidence that jesus will say well done my good and faithful servant at that day he said may we shape our lives by self-control i love that that that image that provides to my mind of a steward sitting there and saying i could do this but i'm going to control myself because i know that these needs are here right and so i'm going to bring under my body as paul says later in corinthians and bring it under subjection because i don't want to be a castaway after having preached to others so brother branham says may we be upright honest and true may we be the kind of christian so this just doesn't apply to ministers but to each one of us may we be the kind of christian that would be a credit to any community may we be men and women such as you could lay your hands upon and say my servant behold this is my servant in whom i am delighted i can send them they'll go they know how to speak and when to speak and i can be with them he says oh father grant that blessing to every one of us we're stewards of the mysteries of god and again i have a right to preach any part of the word but i've got to be a faithful steward to know how much doctrine how much correction how much encouragement i feed the fathers the mothers the children the new christians the mature christian the milk and the meat that's a big job a man couldn't do it on his own he needs to listen to the master verse two of first corinthians chapter four says moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful matthew henry put it this way that he act according to his commission neither withhold any privilege or any part of god's will from the people nor deliver his own notions as the will of god nor take more authority upon him than god has given him as also that he discover and communicate divine truths and blessings as the hearers are able to receive them another commentary puts it this way he says they are in relation to the truth stewards that is to say the truth is not revealed by them speaking of preachers but to them that's an important distinction the truth is not revealed to or or by the preachers revealed to the preacher right and and this is important because even in the message you know we say well brother branham broke the seals well that's not what the bible says the bible says the lamb opened the seals right and then he brother branham put it this way like he took it and gave it to us the seventh angel right and then he gave it to us right so it was revealed to him it was not revealed by him that's the steward he said so it's held not as their property but as their trust it is not appropriated to their own use right that's a you have what we call in the title business the fiduciary responsibility to the word right so it says that i will not take the word and use it to promote myself or to prove myself right or to fight with you about something right because that to do that is though it's the word though it's true but to do that is to use it for my own purposes and i don't have a right to do that it's not held as my property but as my trust as a trust it's not appropriate to their own use but it's dispensed by them for the benefit of others they're not at liberty to do as they like with it they are accountable to the lord of all for the way in which they deal with it paul says in first corinthians 4 3 but with me is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of man's judgment yeah i judge not my own self now paul begins dealing here with something that we call man's day versus the day of the lord the day of man is put before us as a person and that where it says man's judgment that's literally translated man's day paul says i won't be judged in man's day this is the day of man all days previous to the day of the lord is the day of man this is man's day but i'm not going to be judged in man's day and be judged in the day of the lord and paul deals with that over the next few verses but brother branham says this he says he said he's here he said oh it seems crazy to the world i know it's driving you crazy to read the first half of these and i'm sorry he said it seems crazy to the world sure it did in all ages and it will in this age but just wait for that age that is to come he said this is man's day the day of the lord will come he said let us serve him so now that in the day when he does come we'll be found faithful whether we live he said or whether we sleep we'll be awakened by the sound of the trumpet and will rise in the beauty of his resurrection shall be partakers of his holiness and of his power and of his resurrection so paul continues in that vein he said i won't be judged in man's day he said for i know nothing by myself and what that means it sounds like he's saying i'm ignorant but that's not what he's saying he says i'm ignorant of anything that would offend my conscience that word to know nothing is his conscience he said i'm not conscious of anything that i've done that where i would have failed as a minister as a steward no he's probably better off than i am but paul has a clear conscience before the people he said i haven't failed you in any way as a minister as a steward to my knowledge he says my conscience is clear i know nothing by myself but i'm not justified by my conscience now think about that as an individual but jt you think about that my conscience is clear i know i've lived right i've done right before the people but i'm not justified by my conscience god will be the judge because i could be sincerely wrong i could be ever so sincere and be wrong but he says he that judges me is the lord that's the one in the end that'll provide the judgment so he says i'm not aware of anything and that's the way we should be he said but i'm not justified by that alone especially as a minister of the gospel so in verse 5 he says therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come now this is the day of the lord he's talking about man's day man's judgment now he says until the lord come judge nothing until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the councils of their hearts then shall every man have praise of god so don't superinvest yourself in any ministry to the point where the ministry gets bigger than the word because you may have invested in something that's not even true in the end even maybe if it preached true things but what'll matter is at the end not anytime in man's day but at the end all the works will be made manifested and that he dealt with that in first corinthians three now brother brown says the day we're living is called in the bible the day of man man's day this is not god's day god is not the god of this earth he says the bible says he isn't he's the god of heaven but this is not god's day this is choosing day he said either live for today and die choose god and live god is the word and the word is the word manifested for the hour and the day now he goes on he said notice the day of man and this is in the god of this evil age if you want to look it up later he says if you want to put that down i was going to read it but first corinthians 5 4 1-5 he said was paul speaking of being judged by man in man's day he said the day he said what do you call it man's day for he said you would say it's the day that listen it's the day that the works but the knowledge of man is glorified now have you ever seen a day like that today the works by the knowledge of man is glorified look what we can do as a society works by the knowledge of man look what how we can provide for all the people look what we can do it works for the it works from the mind of a man works by the knowledge of man he said look what all the brag of the communist somebody trying to get somebody to the moon he said god is trying to get somebody to heaven he said but they're spending millions and billions and trillions of dollars in a wasted effort he didn't say they wouldn't get there in this place he says when they get there they ain't going to find nothing that's true he said what's the matter with him he said i don't care about the moon i want to pass the moon so fast i won't even see it amen it's just going to keep going higher he said i want to pass the milky way go on just keep going he said in the world today is dedicating themselves to the knowledge which came by satan and man's day is glorified not by the word of god but by the knowledge that he has remember that when you're evaluating ministry man stays glorified not by the word of god but by the knowledge that he has he said now think let that soak in he said when you play this tape back on this point here stop for a while and think he really wanted to get that across man's day is glorified not by the word of god but by the knowledge that he has first corinthians 4 6 and these things brother and i have in a figure transferred to myself into apollos for your sakes now he's saying it's really not just being apollos that i'm dealing with but it's the ministers in corinth that the people we're holding to is higher than the word of god or putting one up against the other and so he says i've just named apollos and myself because you're going to learn in us not to think of men above that which is written no one of you be puffed up for one against another so he says don't think more of a minister than is allowed by the scripture don't make him a god don't invest all truth in him or all knowledge or infallibility because that's above what is written and we've dealt with this i'm sure before but i'll go back over it because it fits here brother branham says talking about people who made him jesus christ he says because of it it forces me to say i'm leaving the ministries because there's something rose up amongst the people that's caused me to do it as i've been taken he said from my bracket been taken from my bracket what is his bracket it's what the word said about him right he he fulfilled that revelation 10 7 malachi 4 5 and 6. he he fulfilled that then in luke 17 30 was fulfilled in his ministry but he was not jesus christ right and so he says i've been taken from my bracket of a minister or brother and being called jesus christ he said that would bring me as antichrist and i'll meet god as a quitter before i would meet him as an antichrist to take away from him and so again towards the end of that where he's talking and dealing with this problem he says remember he said if you've ever believed me if you've ever believed me to be a servant of christ remember that's an error it's false he said thus saith the lord it is wrong he said have nothing to do with it he said i am your brother. now paul says you you puffed up for one he said you think above men what's written and then you're puffed up for one against another puffed up paul likes to use that word in corinth they must have been really arrogant you know i i'm for paul and here's why and here you had another group i'm for peter and this is why peter was with jesus another one said well i'm for christ i just don't do nothing with those preachers just leave them alone i just take the words of christ and paul says you're all babies right you're immature you're puffed up you're arrogant he says for verse seven for whom make it three to differ from another and what hostile that thou didst not receive now if thou just receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hast not received it it's a gift not an attribute all right if you're able to preach that way wonderful i i've always wanted to preach like brother daryl warden i've never been able to do it but it's a gift right not an attribute it's not something that it just comes from our nature but god places a gift in a man's life to do that and so we take it as that what do you have that was not received you did not receive he said why if thou just receive it why does thou glory as if thou hast not received it we could say that about the message of the hour if we are in the message we say well i'm in the message well what do we have that we have not received the message had to come to us for us to be in it we didn't invent it we didn't make it up right come from god we don't have a message from us any certain place we have a message from god come from the throne room and so if it comes from god then it's a gift what do we have that we did not receive and verse 8 he says now you're full now you're rich you've reigned as kings without us he said and i would to god that you did reign that we also might reign with you for i think that god has said set forth us the apostles last as as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men and paul is relating to a something they would understand and called the roman spectacle which was a part of the roman games where the gladiators would be brought out in the morning and they would have armor on and have swords and they would fight against the wild beasts and the ones that survived would have a pretty good chance of beating the animal the lion or whatever and they would go back but then at noon time they would bring out certain ones that would be brought out naked with nothing to defend themselves with these were appointed to death they were the ones that they just wanted to get rid of they were tired of feeding them so they'd bring them out into the arena at noon time and then they would set the wild beasts on them and watch them and for entertainment get torn apart and paul says that god has made the apostles like those noonday spectacles those gladiators that had to go out and fight the wild beasts and and for sport demons tore them up and the world tore them up and spit on them and put them to death and everything else and became their death become the entertainment for the masses he said god has put us in that place we're made a spectacle into the world to angels and to men and he goes on to say we are fools for christ's sake but you're wise in christ we are weak but you're strong you're honorable but we are despised and this presents a different view of ministry than what the pharisees had and a different view than what the denominations had in a different view than what many people today have and a minister is a fool for christ's sake sometimes he's got to be the bad person and say things that he doesn't want to say why he's a fool for christ's sake but you're wise in christ sometimes the minister's got to speak so sure of things that he can't prove he's got to stand there and declare there is a heaven there's a hell you either going to one or the other right he's got he got to speak of things that are more you know whenever someone gets up and talks about the economy they can say well it could be this way it could be that way this is my educated opinion we have to speak of eternal things as if we are absolutely sure that they are true and he says speakers the oracles of god as if it was god himself what is it we're made fools for christ's sake i remember years ago i shared the church age book with a man from the church of christ and and he was a good man but he uh was a county tax collector actually and i shared it with him because i told him i was going to convert the publicans tax collectors and i shared this with him and he was a good man but he read it he read the whole book and he called him and brought it back to me he said he got a lot of good things to say he said but he speaks with such authority he said how does he speak with such authority he just couldn't wrap his mind wrap his mind around that why could he say these things as if why we're fools for christ he said he shouldn't talk like that he shouldn't talk with such authority but remember what they said about jesus he said he don't speak like the scribes do well it could be this way it might be this way he said this he said is the day of salvation he said i am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father but by me that's a bold statement and on some level as ministers we're truth declarers that's that's what we we have to do is declare the truth and not just make it where it'll fit in with the modern culture that we live in we're fools for christ's sake but you're wise in christ we are weak but you're strong you're honorable but we are despised brother madam says then to the world he was a fool speaking of paul and to the church he was a fool he said to the denominational church he was actually a fool he said that's what he said he'd become a fool he's a fool to those people but he was the instrument that god used and i just pray that god would would help me in this way listen because you can't read it on the board but he said he he was the instrument that god used to hold the church together to hold the body as it was in that day together he'd become a fool for that for the sake of that god help me to be a fool then that don't just apply to ministry that applies to all of us we we become an instrument that god uses even though we look foolish to hold the church together what a good definition that is first corinthians 4 11 even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place labor working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it we don't realize how much we owe to those who have gone on before us we can have church here today because some because christians over centuries died to meet together so we get to have church we take it lightly but they died for that privilege of being able to come together and in some foreign countries in places they still do millions have died for the privilege of being able to sit with their brothers and sisters and hear the word of god and so he says in in this time he said we labor he said we work with our own hands being reviled we blessed being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat he said we are made as the filth of the world are the all-scouring of all things and to this day that filth and off-scaring that's what what is not even useful to be burnt by the heathens as a sacrifice the heathens would use about anything as a sacrifice even it alludes also to a custom that they had that they would bring out the very worst men in the city and they call that the filth of the city the off scouring of the city probably some of my relatives in there somewhere but they'd bring them out and and they would put them at a certain time of the feast day there were certain gods that could only be satisfied by human sacrifice so they would bring the very worst people in the city the drunk on the street bring him in and sacrifice him to the gods and paul said that's what we've been made like like a sacrifice that like the lowest man in the city like a sacrifice that even the gods wouldn't accept paul said he had to forget everything he knew to have christ you know our mind gets in our way of accepting christ we begin to think and begin to think well you know i don't know if that's true i don't know you know people can talk their way out of anything i'm i'm reading i haven't finished it yet but i'm reading a a book an old book and it's it's a case to be made that somebody made about 50 years after napoleon left the scene and someone is a member of the clergy wrote a book making the case for the fact that napoleon was a legend that he never existed and what it was is this satirical work where the man makes that case because he says that he says i can prove to you he said these accounts are unreliable the things that napoleon did a man couldn't do it's too supernatural and people do the same thing today with the message and he basically by the end of that they said many people who read that book really come out thinking and it wasn't his purpose at all but many people come out thinking napoleon didn't even exist can't prove it to me and people think the same way about jesus in the same way about the word of god but but it still doesn't make it any less true you can talk your way out of anything right but our mind gets in the way and paul says i had to forget all these things and one of the early church fathers who knew paul wrote later about him and said his words indeed seem to be those of a simple and innocent and a rustic man who knows neither how to frame nor to avoid wilds in other words he just wasn't good at at putting things and i think paul was wonderful at how he put things but he was blunt he was bold he said his words were like an innocent and a rustic man he said but wherever you look there are thunderbolts and what he means by that is paul spoke with power and he backed it up and he stands up here and he says if any man says anything different than what i've said let him be accursed why could he say that because he of the uniqueness of his ministry and so paul begins to deal with that in the last part of this chapter 4 or in this next part that we're going through now in verse 14 he said i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you for though you have 10 000 instructors in christ yet have you not many fathers for in christ jesus have i begotten you the gospel he said that's the uniqueness of my ministry you're a product of my message and we have a prophet on this day we are a product of that message that's a unique ministry none of us as ministers can take that place so in our attitude about ministers we don't raise one man above another in the flesh but we do recognize that god has different callings for different people and no one can fit that calling except the messenger of the hour that's the stars that held in his hand that's the one the seven golden candlesticks that's the one that was there with him and the the the lamp stand to the h and paul says you don't have many fathers i've begotten you through the gospel he says verse 16 wherefore i beseech you be followers of me word followers is literally imitators the word is minds brother branham says this he said you're going to follow somebody he said you remember that you're going to follow somebody say i don't follow anybody brother perry green you tell a story about a man that insisted he didn't follow a man he said he come to find out he followed his wife people who don't follow a man true but you're going to be a follower of somebody he says you just remember that he said you're going to follow somebody the way you follow that person he said is be sure that who this person is following you can't follow somebody who can't be led right and so he says be sure who this person is following paul one time said be followers of me as i am of christ in other words just as i follow christ you follow me and he says and speaking of paul and brother branham calls him the pattern he said his manner of ministering and i want us to notice that because we've had a pattern paul set the pattern even for brother branham he had to brother brown said that he did for all other ages but what we've had in this day at the end time is someone who followed the pattern exactly in in their manner of ministry so we have a pattern a modern day way of looking at what paul's message and what his manner of ministering was brother branham followed that pattern so we have a unique insight into that maybe other ages kind of lost that pattern we've got it we're able to do that and so we could say we're imitators of the messenger in that way we are imitators he said be an imitator of me not an imitator of how i hold my bible not an imitate imitator of how i speak but an imitator of my manner of ministry he said his manner of ministering set the pattern manner of ministering that's not just doctrine but it's how you handle the word and how you handle yourself so when we look at ministers and i thought this was important to bring to us as a church because when we look at ministers when we evaluate ministries when we haven't asked what should our attitude be towards a minister well it should be more than just he brings me the word yes that's true but it should be that he his manner of ministering matches paul's how was that he denies himself he follows the word he doesn't he doesn't do things to his own benefit right all these things that paul talks about that he did he said this is what we do then we become imitators of that right not not in a carnal way but but in a way of saying lord help me to match the pattern now so he said he was to be the pattern of all future messengers and actually sets the pattern he said all future messengers would aspire to and actually sets the pattern for every true minister of god though he would not attain to such heights in the prophetic realm as did paul and paul in first corinthians 4 17 said for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus for what cause so you can see what my pattern looks like be followers of me because i'm going to send you someone who imitates me right someone who mimics me in ministry timothy who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways my ways how i handle the word how i handle the people right which be in christ as i teach everywhere in every church he's an imitator of me and so i'm going to send him and it's important because he didn't just say this letter will be sufficient but he said i'm going to send timothy because he's going to show you he's going to be an example to you of my manner of ministry god helped me to do that as a minister but that's the way we should think about ministry how does his ministry match up to the apostle paul how does he match up to the messenger of this age not in prophetic utterance not in the heights of of revelation and visions and things like that but the way he treats people the way he treats the church the way he treats the word i hope i'm not boring you tonight so he says he's an imitator of me i've sent him this for this cause and this is what paul told timothy in second timothy 2 2 he says the things that thou hast heard of me and now listen and this is where people get off because we've all heard personal testimonies right and i'll even tell sometimes i'll tell one but it's just that it's a personal testimony so paul tells timothy specifically he said the things you have heard of me among many witnesses and the reason he's telling him that is because no one could then say that timothy you're making that up he only told that to you but paul says commit the things that you've heard of me among many witnesses in other words you heard me say this publicly right you know what he's saying say what the tapes say that's what he's saying and people will say that and they don't they won't say what the tapes actually say but because just repeating it doesn't mean you do it right but now he's saying timothy say the things that i said publicly not just the the stories that you heard don't build doctrines on the stories that you heard but say the things that you heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also teach what you've heard me say publicly brother branham says in the church age book again he said in every age we have exactly the same pattern that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been faithfully taught he said but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken let's go on down to the end of this real quickly i won't spend much more time verse 18 now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you but i will come to you shortly you talk about a return ministry now paul was coming back but he wasn't dead yet but he said i'm going to come back you know and people think they want a messenger to come back but you wonder what would happen if one did because paul kind of puts it bluntly to them he said i will come to you shortly if the lord will and we'll know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power paul says i'm about to bring the hammer down i'm going to show up and you're going to have to prove huh what you're talking about anybody can talk right so paul says there's more to my ministry than words because verse 20 says for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power another place he says word only it's not in word only it's not just that but it's power and almost anybody can talk but few can manifest the power of god in their lives and this was the age of ananias and sapphira this is the time when the people knew he could back it up that the apostles had the authority right and and there's an authority that comes with the word but we that authority is in our lives can we manifest the power of god in our lives it's not just talk verse 21 what will he i come into you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness now the lord will and i'm not sure how we'll handle it but the lord willing we'll get into chapter 5. next week and paul deals with some hard things in the church in the corinthian church but he says you want me to come with a rod or in love and a spirit of meekness and and what he's saying is your attitude towards this letter will determine how i come what my attitude will be when i come you know we're going to make mistakes we're going to bear too long with some and not bear long enough with others and as a church you make mistakes as individuals you make me say you're going to make mistakes but our attitudes when we find out what the mistake is when we find out what the word says about something our reaction to that is determines how god deals with us you see paul's not the only one he wasn't the only one coming to corinth jesus is coming he's coming and and we live in that day we live at the time when the day of the lord is at hand this is the day of man but there's coming a day when it's the day of the lord the lord's day the lord's day is coming and he'll judge everything according to the way it ought to be he sees everything how it should be right and so the day of the lord is coming and and so we our attitude towards the word today will determine what his attitude towards us is when he comes what is paul doing he's laying an example paul laid an example in corinthians of what our attitude should be towards ministry how we should think what our mindset should be towards ministry not to elevate one against the other not to puff one up against another but to say i realize that the real value is in the word and the power of god manifested in the life you see as ministers and i think we could say this as christians too we have to recognize that everything we have is god's we are ministers and stewards that's what we're doing here on this earth we're low slaves to god and we're stewards we god's given us something whether it's money or or a talent of some kind he's given us some ability he's giving you something you say well i can't i don't know much about that i don't have much but you have something whatever that thing is has been given to you as a steward and you have an opportunity to give you have an opportunity to to love you have an opportunity to to reach out or to just hold it in bury it under the earth david livingston the great missionary to africa and musicians go ahead and come i'm finished this evening but the great missionary to africa he said this he said i place no value on anything i have or may possess except in relation to the kingdom of god he said if anything will advance the interests of the kingdom it shall be given away or kept only as by giving or keeping it i shall most promote the glory of him to whom i owe all my hopes in time or eternity paul put it this way he said for me to live is christ to die is gain if i give it away or i keep it how will that promote his glory that's what i want i've given everything up i can't go back to the problem with ministers that go back is that they haven't sold out because if you if you sold out like paul did you can't go back paul couldn't become a pharisee again he doesn't burn those bridges he wasn't going back to denominations he wasn't going back to the old life that was all gone why because everything that he had and everything that he was was in the service of god brother darrell said something sunday night that just really struck me when he talked about how that we don't give a part of our life to the church our life is the church our life is church and that's not this building but that's the body of christ god help me to be that way place no value on anything other than the glory that it can bring god that's what we want in our lives isn't it amen let's bow our heads together heavenly father thank you for the service tonight i i pray that in some way i know it's different lord in a teaching message but i pray god that in some way you would just move into our hearts and begin to water the word that's been planted help me lord as a minister these words surely apply to me if they apply to no one else i must be a minister and a steward [Music] a minister lord an under under row under rower a person who's chained to the work that i'm doing by chains of love i pray it would be so in my life lord to one day you see fit from maybe i'm grown too weak to keep the ore going like i should i just get taken out of the way and another takes my place if you tarry lord that it may happen but lord i want to give everything that i've got may we be that way as christians whatever value we place in something may be the value of giving glory to god [Music] i don't want it if it won't bring glory to you i'm not going to have it if it's just you know maybe i could get it but by fighting to get it i i mar my testimony help me lord not not to be selfish [Music] we could we could conduct ourselves in a way such a way as ministers that would that would make it where we could we could have more but we'd have to give up our conscience we'd have to give up what we know is right we'd have to do things in the wrong way and we know that when it comes to ministry when it comes to the word of god it's never right to do the supposedly right thing the wrong way it matters how we handle the word you will only accept a sacrifice made in a certain manner lord the only door the only place we can worship is at the door of christ jesus we thank you lord for that and we thank you for making the way clear for us i pray god that you would help us each one to give up all things only those things keep only those things that would bring glory to god by us keeping them i pray you grant it now in jesus name amen amen let's stand together and sing this i want to live the way he wants me to live is that your desire tonight i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to no more love or i can never ever out love the lord see it one more time for your heart now i want to live the way he wants me to live thank you lord i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love [Music] i want to live [Music] i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love [Music] amen did you enjoy that this evening amen give the lord a hand clapper praise and definitely enjoyed that amen just some some good things are set in there about how to take a few notes on my phone things you know you read it's funny you read the scripture and you look at things and you study and then every time god brings something out new every time so it's just amazing what god can do for us it's good to be in the house of the lord let's just sing this song as we're dismissed at calvary remember robert if you have that in there i'm not sure what key let's just sing a few verses of this before we go that calvary years [Music] he died [Music] there was great and grace was in free was multiplied to me there my burden so foul
