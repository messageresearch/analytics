and uh in Harmony and believe we're going to be all together one day so might as well practice for that now 1 Corinthians 15 and8 we're going to continue on our study on Christ is the mystery of God revealed uh tonight just take a small portion of it and I hope it'll be a blessing to you said and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time this is Paul speaking the Apostle I am the least of the Apostles I'm not meat to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God by the grace of God I am what I am how many can say Amen to that tonight by the grace of God his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I labored more abundantly than they all yet not I but the grace of God which was with me amen I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated what we discovered last time without doing too much reviewed tonight that the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you we found that uh Peter got a revelation of who he was of who Jesus was and then later Peter got a revelation of who Jesus was in Peter and when he got that Revelation it was the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was the new birth in Peter's life Jesus Jesus told him when you're converted strengthen your brethren and so that's what it takes for us to be born again I'll just read that part to you again brother brand said the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth amen oh don't you love that tonight he said now what are you going to do when you get all that group together now what group the group that has the revelation of who Christ is not the group that goes to a certain church or the group that has a certain Pastor or the group that dresses a certain way or the group that does this side or the other but the group that has the revelation of who Jesus is today that group that has that Revelation where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it perfect it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest he said oh if the church only knew its position oh my heart cries with the prophet tonight as he it come from his heart he said oh if the church only knew its position it will one day it will one day that's a promise I believe this is the day that the church recognizes its position because we have to for a Rapture he said then he said the Rapture will go when it knows what it is the Rapture will go we talked about that he didn't say the Rapture will come but the Rapture will go because everything you have need of for the Rapture is in you right now oh if you can just realize who you are tonight and what's going to happen to you now and and brother brandom goes on he said and and this is just a continuation of that thought but he said did you notice Paul never knew Jesus physically right Paul never knew Jesus physically the only way that Paul knew him was by Revelation by a vision it was by a revelation by a vision is that right Paul only knew Jesus by the Revelation just like Peter did Peter had seen him in flesh but he didn't know him by flesh so Paul hadn't seen him in the flesh and didn't know him by the flesh Peter had seen him in the flesh but still didn't know him by the flesh cuz he said Flesh and Blood didn't reveal it to even my own life didn't reveal it to you now I want you to know this Revelation doesn't come by observation you can find Jesus teaching that in Luke 17: 20 if you want to write that down but he talks to them the Pharisees he said the kingdom of God doesn't come by what you see he said you won't be able to see it it could be right among you and you wouldn't see it he said because the kingdom of God is within you so the kingdom of God does not come by observation you won't be able to set a come by a set of rules or or this is what the church will be this is what this is what the person will be it don't come by observation the kingdom of God is within you no amount of observing The Life of Christ will give you a revelation of who he is they could have been raised with him uh they could have lived with him they could have worked with him but it would never reveal who he was oh my you can go to church church you can pay your tithe you can live right you can do everything right but it takes a revelation of Grace by grace for you to be saved and for me to be saved and I'm so glad of that tonight it does not come by observation in other words you can't just observe it you can't he said even my own life didn't reveal to you could know everything brother random ever did and try to pattern your life according to the prophet and it would never do you any good other than just as a leader as a mentor but that's not going to get you into heaven what's going to get you into heaven a revelation of who he is right now you got to know who he is in you and who he is in your brother and sister to have a revelation today which is the new birth now but it doesn't come even by observing your brother and sister right yeah right you could watch them you could watch two people they could both do the same things say the same things claim to believe the same things one of them has a revelation and one doesn't but it proves out in the end who they are the wheat and The Tear grow up together now he said but my Father which is in heaven has revealed the thing to you that he is the word of God and Upon This Rock I'll build my church Peter didn't know him by flesh man walked and handled him and everything else but he said Paul had something greater than any of the Apostles did and watch Paul had a greater Revelation even though he never met him now he said they said well I've got more Revelation than you Paul because you know I walked with him I went fishing with him one day I heard him talk right that brother brand said people die Spirits never die right that's still around today he said well he sat in the boat with me and actually told me let's go over here and fish in this place and we'll get more fish and we did it see we seen him do things but just being there and seeing the supernatural happen is not enough to give you a revelation right but what what gives you a revelation is Grace because you are God's because you're one of his children that's why you have a revelation tonight is because you belong to Heaven you come come from somewhere and you're going back to somewhere are you with me so far so Paul had something greater than the apostles did they said well we've done this that and the other and we saw him do this that and the other but that wasn't enough hearing the voice of Jesus was not what saved Paul he never heard his voice in the flesh he heard it from the pillar of fire right but he never heard his voice in the flesh I I would contend to you today that hearing the voice of the Prophet will not save you and in some places that we've been in the world we know there's places where they can't hear the voice of a prophet where they don't understand the voice of a prophet and that has no saving value in it but it's what that it's the message that that Prophet brought it's the message it's the Revelation that doesn't come from the voice of a man but it comes from the voice of God it's the words that he spoke it's the words that Jesus spoke that's what matter he said that's what my words are spirit and life so Paul saw him after he was dead the brown said buried rose again and expressed himself in the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel Paul being a Jew would have never called that Lord unless he had seen the expression he was back the same yesterday today and forever he was back what does that tell us if we've seen the pillar of fire today if we've seen it you say well I haven't seen it you've seen the picture of it I believe there's a reason why God allowed his picture to be taken in this hour because you've at least seen the picture of the supernatural Pillar of Fire that doesn't save you but what it does is tell you he's back right the same God that was here in the old times is still here today the same God that was with Moses the same God that was with Paul that same God that was with brother brandom is still here today how many believe that today so he said Paul in other words I'm the same God today I was yesterday here I am in the same light the pillar of fire that Moses talked to in the burning bush no wonder he could separate the law From Grace over in the book of Hebrews now keep that in your mind he met that same Pillar of Fire he said I am Jesus whom you persecute and here he is today in the same manner by the same Pillar of Fire expressing himself and vindicating himself the same revealing the mystery of God has been hid since the foundation of the world oh my so Paul only knew him by Revelation Peter knew him by Revelation Paul only knew him by Revelation now Peter walked with him talked with him brother BR said therefore you can set in this word now remember he was the word just knowing the word as far as knowing what it says doesn't save you right because he said you you can sit in this word he said now I've just said that he was the word now a scholar can sit down and read that word till he can just tie your mind up anyway see if he wants to do it cuz he's smart brilliant get a Catholic priest or not so much as that a real good trained Theologian in the Bible a Baptist or a presbyterian or something he'll make you think you don't know nothing when it comes to talk see that we don't we don't want to get to a place where all we know is talk the B of the church got to a place where it's only weapon was argument I don't want to ever get to that place but I want to know him by Revelation I want to know him by experience I want to know him in the reality of who he is they knew him he said they they'll tie you up where you don't know nothing when it comes to talk why what see he said because he has known him in the flesh the word and he he Pats his Bible so knowing him in the flesh the brand typed that to knowing him in the Bible only yeah in the letter only he said but the only way you're saved is by know him by Revelation right know him by Revelation it's got to become a reality to you see by the word by knowing him by the flesh you can know he died right but you got to have a revelation he died for you right so when we're talking about Revelation we're not talking about understanding or levels of understanding or being able to explain things in the message that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about revelation I'm talking about you knowing it being a settled fact all right that he died for you not saying what my dad told me my mom told me the the pastor told me somebody else told me but I know see this message has got to become more than just something we've been beat over the head with it's got to be something more than something we've just been fed force fed over and over and over again but it's got to be something that you settled in your heart that you said I know other people can say what they want to but I know brother Jeff this message is right I know it and so you couldn't draw me away from it you couldn't pull me off of it because I know it's a revelation it's not I think or someone told me but I know that's what Peter said I know you are the Christ and once I have that Revelation I might even fail Peter even denied him but after he had that Revelation he could never leave he could never fall so far that the grace of God wouldn't pick him up why because he knew that was the Christ and you know that this message is right you know him you know the word not just the letter of it but you know that that word is real Hallelujah the Revelation brand said I can take the Presbyterian Doctrine tie you Pentecostals till you won't know I can take the Baptist Doctrine and show you Pentecostals a million things you'll know nothing of that's right but that's not it that's not his church huh he repeats it that's not his church yeah yeah his church is himself revealed and whatever he did the church will do and brother B taught us about that we believe the signs of Wonders follow the church right those that believe but that's not what we what we do first is we make sure that the fruits of the spirit are operating in our lives that's love joy peace longsuffering gentleness kindness amen because that is him expressing himself in the church yes see you could do a lot of things and say I'm a Believer and I belong to the church and I believe the message but is that coming is that emanating from your life is the is is the nature of Christ himself expressing himself the way he did in the Bible through your life or is there Envy jealousy right those other things that are are of the flesh those things that we have to overcome now watch his church is himself revealed you see it and expressed by the word itself that he is God now I want to I want to step away from Christ as the mystery of God revealed for a moment and and I want to ask you again how did Paul know Jesus well he knew him by revelation but what did he do to get that Revelation I want you to think about it I want you to don't answer me ably but just think about that what did he do to get that re Revelation well I would ask you what did Peter do to get that Revelation because Peter did just basically everything before Pentecost everything Peter did was wrong right he messed up in every possible way you can mess up in in what he was you know and so talking about this Peter I'm just talking about Peter in the Bible I know Peter feels like he messes up sometimes in every way but that's all of us but we don't know him by what we do right we don't know him by what we can perform you young people listen to me tonight you don't know him and because many times if it's performance-based you'll go out and you'll make a mistake and you'll think well I can't go back to church like that I I I done too much i' I've went too far don't you you don't know him that way you know him by Revelation right you know him by Revelation I I know him I know he's he's Grace to me and that Revelation does not come by by teaching it doesn't come by by by works it comes by Grace amen see it's a revelation of Grace by Grace amen now let me show you in Acts chapter 9 let's look at how Paul if we just take a few minutes tonight and and kind of if I can kind of get my heart to you because I I just couldn't get away from this and so we just took a little bit out of Christ as the mystery but it spoke to me so much Acts chapter 9 verse1 Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord and went into the high priest now look at the type of man that Saul was who became Paul he was breathing out that that that's very descriptive it's saying he panted like a wolf to persecute people that's who he was he he was a wolf he was breathing out threats and Slaughter which is murder against the Disciples of the Lord Philippians 3:5 Paul says even of himself he said I was circumcised The Eighth Day the stalk of Israel the tribe of Benjamin Hebrew of the Hebrews that's touching the law of Pharisee sir and when he says that he said If any man could be proud of himself I could more right if any man could trust in himself I could more he said I had to count it all as done to be able to see Christ amen but see he was he was he was panting like a wolf because that was his nature and we've went through that The Tribe of Benjamin and my name is Benjamin but I don't have a Benjamin nature but the tribe of Benjamin is actually uh it was told of them that they would raven like a wolf that's Genesis 49:27 Benjamin shall Raven as a wolf in other words they would they would get a taste of blood a a and they couldn't quit killing right they get a taste of blood and they couldn't quit killing that's why if you get that in the church it's a problem right that that spirit that that Paul had before he became Paul when he was Saul he was he was actually a wolf and he he had a a taste for blood so he wasn't going to stop until he destroyed the people of God like a wolf or a stray dog or something if they ever get a taste they say if a dog ever gets a taste for chickens you're done you just have to shoot the dog right because if you have chickens because if he ever gets a taste of that it won't just it won't just kill a chicken to eat it it'll just keep killing if they ever they get excited by that blood like a shark get excited by the sin of blood they just killed to kill and that's the way Saul was he had tasted blood and he wanted more Christians aren't like that right that's not the life of Christ come on church I it going to get kind of tight here for a minute and then we're going to we're going to move on but Christians aren't like that brother Bron said people can jump up and down shout all night long speak in tongues like pouring Peas on a dry cide while cried out the next morning with enough temper to fight a buzz saw you know temper was still wrong just give you an update on that in 2024 it's still wrong to lose your temper if you did it wasn't the Lord don't blame it on God don't try to justify it you just you you lost your temper the whole idea of losing your temper means you were insane for a moment if you lost your temper it means that you were in the flesh and you need to repent right still a sin we said you can do all that and have enough temper to fight a buzz saw go right on out and tell something in the church will cause the whole church to be broke up there nothing in the world but enticing demon Spirits God help us today we don't want to blame our temper on God we don't want to blame our vindictiveness on God Lord take that out of me I just want to serve you Lord I don't want any of that in my life all right blame it on God the B said you watch a little old baby not over higher than that I don't know how high it was but little baby maybe higher than that right we've known some big babies all of us have we've all been big babies at some point in our life just gets so mad said he'd ring his hands turn red in the face and hold his breath ever seen a child do that a baby sure he will what is it it's his nature he got it from his py or his Mammy one times it's hard to figure that out you know she had enough temper to fight a buz saw or his daddy if they didn't his grandfather grandmother did to it's Offspring he said you're born in the world you come by nature and your whole being is black and smudy and Damned and cursed and going to hell that's pretty dark isn't it but we need to recognize that that's the way we came here but it's not the way we have we can stay aren't you glad for Grace today that's the way Paul came his whole being he was a ravening wolf breathing out threatening and Slaughter the Brandon said you're born in the world you come by nature but when you're born again then the light of God shines down into that soul and it's no more a dark Valley but it's a valley with a shadow in it so he says there's light now in it there's still a shadow because you're still here in the flesh but there's light there he said you may be veiled here with the Flesh and the things of our face but there's enough light in there and someday that light Darkness has to separate oh I'm so glad we're looking forward to that day I'm not what I was but I'm not what I'm going to be I'm going to I'm going to leave this old body of Flesh One Day by Grace I'm going to do it I'm going to walk out of this old body I'm going to walk out of this old this this thing that holds me down this thing that I have to keep under subjection I'm going to walk out of it one of these days and the light is going to separate from the darkness oh I think that ought to give us hope he said but whe been I've failed I've done this t or the other don't you realize that one of these days that Darkness will leave Hallelujah but there's got to be light in there when that moment comes to overcome that Darkness right he said you may be veiled here with the flesh the things over our face but there's enough light in there and someday that light and darkness has to separate when the light shines Darkness fleas oh I'm so grateful for that today you know I got a lot of darkness in my life shine some light on it sir let the light come in that's good one day that Darkness and Light will separate Acts chapter 9 verse two Paul desired of the high priest letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem he didn't have no pity he was a raving wolf as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shine round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and he heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord see he knew that was a pillar of fire and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks other words the ox goes because God had been channeling Paul into the new birth all the time Paul didn't know it but God had actually been tricking him he'd been moving him he'd been working on him and you may not realize today you say well I know somebody that was in church and now they're not or I know somebody that really needs God don't you realize that they're a seat of God God's already working he's already pricking he's already bringing he's already pushing you may not see it yet but it's already taking place it was hard to kick against the Pricks and he trembling and astonished said Lord what Willl thou have me to do the Lord said him arise go to the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do now I want I want you to tell me tonight what did Paul have to do with that did he get himself in a good atmosphere think about it now I believe we should get ourselves in a good atmosphere but we can only do that by the Holy Ghost what did Paul do good to to get himself converted now this is you know those of us I like the service to run just right everything to be just right but what did Paul do what was done for Paul to to get him to a place where he could be converted God put him right in the place where he needed him where he wanted him but but Paul didn't have anything to do with it nothing nothing I know you're sitting there thinking brother Ben you know for me you know I believed the message only if you had something to believe with right there had to be a deposit of faith I I I but you don't understand I I pulled myself up by by my bootstraps that might work in in the economy it don't work with god brother Brandon said that was a god dishonoring proverb God helps those that help themselves but the B said it was a god dishonoring proverb God don't help those who help themselves God helps those who can't help themselves right and he was there three days without sight in verse n neither did eat nor drink nothing he could do he just helpless the pillar of fire spoke to him he said he said when you go down there and just wait and then I'll tell you what to do he had to wait it's all he could do the Lord spoke to ananas to to go down there was a a Believer there in uh in Damascus to go down lay hands on him but Paul had been so murderous to the church that ananas was he he in first at first he said no no Lord no no not him you imagine if a guy come in that was so bad that we refused to lay hands on him ananas had to have a vision to go lay hands on Paul because he was so bad nobody wanted to touch him because they were afraid it was a trick they afraid that he was coming down they had heard he was coming down to destroy them him yes sir but he been changed oh my look they and ananas was so reluctant to go but the Lord said go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear not my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake I know people today say we don't need Ministry no more we don't need pastors we we don't need we don't need uh evangelists anymore but even Paul couldn't save himself he couldn't lay hands on himself he couldn't give himself the Holy Ghost it come from one member of the Bride to another God had to send ananas down into the place where Saul was so he could be filled with the Holy Ghost and anas went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared un thee in the way as thou camest has sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost I love the way he addresses him there I just noticed that brother Saul because whether you're all the way in whether you're wherever you are on your journey it's still brother Saul because God working on him amen God showed ananas this is going to be a believer he's going to do great things he's going to suffer great things we called him brother Saul and immediately there fell from his eyes as had been scales he received sight and the rose he couldn't make himself see it took the Holy Ghost to do that he didn't go to church he didn't read the word he he didn't sing a song he didn't reform himself try to do better but the revelation of Christ Christ The Mystery of God revealed came to him by Grace the same way it came to You and I by grace and Paul's attitude towards Ministry was shaped by this Revel Philippians 1:12 I would you should understand Brethren that the things which happened unto me listen you're going to have things happened to you it's just part of it the things which happened to me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel oh my if we can all look at it like that the things which happened to me what happened to him he was Shipwrecked he was bitten by a snake he was he he was run from City to City he was stoned and left for dead he was beat he was put in prison he was sitting there with his hands in Chains even then and he said the things that happened to me was for the furtherance of the Gospel so that my Bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places and many of the brethren in the Lord waxing Confident by my bonds much more bold to speak the word without fear some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife some also of goodwi the one preach Christ of intention not sincerely supposing to add Affliction to my bonds but the other of love knowing I'm set for the defense of the Gospel what then he said well I I I really like those ones that preach because of love for the right motives he knew there was some preaching for the wrong things but he said what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretense or in truth Christ has preached and let that I want that to be my attitude towards Ministry I want that to be my attitude towards churches I towards our our brothers and sisters I'm not just saying that some of y'all are here tonight but I didn't know you were going to be here but I'll say this that we should have that attitude towards one another that that whether in pretense or in truth Christ is preached hey if the message is being declared let me put my shoulder to the wheel try to be a part of it in every way I can what then and I with standing every way whether in preaching or in truth Christ is preaching I therein do Rejoice yeah and will rejoice I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ according to my Earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death he said he he had such a revelation of Christ in Paul he said I may be in Chains but Christ is going to magnify himself in those chains that the the gospel is going to be further down the road than what it was because I was put in prison right you knew he had nothing to do with his calling it didn't matter what people did to him it'd be for the furtherance of the Gospel if you had nothing to do with your salvation then everything that happens to you must be ordained of the Lord right and all things must work together for good right right you had nothing to do with it anyway see Paul understood you got to let God be God that's what he told him don't don't kick against the Pricks if God God's doing something in your life let God be God let the chips fall where they may and I think that and I'm just expressing my heart because I I I sometimes I get introspective and I look down the road and I think sometimes as pastors we get to feeling like we're so essential to the life of the church because because I I believe a pastor the office of a pastor is essential to the life of the church but but the particular Pastor sometimes as a pastor we get to feeling like we are and we end up holding on longer than we should I'm not about to leave I'm just you know someday I'll be old and and and people my weight don't age well wow it's cold brother Joel but I got thinking about that and I thought what what would happen if I got to where I couldn't take care of the church anymore what am I going to do see we got to Empower others to follow us right because God's going to have a church I didn't make myself a preacher I I didn't put myself here behind this Pulpit God did that and if God did that oh church then if I'm gone somebody else will step in and I can have confidence I I can I can I can go take a vacation knowing that God will will perform what he promised he would perform even if I'm not here and yet I feel like I need to be here but it's not that I'm so essential to the life of the church because what happens is we hold on much longer than we should but I believe that what's essential is the mystery of who's doing this in the first place it's not me revealed to the church it's Christ revealed to the church sir and if the deacons change and the trustees change and the and the whole face of the church changes there will still be somebody declaring the gospel of Christ God's big enough to do that right if I can't serve him in my capacity anymore he'll find somebody else right it's because of Grace he loves his people right Hallelujah now look Paul empowered others I won't go get to all of this but in in second Timothy 4 he talks about that and he talks about how he's getting ready to to go and so what does he do instead of holding on to what he has he empowers Timothy to go fight to go do what he did and I'm I'm grateful for the men that give me the ability to do what I do today because it wasn't for men that allowed me to do what I do allowed me to make my stumbles and things I couldn't be where I'm at today and yet I know there will be other men come up I've got to let them I've got to I got to suffer with them too right and we do as a church because we know we're trying to get the Next Generation ready they got to have their Revival it's one thing for me to have mine and then sit there and and and preach against it the rest of my life or I can let them have their Revival what Paul say I fought a good fight I've finished my course I've kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day not to me only but unto all them also that love is appearing what was it he knew by grace that God didn't count his mistakes to him that God only saw he' fought a good fight wasn't that he never made a M stake said he knew he was called by Grace he was saved by grace he' go home by Grace Wonder we could say by the grace of God I am what I am you see if we really knew how little we had to do with our own salvation we'd be far less critical of others but the brand said that's where the church the people so-called the church have so miserably failed because it is in their own personal work that they feel that they Merit the goodness and grace of God by what they do and how they live but that has not one thing to do with it it's a gift of God but what did that do to Paul Paul said I served him in a greater way I served him with more diligence than anybody because I knew it was Grace right if you really get a revelation of Grace you serve him that much more and you all know that I as a pastor I I I want us to do I want us to work I want us and I try to set that example I want to I want to be the hardest worker in the church I want us to do the things that God wants us to do I want us to be diligent about it I want us to be timely about it but yet I know none of those things will save me and none of those things will save a single person only Christ can do that that's good but he have somebody who is diligent right he'll have somebody who who does do the work but they won't do it because because it's just something they're doing to earn their salvation because the Baptist can do that a Methodist can do that some a presbyterian can do that but who can who can really realize that who Christ is in this hour it takes a Believer this message to really recognize who they are and really recognize who's doing the work Ephesians 2:8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the give gift of God not of Works L any man should boast now watch brother BR said and I'm going to close on this but it's a a little bit of a quote got a a few paragraphs to it and brother brand said this he said watch this master teacher Paul the first thing he does is knock out all the idea of falling away right because I'm not preaching to you out of fear that you're going to fall away I don't want you to be afraid of that at all that's what Paul did he he knocked out all the idea of Falling Away knocked out all the idea of ever being a Christian today and tomorrow I'm gone and the next day God condemned me and the next day I'm back again brother said that's nonsense now he's talking to Saints he said he don't preach that way in evangelism he still made altar calls right he still brought people to an altar and preached conviction to their hearts but he's talking to Saints I believe we're talking to Saints tonight amen now look he said he's trying to tell them the first thing get it out of your mind that you're going to get lost and you're going to do this and you're scared of this don't be scared of nothing on Hallelujah for he's trying to tell you where you're at who you are how you're standing oh church we can only recognize that he said she will one day Hallelujah he said now you might do things wrong oh no really I might do things wrong every one of us do you know the person who did it is wrong and the people who talked about it we're wrong just as wrong oh God help us today help me look he's trying to tell them the first thing get it out of your mind he might do things wrong every time you do anything wrong you're going to get paid for it sure you'll reap what you sow but that has not one thing to do with your salvation now listen we believe in predestination I told that story and I know that it shakes some people about brother Ramsey R talked about him how he refused and all these things and we don't know all the particulars of that I I confess I don't fully understand that but I'll say this if you are one of gods you cannot be lost and a great example of that is the Jews because they've done everything possible possible to be lost right and there will still be 144,000 right during the tribulation period they'll be saved and receive the believe the message that's what our Prophet taught us there'll be 144,000 Jews who believe the message and see Christ and recognize him for what he is what is that Grace some people think well Grace is over when the bride's gone there'll still be Grace just to the Jews right because why not because of anything they did but because they're God's chosen people oh if you can only understand what you are and who you are today amen he said when you're born of the spirit of God you've got eternal life yes and can no more die than God can die I wish you young people just really get that oh look you say brother Ben if we preach that then people will people will fall away not if they got a revelation of it on only if they just have a head knowledge of it come on right but if you ever get a revelation of it you ever really get born again you'll realize listen there nothing you can do to not be a born again Christian Hallelujah brother brand said he was born a brandom I was born a pruit I might be the worst looking example of a pruit that there is but I'll never not be a pruit why pu blood runs through my veins brother BR said I'll never he said I could be crippled with arthritis he said but I'll never not be a br why because random blood run through his veins oh if we just recognize royal blood runs through your veins how could you ever be lost when the life of God is inside of you but you just there's Darkness still there you're in a valley of of a shadow of Darkness but remember remember there's coming a day when the darkness and the light will be separated you won't deal with that old flesh no more oh I'm looking forward to that I'm looking forward to that day Hallelujah hallelujah how are we part of God by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free but all made to drink into one Spirit brother brand said how could God judge him again and I made this point to several but I found our young people I found in counseling our young people as they come up I once they get married and they begin to you know you don't really start making mistakes till you get married because then someone's there to tell you you made a mistake all I'm sorry right he didn't know you were making mistakes just going along freely and then now you have somebody to tell you when you make a mistake God gives us that for a reason brother Brown said for some people that's their cross to bear I I'm grateful for a woman of Grace in my life that has Grace on me and doesn't judge me for all the things that all the mistakes I've made but listen to this yeah you're going to make mistakes and I've watched our young people they struggle with that how could God judge Christ again when he went to Calvary he's already went to Calvary and I've gotten this this idea that well this bad is happening in my life because of something I did it can't be right now God could be testing you he could be trying you he allow you to be tried he could he could actually be uh moving you in a direction he wants you to go in he could be silent in your life for a while to get to nudge you in the right direction but it is not punishment it cannot be punishment it can't be how could you we only get a revelation of this tonight how could God judge him again when he went to Calvary going up gol he was beaten bruised he could not heal he could not even speak a word hardly cuz why he had the sins of the world on him not because he was a sinner but he was made sin for me and for you all the sins of the world from Adam until his coming rest upon his shoulder and God was not punishing his son he was punishing sin right he said see how horrible it was oh Peter if you just get a revelation of that Esther my children all of these children they can ever get a revelation of that God was not punishing his son he's not punishing you he just calling to you he was punishing sin said see how horrible it was ought to make us hate sin in every form in our life he was making a propitiation he was making a way of Escape for all those that God by his forn knowledge knew would come he said now then when you're by one Spirit we're baptized into that body body what are you baptized into his body the body that sin was judged in Hallelujah you're baptized into the when we say we're the body of Christ what are we saying we're perfect sin was already judged in that body Hallelujah brother Brandon when we've went through it in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said he took out of his side Eve it completely the bride came completely from his side so how she could could she be lost she come from him she's part of him and brother Brown makes a statement he said now then when you're by one Spirit baptized into that body one body which is Christ we are safe forever Hallelujah in one place he said we're just as safe as that body is safe Hallelujah that body couldn't see corruption it couldn't be lost God redeemed that body and we're just as safe as that body is safe just ass sure oh God just as sure as there's a literal Jesus Christ that'll come in a body form to receive his elect we're just that safe ourselves yes sir Hallelujah that's true we just need this Darkness to be separated from the light Hallelujah he said now there's where it seems to strangely strike especially the Armenian Believers what Armenian means it's we don't think about that today but as Armenians but back in the day it was a big deal Armenian is someone who follows the teachings of armenius who believed that there was no predestination or election at all so that would be your Methodist and and some Baptists and things like that and then on the other side you had Calvin brother BR said he was a calvinist as long as Calvin stayed with the Scripture it was Armenian as long as Armenia stayed with the scripture he said the Armenian believers they struggle with that he said have to do something that to Merit their s or some Meritor something how can it be by two things at the same time it's either by Grace or by works one it can't be by the same thing it's by two different things got to be by the one he said my I just can't see nothing else but the grace of God and brother BR said that's my makeup and I believe God called our Prophet for a reason he said that's my makeup he said I always did believe in grace he said I'm just Grace all over that's all why because he was like Paul he knew God called him brother brandom tried to kill them young boys you remember right now don't you try that you try that it might work but he tried it remember what happened the gun wouldn't go off all that was in him wanted to kill them and he would have never become a preacher never done never traveled around the world seven times what was it what was it was Grace tried to kill himself twice it's Grace oh God we just regognize Grace to us and I can't see nothing else he said but the grace of God you imagine looking back at that what brother Brandon must have felt like to be brought from that to the place where he was he said I can't see nothing but Grace he said it isn't even in my life when I was a boy I couldn't see nothing just Grace Grace he said they they say you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours well it's an awful expression he said but I don't care whether you scratch mine or not if yours needs scratching I'll scratch you anyhow I've told these young people listen to me everybody tells you how to be happy today and they said take do self-care and make yourself happy and make sure you take time for yourself and do this for yourself and do that for yourself it's the worst way in the world to be happy it's an easy way to be miserable you want to be happy do something good for somebody else you want to be happy in your marriage make your wife happy make your husband happy you want to be happy in the church make the people in the church happy right listen that's the way to be happy is by making somebody else happy he said I don't care whether you scratch mine or not if yours need scratching I'll scratch you anyhow see he said Grace Hallelujah yes sir see grace works by love he said if you need it if you need it I'll do it oh if our marriages worked that way how much better marriages would we have not because I'm made to do it not because somebody forced me not because somebody stood over me and told me this is what you have to do to be my wife or my husband but because of Grace because of Love see he said if you need it I'll do it whatever needs to be done that's what I'll do do and if both people would think like that you never have any problems if people in a church would think like that I'll do what needs to be done I don't need a title I don't I don't need an office I don't need anything else I just want to do what needs to be done if you could ever begin to think like that you begin to be happy and you don't even know why you're happy I'm doing all this work I'm stressed out all the time but I'm still happy why because I did what needed to be done and God Honors that it's the spirit of Christ said Grace yes sir Grace works by love if you need it regardless if you never done nothing for me I don't have one thing to do with you if you need it I'll do it anyhow Grace because you need it he said I needed saving there was nothing could save me there was nothing I could do about myself I could do no more save myself than nothing musicians go ahead and come he said but I needed saving because I believed in a god and God sent his son made in the likeness of sinful flesh to suffer in my place I was saved by grace alone was I saved not one thing could I do or you do to save yourself what did Paul do let me ask again what did he do it wasn't that God sit down up in the heavens waiting on somebody to work hard enough come on come on so he could change them so he could fill them with the Holy Ghost but before Paul was born when he was in his mother's womb the Bible says he covered me in his mother in my mother's womb he possessed my Reigns before I was ever born he covered me he protected me and he said you're going to be a preacher you're going to do this you're going to be saved you're going to preach them people in Hardy I need you there oh Church what did Paul do to that nothing was by Grace but when he received that Revelation he worked harder than anybody else why because he knew he couldn't have worked to have done it he said I'll pay my vows I'll do what I can I can't I can't Merit salvation what did the thief on the cross do as you've heard before the thief on the cross just said the the man in the middle he told me I could come that's all [Music] he said you could come he said the spirit and the bride say come they don't say stay away you're too you're too dirty you're too bad come but you got to recognize you're a sinner you got to realize who you are and you got to come to God and say Lord whatever you have want me to do I'll do it that's what Paul did how you know a person's had a real experience said whatever you want me to do I'll do it God said there's nothing you can do go wait on me amen hallelujah he said I could come and you can come if we have that revelation of Grace I wonder then how should we treat one another see it's not me it's Christ in me he does the works and if you're baptized with the same Spirit as he was you do the same Works let's bow our heads together Heavenly [Music] Father Lord there there may be some tonight that we struggling with thoughts of the day or the week or things that were going on but Lord I pray that that light shine down in that Darkness tonight enough light broke through oh God that Veil that the light would begin to be separated from the darkness oh I pray you'd Grant it today Lord that seed could be awakened in the atmosphere that we're in Lord with
