lord this morning expecting good things you get what you expect there may not be a whole lot of us here but we expect a blessing we expect the word to come forth and bless our hearts and we're thankful for it it's already done key of g oh it's already done hallelujah it's already done oh praise the lord the battle is over the victory is won it's already done oh yes the word has been

was a may grace how sweet the sound oh that saved a rich like me oh i was lost but now i found i was blind but now i've we've been there ten thousand years when we been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun we've known [Music] let's sing that next verse [Music] was [Music] as they play that softly dear lord we just come before you this morning the lord with just expectation to hear from your word lord we pray lord that you just move me aside lord that you just come and speak to your children learn that none of my thoughts or ideas would be injected lord just be the pure word of god lord that lord that it would just bless your people this morning that you would just speak to their needs god i pray for those that uh that are sick this morning lord there's several out that they're sick we just pray while they're listening this morning lord that you just send healing power their direction but we pray you just bless an unspoken request here this morning or whatever we have need of god we just we just know and trust that you will deliver us from that in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen do you love the lord this morning amen just looking forward to what god has in store for us sorry it's it's me again but i found out at eight o'clock i was gonna be preaching this morning so we'll just pray that the lord has a purpose behind everything that's one thing i've learned i try not to question question the lord because if i looked at my own abilities i wouldn't be able to do it but if we look to him he can always come and take care of it amen if you would turn with me to uh ii timothy chapter 1 and verse 12. amen second timothy chapter 1 and verse 12 just greet everybody in the name of the lord this morning glad to have everybody out just be remembering those i think allison and stuart and their family there kind of have a little virus or something going on so just be praying for them the lord would just heal them and deliver them from that second timothy chapter 1 and verse 12 it says for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i'm not ashamed for i know in whom i have believed and persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day hold fast the form of sound words which thou has heard of me in faith and love which is in christ jesus that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us amen you have your seats this morning i mean if i could just for just for a few moments just just go through the scripture here this morning and just see where the lord leads us but i'm going to go back through that second timothy chapter 1 and verse 12 and we see here that he's speaking he says for which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i'm not ashamed for i know in whom i have believed and persuaded that he's able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day so we see here that the writer is saying that what i have committed unto god i am faithful i am persuaded that he will keep that against that day speaking of the day that our bodies are speaking of the day at that time of death or the rapture is that right in verse 13 he says hold fast the form of sound words so we see that when when we look at the scripture when we look at a minister that comes and speaks the word of god those are sound words those are words that will last and that will hold us to the to the rapture is that right which thou has heard of me in faith and love which is in christ jesus that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us so if we don't have that holy ghost we know we're not sealed we know that we cannot make it to our redemption so we see you know you look at this this morning and my thought line this morning if i could speak uh i guess our title or thought it would be christ means more and it's a very simple thought this morning because you're like well what does christ mean more than well everything and i think as a believer we've got to come to that point to where he means more than anything else and and hopefully we we all have that in our life where it means more than family it means more than social status it means more than church but christ has got to be the center focus of our life and and so we look and and you know i just kind of just look here you know rebecca when they come to her and when eliezer come and and you heard the family was saying you know we're going to do this we're going to do that and and finally it come down to them you know they said well let the damsel speak is that right and and she had to speak rebecca had to speak by her own words and they said will you go with this man and she said i will go and so we see that it had to come down to rebecca just like it had to come down to each one of us we had to make that decision to where we says we will go with christ and brother branham says and i have heard but now i see he said and satan had even stretched as far as he could on that he took every friend and everything he had he's speaking of job he says in almost his complete life but he couldn't take his life he said but job held right on he said there was no turning back you see when a man or a person has really come in contact with god with that genuine revealed faith that god is there's nothing no time nowhere can ever separate that man from god he says i believe it was paul said there's no strife no hunger no perils neither living creatures or death or anything that can separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus do you believe that he said you're securely anchored in him because you were ordained to that life and when we know that god ordained us he not only ordained us or predestinated us but he equipped us for the journey is that right so whatever we needed we whatever we would have need of he equipped us with that and i was talking to to jen last night i was kind of telling her about one of the one of the historical facts and i can't remember which war but i was reading where you know they were so short supplied on guns that they were giving one soldier a gun with a clip and then giving the next soldier a clip and so they were going into battle with just bullets and they were like you know when one dies you grab their gun and and how how you know you look at today you know i won't even go to work if the air is not on we won't come to church unless the power's on and how times have changed that used to they were going to jump out of a plane or go into battle with just bullets no gun and so we see that as in today's time we've got to be willing to do that as christians that whatever god has put in front of us that's what we've got to be able to face and we've got to trust that he has equipped us to overcome that is that right i mean do you love the lord this morning and we got to trust god we've got to trust him to know that whatever he's given us and and i really like that you know i heard a quote the other day it says you know in school they give you lessons and then you train for the test is that right and they say in life god gives you the test which teaches you the lesson so we see as christians we want to learn the lesson we want to know what we're going to go through we want to know what's going to happen but god doesn't show us that way he teaches us through the test is that right i believe the scripture says every son and daughter of god must be tested and tried we must be chastened now if we could just for a few moments i'd just like to look at gideon in the scriptures so if you want to turn to judges chapter 6 that's where i'll be taking the most of the context from this morning in the scripture and i just love this story of gideon and it's definitely done something for me in my life and and i usually read this read this quote and i've read it a couple times with several different with several different sermons but there's a there's a plane a nautical term i believe to where this plane reaches the term of the pnr or the point of no return and i've read this before but it's more often to refer to as pilots by the radius of action formula which is referred to as a technical term in air navigation to refer to the point on a flight at which due to fuel consumption the plane is no longer capable of returning to the airfield it took off from and so what that means is it's gone so far that it's closer to the destination than going back so it's gone far enough that there's no way it can turn back it's got to go forward and i believe as christians we've come to that point we've gone so far there's nowhere else to go but to the finish line is that right as believers there's nowhere else to go back to another there's not another age to come there's not another prophet messenger to come the only place we're going is to the rapture to meet him in the air is that right so as sons and daughters of god it's got to be christ means more than anything else that we that we can focus on in this day anything else that's happening in the world christ has to mean more now judges 6 and verse 1 and you know the story of gideon and i've kind of got it broke down we'll kind of go through this but you know the story of gideon and judges 6 1 and you see the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of the midian seven years and you know one thing that that i look at the children of israel and i've said this before you know it's kind of just so so upsetting to me to see that god would save them then they'd go back and god would save them they'd fall again or they'd make a mistake and then i i was just like man they're just so dumb you know and then i kind of looked at my life i was like well i made this mistake oh i did this and then i was like man i'm so dumb and and so without him there's nothing no way none of us can make it you can't outsmart the devil you can't outsmart sin it's not an intellectual knowledge it's a heart knowledge it's something knowing christ i believe it's the peace that passes all understanding when you can't explain why you're at peace that's the peace of god is that right you know you can explain why you're at peace when there's money in the bank your family's healthy everything's going right you can explain that peace and that but when everything's going on and everything's crashing everything's falling apart and and everything's going just the way you don't want it to go and you still have peace that's the peace of god now and we see here that in in verse 2 and the hand of the midian prevailed against israel because the midianites and the children of israel and because of the midianites the children of israel made them dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds and so it was when israel had sown the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of the east even came up against them and i like that when they when one took over more came in is that right and that's just the way it works with sin or with unbelief when you let one thought come in there's a several that's going to be following right behind it to attack is that right that's the way the enemy works he likes to get one thing in and then start taking over with others and and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left no sustenance for israel neither sheep nor oxen or ass and we see that for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers in multitude for both they had their camels were without number and they entered the land to destroy it in verse 6 and israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of israel cried unto the lord so we see they had reached a point of desperation to where they cried back unto god and i think that's just a point you know even historically or or or even scripturally you look at the children of israel every time everything would go good they would go back to some other little god or some minor god or some idols or this or that but every time they got a needs of desperation they would cry out to the one true god and and you can see that in today's time you know there's people who don't go to church but let something wrong happen with the children or with the family they're going to go back to church because they know they know maybe they can't fully grasp or change their life or be filled with the holy ghost but they know there's something about this word that can change somebody is that right brother braham says in desperations he says that the sign of his coming should throw every member of christ into desperation now about our souls about our welfare for hereafter he says well what are you going to do to amount to if we gain the whole world what are you going to do what are we living for he says what do you work for what are you eating for what are you struggling for he says to live he says what are you living for to die he said you're not fit to live until you're fit to die it's true and we all see so many miracles of healing it should put us into desperation so you see the prophet there is saying you know sometimes we can get focused on this mortal life but what are we really focusing on because at the end of this mortal life all we do is die is that right and i've told y'all many times i'm a planner and i've done this and i've said this here many times but you know i plan the week i plan the month i plan the year and you know and i like to get through those things so i like from monday to friday i have my list to do and when i get done on friday my to-do list is done i'm excited i feel good and and then you see i start over the next week and then you you elongate that list all the way out and then at the end it's just death so we see in this mortal life there's nothing to look forward to so we've got to be looking to christ is that right but it ought to put us in desperation that what we're looking for is it you know that kingdom that we're going to the builder and maker was god is that right it's not of this earth but it's of him so we see we we look here we see israel had reached a had reached a point of desperation and i know many times in my life i even trusting the lord but i've come to a point of desperation where i was willing to do whatever it took to to seek the mind of the lord is that right and as christians we all ought to be that way now we'll read on down in verse 7 and it came to pass when the children of israel cried unto the lord because of the midianites that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you up from egypt i brought you forth out of the house of bondage and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians out of the hand that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their land and i said unto you i'm the lord your god fear not the gods the amorites and whose land you dwell but you obey not my voice in verse 11 here and my my notes kind of cut off just a little bit verse 11 there came an angel of the lord and said under the oak which is an ophra and pertained to joash the ibizarite and and his son gideon threshed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the mennonites and so we see that gideon was hiding this from the mennonites because they would come in to seek kill and destroy and they were they were nothing they just took the sustenance of israel and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valor and gideon said unto him o my lord the lord be with us why then is this all befallen us and where be all the miracles which our fathers told of us saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord had forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites and the lord looked upon him and said go in thus thy might and save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i sent thee so i love that getting asked the question you know why why is all this happen where are all the miracles why is all this going on and it seems like god just ignores that and just says listen this is what i need you to do have not i sent thee and so we see that brother branham says in 1961 he says if god before us then where's all the miracles he says he says there are so-called churches around the country today that say well is this all the miracles he said we'll give you a thousand dollars that'll predict produce a miracle he says you poor deliberated backsliding twit twice dead plucked up by the roots how are you ever going to see a miracle until you become one he says glory he says a miracle of god's grace to take an unbelieving doubter and fill them with the holy ghost that's the true miracle he said jesus said except a man be born again he cannot even see the kingdom of god he said if you want to see a miracle become one let god work on you first he's got some overhauling to do i don't care how well you know the message how well you know the ministers the preachers of this message god's got an overhauling to do in our life before we can do anything else in anyone else's life is that right he said some different lenses to put over your eyes because you're blind dead in sin and trespasses spiritually bond double daddy said that's right god has to give you life and touch your eyes so that you can see and perform a miracle and make you a miracle then you can see the miracle working god he said that's the first thing so we see that before we can do anything god's got to change our viewpoint and our life is that right now judges 6 and 15 and we see here we're coming back to get in he said unto him oh my lord wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor and manasseh and i am the least in my father's house and so we see gideon begins to do what many of us do when god calls us to do anything we begin to look at ourselves right we begin to say well my family's the poorest and out of my whole family that is the poorest in all of israel i'm the worst one of that whole family you know so he's saying i'm the least of that family but if you look down through scripture and you look at where god or where jesus went when he was here on earth it was all the places that most people in church wouldn't go right and i heard a man say the other day you know he was he was standing in the he wasn't standing in the temple saying come to me but he was out seeking the people is that right and as christians you know many times we uh you know i i've said it before but you know we see somebody come in here ill dressed and and maybe not right with the lord and we all get nervous how dare they come in here but where else do you want them to go is that right you know there's nothing there's no truth out anywhere else they need to be here and they need to hear the word of god and it shouldn't upset you when somebody comes to church that's maybe not on your standard or on your level but god if if they're being called to this god will do something for them is that right we don't need a bunch of stiff neck message people judging everybody but they're not letting anybody into heaven because it's not your decision anyway if they get in if it was your decision no one would make it it's god's decision it's he who called and so he's the one that has to receive them is that right do you love the lord this morning so we see that when god calls somebody he doesn't change them before they get there but once they get there once they meet him then they're changed amen and so we see gideon begins to look at himself and he begins to say you know my family's poor manas and i'm the least of my father's house and you know you begin to look at david and how god chose david and and you see samuel even went down there and you look and you know even david's own father whenever samuel come and said bring all your sons david's father jesse was so convinced that it wasn't david he said i'm not even going to get david it can't be david and you look down through time and you see people like there's no way this person can be saved there's no way this person can do anything for the lord but if god gets a hold of him it's not the vessel that he's in it's what it's it's what god is in that vessel is that right so we see that even even jesse didn't bring forth david because he's like no there's no way this could be the one and and you know samuel comes down and says well is there anybody else is there is there is there any more and then they they go and get david and and and we find out that's the one that god had chose is that right you look at jericho he come to a prostitute to save to or that lineage had to come through rahab is that right and we see that when joshua or when the spies come over they went to rahab which was a prostitute and god saved her out of the whole city of jericho so it doesn't always make sense the way that god goes it doesn't always make sense the way that the route that god chooses it's not like a gps to where it's just the shortest route or the lowest mileage route god chooses the way that his seed line needs to go god only goes where he is welcome so if you wonder why god's not in your life god's not in your home it's because you have not welcomed him into your life or into your home you can get the best minister up here or the worst minister up here but when you leave the church your salvation your life your spiritual life your spiritual your spiritual faith level is on you it's not on us amen now and the lord said in verse 16 and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man so we see that the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and you know moses kind of had this same situation where god called moses in the desert and he said how can i go i can't speak i can't do this and all that god said was to him was what is in thy hand and he had that rod and and you know with with that god took moses a man who couldn't speak a man who would who had maybe had a bad past or been hiding in the desert and god delivered israel through that man not because of moses ability but because of god's ability brother branham says in the evidence of a resurrection in 1950 1958 he says come in and abide with us he's speaking on the road to emmaus sorry he's speaking on the road to emmaus and they ask him coming in about with us and he says oh i couldn't ask for him to come in i've been a drunkard i've been a gambler brother brown says i don't care what you are ask him and you find out he will come on your invitation he's never turned one down he never will turn one down he's longing and trying to get into the heart you say i've been a street harlot i don't care what you've been god is trying to work his way into your heart just say come in lord and abide with me and so we see that you know you look down through the scripture when he was invited to i can't remember the names how the name of the house where um the woman came and washed his feet but he was invited to that house is that right and we see that that was a religious person of that day i would call them the staunch message person of the day not a message believer but a message person and see jesus still went is that right but they didn't want jesus to come in they just invited him because of ulterior motives and you see the woman that come in and washed his feet he was able to associate with that woman because she wanted jesus in her life is that right so if you have a need you have to call unto him and and brother bam says he's more anxious to give you the holy ghost than you are to receive it now we see here that after after gideon is called he's given a commandment and i'm going to skip on down to verse 25 in judges chapter 6 and verse 25 but you see once he's called he's given a commandment as to what to do but we see in verse 16 he says the lord said to him surely i will be with thee and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man so how many of you believe that the lord is with you today right and so we still are nervous we're still um sometimes we can get in under the spirit of this age where this nervousness reigns and or where this nervousness rules and we don't know what all is going on but i can say this if the lord be with us then who can be against us is that right i believe the scripture says that god's word will not return unto him void but it will accomplish that which he sent it to and we are the spiritual word of god and this day is that right so judges 6 and verse 25 and it came to pass that same night that the lord said unto him take thy father's young bullock even the second bullock of seven years old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath cut down the and and cut down the grove that is by it so pretty much god comes in he says the first thing we've got to do is get rid of satan so that god can come in right and so i'm of course typifying this to today but but god can't come in and abide with other things so we've got to first clean ourselves out then the lord can come in and take control in our lives is that right now after rahab was saved from jericho she could no longer continue on in prostitution right she had to be changed from that moment on do you believe that so us as believers once once the lord comes in and changes our lives we're we you know sanctification justification all the way through we're filled with the holy ghost we can no longer partake of those things it doesn't mean we're not going to make mistakes it doesn't mean we're not going to trip and stumble and do these things but we have founded ourselves in jesus christ and we do not ever question we don't we don't ever look at the messenger say is this true is this true or is the bible true no we believe it because faith is our foundation now we see that in judges 6 and 26 it says and build an altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock and i like it you know how he wanted them to tear down the altar of bell which i'm assuming was a really nice altar you know they typically to other gods the altars were very nice but but god didn't want any worship off of that altar he wanted his own altar is that right so you can't go and worship under the wrong altar cain had a very good altar as we spoke last week and and maybe we've seen that abel's altar wasn't wasn't the best or whatever but but but abel came with the right sacrifice is that right so we see that he told gideon he says tear down the old altar of baal and then build a new altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bullock of a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down then gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the lord said unto him so it was because he feared his father's household and the men in the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by night and so brother braham says here in jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever in 1956 he says you have to be in love with the author to be able to read between the lines because god promised and he said it and he had hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent that would be able to reveal it to babes as such as would learn you know the scripture don't you he said and so we want you it says it doesn't take a degree in theology it doesn't take some ba or dd or he says the only thing it takes is a humble heart surrendered to him and that's what does it so we see that maybe gideon couldn't explain everything that the angel of the lord was telling him but he followed the orders the angel of the lord he did what god asked him to do and the men of the city they wanted to kill him but god but gideon's father said let belle defend himself and so you know today we look at that and and many people maybe cry out against the message or when they leave it when they leave the message you know they begin to crowd against it and and you see the baptist maybe leave a baptist church and they don't cry out against the baptist they just go somewhere else and i think it's crazy how when message people leave they try to cry out against the message is that right but i would like to see any other religion or any other belief produce the life that this message has produced in this day you won't find it anywhere i don't care what religion you look at there's nothing that can produce a life that is this close to jesus christ in this day as the message of the hour in the scripture is that right do you believe that and how faithful and thankful as christians we ought to be that we've been given first class first view to this message that god called us to this and that god has given us the ability to see not without not with our eyes or not with our intellect but with our hearts to believe that what he has said is true you know i can i can try to tell my kids to believe me and and trust me and and even as children you know sometimes they'll trust you unconditionally but sometimes you have to build their trust on certain things is that right you know sometimes your kids will tell you the truth and maybe they're too young you know you got your young kid and and they may be you know holding the broken thing that you asked them if they broke and they'll tell you no i didn't break it and there's no one else around and you see that you know it's so funny we have to teach kids to share but we don't have to teach them to fight we have to teach them to be nice we don't teach them to be mean all right you know i kind of wonder you know this morning my little girl and paxton were fighting over a cinnamon roll there's other cinnamon rolls on the cabinet but she wanted the one that he had and it's really funny that how human nature how how that it comes down through and you can see how human nature affects from from generation to generation but but that spiritual that christ-like nature has to come and control that human nature is that right when we receive the holy ghost we can no longer say well my family had a bad temper so i can have a bad temper just because they did and it's like people are like well this is my card to have a bad timber because my grandpa had a bad temper so brother branham said you know it's passed down but but you've got to read into the message a little bit more that we've been given the holy ghost which overcomes that human nature is that right do you believe the lord this morning and so we see that now gideon is going and i'm going to skip on down to judges in verse 33 and chapter 6 and verse 33 if we could just for a few moments and you know you look at your life many times and you kind of wonder why you're going through the things you're you're going through and i always go back to to john and whoever this is for you kind of wonder about the decisions that you've made and i wonder you know why has this happened and why is this befalling me and why is all this going on i always go back to john chapter nine and it's one of the probably one of the most uh to me one of the most things that's helped me in scripture as far as looking looking back and seeing him you know uh jesus and his disciples are walking through and they come upon a blind man and he's sitting at the gate and the disciples ask jesus a simple question they say you know why was it and he was blind from birth you know the story and they say you know why was this man blind from birth was it because he sinned or because his parents sin and so jesus said is neither but that the works of god would be made manifest in his life and so you look at that story and and the the young man was was blind at birth just so god could be manifested in his life and so many times you maybe can't explain why your family why you're going through what you're going through but i would always take it back to john chapter 9 and saying so that the works of god can be made manifest in this day through my life amen so whoever that was for whatever you're going through this morning maybe you've been questioned on the way to church you've been wondering why am i going through this why is this but follow me why is this happening to me so that the works of god if you're a believer it's because the works of god need to be made manifest through your life amen judges 6 and verse 33 and he says then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the east gathered together and went over and pitched in the valley of jezreel but the spirit of the lord came upon getting and he blew a trumpet and abuser was gathered after him and they he sent messengers all through manasseh and were all gathered after him and he sent messengers into asher and zebulun and and fatili and they came up to meet him and so we see that now he's sending out a message a message is going forth come and fight so they're finally they're gaining strength you see that from what gideon had done to the altar of bell they're now kind of taking strength so gideon sends out a message and we go into judges in verse 7 2 and the lord said in the beginning the people and we know that there was a great army that come up and i i know i'm skipping down through this but you need to go read judges six and seven and you can kind of do that this afternoon and and so we see that gideon had done this then a great and mighty army had came it still wasn't as as great as the enemy's army but it was it was more than what they thought they would get you know it was like well you know we can we can maybe have a shot at this well if not we're gonna at least put a den in them right and you know sometimes you know you you feel really good you know i'm coaching a little league baseball team right now and and mattie's on the team and you know i'm not a very competitive i'm competitive with myself but i'm not competitive with other people and if if you don't like sports analogies or sports i'm very sorry but i'm about to talk about it for a few minutes and you look and you know we have a we have a young team and and you know whenever they call the coaches i didn't want to coach but they didn't have anybody else so they're like you know i was like runner up runner up runner up you know set fourth string or so and you know i was like well the kids do need to be outside at least we can show them how to play and move and run around and do this and and so i agreed to do it and you know we got the team and you know last year because of covert a lot of players come out that never played baseball before right and so you know as message people sometimes we we see a new convert we just expect them to all of a sudden know everything about the message and we judge them by that well you you're too young to understand this and we treat them differently i think that's a hundred percent wrong amen and so we look at then so i get this team and you know there's kids taking plastic off of gloves kids wearing it on the wrong hand and you know we had one kid batting right hand 90 of the season just to find out oh he's left-handed you know and he walks up to the plate and he always had his hands backward i'm like what did come on i was like come on man turn him around and then all of a sudden he got up and he went to the left side of the plate i was like you know what try it you know you ain't hitting it the other way and he hits it so you see that sometimes we we try to fit people to what we think they should be and so we see new people coming to the message like well this is what group you have to associate this is what you have to be and there's only one thing that we have to be and that's christians is that right we ought to be able to associate with anybody in the message no matter you know what what part or what church they go to we ought to be able to associate any person in the message around the word of god now we may not agree on everything me and brother me and brother joel may not agree on everything but we still have to be able to ride in the same boat we're going in the same rapture to meet the same lord we've got to be able to get along is that right christ has to mean more than what brother joel believes or what i believe it has to mean more that i got to love my brother because that's what god told me to do and he said if i don't have love then i'm not his and so we see we look at this and you know we get this team and and i know we're going to be one of the worst teams and it's it's no offense to the boys it's just they they haven't been trained they don't know about it but we're going to give it all and i'm like you know i'm not competitive we're just here to just have fun so that's what i told them we're just here to have fun we're just here to have a good time and learn and and do this and do that and so i realized that as i told them that we were just here to have fun that's all they heard so they weren't trying to win they were trying to just have fun and then i would be in the dugout yelling like quit picking flowers but to the outfield that was fun and coach you said just have fun and so you know i begin to learn i begin to talk with other coaches like you know i've got to quit saying that because they're fine with losing because they're having fun and you know i think as as as believers we can get accompanied we're okay with losing we lose one battle we're like well god said he'd forgive me i pick back up and the next battle we almost don't even try right and so we've got to we've got to come to a point where losing's not an option it's not okay and it's something that you can't get so beat up about that you won't do anything else you know i could i could go and preach the boys if you don't win season's over we're done and then they lose what happens well then they're over right and as as christians i believe it's been preached many times maybe definitely not here but back in the back in the older times you know i you know it was hellfire and brimstone when i was growing up you looked the wrong way you were going to hell i mean that's just the way it was and it's not that maybe that that preaching is wrong but i believe we've got to come as message believer we've got to be able to see what's in the word of god because we know brother brandon made mistakes is that right you know i mean that's just he said that i'm not saying that that's what he said and so we see that he was a man and we see many times as as believers we begin to think well then we get associated well on the other side where we cut part of a bigger church we're like well if we get a bigger church everything will go easier that's not right anytime you get more people together you can have more opinions more problems right now if they're all filled with the holy ghost you're going to have a mighty army so we'll get to that but we i begin to look at the boys and then you begin to identify the positions that they need to play because there's some that just can't play this or can't play that or can't do this and and you know you begin to you know see well this one knows what he's doing this one knows what they're not doing and and many times you know you you look and there's there's people that come into this message and we just automatically say well they can do this or they can do that and we don't let god position to replace them but we try to choose and try to put it all together and so we see that in judges chapter 6 and verse 33 then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of israel gathered together and went over and pitched in the valley of jezreel but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon he blew a trumpet and he called in this army is that right now we're going to skip on down to judges seven and verse two and the lord said in the gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into their hand lest israel vaunt themselves against me saying my own hand has saved me and so back to my little league team here when they win it's because they've tried really really hard right because they've given it their all they're not the team that's supposed to win but when they win they've given their all and you know many people and i was i was preaching that mindset of just have fun just have fun well they got associated with it's okay to lose and and you know it's it's okay to do this it's okay not to try and and i believe as christians we can never get that complacent mindset where you know maybe you're not sinning but maybe you're not going to where god needs you to go maybe you're not going just that little bit extra that god needs you to go is that right because the church needs help we need people in the church to assist we need people in the church to pray we need people in the church to do specific things and you can just sit there and say well i'm not doing anything wrong but you're complacent with just being okay just having fun because you're doing what god called you to do you're doing this you're doing that and then it begins to come to a point to where we're going to say well i'm doing this by myself because you don't need god because you can do that but remember god he brings you to the test to teach you the lesson he doesn't give you the lesson and then give you the test and so we see that they get that god knows israel he knows that if they go down there with too many people they're going to say hey we did this ourselves this is we we did this and so we see that that judges uh in verse seven between seven and uh chapter seven and verse seven we see that gideon comes down to the people says hey anybody who's afraid or fearful go ahead and go home all right he says that it's plain and simple cut and dry so those who were afraid and really didn't want to be there went home and i believe the army went down to around went from 32 000 to around 10 000 i believe is is what was left i think if i'm doing the math correctly there i think there's about 10 000 left and so we see that you know god doesn't deal in numbers i think this story ought to show people that god doesn't deal in numbers because if he wanted great numbers he would have kept the great numbers is that right but god likes to receive the glory and as christians we ought to be the type of people that likes to give god the glory so we see that gideon come down he said who's whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and so you know god doesn't want any chickens in his army is that right god doesn't want somebody that's afraid to to follow him into battle and you know it seemed kind of and i spoke on this several years ago but it seemed like that came through the message several years ago when everybody was questioning the cloud and questioning this and questioning that and and the bridge and you see that everybody was fearful and afraid what they do they left like oh man science is here we should be afraid and so what did they do they left because you look at their arm and they're like well we're 32 000 going against an army that can't be numbered scientifically they should not win now it's really funny to me that the little league team we've lost every time but once but every day or every game day the kids still show back up right and as message believers it doesn't matter how many times you've lost you still need to show up is that right you say well the church has went through this well you still need to show up oh well i don't like the ministers that's preaching this morning we tricked you we had stewart coming you put me out but hey you still got to show up is that right so we see that the lord even comes down and says hey the people are still yet too many because god needs to receive the glory is that right and as christians we ought to be willing or wanting god to receive the glory we ought to we we have the ability to praise him to worship him and we shouldn't let anybody else take away our ability to praise and worship our lord and so we see that the the the the angel lord spoke to gideon and said only those who drink a certain way can come in it had to be a certain way and i'm not going to go into that but in judges seven and seven and they went from ten thousand i believe to around three hundred and the lord said unto gideon by the three 300 men that lapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and let all other people who go every man into his place now we see here that the the angel lord these these other men these i guess it would be eleven thousand seven hundred or excuse me nine thousand seven hundred men they wanted to be there right they they wanted to be there and i always go back to you know looking at the scripture many are called but few were chosen is that right and these three hundred men were chosen of god they weren't they they they weren't the ones that just wanted to be there but they were the chosen of god so we see that you you look entire you look at life and you see many people want to believe this message and you see them come in occasionally they know it's the truth they cannot deny it because no matter how hard they look they cannot deny that this message is not real that it's not true that it's not lining with the scripture but still it almost seems that there's something about them they just can't go all the way but these 300 they were called to go all the way and we see that in in verse seven and deliver the midi night into thine hand and let all their people go every man to his place so the people took victuals in their hands and their trumpets and he sent the all the men rest of israel every man into his tent and retained those 300 men and the host of midian was beneath him in the valley and one thing that i've never really looked at or even thought about until this morning when i was reading is like man what did the rest of israel have to be thinking like man we got we got gideon 32 000 men and this sends every one of them home but 300. all right and sometimes we look at that and we're like man everything that we're going through everything that we've got going on and you really want to call this person to preach well i don't like the way they preach well sometimes we don't like the way you all worship right we don't like the way you all pull sometimes you pull ways we don't want to be pulled on and i don't mean that mean but we look at it and we're like man what is going on why has god done why is god choosing this one to do it and i think the main thing is as believers is once god chooses his man we've got to follow that right you know it's not where well god chooses this one well i didn't like you i'm going to leave and i'm going to go over here that's not what god called us to do he called us to get behind and follow that man into the rapture is that right now we're not following a man but that man is following christ is that right our pastor is following christ and we are following christ through him is that right now judges seven and eight and so we see that the host is below them in the valley verse nine and it came to pass the same night the lord said unto him arise and get thee down to the host for i delivered into thy hand and we see that gideon was beginning to he's always dealt with fear through this or you know he always you know he always asked god for a sign you know at first it was the uh i believe he actually put the the unleavened cakes and the and the kid upon the rock and the angel lord reached out and touched it and consumed it then he also wanted the dew to fall on the wool and not on the ground around it god did that and he said okay he said let me do it one more time i need one more sign he says now i want the dude to fall around on the ground and not on the not on the fleece right so god does it again and so time after time god is reassuring gideon reassuring gideon and you know it's not that we question god but we look back and we look at our testimonies and we see that those are those are testimonies that god has given us to look back at and say this is what god did for me here and if he did that he can do this now and so he sees you know i've delivered into thy hand in verse 10 but fear but if thou fear to go down go thou with thy servant or fear of thy servant to the host and thou shalt hear what they say and so verse 10 but if thou fear go down with pure thy thy servant to the host and so we see obviously gideon went down so he was still fearing a little bit right and they went down his servant onto the outside of the armed men that were in the host of the midianites and the amla kites and all the children of the east lay along the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number as by the sand by the sea sea side for a multitude now uh looking at this as believers in this day you know we look at this and we say man they're really outnumbered you have to wonder what's going through their head what's going through their minds but we always have to go back if god be for us who can be against us now and gideon was come and behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said behold i dreamed a dream and low a cake of barley tumbled into the host of midian and came into attendance and smote it that fell and overturned it and the tent lay long and his fellow answered and said there is this this is nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel for into his hand that god delivered midian and all the hosts and so we see that god had the angel lord had sent getting down there to hear the enemy testifying that they were afraid of gideon now i always you know i look at the scripture and brother branham says you know the the enemy is trembling right hell trembles when the believer hits his knees is that right all of hell begins to tremble and i think as believers we forget the power or the authority that we have and the power of jesus christ that when we pray mountains have to move is that right when we ask anything in jesus name it has to be given to us is that right and i believe as christians we kind of nulled that down and and you know what the scripture where it says the word is nigh thee we've kind of been like well you know well they have medicine and we have doctors nowadays and i'm not telling you not to take your medicine or not not telling you to do this or do that but i'm telling you our faith has kind of been weakened with the scientific age is that right where we say well well i can just do this or i can take this headache medicine we don't even ask god anymore to heal us because we have all these other routes but see gideon in israel they had no other way this was it if they didn't want the land to besiege them if they didn't want to to have everything taken away from them the rest of the life this is the only way that they could go and it was so that when gideon heard of them telling the dream the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned to the host of israel and said arise for the lord had delivered uh into your hand the host of midian i love that before the battle he begins to worship and i believe as christians and believers of jesus christ we we don't put enough on worship and i'm not obviously you see me i don't jump up and down i don't run around the church and it's not that that's wrong but it's just the way that i worship i may cry and i may sing and i may do these things where somebody else may shout or speak in tongues and that's what you're called to do but i believe we all have our form of worship that we have to worship the lord is that right i don't care how you worship if you scream or you shout or you lift your hands and cry as long as you're worshipping him that's what counts is that right and so we see that gideon but even before the battle began to worship the lord because he heard the testimony of his enemies and so as believers we can look through the bible and we can see the testimony we know how this story is going to end we ought to be able freely to worship jesus christ in verse 16 and he divided the 300 men into three companies he put a trumpet in every man's hand so we see that out of the 300 everybody had a part to play is that right gideon didn't come down and look at this one and look at that one and say hey you know what we've got these 275 we're good the rest of you can go home no god who god had chosen gideon used is that right so everybody had a part to play so if god has chosen you you have a part to play in the bride of jesus christ and he gave them with empty pictures and lamps with the pictures and he said to them look on me and do likewise and behold when i come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as i do so shall ye do when i blow with the trumpet and i and all that are with me then blow ye the trumpets also everyone on side of the camp and say the sword of the lord and of gideon so gideon and the the hundred men that were with him came to the outside of the camp beginning at the middle watch and they had but newly set the watch when they blew the trumpets and break the pictures that were in their hands and the three companies blew the trumpets and break the pitchers and held the lamps in their hands and the trumpets in the right hands to blow with all and they cried the sword of the lord and gideon so we see that that light just to just go here for a minute it was no good in the picture right it had to be broken to see that light is that right so we see many times as we are the vessels of as we are the vessels of god sometimes we have to be broken to let that light shine you know many times we don't know we we don't know how gideon would have been if he hadn't followed the will of the lord but when he followed the will of the lord him and 300 men overcame a mighty army is that right and the 300 blue trumpets the lord said every man's sword against this fellow even throughout all the hosts and the hosts fled and and and the border of the or tomorrow and to tabitha so we see that they continued to chase them after they defeated him now brother branham says and i know my redeemer lives he says and oh how that coincides this morning with faith the living faith of the living god in his church there's something in our hearts that speaks that there's a land beyond the river do you believe that he said i cannot put my finger on that land and neither can any any man but there's something within us that tells us the grave is not our goal he said in dust thou art or dust our eternance is not spoken of the soul he said there's something within us a fire that's burning a light that's been lit by god and no breeze can blow it out so i don't care what you've been through what you're going through currently there's there's a light on the inside of you if you've been filled with the holy ghost that nothing can blow it out he said there's no cold spells in the church there's no indifference amongst the people no persecution in the world that can blow out that flame that god has lit and i'll say this this morning christ has to mean more than whatever you're going through if you want to see it in a rapture he said for god's purpose that his torch light of freedom will burn until the coming of our lord he said and no powers can blow it out they will only make it burn brighter as they blow do you believe that this morning so christ has to mean more to you than your family than your friends than your pastor than your song leader than your colleagues then your work associates he has to mean more than anything you have to be solely focused on him that no matter what comes or what goes you keep your eyes focused on the prize isaiah 43 and 2 it says when thou passes through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee and so we see that god gives us the test before he gives us a lesson you look at the three hebrew children that were thrown into the fire they weren't told before they were thrown in that they weren't gonna burn but once they got in they realized they weren't on fire right and in laodicea we weren't told that we wouldn't fail we weren't told this or that but now that we realize we've got that holy ghost on the inside he hasn't got us yet and he's not going to be able to overcome us amen the same spirit that was in jesus is now in you and i and it overcomes satan in that day and it will overcome satan in this day amen psalms 138 and 7 it says though i walk in the midst of trouble that will revive me you know you i don't know if you've ever seen anybody give cpr before but you know they somebody that's drowning or somebody that's been in an accident or something they can revive them through cpr they weren't completely dead but they can revive them through cpr and it says you know though i walk in the midst of trouble that will revive me and many times we feel like it's over we feel like we we can't go any further but the lord comes and revives us he says thou shalt stretch forth on hand the wrath of my enemies and thy right hand shall save me the lord will perfect that which concerneth me man i love that the lord will perfect that which concerneth me that means if it's even to deal with you in your life the lord will perfect it whatever is going on you say well god doesn't deal in work or doesn't deal with this yes he does if it concerns you and your life as a believer god deals with it he said well god doesn't look at my job or my bank account if it concerns you god will perfect it if you'll let him is that right you say well it's always been like this my family's the poorest my i'm the least in my family but if it concerns you and you're a child of god god will perfect it he said thy mercy o lord endureth forever forsake not the works of thine own hands and we know that he is the potter and we are the clay is that right read this just as i come to a close just here in a few moments and brother madam says he says in exposition of the seven church jesus it's written he says every time the lord uses those words fear not there's an engagement at hand which involves great danger suffering and deprivation he says no he does not say in a blunt current manner tribulation is coming he said that would frighten one he says but like a mother who's about to turn out the light gently says to her child lest he be frightened now don't be afraid for the light will go out and it'll be dark but remember i'm here with you he says so he says don't be afraid of what man or what he can do to you he says i am with you my grace is sufficient for you when you pass through the waters they will not overflow you not even death are you defeated you are more than conquerors and i love that how he compares it to a mom that's about to turn out the light he says no matter if you can't see no matter the light goes dim i am here with you and that's what matters is that christ is here with us do you believe that brother brahman says as i was with moses in 51 it says let him that is weak say i am strong and how many times how many times we've tried to do that in our life and it seems almost almost ludicrous for us to say that but when we say when we're weak we say i am strong he said you're just saying in your heart now that i am strong he says i've accepted jesus as my healer and never have a negative testimony anymore he said just believe it and i've told you all of my my i like to write things down and i've tried this not to be negative for a full day and man is it difficult especially if you work with other human beings if you're married it's difficult if you have kids it's difficult if you go to church it's difficult but god called us to overcome the difficult things is that right never ever have a negative testimony anymore when you feel like going up to that person at church and tell them everything that's wrong with you instead of that stop think for a moment and go tell them everything that you got good going on in your life and if you speak more good things god will give you more good things is that right so he said just believe it god is under obligation he says jesus christ is sitting at the right hand of the father to accept you he's sitting there as the high priest of your confession to make good before the father anything that he died for so we have an intercessor do you believe that amen do you love the lord this evening and you know a long time ago i think gabe said in here and i had filled up two jars of dirt and i put a seed in one of them and i had gabe come up and pick which one the seed was in and i don't know if you remember this this was years ago and you know what gabe couldn't figure out which one the seed was in shame on him but just like every other message person he tried i'm going to come home on this one right we look at this when we say no there's no seed there oh this one yeah they they got it oh man they can sing play the instrument while they sing they got it right you know but there's a funny thing there's only one person that can see that seed and guess who it's not us all right we say well my children have been gone for years that doesn't matter look at the rich or look at the prodigal son how bad he got right you look at rahab i'm sure rahab's parents weren't like oh yeah the god of israel is going to choose rahab right and then you look at your own self well and this is where it really really comes home to to us as believers well god wouldn't choose me why not and and one thing i've always went back to i've had young people come to me when i when i dealt with the youth a lot back in the day and you know they were like well i i feel like you know the enemy's tricking me or or or or this is happening or this is happening i'm like you know do you have a pull in your heart to serve god so i can promise you one thing satan ain't going to put that there the world ain't going to put that there human nature ain't going to put that there if you've got a calling on your life that's a deep calling to the deep if you've got something going on the inside of you where you're crying out like i want more i want more of god or i know that maybe i maybe i haven't been able to live it yet but there's something on the inside of me that's crying out because i know this is the truth that's god on the inside calling that seed that's not just happenstance that this is happening but but but that's actually god calling on that life and so we see that whenever we try to look at believers or we try to look at this one or that one it doesn't mean if they even go astray for a time that doesn't mean that that seeds not in there it just hasn't been quickened yet is that right so as believers we shouldn't shut them down whenever they come and go and come and go one day they're going to get it and god's going to get a hold of them and they can't leave anymore amen we see here we look tonight or we look this morning you know they may look the same those jars of dirt i had identical jars they may look the same they may feel the same but on the inside is a total different story do you believe that now ephesians 2 and verse 5 here if we could look just for a moment ephesians 2 and verse 5 down through 10 it says even when we were dead in sins hath he quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved not by works but by grace and he hath raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus and so i like that we've been raised to sit with christ jesus we're not above christ we're not below him we're sitting with jesus christ and we're not above one another or below one another we're equally setting with him that in ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace you are saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them so we see that it's not of works it's not of this or of that but it's by grace we are saved and there's nothing you and i can do to mess it up jesus already paid the price all we have to do is trust and believe in him is that right now brother branham says he says hold this carefully in mind now we take the next step redeem means to buy back to restore to the original owner god it said by his death and shed his blood brought back his own excuse me bought back his own he bought back the spoken word seed bride he said my sheep hear my voice and word they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog that turned into a sheep he said that's impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there is no change in species so you look at the prodigal son out in the pig pen he wasn't a pig in a pig pen he was a sheep in the pig pen is that right he was the son even when he was out in the world but that seed had yet to be quicker and he says as we were in the thoughts of god and then to be expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are the sons of god we heard his voice we cried out as he did the prodigal son save me o my father i am returning to thee do you believe that this morning you know it amazes me you know the the rich young ruler you know he went away sad but you know jesus even knowing what he knew wanted him to be saved wanted him to accept he wanted him to sell all he had and give to the poor he he wanted him to come and he still went away now as believers that ought to show us whenever we're trying to maybe lead somebody even if they go away we do not hate them when they go away we still love them and still try to be an example in this day titus chapter three and verse three and then i'll just have one more scripture and then a quote and we'll go ahead and widen this down and for we ourselves also are sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving diverse lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful or hating one another but after the kindness and love of god our savior toward men appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing and regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost which he shed on us abundantly through christ jesus our savior so once we were regenerated we no longer wanted wanted to hate one another or do this to one another or be hateful or have environmentalists right and so we see that when christ comes on the scene everything changes john 16 33 these things have i spoken unto you that you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world so we see that no matter what we're going through no matter what we face jesus has already overcome the world so anything that we face in the world he's already overcome and as that same spirit dwells in you and i we will do the same thing he did and overcome the world now this is just where i kind of gathered my thought from this morning because christ has to mean more and i begin to think about that and and christ has to mean more and and to me in this day you know what is more we're in a consumer age where where we just want more we just want to consume and consume and consume but but brother brahm says in a hidden life in 55 he says have you ever come to the place in life where christ meant more to you than all the arguing arguing you could ever do about your church all right you know there's a lot of things we can say that really don't need to be said right i i if anybody in here you're married there's a lot of things husbands can say that don't need to be said that they could go without right we got to throw in that last little throwing that last little thing or or vice versa but we've got to come to a point where christ means more than than how the pastor preaches or how the pews are or how the bathrooms are or how the parking lot is or how how this one sings or how this one does christ has got to come more than all of those things he said has christ ever meant to more to you than all the world it's got to come more than our social status more than how maybe the the minister goes out to eat with this one or the the fellowship hall groups have this one or this one has this one and christ has got to mean more to where none of that stuff matters he says yeah i don't mean an emotional mental workup i mean the depths of your heart that something's settled in there that something's taken place that you don't know how it how it come but you're hit away your whole whole motive is to serve jesus christ and i love that he says you don't know how it come but one day you just wake up and you're like man none of this stuff matters anymore but this matters and once you get the holy ghost that's the way it's going to be you wake up one day and then you you just all of a sudden you're like man you know what i used to worry about don't worry me anymore this is what matters have you come to the place where you don't care what anyone says man we got to get there this is not not not to go out and act smart but till the love of god is so anchored into you you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of god love for everybody flowing free from every everywhere he says what a place to live that's the hidden place that's the place we've got to come to my brethren that's the place where god reveals his secret things that's the place where god does the placing and calling he says do you get what i mean and i want to just end it tonight christ has got to mean more than whatever you're dealing with this morning whatever you're going through whatever situation you've been given christ has got to mean more than all of that it doesn't matter if it's sin it doesn't matter if it's just if it's just just just sitting there and just going through the motions christ has got to mean more than anything you're going through if you want to make it do you believe that this morning even if we could have the musicians come at this time and you look at gideon and how he he come and christ or you see that the angel lord what what god was doing it had to mean more to him than remaining at the altar of bell then hiding out behind the wine press press threshing the wheat it had to mean more than his father's name in the town or had to be more than he was the least of these or his family was the poorest and when it finally meant more he was able to go and follow the lord to conquer the enemy do you believe that amen do you love the lord this morning i mean maybe if they'll just play something softly as we just bow our heads as we just go to the lord in prayer dear lord we just come before you this morning and we pray that something was said to your children that would just be a blessing to them and just encouragement along the way we just we just love you and thank you for coming and speaking to your heart to our hearts this morning lord i know my heart was blessed just just studying on this little thought this morning reading through the scriptures god i pray just give us strength for the journey lord that is to come lord we pray for our church body here lord that we would just get so entangled in the holy ghost that lord the enemy just wouldn't know what to do and god i pray for our pastor let me just continue to bless him and just lead him and guide him in the scriptures but i pray for the the people here this morning lord that we would just completely sell our lives out to you and follow you to the rapture [Music] lord for those that been struggling with sickness lord i pray just send healing power to them this morning lord i pray just anchored in their hearts with faith lord that they believe and ask anything in your name it shall be given to them lord not it not a conventional healing lord that would take a process of time but lord a miracle that they would just stand up lord this morning and be completely made whole god we thank you for giving us the the word sending your prophet to to reveal these things and restore back all those loose ends lord i pray just bless us as we go through our work week coming up lord for the service coming back wednesday i pray lord just great and mighty things will be spoken and whether we just take our faith just higher and higher
