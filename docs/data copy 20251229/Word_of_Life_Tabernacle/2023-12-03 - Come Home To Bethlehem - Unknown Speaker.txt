glad to be in the house of the Lord amen see each and every one of you I see uh sister Fritz made it this morning she's uh uh turning 90 this week I think happy birthday sister Fritz God bless you I uh appreciate our elders whenever they can make it to the house of the Lord because you don't know how many times I think it's precious to them you don't know how many more times that you be able to do that and but that's true of all of us we ought to take this opportunity take it seriously Lord speak to me today yes just help me I I that's what I my prayer is when I get up here on a Sunday morning or a Sunday Lord help me I want to I want to know something that'll feed my soul amen that'll help me make it through the week because we need him we can't make it without him Ruth chapter 1 and verse one now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sour in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was IMC and the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons Maan and chilon Ides of Beth beem Judah and they came into the country of Moab and continued there and IMC Naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of the one was orpa the name of the other Ruth and they dwelt there about 10 years and Maan and chilion died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might returned from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters-in-law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah I want to title this this morning come home to Bethlehem pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated when the going got rough in Israel IMC had a decision to make and you couldn't blame him for doing what he did because he did what was best for his family or so he thought in going down into uh Moab because the land there was more fertile and the land of uh if you if you know anything about the Middle East the land of Israel is different from many other nations countries around there because the land of Israel is dependent on water from rain and many of those countries and those arid regions are dependent on Rivers major rivers but the Jordan River really isn't that big of a river and so they're they're dependent on rain uh they were especially at that time dependent on rain so if there was a famine if there was a lack of rain there would be a lack of crops there would be a lack of bread and it would last sometimes for many years and and so we find that he made a a good decision for his family uh but yet or or or so it would seem at the time and yet we know it was the wrong decision because he died and his his two sons died and and it was just the grace of God and yet sometimes I think God allows us to make wrong decisions because ultimately he sees farther down the road than we do and you say Lord why didn't you prevent me from doing that and why didn't you keep me from uh from from being stupid in that way if if I could just put it in a way that we would put it and yet he can see Logan much farther than we can see him he knew that you would make that decision but he also knew what he had planned for you in the future and he knew what he had planned for the church in the future and he knew what he had planned for your family in the future you believe he's got everything in control today everything is in his control so we should never get too upset about the the decisions that people make and yet and yet we know that there's a right thing to do and a wrong thing to do and the right thing to do is to be in Bethlehem to be in the land that you were planted in now the Bible says that that IMC was he was of Bethlehem Judah and what that means is that he was born there his family was born there that this was a place that had been divided when Joshua divided the land between the 12 tribes of Israel Joshua divided a certain portion to Judah and and that portion then there was a portion that was given to Caleb's family and from that portion that was given to Caleb's family there was a portion that was settled by Rahab and her husband salmon and the Bible tells us that salmon was the founder of Bethlehem it calls him the father of Bethlehem and so the land was allocated to a certain tribe and a certain family within that tribe and we know that in the scripture title could never completely pass from that family Leviticus 2 523 let's look at it for a moment he said the land shall not be sold forever the that's why they're having trouble in Israel right now because they had a possession that was given to them and they come back to the land and the people that were there didn't like it but he said the land shall not be sold forever yeah and so he says for the land is mine for you are strangers and sojourners with me and in all the land of your possession you shall Grant a Redemption for the land so he's telling you you could you could lose the benefits of the land for a time but you can't lose the land itself oh that gives me great confidence today because you might lose the benefits of being a Christian if you do something that you shouldn't do you might lose the benefits of being a Believer because there are great benefits to doing what God said you might lose that benefit for a while but you can never lose the land come on oh my the land cannot be lost it cannot be sold not even by our own stupidity not even by our own our own malevolence not even by saying well I'm you might have determined in your heart I'm leaving I'm going out I'm never going to listen to the word again I'll never listen to a prophet again I'll never be a part of that message cult again you might have determined that but if you were born in the land you're of that land you'll come back to that land yes sir you got to come back to that land that gives me great hope for those sister Stephanie who have went out and have to come back they must come back cuz you were born in this land you got to come back to this land and I think of brother Daniel's on call today and different ones that have come and and others I believe there's many more that are coming back why they were born in this land I'm not talking about a natural birth but they were Gods before the foundation of the earth and they're are they're still gods they always will be gods and they've got to come home at some point in their life to the word they've got to come back to the word hallelujah do you love him this morning the land could not be forever lost it was redeemable always and let me speak that to you today and I don't care what you've done or what you might some of you young people beat yourself up because you make mistakes you're redeemable always redeemable always it it belongs to you that's you're the portion of the people of the earth that God has chosen from before the foundation of the earth you are redeemable always right now that doesn't mean that the enemy surrounding Bethlehem will not attempt to take it by force yeah it doesn't mean that there won't be a battle but it means if you'll stay in the land and defend the land and come home to the land it's yours that's it belongs to you and the benefits and blessings of staying there belong to you if you'll stay in it if you'll defend it if you'll come back to it when you leave well that land belongs to you and God will help you keep it amen good yes in Moab IMC is dependent on his own works and Moab is dependent I tell you what the the the dealings of God may seem to be harsh in my life but but there I would much rather submit myself to the dealings of God even though they may be harsh than submit than go out and try to do it on my own right we we find that in David when the lord gave him a choice he said there's three different things that can happen and and which one do you want and and the final one was a plague that God the angel of God would come in and bring a plague and and David chose that one because he chose to throw himself in the hands of a merciful god and after a short span of time many people died after a short span of time the plague was lifted because he knew if it was in God's hands everything would be okay church I wish we'd put things in God's hands if you put it in God's hands every you put your job in God's hands everything's going to be okay put your marriage in God's hands everything's going to be okay if you try to do it by yourself you're just going to mess it up stay in the land that's good and the land was was theirs but they had to defend it and the same thing is true of our land which is all the promises of God for our day all the promises of God Luther had justification Wesley had sanctification we have all of it amen the Pentecostals had the restoration of the gifts we have all of it it all belongs to us and so we've got to defend all of the message of the hour that's why I don't like to see people get off on a tangent and only preach one little thing or one little part of it let me preach all of it let me let me grab a hold of all of it let me live all of it now good Bethlehem means the house of God's bread and immc being born in Bethlehem would give him certain rights and responsibilities as a bethlehemite that's good it means Not only was it his right to stay in the land but his responsibility to stay in the land that's good and he he he didn't keep his responsibility but he still had his right and he even died and was able to come back but Naomi was able to come back his family still benefited because of who he was even though he personally died in Moab now Bethlehem again means House of God's bread we know that Christ was born in Bethlehem and he became God's house of eternal life bread he is the bread of life he is our Bethlehem Christ is our Bethlehem and Jesus said this when he was on the earth he said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst he had to go through the process of death to become bread just like a plant has to die for you to eat it right or it should but even if you you just cut it off and don't cook it I like my plants cooked if I'm going to eat plants I want it to be coated in in something and cooked come on Amen I'm glad I got some help on that but if you're going to eat plants you want them to be yellow right you want them be all the all the all the vitamins cooked out of them so they taste good but but now Jesus had to go through that process he he was God's he was God's plant if we could say it that way but he he was God's tree but he had to die he had to be cut off he had to die so that he could be made bread he was God's wheat and he had to be he had to be cut down so he could become bread for you and I he had to die to become bread brother Brandon said you can only live by natural substance he said then if you can only live by natural by dead substance something had to die so you can live natural how much more did something have to die so you can live eternally Christ died that we might live eternally aren't you glad for that today Christ died so that we might live eternally and he become the house of God's eternal life bread that we catch I love this freshly every hour of the day coming down from God out of heaven like the Mana did in the Old Testament coming down from God out of heaven in the form of the Holy Spirit feeds our hungry Souls as we sit together in Heavenly places he is our Bethlehem all right then he said all true believing sons of God are born in Bethlehem with him oh my there's the difference there's the difference in the one that that makes it in the one that doesn't you got to be born in Bethlehem if you're born in Bethlehem you'll come back to Bethlehem he but they're born in God's Bethlehem he said if Christ had to become the bread of life to be born in Bethlehem which is life's bread house and everyone of True Believers in Christ is born in Christ they are born in God's Bethlehem he said not only Jesus was born in Bethlehem he said I was born in Bethlehem you were born in Bethlehem how did you do it he he he was speaking in the rata in he said right here in Phoenix Arizona this morning in the remata you can be born again in God's Bethlehem House of Eternal bread life I say to you this morning right here in Hardy Arkansas in Word of Life Tabernacle you can be born again you can be born in Bethlehem today you can be born in Bethlehem if you've not been born you can be born into a place that you can never leave and you can and it's always yours said well I've always nothing's ever belonged to me I've always lived a life of seemed like everything's against me and and and I've lived this dark kind of existence but come home to Bethlehem there's something inside of you you wouldn't be in the house of God today if there wasn't something inside of you pulling you to Bethlehem you said I I just you don't understand the anxiety of my life you don't understand the trouble that's in my life come home to Bethlehem and you'll find a place where there's bread a place where there's something that'll satisfy your soul put the joy of God in your life come home to Bethlehem Hallelujah he said eat it and live forever oh if we could just cry that out brother Harvey if that could be the Cry of our heart today eat it and live forever Hardy Arkansas eat it and live forever wherever you live in the world eat it and live forever Hallelujah the said why little Bethlehem that's today why a bunch of little Holy Rollers why this that or the other the people don't know what it's all about but the spirit reveals it the word shows it it's the manifestation of God's word we have life through Christ and him alone our organizations our denominations our differences only separates us from God we have one access to God and that's through Jesus Christ there's not another way that we can come through in by no Priest No preacher no system or nothing else only Jesus Christ and him crucified he's God's bread of life and we are borned in him and if he is God's bread of life then he is Bethlehem and being born in Christ we are then God born in Bethlehem in Christ Jesus sitting together in Heavenly places eating of him eating of him who is he he's the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and when we can sit with one objective the word of God that's our objective in meeting together is the word of God that's why we put so much emphasis on the word it's our objective the word not the word for another day but the word for this day the word revealed by the prophet of Malachi 4 the word for our hour the opening of the word for our day the Seven Seals being open now we have a word that we can feed on the full seven course meal amen and he said we're eating of him in the beginning was the word the word was with God we can sit with one objective the word of God and feat upon that we are in God's spiritual Bethlehem eating God's spiritual bread and our souls punctuating every word that he spoke with an amen he said we enjoy this heavenly angel food when it says these signs shall follow them that believe the Creed or denomination says so it isn't so but the real man who's born in Bethlehem says amen The Works that I do shall you do also now some of those Works might surprise you maybe we'll talk about that tonight but the denomination says it's a bunch of workup emotion but the real Beth dweller says amen amen because he is satisfied that's angels's food if you abide in me and my words in you ask what you will it'll be done for you amen oh he said the high and prudent will never see it we hold so much to our traditions of the elders so much we have to pack carts and everything else to get in some Pulpit he said that ain't it you can get in God's Pulpit by humbling yourself that's still true today that's good advice for preachers you want to get in the Pulpit I'm not talking to ours here ours are are some of the the humblest preachers that I know is the ministers I have working with me here but I'll say this there's ministers across the country working to get in certain groups to try to get in the pulpits that's not how you get in the Pulpit you don't get in the Pulpit by a membership card you get In a Pulpit by humbling yourself com to the house of the bread of life Jesus Christ and live forever in his presence you want to be a a go a preacher that's worth something you want to be a preacher that can help somebody get into God's Bethlehem feed on the word of God come into the house of the bread of life Jesus Christ live forever in his presence and lifted up in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus feasting on the word that's God's Bethlehem come home to Bethlehem IMC left Bethlehem and I want you to understand today and maybe I'll get a little bit just doing what I do today and it's going to sound very much like me and but but it is me so it'll be all right you know there's certain things you stress on as a minister and there's certain things that you don't and and and I want to declare the whole word of God but these are things that that that I I just want to establish in your heart Bethlehem is not a church yeah right neither is it a pastor or a Ministry or even a prophet there's a spirit in the message today that if you're associated with certain Ministries or or churches I say there is there seems to be that that you're in the message if you're associated with a certain church and God forbid that that would ever be around us you're not in the message because you're associated with Word of Life Tabernacle right it's nonsense people say well if you leave then you're backsliding I it's nonsense I could say more about that but I want we're not a gang a cult or a denomination we're a body and we're not just a body among ourselves right we are a body here in the church but this is a local body but there's a the body itself is is wide it's it's far it stretches over the entire Earth and so when a person leaves I you know I want everyone and and we're not nobody's leaving nobody's thinking about leaving and nobody has left so just just just get that out of your mind I just want to lay this principle in I I want everyone to come here who wants to be here but a person who leaves this church should be treated just the same as when they were here there should be no difference in how we treat people and we want to establish that in our hearts today because we're here to help people and we can't help everybody so if you can get help somewhere else go get help somewhere else right maybe one day you can come back and return and and be with us maybe there'll be a day we can help you but if we can't help you go get go where you can get help and we should treat people the same whether they leave or whether they come and and brother brandom you know he he he treated people that way and I that's what I want to Aspire to yeah it hurts when people do things that are you feel like they will will hurt them but but listen we got to treat people the way Jesus would treat people and Jesus wasn't from Word of Life Tabernacle we want to believe he's here with us but he's also in every other church that preaches the gospel the message of the hour good preaching sometimes people leave for the wrong reasons and I'll say this they still they still are gods they were still born in Bethlehem and need to be treated as such brother brandom had some that did that they couldn't take correction on the gifts they wanted the gifts to be open in the church and brother brandham didn't want that and uh and brother brandham they they couldn't take correction on that and they left and you know someone leaving a prophet's Church you might look at that and say well you know you just forsook the messenger of the hour and brother Bram did have some things to say about them he he he calls them illegitimate children and he says this he said he tells about him he said I said just let it alone they're babies we can't judge it he said but watch when it really comes down to pin down to the word so it's not our job to correct everybody right but let's just in our church let's just do it the way a prophet said right that's all we can do but brother brandom he he said they're they're they're babies but watch when it really comes to pin down to the word sometimes I'll say this sometimes we need to get out of order but we do need to stay with the word brother BR said we need to get out of order long enough to get saved but we do need to stay with the word you understand so we we we can't judge other people on that now but these people left now brother Bron said now brother Junior Jackson had a right to disagree with that he wants his church and the people all want to speak with tongues and things in the audience that's brother Junior's troubles he says that's up to him but I love this he said but Junior Jackson believes this message the same as any of the rest of us does he's one of us brother Brandon is not telling a lie that's right right he's not saying that to make brother Junior feel good because brother junr wasn't there that night he's saying that because was wanted the people to treat the people that left a certain way and brother Junior uh brother junior he said believes the message the same as any the rest of us does and he said it's not a dead bird to go there Junior Jackson is a man of God that I love with all my heart and is not here tonight so I can really pour it on the way I want to he said and Don Ruddell I don't think Don's here tonight because they got church of their own can you imagine having church when brother Brandon was having church now just think about it for a minute if brother brandham was standing was in Cherokee Village having church I would dismiss and have church with brother brandom I'm serious about that we would want to hear what he had to say but Brother Don rutle didn't at times brother Junior Jackson didn't at times they had Church in fact brother Brandon went and preached for them and had church at the Tabernacle the same night so and we don't hardly understand understand that you said well they just didn't have a revelation well maybe but that's not what a prophet said about them brother Brown said he said Don's got church they have church of their own he said but I if I seen every person come to this Tabernacle walk out and go to Don rle or brother JT Parnell or any of these brothers here that's our brothers and fellow citizens of the Kingdom I'd be so happy I wouldn't know what to do I'd say Lord fill this one back up again let's pour it out and fill up another one the more souls we can see Born Into the kingdom of God the better let's fill them all up let's put our shoulder to the whe and do the very you say brother Ben you're you're you sound like paulana well I'd rather sound like that than than old grumpy face you know I I just amen I'd rather sound like paulana than Scrooge to use another literary character I don't want to be a scrooge I want to be I want to be somebody who can help people and if we can help people let's help people with everything that we got why don't we just do that with all of our heart you don't you don't because your family members move you don't uh you don't ostra I hope you don't hope you don't cut them off because they leave your area right you don't do that but you love them that much more and you make an effort to go see them we want to be like that don't we i' say Lord fill this one back up that's my prayer I'll say this and I we'll get back to our subject but are we edifying the body or are we building kingdoms here Paul says in Galatians 61 brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual somebody's got to be spiritual ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted yes they were wrong yes they did wrong but restore that one who did wrong you might do wrong one day and you might need a brother who's faithful a brother or a sister who loves you to step up on your behalf to pray for you to intercede for you you might need somebody to step into the Gap and pull you back into the house of God that considering thyself lest thou also be tempted so be careful what you associate with but love them with all of your heart the B said if the devil can keep us separated he's got us shooting at one another so he's got an open Target anywhere he wants to shoot what's the use of shooting we're shooting one another he could he can just sit back and relax if there ever what you know that war is such a strange thing if you look at at what's going on in Israel right now Israel and and Palestine we're funding both sides amen we're literally funding the Palestinians giving them money and Aid and then funding Israel that's never been done in the history of the world before and and you look at that and think how in the world can we expect anything but just more war more trouble more you know I say this maybe we ought to just let people work it out on their own but I'll say this when we support Israel we're supporting something that God established and yet and yet you look at the troubles around the world and and we just finan we we we gave Bin Laden weapons and then took us years to kill him right and so it's just it's not it's just terrible we don't want to be like that we don't want to think like that that's the way the kingdoms of this world think said one uh one demon that's over one country he'll get angry at another demon and they'll fight yeah you know demons fight each other that's right he said the the the demon that's over America will get will'll get angry and he'll fight over the demon that's over Russia because it's controlled by Satan yeah and each one has their own little little Spirit little little demonic power that that runs that place and and they begin to fight one one with another but that shouldn't be the people of God it shouldn't be the Churches of God we said what's the use of shooting we're shooting one another so we can just sit back and relax he said if I have found Grace in your sight through God you take my word for this brethren did did he find Grace in our sight he's a prophet of God he's the prophet for the age good now look you take my word for this he said if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong absolutely justly he said I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before God that's right God help me to live this word help me to come home to Bethlehem because Bethlehem is the word of God the bread of God let me come home to this is again Bethlehem is not a Church Bethlehem is the word Bethlehem is Christ let me come home to this to this truth yes he said don't mention that you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in a way of just as selfish and say well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder that means how could you do that if you disassociate from him the minute he does something wrong but you stand with his shoulder your shoulder to his shoulder stand in the presence of God our Father way of prayer should be made in the presence of God and say father here's my brother he justly he deserves punishment because he's done me evil and I don't see why he did it he said and then let God go talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through yeah I've never seen a man who had no excuse now that doesn't mean they should do it I've never seen a man who didn't have some reason Hitler had some reason was the devil got into him but look at how he was raised and the things that happened in his life there's always something and that doesn't excuse one ounce of what they did but there's some reason and he said if you'll get to talking to God God will reveal to you maybe how that person was raised or something about their life and maybe you'll begin to see maybe things you know but you haven't considered about the way that person come up or or or the way that they are and you'll say you know what maybe he talks all the time because of this that happened in his life maybe she maybe she uh is this kind of maybe she's suspicious like that because of the way that things have been done to her maybe she sits in church and and acts different than everybody else or he sits in church and Acts a little different than everybody else and he say well that person is weird that person is odd but you don't know what that person's been through you don't know what the background of that person is he said if you could ever get down to business with God and begin to pray and you'll see maybe what that man's been through the devil has Twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong he said before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man that's right you'll be sympathizing with that brother he said and when you get back down to Earth again you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand cuz you know what he's been through oh God it takes the spirit of God to empathize the way we should with our brothers and sisters it takes the Holy Spirit to do that brother Brown said you can't pray for somebody for healing unless you can sympathize with their sickness that's why God called men men who are living because we a man that gets up and preaches ought to be able to empathize with the audience he's preaching to that goes through the same things God didn't just call Rich preachers he didn't just call preachers who've always done everything right he didn't just call preachers who who who were perfect he didn't just call preachers who come from a certain part of the country but he called men from all over the world he called men with all kinds of different backgrounds why did he do that so they can speak life in a way that you can hear it and what I've been through helps me and I've finally come to that realization what I've been through in my life helps me Speak Life in a way you can hear it in Hardy Arkansas listen to me there's got to be we've got to remember God's doing that in our life right good he said you know what he's been through you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir even if he is a rank cner and what about a brother that's made a mistake though I say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he is wrong well if we will take him to the throne of God stand there shoulder toosh shoulder with our brother knowing he's a mortal and maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards oh my yeah yes that's good I want to get I want I just want us to get this real close sometimes we need to hear fast anointed preaching that gets us up out of our seats and sometimes we just need to soak in it a little bit what if how would I treat you if my attitude towards you might determine your Eternal destination young people you need to think about that how you treat one another talking to one another sir I know how message youth groups can get kids you need to think about that Elders we need to think about that what if the Eternal destination of the waitress at the restaurant that we frequent depends on our attitude towards them that's good preaching what is the Eternal destination of the person sitting next to you in the Pew or the person maybe that you don't talk to very much or you've never washed their feet or you really don't like them to even to see them take communion because you say well they've done this this and that what if their Eternal destination rest on your attitude towards them if you really believe what a prophet said if I really believe what a prophet said how would we treat people yeah good when we come back from the Throne of God he said we'll realize that we're everyone guilty see we're everyone guilty and we all need help one from the other and the best way to do is pray and and we must stand for truth I've got to as a pastor I'm in a position I've got to preach the word and I've got to tell you what what the word says I can't change it I wish I sometimes I wish I could for you but I can't do that I can't make an exception for my family for anybody else the word is the truth it's the truth no matter whether I say or somebody else I'm not not going to I can't cross that that's the whole reason why I'm here God help me if I ever cross that for favoritism but we treat people we don't treat people like objects yeah we don't treat people like numbers they're not pawns and our macav in games they're the purchase of God's blood that's good brother brand said I don't want to hurt feelings but I'm responsible for a message and the message is come out of this mess if asked you to come out where am I going to take you to I read this to you recently but it just fits right here he said I'd take you to the brandham Tabernacle it's as much fault as any of the rest of them but there's one place I can take you to where you're safe and protected from Death that's in Jesus Christ God's place of worship he said that's the place I'm introducing to you tonight where God put his name where he promised he would meet every person to come in there he would worship with him and feast with him that's in Christ not in no church we put way too much value on who is preaching in the PO open what church we go to we should love our church we should go to church but we'll do that because we love God he's not no church no Tabernacle but in Christ he is God's Tabernacle he is the place that God came into himself and dwelt in him this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in he is God's Tabernacle it should be easy to see the opening of the seventh sealen just let that soak in 1 Corinthians 3:5 who then is Paul and who is apollis but ministers but whom you believed even as the lord gave to every man I have planted a poish watered but God gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that WTH but God that giveth the increase and I want to say to you with all of my heart with all of my voice with everything I can I can muster out of my overweight body I want to be able to save you with all of my all of the life that I've got in me hear ye him hear you him I want to point like a prophet did in our day and pointed back to the cross and he said hear you him not your Methodist not your not your denomination not your Baptist not your little group around the message but here Christ not this church not this pastor but Christ that's good come home to Christ he is our bethle you say well I I haven't left maybe we didn't leave the Pew but maybe we wandered in our heart from the word that's good come home was a famine in Israel but the B said during the time of the judges when the first thing coming time when Israel got away from God when they did the water supply was withheld when people get away from God today the water supply is withheld all of blessings will be withheld yeah that doesn't mean that if you're in financial iial trouble that your the water is being withheld let me just deal with that well how does the water get up withheld today it's the presence of God it's the spiritual blessings of God in your life you can't get Revelation you can't seem to just cold and dry and dead yeah and it may God May deal with you in a financial way but the primary way he deals with us in this in this day is through spiritual blessings yeah amen the blessings are withheld when we get away from God and again don't let don't let a scare come into you say well if I get away from this church or this ministry or or if I mess up and and and in my life in some way and all that God's going to leave me you know he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you that's right Amen to get away from God is to get away from his presence to get away from the word which brings his presence and when you do that all other blessings will be withheld Naomi means Pleasant IMC was was her husband his name means worship Pleasant worship was her family they had a son meon that mean sickness and chilon meant weary gloomy sadness and that was the family and there come a famine in the land of Israel he said the first mistake a Jew ever makes is leave that land God gave them that land when Abraham was given that land God told him not to leave the land and he made a mistake when he went down into GR got in trouble the Jew is never to lead Palestine that's his lotted place and they had been drove out all over the world he said now they're returning back again don't you that's where the battle is it's back home come home to the Bethlehem when you come home there's going to be a battle when you get home but there's a battle worth fighting yes when you get home all right there's a there's a victory worth winning a victory you can win when you come home to Bethlehem yeah said they've been drove out all over the world now they're returning back again oh it's such a beautiful story we have here this morning they are returning back they're returning back back it explains a lot about the current situation in Israel now Moab we know is a type of organization they left the freedom of the word for an organization that promised food but it wasn't God's bread it was moabite Creeds there was a price to pay for that elmc died their two sons died I'll say this when you trust in a church instead of Christ elim worship dies yeah did you hear that this morning worship dies when you trust in something else instead of Christ that's right I know many people want Worship in their life now it can be a deceiving thing in the sense that there's some people there are people who can still worship and yet be living in sin and I'll say this that if you can do that today that's a scary place it's a scary place to be able to worship and live in an out andout sin because when you do that what you're doing is you've disassociated worship from the presence of God that's right because God is not with you when you're against the word and and he didn't brother B say he doesn't leave he goes to the Gable end of your soul right if you're a person that's filled with the Holy Ghost you can do things that are against the word but what what will he do he'll go to he'll he his his presence his in his imminent presence is not felt and that's how we know I need to check up that's right and we don't look you know we don't look to work our our elves up when we can't worship the answer is not to work ourselves into worship the answer is to see in our lives where is there a place examine ourselves where have I strayed from the word I can't the the presence of God seems like just not there anymore I can't touch him like I used to where if we' strayed from the word and usually sometimes God's withhold God withholds His blessings but usually we'll find some way that we've just given in yeah and that's where a Christian when they find that says Lord forgive me and then it's under the blood it's all over yes right now look when you trust in a church when you go to Moab instead of trusting in Christ when you trust in your own efforts instead of trusting God worship dies yeah that's right brother Brandon said that cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you have to do is recall the last move of the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians went to church prayed all night took the street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left their all dead churches and worshiped in homes or old store buildings they had reality but it wasn't too long a time until they began to get enough money to build fine new churches they put in a choir instead of singing unto God for themselves they put gowns on the choir they organized the movement and ran it by man they soon began to read books that weren't fit to read they let down the bars and goats came in and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone what was it worship died immc died in Moab yes God help us today the Cry Of Joy was gone the Blackness of Ashes is all about about all that is left we leave the word we lose our true worship we might shout dance speak in tongues but the connection is gone that's right oh God help me to stay in Bethlehem help me to come home to Bethlehem I'll say this if you want to keep worship alive stay in Bethlehem we know that every word of the Bible is breathed out by God I'll say this which one is more important than the other 2 Timothy 3:16 all scriptures given by inspiration of God it's literally expiration brother Bram said it's breathing out all scripture how much of it is it all of it it's profitable for Doctrine for reprove for correction for instruction and righteousness remember Eve misinterpreted one word and lost her worship when God come down in the the cool of the evening we talked about when in the time when she might get anxious and the Holy Spirit come down over that little couple and and met with them in the cool of the evening and Eve because she misinterpreted one word because the serpent that became her interpreter she lost her ability to worship there in the Garden of Eden come on Matthew 4:4 says that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and I say this most people I think especially most Christians they want to be able to worship they want to be able to to be free in the spirit they want to be able I think all of us can say that this morning I want to be able to be free I I want to be able I know there's some types of people that just sit there and cry you that that's the that's the most the loudest you'll ever be is completely silent and I'll say this that's there's some people are like that that's okay that's right that's all right we don't all have to be hollers and shouters and and stuff but but I'll say this that that there's got to be worshiped whatever that whatever that is to you whatever that whatever presses out of your heart you got to be able to know that God is near the church can't be just a formal experience it can't be just someplace you go and you sit here and act and are miserable for 30 minutes or an hour while the preacher preaches at you that can't be what church is about church has got to be an experience with God every servant you say well I had an experience one day every service ought to be a new refilling of the Holy Ghost it ought to be a new experience with God it's an experience with the word and the word is God yes yes but I find many people want relief from famine they want to be able to worship but they don't want to stay in the land or come home to it again the land is not this church the land is the word amen the church Christ today oh heavenly father will you please send Jesus to us will you please and when the Holy Spirit begins to move in oh oh we don't want that well you be oh we we won't have this man rule over us oh I don't want to hear that there were people who cried for Revival in this area cried for cried for a move of the spirit and then God moves and they're like oh that's Pentecost I cried for years for Revival among the young people cry for years for Revival and then when it happens they're like well that's nothing to that yeah right oh my my no my he said I couldn't accept that my denomination won't believe that he said then you don't want a messiah you don't want the anointing if God sent a messiah he'd be exactly word by word of the Bible exactly what he was at the first time yes so brother brandom introduces this idea with you to you and I've got eight minutes left so I'm going to try to hurry brother brandham introduces this idea of coping with the word how many of you ever heard brother brandham say that you got to cope with the word if you've listened to the message very much and you remember you can search it you go back and look at that cope or coping it was say you have to cope with the word you got to be able to cope with the word of your day to cope and to cope means to deal with effectively even through difficulty it means to contend or to wrestle with did you know that coping just doesn't mean to agree with but it means to contend with Amen to wrestle with yes and every one of us wrestle with the word in our lives now now listen to this he said when this takes place he said the thing you'll do then he's talking about a believer that gets that new birth you'll find out the spirit comes in you from the New Birth you'll believe and do everything that God says and his word is for you to do and everything the Bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen right and he said you'll not stop day and night until you receive it that's right he said and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit above everything you'll bear the fruit of the spirit you say well I speak with tongues you might do that and you might not will I shout you might do that you might not but there's one sure thing you will do you will bear the Fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace Faith longsuffering meekness gentleness patience he said your temper will not be in on tape I listen to it to make sure he goes that sounded awful your temper will not be like that he said Just remember when you got that oh my that poisons the holy spirit away from you when you get to a place you want to fuss with everybody you come along to there's something wrong when you get to a place where a minister will read from the Bible that it's wrong to do a certain thing just remember he said there's no Christianity there at all now he said by their fruits you shall know them that's what Jesus said he said if it's the word and God said so that spirit in you will cope yes it doesn't mean you'll like it that's right right I hope you're hearing me I know sometimes people get quiet cuz they're coping with it they're wrestling with it it doesn't mean you like to hear it but you got to cope with it why because it's not my word and that's why I try not to preach what my ideas I may some things that I preach being a human might be my opinion but you can take it back to the word and if you see that it's the word cope with it you got to wrestle with it said cope with the word because the word is life and spirit the genuine Holy Spirit Will cope with the word Jesus said my words are life and if you got eternal life and he is the word how can the word deny the word see what kind of a person would you make God that's one thing to know that you're a Christian when you can fully agree upon every word of God that's how brother Brand's definition different from many of ours we say Well they're a Christian they're a Christian because they they went to church they're a Christian because they listened to a tape they're a Christian because they believe in a prophet they're a Christian because they go to word to Life Tabernacle that's not what a prophet said he said you're a Christian because you fully agree upon every word you won't totally agree with me maybe but you fully agree with the Bible and the message of the hour is the light God shown on the Bible you can't disagree with a word Prophet come on and cope with the word you say well things in the message you don't understand absolutely but I just put up on the Shelf leave it there someday I'll understand it that's right I got to cope with it got to wrestle with it yeah the idea that this that God sent a prophet that was a real prophet but a true Prophet I got to wrestle with it yeah can't just cast it off well that's an opinion and and again if it go if it goes all the way through the word all the way through the message all the way through the Bible I got to cope with it right that's good amen he said you find yourself in love with your enemies there's a tough one in love usually don't fall in love with your enemies but that's why love is a choice uh someone told me one time a youth pastor and it it made sense he said you fall out of your truck into a mud puddle you don't fall in love you you you choose to love yes you may fall into like attraction but you don't fall in love oh my say well he's nothing but a Holy Roller you start to get oh he said be careful be careful when you really find yourself that you love him who your enemy that's right regardless of what they do you still love them you can go read on and it's your life where the gospel he said if your family fusses don't fuss with them that's right yeah amen right and all of those things don't argue with them I want to I want to challenge you this morning does your life cope with that and I know right now that some of us are pitchforking at some of those people who fuss a lot lot and pitchforking on that and that's good they need to cope with that but what do you need to cope with what do you need to wrestle with today I know there's a different style of ministry maybe than what you get all the time but but listen to me you got to cope with the word amen can you be like Jacob who wrestled with the word when it come by his way when he found he was there in a desperate situation and and Esau was coming for his life and he the word come by his way the word and at the off any body come by Jacob's way and when it come by his way Jacob grabbed a hold of it yeah and he said I will not let you go come on until you bless me yes and his Blessing come in the form of a new name and a limp yes to show that he's been with God I said God let me be blessed today the blessing may not come in the form I look at it as but he's going to give me a new identity of the word and he's going to give me a limp to show me I can't do it by myself can you wrestle like Jacob with the word until it changes you Jose 12:4 he said he had power over the angel and prevailed he wept and made supplication that's how you wrestle you wrestle with tears you wrestle in your soul wrestle with God he found him in bethl and there he spake with us oh my you imagine can you wrestle with it this morning can you wrestle with that thought can you wrestle with the thought of the message of the hour I don't just go to church cuz my parents do but I got to wrestle with the thought is this message right is this the word of God or is it not if it's the word of God let me sell out to it let me follow it with all of my heart with all of my life with everything I don't want to live halfway I don't want to be a Halfway Christian I want to wrestle with that word let me wrestle with it can you wrestle for the conviction that your sins have been forgiven can you wrestle for Isaiah 535 there's a scripture to wrestle with he was wounded for our transgression you put your own name there wrestle with it now he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity that means that all my past is done away with the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes we are healed you that are sick can you wrestle with that word today in the presence of the angel can you wrestle with it until you believe it have you wrestled with that word come home to Bethlehem you're going to have to fight you're going to have to wrestle but come home what about the word that says assemble yourselves together the more as you see the day approaching can you wrestle with that word and continue to do what you're doing I'm just preaching to you this morning can you wrestle with that and continue to act like you're acting can I do that what about the word that says how we treat one another how we should love one another by this you shall all men know that you're my disciples by the love you have one for another can we wrestle with that word until we become that [Music] word we might come out of it with a limp we might come out of it a different kind of person but we'll come out of it with a new identity a new name someone tells us what the word says do we get mad or are we willing to wrestle with it come home to Bethlehem home good you'll die your worship will die down there in Moab home to Bethlehem I'm talking spiritually I'm not talking about a place Hing spiritually come home bethem eans go ahead and come we don't know how Naomi heard that there was a revival going on in Bethlehem the Jews say an angel told her an angel goes down into Moab after she was lost her her her husband her worship after she's lost her sons she sitting down there in Moab don't know what to do because in Moab there was no promise of redemption but in Christ you are redeemable are you hearing me this morning in Christ you are redeemable you are worthy of something I know the devil attacks people today and especially message kids it seems like kids were raised in the message message around the message and you feel worthless now why does the devil try to make you feel that way because you're the most valuable thing there is right right why of that suicide spirit and that that that that those feelings of I'm just worthless I oh I made a mistake I messed up that worthless feeling and you've been raised I know what if I was raised in the message you around the message and things and you you know what you know what the word says and yet you fail and you feel worthless come home to Bethlehem the word says I the Bride of Jesus Christ and the bride is going to make herself ready the word says I'm going to make it the word says I'm a I'm a Believer the word
