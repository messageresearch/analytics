Jesus looked on her with compassion you could judge a woman all you want to but what he saw was someone different I'm thankful when he looks at me he looks at the blood and see something different because if he's looking at my sins he could never love me but he looked at the blood and he saw oh aren't you thankful tonight would you give the Lord a big head clap of praise when I come to his presence a humble myself I lift up both my hands and I begin to worship him oh yes [Music] I humble myself remembering what is done the victories is one so our praise is that reason enough to praise

pass through the body May there be healing o God May there be salvation that would come Lord May there be strength thank you for it tonight we love you We Worship You O Lord thank you Lord Jesus oh isn't he good to his church is more than we could ever ask or think and blessed abundantly thank you for being here tonight First Corinthians 11 28 it's going to take about 20 or 30 minutes and we'll go into the communion service Corinthians 11 28. we'll read the rest of this when the time comes for communion but just these two verses let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily Edith and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body amen I want to speak on that Discerning the Lord's body if you have your seats each one of us must discern the body of the Lord and our place in it by examining ourselves in the mirror of God's word when we're talking about Discerning the Lord's body think of it like this if the room was dark you couldn't see the bodies of the people that were in the room but once light has come begin to be able to see that the people there are there are people in the room and as the light comes stronger you begin to see who they are and and what they do and what they mean to you and so we discern the Lord's body we're Discerning what the body of Christ did for us we're also Discerning who the body of Christ is and our place in it and and so it's very needful what we're doing tonight is an order of God for the church that it causes us to come together and and sit in the presence of God and examine ourselves brother Bill am I in the faith dude do am I a Believer am I am I just a pretender or am I a real Christian and and so we examine ourselves each one of us not I'm not me Examining you or you examining me but each one of us individually we examine ourselves and see what our place is in the party brother Brandon teaches us he said our Eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see or what we hear but it's determined on what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear right now that's important it's not what we see or what we even hear but it's our discernment of what we see and what we hear so he said Paul was not disputing with them for taking the communion their act was right but their discernment was wrong yeah active communion was right but the discernment that they had was wrong for taking the Lord's Supper is the Commandment of the Lord but to take it unworthily not Discerning the Lord's body is we're the wrong lane excuse me these Christians were taking the communion and not living the life yeah Christianity is an experience and the life how many believe that tonight it's an experience and a life and these Christians were living any kind of a life making a poor example of their profession and so we need to be careful what example that we've set maybe something wouldn't be wrong for us personally we don't feel any condemnation but we know the church teaches against it or brother Brandon said something about it and for ourselves you say well I I don't see anything wrong with it but we should discern the Lord's body in staying away from even the the thing that would hurt somebody else or or stumble someone else we would not put a stumbling block in somebody else's way so the Christians were taking communion but not living the life and he said making a poor example of their profession and Paul said that this caused many are sick and weak weak among you and many are asleep which means they're dead because they haven't discerned the body of the Lord so it's important that we discern the body of the Lord we read this last week but it fits here it's very important the Branham said the discernment of knowing that you are the Lord's body he said you can't discern it in wickedness and sin we've got to be above that yeah we discern that the Lord is righteous we discern he's our propitiation how many have discerned the body of the Lord tonight that all of our sins we've confessed and we believe in him of waiting upon his atonement to cleanse us from all our iniquity he said then we're Discerning the Lord's body to what it is and discernment of what it's for he said and then Discerning again that in among us as the Lord's bride body he said let's discern if there's anything wrong with us and hear that would hinder the gospel from growing or the Lord from presenting us before God as a chaste virgin he said let's discern that out right now what was it it was communion night yeah yeah let's discern it out right now oh why can't we do that tonight let's just discern it out right now he said who should I deserve yourself discern that out am I am I a hindrance to the body of God if so Lord let me repent of that it doesn't mean I shouldn't take communion it means I should repent and then take communion and then go make it right wherever I need to make it right hey man if you really repent you'll you'll make it right so notice he said if there's anything wrong that would hinder the gospel from growing let's discern that out right now and find if it's wrong let's confess it if it's wrong and let's say Lord I'm sorry about that see we have to discern the Lord's body in order to care for it you've got to discern the Lord's body to care for it so he says this he said the Lord's body is the church we do not have spiritual discernment enough to care for one another he said how can we care then if we can't care for each other so it's a problem he says how are we going to care for the outsider how can we care for the lost and dying what hospital can we take them to he said cast our cares upon Him for he cares for you but how can we do that how can we care for those outside if we cannot care for one another so he Ties That to Discerning the Lord's body when you discern the people that are in the room then you begin to care for those people yeah right if you if you heard that somebody was in a car wreck and you have a certain amount of concern for that but if you could discern uh if you found a name or saw a picture and you discerned that that was somebody you knew there's a different level of care yeah that is attributed to that and that's why we should we should Fellowship together we should know one another because there's a Discerning of the Lord's body that goes along with that in carrying one for the other we discern the Lord's body for Fellowship yeah right in in First Corinthians 10 16 he said the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion and what does the word communion mean Fellowship yeah that's how it's translated actually most times in the scripture the same word Koinonia we've talked about it before Koinonia is the word for fellowship or communion or sharing or participation solidarity commonality shared responsibility right so communion is more than just just wine and bread but communion is fellowship he said the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ in Acts 2 42 the Bible tells us they continue to steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and communion that's the same word in first John 1 6 if we say that we have communion with him fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he are you glad to be walking in the light tonight if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have communion one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin so communion then is a revelation of the Lord's body did you say it that way communion if it's properly done is a revelation of the Lord's body it's going to reveal to me the benefits of that body and what it meant to me when it was broken when it was wounded right but it's also a revelation of the Lord's body on the earth that it reveals to me who the Lord's body is because when we gather together we take communion Christians take communion what you're saying when you walk up here before the table and you walk in front of the pastor and we're taking communion publicly we do that because what we're saying is I'm a Christian I'm I've tested myself because brother random Thomas we have open communion not closed communion so it's not me telling you you're a Christian but it's you telling yourself you say I'm a Christian I can take communion yes yes and if we're not a Christian we shouldn't take communion right right but if we are a Christian you say well how can I become a Christian repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so if you are a Christian you take communion and you are stating you're making a statement I'm a Christian I belong in this body yeah right oh my it's a big statement but by doing that when I see you come and take communion it helps me discern who the Lord's body is all right it helps you discern who the Lord's body is because they're taking communion with us we take we don't have membership we don't have anything like that but the communion is away so we can identify the Lord's body but the brown said is this communion just something I go up for it and Order say well the rest of them take this I will too that's not the way to take it he said it's a revelation that I am part of him I'm not just saying these things but random taught us this he said it's a revelation that I am part of him and I'm part of you so communion oh we maybe you didn't realize this but communion when you take it it's a revelation to me that you are a Christian it's a revelation that you're a part of the body are you with me now it's a revelation I'm part of him and I'm part of you so he said and I love you and I love him he said and we're taking this together as a symbol of our love to God and our love and fellowship with one another so it means I love you and I love him so when I take communion I don't carry grudges I don't carry a bad temper I don't care we shouldn't carry uh uh kind of a say well I got I got kind of upset at that brother we don't carry that to the communion table why because communion says whatever you did it's under the blood I'm under the blood you're under the blood and together we're going to take communion you see it tonight it's a revelation I'm a Child of God see and then when we discern the Lord's body we no longer fellowship with sin this is what second Corinthians 6 14 tells us he said be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship communion righteousness with unrighteousness what communion light with Darkness so now he's saying that if you're if you're in communion with God this is just a type but if you're in communion with God if you're a Christian what it means is that as you fellowship with Christ you have fellowship with him because you agree with him your life agrees with his word you have fellowship with those of like Precious Faith because you have agreement you're not unequally yoked with a church that you say well that church is is all right but they teach the Trinity they teach all these things Isn't it nice to take communion with people that believe the same message we do they may not see everything just exactly like every little thing like we see it but yet we're taking communion together we ought to take communion if we can with other believers because then we have agreement how can two walk together unless they agree Fellowship is based on agreement he said our agreement with God now what is our agreement with God now think about it God cannot come in agreement with us The Way We Were he could not walk with us the life we lived he could not walk with that we were Sinners without hope so what does he do he shed his own blood now there's the gospel Christ shed his own blood so he could have agreement with us so he could have communion with us so when we discern the body and blood of the Lord discern what communion is for it shows us that it's for Fellowship we now have agreement the blood brings us to agreement amen he said now when God made man in the beginning to fellowship with him he said then this man was in perfect Fellowship in the Garden of Eden he was in perfect fellowship with God and how it must have been on that day when God would come down to the cool of the evening and call Adam he and Eve would come up they would worship God they would fellowship and commune one with the other he said that's the very thing that calls us together like this Oh my he said sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus fellowshipping in the Holy Spirit no difference in US oh I wish I could preach that I just about don't have any voice at all tonight church but there's no difference in US no difference We Are All One in Christ with a communion table this level yeah right we come up here we're all the same no matter what our pastor's been no matter what yesterday was no matter what you're coming to the community you say I'm a Christian you're a Christian no big eyes and little youth but we're coming together we're a body all right oh do you love him tonight he's provided this for us as a visible way we can discern the Lord's body so we're sitting in Heavenly places no difference in us nothing like it he said I've ever found on the earth is to come together in Heavenly places and have communion fellowship with god with each other he said that's what God intended in the Garden of Eden and that Fellowship from God and man was broken by sin now God made a basis in the ground upon which man could remain and retain his Fellowship it wasn't through a get-together organization or an education it was on the basis of the shed blood that's the only place a fellowship we have with God today the only meaning place is through the blood of Jesus Christ he said now we've tried organizing the fellowship you break off with another group when you do that he said all right we try to educate them Fellowship what do we get we get a bunch of educated idiots uh Prophet said it wasn't me yeah it's quote men just educate themselves so they educate themselves away from one another they get complexes he said you don't get no complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you get love yeah you get love not a complex and I'm a little bigger than somebody else a little better than somebody else you know a little more than somebody else you just got your arms around everybody it's a basis of Love through the blood he said the blood cleanses yeah Fellowship comes by love love requires Fellowship he said if you love your wife you just got to get with her and talk with her if you love your friend you've got to get with him and talk with him if you love God there's got to be a basis for Fellowship you cannot have complete fellowship and livelihood he said without these agreements you cannot have fellowship with god without coming to God's agreement there's a basic thing for fellowship and that's the blood but only it's been God's way from the beginning it will be till the end the only place that Fellowship is through the blood you could not meet with us an organization he could not meet with us as an intellectual group he can only meet with us as we have Fellowship as we come under the shed blood of his son Jesus Christ that's the only basic place that we can meet all right then that makes us we don't we don't war with our brothers and sisters we're just a part of those who have Fellowship under the blood are you with me now I'm almost done that God dwells with Fellowship under the shed blood of his son and that alone someone say that alone not Upon Our denomination or affiliation but upon the shed blood we meet God face to face think of job and his friends remember his friends kept coming to him it wasn't very good communion was it had a communion service now come around and said job's a sinner oh job he's done something bad you see job man he wasn't at church Wednesday night boy tell you what you've been doing something wrong God judged him that's not what we do to one another that's right we have communion when we have communion we're all in the same level why and job knew he hadn't done anything wrong why brother Brown says because he knew he did what God required he offered a lamb and and you know if you've come to God you know that you asked God to forgive you right and so I can't sit there on communion time at Communion time and be a job's friend and tell you well you it must be that's happening to you because of something you did no you say I come into the shed blood and so Brothers said for job to admit or say that he was a sinner would be to deny his sacrifice so he couldn't do that he said our fellowship now listen listen to this our fellowship is not upon the basis of how much God prospers us but on the basis of coming under the shed blood and fellowship with one another that's why a person who makes half a million dollars a year can follows you with somebody who makes five thousand dollars a year a person who's got a nice truck can fellowship with somebody who's got a not nice truck or no truck at all why because you come together under communion everything's level you're one with one another not your denomination or affiliation not how much money you have not on the basis of how much God prospers you but on the basis of coming under the shed blood and fellowship with one another here's where the real part of Christianity Lays he said that's what makes these meetings so real that when people come into those basis of the shed blood we have things in common we sit in Heavenly places think about this for a moment when Jesus disciples were at the Last Supper they come from all different backgrounds occupation some majority of them were fishermen but some were tax collectors and other things farmers different things that they were but they were all there even Judas was there now watch now brother Brandon taught us every Christian has a duty to take communion do you know he taught that he said I truly think it's the duty of every Christian to take communion the Bible said if you take this note you have no part with me and I'm not I'm not going to make you feel bad tonight if you're gone you couldn't take it I know some of some folks got sick and uh brother Allen's wife wasn't feeling good we need to pray for her tonight and I believe there's healing in this service there's a feeling in the blood of Jesus she wasn't feeling well tonight they had to go home and there's some other things that happen things happen people aren't able to be here but if you can be a communion service you need to go because it's our duty to take communion right you say well I did something that was wrong with Ben confess it get rid of it that's all it takes he already knew you did it yeah yeah you don't have to well Lord when I get this all out when you find out you may or may not forgive me no God I'm sorry I confess my sin I I I'm not been what I should have been and he forgives you in that instant amen and each one of them were there he said it's the duty of a Christian take communion he said I believe it's a showdown time for Christians if we do not take it we have no part with him if we take it unworthily then we're guilty of the body and death of Christ he said so it gets to a place where it keeps the Christian prayed up when he comes to communion it should come reverently solemnly sacredly walking up confessing all of our wrongs praying one for the other listen to this if there's a brother or sister among us we feel just a little bit out of line somewhere our hearts ought to be burdened for that person on communion night especially to see them that they'll be able to walk up and take communion not be condemned with the world because they are our brothers and sisters you don't know what it does to me to see some of some of you take communion because I know what you've been through and I know the struggles and to take it together with one another I know what you've been through but I know we serve a god it heals all the Brokenness and and he heals all the stuff and you go through things that are hard yeah you come to the communion table together what does that mean God it means God is doing a supernatural work something that you couldn't do but he did it we watch every time our little kids sometimes I'll stand up here and cry at the communion table and I just just being honest with you tonight because I watch people come through I know what they were I know what God saved them from and yet I watch them take communion recognizing saying themselves I'm a Child of God watch our children as they grow up there's nothing we want more and to see our children grow up and get baptized and get filled with the Holy Ghost and take communion and when they take communion it always blesses my heart to see my my son and my daughter go through it and now my third child Melody's starting to go through and it's like it's just a wonderful thing to me I'm thinking they think enough of the blood of Jesus they they're sure enough of their experience with God that they'll come up before the communion table and tell the church I'm a Christian that blesses me you say well maybe they don't do everything right maybe they don't but somehow I think they've made it right with God I want them to come to come and then God will deal with them the time comes to make things right ought to deal with them you say well I know what brother so-and-so did he shouldn't come to communion you don't know if he's repented or not well I think I know no you don't you didn't know when the thief on the cross repented you had not been privy to that conversation between him and the Lord can you imagine if you hadn't heard it you would have never expected to be in heaven he never expected to be in heaven I was he there I heard a preacher say it this way he said the man on the middle cross said I could come that's the only reason any of us are going to make it yes Mother Brown said if you see your brother or sister like that and you see that they've not been able to take it and then they start being able to take it he said you pray for them but they won't be condemned with the world because they are brothers and sisters now watch this and we'll close to betray Christ Judas left the communion table have you ever noticed that left communion he flipped out he broke his fellowship with the disciples and with Jesus Don said this he said they went out from us but they were not of us or if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us he said the old unbeliever will walk out on the first thing that Sandy don't like uh brother he's going to throw his colors right then he's an unbeliever Paul said they went out from us because there wasn't of us in the beginning he started with us or you did run well what hindered you he said they went out because he wasn't of us when they see the word perfectly moving on they want to get some kind of a gimmick they could work he said but the real Believers don't question nothing yeah yeah amen do you realize let's look at it you look at Judas he left that shows he wasn't of us but what does that mean if you look at it the other way it means the fact that you're here means you are a part of the body Hallelujah I discerned the Lord's body and I'm in it I deserved the Lord's body and you're in it you're a part of it real Believers don't question nothing that's the way I want to be written in the word and they believe and they just go on that's it always is written if it isn't written he said well you just stay away from it matter what happens it's got to be written how do we do communion like we do because it's written in the word Prophet said it the prophet shed light Paul shed light on communion on what Jesus said brother Branham said light on what Paul said that's why we do what we do it's got to be written he said they see that written word and they believe it and they see God moving in his word you see him moving today see the hour of the message the time and they just walk with it musicians I need a piano player actually an organ player if you would come piano and organ I want us to Bow our heads for just a moment the brothers would come and communion ready you would play something Softly and then we're going to read the the scripture as well in First Corinthians 11 but I want us to just take a moment we don't always do this but brother Branham did it at times that when you have communion you tarry one for the other you said that in his church he implemented that as a moment of Silent prayer where you pray for me and I pray for you and that's what we want we want to pray one
