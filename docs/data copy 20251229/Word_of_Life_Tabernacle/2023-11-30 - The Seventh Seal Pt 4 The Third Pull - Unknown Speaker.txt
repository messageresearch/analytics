life we need an awesome God don't we let's bow our heads together for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we're happy to be here on a Wednesday night and so grateful for your presence and your

move me out of the way Lord may we learn but not just learn Lord may we receive Revelation father pray that the word that we hear would not be just word because the letter kth but the spirit giveth life I pray you'd grant that tonight that you give life to your children we pray in Jesus name amen amen hallelujah we're going to read from Revelation 81 and then from Mark 11:23 Revelation 81 and Mark 11:23 Revelation 81 says when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about about the space of half an hour and then this seems like an unrelated scripture but Mark 11:23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen I pray the Lord with that his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to speak to you tonight about uh on the seventh seal and the third pole the seventh seal and the third pole there's a reason why that we're preaching on these things and that's because we need to understand these things and there are some things we do need to understand the Bible says that the wise will understand and and do exploits but there will be a people who will not understand but those people are the people of the world and we live in an age when no one understands anything about the things of God but we do need to understand and yet even those things we can't understand we need to believe amen because he said it isn't that right we need to believe those things but I uh there are some things we need to understand I heard a story about a a pastor who was speaking to the young boys the young men in the church and and maybe Jason's age and he was asking him he said uh he asked him a question he said uh who he said' who knocked down the wall of Jericho and uh the boys said well I didn't do it and each one proclaimed his innocence so the pastor went to a deacons meeting later that day and he was telling the deacons he said I can't believe we've not taught our children better he said they they they didn't even know who knocked down the walls of Jericho and and he went on for a little while and finally a wise old Deacon he kind of spoke up he said pastor he said uh he said I I don't know who knocked down the walls of Jericho he said but whoever did it we can pay for it out of the building fund said if it's that big of a deal to you that's why we need to know Ain that right so we don't want to be caught like that if it comes to somebody ask us what is the third pole we should know what that is yes amen who knocked down the wall of Jericho what is the third pole what's the connection between the seventh seal and the third pole and I want to look at those two things tonight what is the third pole what is the connection so the the we know that God Reveals His secret to his servants the prophets Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing someone say nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets and this is where uh and I don't think I have to restate this to you but if someone would be listening that doesn't understand why we uh we quote brother brandom why we uh believe uh the message that he brought we believe that because God sent a prophet in our hour and that Prophet was to reveal the secrets at the end time and so the things that happened in that prophet's life and Ministry mattered to us because we believe he was a true Prophet we believe just like Moses just like Paul in the Bible that he was a true Prophet now his purpose was not uh to rewrite the Bible that wasn't what he came for it was to tie up the Loose Ends that had been left by Luther and by Wesley and by all the other reformers and he would uh he would show us we would we would know with authority we would know uh what the truth is in the end time and and and the purpose of that was to get us ready for a Rapture that's ultimately why we have a message behold I send Elijah the prophet you he said he said I send you Elijah the prophet why did he come to prepare us for the the Rapture of the church so the bride could make herself ready and I believe that's the day that we're living in I believe we have what we have need of to be ready uh at the end time amen how many believe that we we have everything that we have need of to be ready for a Rapture so we we find that we live in the hour when someone has to answer the question when Jesus said when the son of man come cometh shall he find faith on the earth and brother brandom said you can you can say that when when the son of man comes he said will Malachi 4 be revealed or be fulfilled will Luke 17:30 be fulfilled will he find faith on the earth because if he sends the prophet and he did and if he calls out a bride and he did then there will be faith on the earth at the end time amen so that's why uh we listen to a prophet now uh we know that we live in an hour when the days must be shortened for the elect's sake how many knows the Bible says that Mark 13 and 20 says except that the Lord had shortened those days no flesh should be saved but for the elect's sake aren't you glad to be the elect doesn't it doesn't it mean something to you to be the what does the elect mean being the elect means even when you were in your darkest deepest hole in life that you'd gotten you'd done as many bad bad things as you could do and yet you were still the elect of God you didn't know it yet but you were God's elect he chose you and so you couldn't not become a son and so there had to come a day there had to come a day when you when the light come by your way and you receive the message of the hour you were born again your life changed that day had to come it had to come and so uh we find then that uh we find then the days are shortened for our sake except the Lord had shortened those days whom for the elect's sake whom he had chosen he shortened the days what that means is we've come to the end time now there's no more delay yeah so there had to be uh there had to be a presence of Christ there had to be a revelation of the Rapture there had to be an opening of the word the reason why there was an opening of the word so of the word is so we could make it in the hour that we live in we could not be what we are without the message of the hour oh do you love him aren't you glad he sent you a message aren't you glad he sent you a aren't you glad there was a third poll we can say it that way for those that understand aren't you glad there was a third pole aren't you glad there was an opening of the word there had to be or we would not we would just be another Pentecostal Church without the this message so the method that God used in William bram's Ministry was three phases or poll of his Ministry just like he worked with Noah in three polls he worked with Abraham in three polls and he worked with Jesus in three polls now the terminology poll comes from a multi-part vision that brother brandham has around November of 1955 after preaching a series of meetings in San Fernando California and the Lord had always provided for brother brandom and and in the meetings he never begged for money he didn't if you've ever been to an Evangelical meeting uh convention a great convention I remember when we were kids we went to the inner Church Holiness convention and they spent uh I feel like this is feeding back to me brother Peter if you can fix that just turn it down a little bit I feel like I'm yelling at everybody too so but we would go to the inner Church Holiness convention and I remember they they blocked off an hour one night of the meeting it was only a 3 night meeting and they blocked off a whole hour to beg for money and they would get up and they had guys that were really good at it like by the time you got done you wanted to give money I didn't even have any money and I wanted to give money but they uh uh the the guys there were just really good at doing that and and that's what they did in brother bram's time but brother brandham wouldn't do that he refused to do that said if God gives us the money we'll have the meeting and so when he was in California he comes back from California in debt $155,000 now $155,000 for those of you who were alive in 19 uh 1955 1956 that was a lot of money so he's in debt $115,000 for those meetings and he comes home from the meetings and he he's decides on his way back home he's leaving the field he's going back to get his job at the Public Service Company he'll just preach at the Tabernacle and he finally works up the courage to tell his wife and kids about it and and then he gets home and he said this on January 1st 1956 he tells the story he said I went home tired weary upset crying went to bed that night it gives me great comfort that God used a man in our day and not just an angel from heaven God used a man that got weary and upset and crying and he went to bed that night he said after the wife got to sleep I went into the room knelt down and said dear Jesus I don't know what I'm going to do here I am right back where I started from again he said see I guess I made a failure about two hours from then he appeared to me oh my and he begins to tell him what his future would would be in the ministry now uh he tells it in uh more detail about four months later in a message called what is a vision what is a vision and again he tells it in the seventh seal and we're going to take from all those different times he tells it and I'm going to do it a little bit different tonight because I'm honestly trying to keep you awake and and keep your attention so I'm going to read some things that I don't have on the board and you'll just have to catch up with me and then there's some pict back there uh that you're going to have to put on the board as well brother brandom went his vision begins with he sees two small children he pulling a cart or pulling a wagon two small he said brown eyed brown-haired children that he later realized were Mexican children Hispanic children pulling a cart and he said Here Comes something moving and he said I seen two little dark-faced children come moving down pulling a wagon and these children were walking towards him a and uh with their black dark eyes and then he he moves out of that Vision he he he describes it like changing Dimensions now I don't even know what that would feel like but he said it was like going from one dimension to another and he said he goes from uh the vision uh of the little uh Little Children walking towards him and he goes to a vision of a meeting that was dismissed so the second part of the vision was actually meeting that was dismissed without an altar call and brother brandham thought that was a bad thing by the way for those of you who don't believe in alter calls or wonder sometimes why we do it brother brandham in this third pole Vision deals with alter calls twice in this third pole vision and in this first part uh he goes to a meeting and the the vision or the meeting gets dismissed and and this was I think I have a picture on there of the meeting in Mexico now brother brand goes goes to Mexico twice uh during uh 1956 and when he goes to uh uh Mexico the first time what happens is uh he gets um he goes and they get rained out but no one knows who cancels the meeting they never find out and so he goes to Mexico City they rent the bll ring in Mexico City and this is a picture from where they actually went the second time were able to have the meeting and thousands and thousands of people come that's the famous story of the I'm just going to change this mic it's giving me all kinds of problems tonight that's the famous story of the uh now this one's real hot the famous story of the little baby that got raised from the dead how many have heard that the little Mexican baby the mother run up over all the guards and things and comes up front that happened during this meeting so then the meeting uh the meeting was uh uh in Mexico City so this is the next part of his vision and he says later that that was fulfilled that part was fulfilled in Mexico City he sees brother Oregan brigh he talks about how that he comes he passes some ministers and he comes into this place where there's thousands of people and uh and he said it was sprinkling rain and someone said that the meeting is dismissed and he said well who dismissed it no one knew and that literally happened to him a few months later so and and and and they said well what they told him was they said well we already took up the offering and and of course that burn brother brand him up you can understand so and and so that was fulfilled now that's where brother brandom says part of the vision the of the third pole Vision was fulfilled in Mexico in 1956 brother brandom went there and and did that now the third part was a baby shoe now we we don't always understand how a prophet Works do we we don't always understand how God works but if you you say Well that's strange okay go back in the Bible and you'll find prophets doing strange things all the time and seeing strange things candlesticks and and all kinds of different things that they saw read the book of Revelation a lamb as if it had been slain walking out and taking a book right it's a symbol of something and so it's just like brother brandom's having a a vision of a baby shoe but it's a symbol of something and so that's that's an actual 1950s baby shoe Because the Internet is wonderful and you're able to find whatever you're looking for and uh it's a 1950s baby shoe and so it would be something like that he said it was about he said he was standing there with the shoe and a shoelace and he was trying to thread up into that little uh into that little e inch hole he's trying to put a half inch uh shoelace into that e inch hole and and it's just not working and and the the the the thing is coming apart and finally he realizes and he see here's a voice behind him and says you can't teach babies Supernatural things right and he kept trying to do it and he looked down on the string on the floor he said and he realized that the other end would have fit but not that end he was trying to do it wrong and he reached down to pick up the other end and he was taken up again now we're moving we're moving along real well so we'll get we'll get done tonight uh before midnight so we'll be good so he he reached down to pick up the string and he said I was taken again so he goes into another part of the vision right so this is maybe more than what you've heard but it's this is the entire Vision the fourth part he's standing by a lake fishing so I've got a uh kind of a just a picture he sees in the lake a bunch of rainbow trout and I put that picture there mostly for me and I I'll say this right now they're catching some big ones up at the Spring River so just you can thank me later and uh in that next picture is a lake that's Lake Michigan brother brandom when he went to Chicago and told the vision he said it looked like Lake Michigan in the summer is what it looked like so he goes up into and he's standing at this Lake Shore and brother random is a fisherman but the angel is telling him how to fish oh I think we ought to listen when God tries to tell us something the angel is telling him how to fish and so the angel is telling him exactly the way you would fish he's telling him you you cast it out he said when you first cast it out you'll uh he said you'll attract the little bitty fish he said and so you kind of pull it slowly he said and then uh he said and then when you pull it the second time because he's using a lure so he doesn't just leave it there but he pulls it he reels it in and he pulls it again when he pulls a second time he said you'll attract a little bit bigger fish but don't set the hook yet he said because there's more big fish coming after he wanted those rainbow trout right and so he finally he got a he said he told him when you make that third pole and that's where the terminology comes from literally a pull uh it's he's using a fishing rod and he pulls p p l he pulls on the rod and so he said that third pull is what'll catch the big fish and so when he pulls on the rod and and he's standing there and he starts to do what the angel told him but he said a bunch of preachers come around he said he said they were fishermen standing by the lake he realized later that they were preachers he said they come around him and they begin to Pat him on the back and say oh brother brandom you can do it you're oh my you you can you can explain it and so he said okay he said I'm a fisherman and he began to explain to them which is where he made his mistake explaining to them about the gift right because when he explained it to them they begin to try to impersonate it so he began to explain to them about this gift and uh and he said it's because I love people he said I I want him to understand but you can't always understand the things of God and but I we want to understand what we can but there's some things that he had to keep to himself and so uh he was trying to explain this and and when he did it he did it right the first time little fish came when he pulled the second time he pulled too hard and he tried to set the hook he said got a fish but he said it looked like a skin Over The Lure right it was so small you ever caught a fish like that it was so small it was a skin Over The Lure and so when he catches this fish what happens he realizes he's messed up because he's missed the bigger fish but he he finds himself now and the angel begins to rebuke him and the angel begins to say uh begins to say uh he said I give it a great big jerk and I pulled the lure out of the water and he said just in this one who had been talking behind me stepped around in front of me it was the angel of the Lord he looked at me and he said just what I told you not to do and then the angel begins to explain the vision and I have this quote I believe on there the angel begins to explain the vision he said you see that first poll was when you used to put your hands on the people and tell them what was their trouble he said the second poll was when you know the secrets of the hearts like I told you he said instead of keeping that to yourself you tried to explain all about it and tell people people and when you did you didn't know nothing about it yourself and how could you explain it he said you've caused a big bunch of carnal impersonations to rise up and you see what you've done imagine the angel of the Lord speaking to his a prophet like that and I said Lord I'm sorry and I said oh I'm so sorry I don't know what to do and I was pulling the line like this I was trying to straighten my line out he looked at me he said now don't get your line Tangled Up In Those these kind of times now if you read on you you find he got the line straightened out he he mentions that before he goes on he actually got the line I'm so glad that he did so now the fifth part of this vision is a tent and or a tabernacle he says in one place of some kind or a cathedral so I I this is Brother brandom's actual tent that he had uh back in the early days of his ministry I don't know how well you can see that but you can see it's very large and maybe some see some seever a couple thousand people maybe this picture is Jack CO's tent which uh was very much larger in fact Jack Co made sure it was the largest one in the world and the way that he did that he he went to he went to oral Robert's meeting he took out a tape measure and he measured oral Robert's tent and then he went and ordered one bigger sounds like some preachers I know and cuz he had to have the biggest tent in the world they' put that on their advertisements and stuff and so it was the thing to do back then was have a tent and brother brandom talks about that tent and he talked about how he felt himself go up higher he was raised up higher he was picked up he said I never seen he said he saw a great tent I never seen such a tent now he had seen Jack CO's tent so it must have been a greater tent than this tent that's a big tent in fact that tent was bigger than Barnum uh Brothers uh circus tent and he said just then he picked me up he took me up he sent me way up high he said to where a meeting was going on so he's looking down he said it was a tent or a Cathedral of some sort he said and I had just made an altar call he said when I looked there was hundreds of people standing around the altar weeping because they had accepted the Lord Jesus he said and they were just weeping out loud he said and I said oh that's more like it you see why we want to we we want to keep having alter calls till the Lord comes we want to keep the move of the spirit moving in our church till till the Lord we want to till the end why because even in the third pole Vision brother brandom sees it and he says that's more like it I said that's more like it like that we still believed in altar calls and then he sees a long prayer line the longest he's ever seen and he said I looked over what was then to my left and what would be to my right if I was standing on the platform would be that way he said so it' be on over on this side of the platform he said if I he said there's a piece of canvas stretched there in behind this canvas was a little square building about 12T across and 20 foot long something like that he said I seen him bring a lady up on a stretcher I've read these to you before and you can go and and find them and what is a vision in the seventh seal and and a couple other places but he said the next man come through was with crutches he says so there was one on a stretcher and one come with crutches and he saw him go through that little building and on the outside the lady come out screaming to the top of her voice pushing the stretcher and there was another lady on the other side and she asked her she said what happened and she said I just don't know she said I couldn't tell you what happened she said I've been paralyzed for 20 years and she said I feel like I was never sick and just said out come the man leaping and jumping with his crutches in his hand he said he heard something moving like it did on the platform and he heard the pillar of fire begin to whip around he said and the pillar of fire left me it went down over the top of the audience and went and stood over the top of that little building and then settled down on top of it and I have this quote he said then when it did he said this one that was standing by me behind me the same voice the Angel's voice said I'll meet you in there and this is the third pole but nobody will know nothing about it now I'm just going to go on record and say that if brother brandham came back and alive to fulfill this vision and came back and set up a tent that big we would know about it but this third poll nobody would know nothing about it right so now he said it will not be a public show this time right now so the third poll was the third phase of William bram's Ministry a and he didn't even know what it would be but he later identified it as the opening of the word we all know that the first pole was healing he said the second pole prophesying the third pole the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed so what he identified is what would catch the big fish oh my come on what what he oh my that makes me want to that makes me want to run all over the place what he identified what would catch a big fish is the opening of the word it is the word and it's not again letter only but it's the word it's a Living Word it's Christ made real in our hour that's good so it was it was the Mysteries revealed now it was also identified by the sword that was uh he was given in Sabino Canyon and I've I've stood there on uh the rock where on sword Rock I meant to get a picture of that and have a picture of it I meant to put one on there and I didn't but I've stood there on that rock and in that place where brother Bon stood and he had a sword now that's a a king sword that's actually the uh the sword that they used during a coronation uh for the kings and queens of England but it was a sword like that he said it was real pretty it had pearl handles had a guard over it had gold and the blade looked like Chrome or silver was real shiny he says three things about it he said it was sharp it was shiny and it just fit his hand and he said and there was only one the king and that's God and he has one sword and that's his word oh my he said it's the word he said oh what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery and the secret and so he said he told him he said something just come to me and said Don't Fear this is that third pole so the sword in the hand was the third pole now I've got this quote uh brother B said third pole you remember it so he's going on this is in the seventh seal he said you've had so many impersonators on this what you tried to explain but said don't even try this he said you remember it how many remembers that Vision while it's all over it's taped and everywhere it's been about six years ago seven years ago he said don't try to explain that this is the third poll I'll meet you in there so the third phase of his ministry the third pole was also identified by mountain peaks the three uh the mountain range that had his name on but there was three different Peaks and by three sets of Messengers when he saw the vision which he would later go out out to uh Arizona and be caught up in that constellation of angels he saw a vision of of Messengers he saw little birds and I've got a picture of that I think and it's not an actual picture of it but it kind of gives you an idea he said the first one was little birds he said the second one was uh bigger Birds and the third one was Angels little birds bigger birds and angels and he said that was that first second and third pole and to represent the angels I put a picture of the cloud which is the con ation he was caught up in which uh was the sign of that in the heavens now are you with me so far brother Bram taught us he said notice the first little flight hand he said the second was greater Wier doves Holy Spirit revealing the secrets of the heart the third flight was Angels not Birds angels He said that's the end time that's all of it and so and I like the fact if you go back and and I'm just laying stuff in here tonight you go back and study it but if you go back into uh if you go back into is this the sign of the end sir he said he was caught up in a constellation of angels how many remember him saying that he was caught up he was caught up and he says the same thing when he tells the story he said I was caught up in that constellation of angels and and we know that when he gave the third pole Vision he said I was lifted up I was caught up so when you begin to look at this you begin to realize then the third pole was also identified by the spoken word a lot of people think that the third poll is Hatty right speaking or family and the spoken word happening that's not the third pole that's an identification of the third pole right he's showing the power of the word there's so much more here church are are you still with me tonight would you be just a little bit longer my job to you I is to present is to communicate What the Lord Has on my heart and I don't always do that well but that's what I'm here to do I'm not here to make you happy right that's not my job my job is not to entertain you my job is to present whatever the Lord puts on my heart and try to present that to you where you can understand it so the third poll is identified by the spoken word and we're going to deal with that in a little bit more depth maybe next next time that we preach now or next time we have a Wednesday night service now uh what's the connection between the seventh seal and the third pole well brother random says this in questions and answers after he he relates all the supernatural things that have been happening all through the week when he's preaching the seals questions and answers on the seals that Sunday morning after he's preached the seals all week he said if you can understand it this is that third pole he said see you should have caught that the other day just remember there'll be no impersonation like there was of the other two he said that's as far as you should know now and he tells us more obviously later now in Revelation 81 we remember there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour why was there silence in heaven because brother brand said if it's spoken Satan would know about it and that's what he leaves off in the seventh seal and picks up in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said there's some things we don't know because if once it's spoken then he knows about it but he points back to it after it happened and said this is what took place he said say will try to impersonate he'll try to impersonate everything that the church will do he's tried to do it he said we notice it through the Antichrist but this is one thing he cannot impersonate there will be no mimics to this CU he don't know it there's no way for him to know it it's the third pole he just knows nothing about it he doesn't understand it you know what that tells me there will be a people that do understand it if he doesn't understand there's got to be people that do and again I don't think it's understanding how to put it together but it's understanding it's for us yes right it's not it's not how it goes together and all the dates and everything that's not what we need to understand what we need to understand is how does this apply to my life how can I move into this cycle of the Rapture how can I become a part of this third poll of brother Brand's Ministry that would be so great now and we know that we're part of that now and when I say brother Brandon's Ministry remember it really he was he was presenting something to us the first and second poll was to attract our attention to something what was it for to attract our attention to Christ right so we can say it this way Christ is the third pole right it's the opening of Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ to the people I'm so glad for that tonight he said an inubino Canyon so he he he retells that third P Vision in the seventh seal he left out out the part that happened in Mexico he said in Sabino Canyon he said this is the third poll and there's three great things that goes with it one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today one thing I cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language he said but I stand right there and look right straight at it this is the third pole coming up and the Holy Spirit of God he said Oh my he said that's the reason all heaven was silent that's the reason what was it it was again it was something that they wouldn't know anything about but it was something so powerful when they walked in into the little room they were crippled but when they walked out it was as though they'd never been sick can I say it to you this way when you come into the opening of the word when you come into the message of the hour you walked in crippled I walked in crippled but when we go through this age we're not coming out crippled we're not coming out halfway Believers we're not coming out as a bunch of as a backsliding church we're not a bride that will fall we are an eve that will not fall that cannot fall so when we come through this 12x2 room if you can say it that way when we come through that little room see it's a symbol of something when we come through it we come out the other side well as though we were never sick in the first place as though we were never sinners in the first place what do we come out with new bodies you say where are we at we're in there right now oh my we're hidden in the secret of his coming and remember what the seventh seal was the seven seal was the end of all things the seven seal was the seven Thunders the seventh seal was the third pole and the Seven seal is the coming of the Lord that's good Hallelujah the third poll I want to present this to you tonight the third poll is not just for the prophet it's for us he said behold I send you Elijah so if there was a third face to brother brandham Ministry a third pole where he would catch the big fish it was for the sake of the fish that he would catch oh my if you're fishing no matter how good of a fisherman you are you're you're only as good as the fish you catch right you can have the best equipment you can have the best line you can have everything just set just right but you're only as good as the fish you catch brother Brandon's Ministry is only as good as the fish he caught but who did he catch he caught us and there was the supernatural catches many kinds of people right it does it even does today when we and I believe in a supernatural God I believe in the moving of the spirit but it catches all kinds of people everybody can benefit from that the saved and the unsaved and The Sinner and everybody else they feel the presence of God and that's good but but there has to be something that goes beyond that something that'll keep you something that'll hold you something that'll make it where you cannot fall right and that is Christ himself manifesting the word in your life oh my brother BR said that's how you know you have the the revelation of the word by the way is because it manifests itself it's not because you can quote it not because you can tell tell it put it all together but because it manifests itself it does what a preacher is supposed to do it does what a Deacon's supposed to do it does what a housewife is supposed to do the word manifest itself so the third poll is for us brother brandham says this he said it's tightening and he could see that in his day and I believe that we're in a squeeze right now I'm not looking for a squeeze to come when everybody's going to be without power and everybody's gonna because I can take you places in the world where that's going on right now right everybody's going to be persecuted and and and we can all be preparers for this squeeze I do not believe that that's coming I could be wrong but I don't believe based on the message of the hour that that's coming I believe I believe when the tribulation starts we go home but the Bible says in in a day and hour that you think not they'll be eating they'll be drinking they'll be marrying they'll be giving in marriage they'll be doing business transactions Building Homes having Church brother B said they'd be having Revival people would be coming to the Altar and yet the bride would be gone and so it happens in that kind of a time but I do believe that right now we're in a squeeze we're being squeezed on every side we talked about it Sunday night where there there's Darkness everywhere the the there's oppression everywhere there's trouble everywhere but I'm so glad he said in the time of trouble he said I'll hide you in in my Pavilion in my tent in my Tabernacle he said in the time of trouble I'll hide you brother said that was the time of the Rapture right so so Bram says this about the third poll he said when that time comes and the Press comes to a place to where you're pressed out now what that means is that you it's gotten to a place where you cannot withstand it anymore he said then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes he said watch the third pole then he said see It'll be absolutely to the total lost but it will be for the bride and the church now why would he say that he said that because of Abraham Abraham had three poles Sodom had three poles lot went down to Sodom that's the first pole the two angels went down to Sodom that's the second pole but the third pole where did he go where did the angel go it was to the Eternal loss because by that point Sodom had been condemned but the angel didn't go into Sodom he stayed there with Abraham and revealed the secret of his heart oh my that's the hour that we're living in that's the time he began to reveal his secrets to Abraham during that time so he said it'll be to the total loss but it'll be for the bride and the church amen so now what is the third poll have you been with me so far is it you know can you do you know anything about what I'm talking about sometimes I get done with this and I feel like man I had three people that thought they got it you know what it takes for me is it takes a lot of study but it's not just that it takes the revelation of the of the spirit to put this in your life but if you you can't it can't be revealed to you until you hear it once you hear it then it can be a revelation it's got to come from somewhere now it can't be real Faith until it's mental Faith then it's got to sink down somewhere deeper the third poll is what the third poll is the third phase of William Brand's Ministry the third poll is the spoken word or we could say it was identified by the spoken word the third pole is the opening of the word the third pole is the seventh seal the third pole is the coming of the Lord this is it he said those third that third set of Messengers was angels He said that's the end of all of it and that's why we know there's not another messenger another message coming God didn't do that all of that just for William brandom he didn't do that so he could pause it and come back 30 years later and restart it again or 70 years later and restarted again he didn't do that he did it for me he did it so I could live a a Victorious life because the third pole is Christ in us that's what the third pole is that's what that's what Christ is the mystery revealed taught us the third pole is Christ in you and so we go back to Mark 11:23 where we started he said verily I say unto you whosoever shall say to this mountain whosoever how many whosoever's we got in here whosoever shall say to this mountain that means that when you have a need you're living in the time when there's been a Power released to you that you can speak and your mind your thoughts will be so with the word that you won't speak anything but the word on huh well he said you have thus sayi the Lord who keep still so you're living in the time when when you need a new job you can you can speak a new job into existence you're living in a time when when you need uh those things we're living in that time but I don't believe that's the ultimate fulfillment of the third pole because the third poll is the coming of the Lord but listen what he says whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart so you got to believe it you got it's got to be revealed to you and brother BR said it has to be timely it has to be in the line of dut Duty has to be something you really need he said he shall have whatsoever he saith now watch he said so now I'm going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along and that is the thing that we've looked forward to for so long he said for at least many years four or five years maybe longer the third pole has now been Vindicated by the spoken word he said I'm sure you all know what it is he said now remember there will never be an impersonation of that cuz it can't be they can impersonate discernment but they can't impersonate the third pole right he said because it can't be and that's how we know the third Pole's not just head knowledge because they can impersonate that right he said see it cannot be now he said it's inexistent he said and I am warned of this that soon he said right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you but it will not be used in a great way until this Council begins to tighten up again if we're not living in a in a hard time I don't know when the hard time is come on I'll be honest for a pastor this right now is the hardest time it's hard to get people to respond to the word it's hard and I'm not criticizing you at all you're a lovely bunch of people but just ask any preacher it's difficult right now the the the Earth the United States especially just burn over and even overseas you don't have the response that you used to have and and you preach the same word under the same anointing and you don't have the response you used to have why it's the time that we're living in there's a squeeze coming down on the minds of the people there's Darkness coming down on the spirits of the people but I'm so glad that we're not relegated to that we're not a part of that he said AR Rise and Shine for thy light has come you can shake yourself and receive the word of the hour and believe the word of the hour he says but he says it will not be used in a great way until this counsil begins to tighten up and when it does he said the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down and I've talked to you about the squeeze maybe we'll go back into it as part of this because I can prove to you brother brandom said the squeeze for the for the bride he said was not a natural force but he said it's it's the it's the devil trying to tell them things don't matter the word doesn't matter doesn't matter if you go to church or not doesn't matter if you live right or not go look it up that's what he taught that the squeeze was and I think most of us miss that but he said when the squeeze comes down you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power you know what that is you know what the fullness of it is what's the fullness of your adoption the body change you waiting on somebody to come and speak you into a Rapture there is somebody going to come speak you into a Rapture you you maybe I went too far but we'll get into that next time Lord willing or I say Lord come quickly I believe you remember down in Egypt when they got to they got pressed so hard brother Danny they finally got to a place where they begin to cry out and the Lord said I heard their cry there is a people that are going to that are going to speak and the voice of Resurrection is going to be in them there has to be a people but the B said that same voice that raised Lazarus from the dead has got to be it's got to be in US church it's got to be there's no promise of a private Resurrection for brother brandham but we don't need brother brandham because we have Christ can I put it that way I don't mean that we don't need the message anymore we don't need to know about brother brandom what I mean is we don't need brother brandom to be here physically because Christ came and he is here amen where he is everything is possible do you believe that tonight everything is possible nothing is impossible he said you can speak to this mountain say be thou removed close your eyes with me if you would and bow your heads I believe now is the time we need the third polls musicians come now we need the seventh seal he said brother Ben we don't need to know that I think if there ever was a time we needed to know it Now's the Time now now we need Christ in his fullness and Christ in his fullness may not be just a good church service that's a good thing but we've always had good church services that's something we should contend for but we need to go through that little room and be healed because I got a I was born sick I was born in sin shaping in iniquity and I need to be Washed by the Water of the word until not just you know the Millennium is a time of change and during the Millennium there'll be no no there will be no war there'll be no it'll be peaceful cu the devil be bound by change of circumstance but there's a greater there's a greater renovation of the earth than what happens before the Millennium what happens before the Millennium is a minor renovation but what happens after the Millennium is a greater renovation of the earth when Satan will be done away with completely and all those that do evil be done away with completely don't you realize oh God God works with us the same way right yes we we're we're we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost we we have the power of God we're sealed to the day of our Redemption but these bodies have to be changed and this message didn't just come to give us a good service or or to let us speak in tongues or let us let us do those things though I believe in those things but that's not what it come for it come to present to us a change of the body to get us ready for that event how does it do that but we got to go through that little room what is that the opening of the word we we've got to feed on it we've got to let it be our life we got to believe it we've got to believe this message with all of our heart if there ever was a time I challenge you today believe the message of the hour now's not the time to begin saying well that doesn't matter and that doesn't matter and that doesn't matter Now's the Time to believe it if there ever was a time to believe it today is the day of salvation now is the time maybe we should just pray this way that Lord would help us to be sincere in these things when he showed him the vision of the Mamba of death show brother brand that Vision he said you must be more sincere say God help us today I need to be more sincere I need to be so invested in this that I can preach to you something that'll that'll communicate to you not just communicate justification or sanctification or the baptism of the Holy Ghost but something that'll communicate Rapture I've got to preach that in my day and if I preach the message of the hour that's what I preach I hope you understand the burden of my heart today maybe we just pray that way Lord help me be more sincere help me take it seriously Lord help me to recognize my name not live below my privileges but recognize what you've done Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I myself I need to take it more seriously Lord I I want to I want to do what you you called me to do and I know I can't do it in this age or there's no surprise to me when when preachers Fall by the wayside or even leave the message it's no surprise because a man can't do it in this age it takes Supernatural strength oh God to be a husband in this AG to be a father it takes Supernatural strength to be a mother of children to be a housewife to be to be a an example in the church it takes Supernatural strength oh I pray God as we pass through the message of the hour as we go through the opening of the word may you reveal to us what we have need of Lord may you help us Lord that when we come out on the other side we'll be able to say like they did in the vision I don't know what happened but I know I'm changed I don't know what happened but I know I'm Healed it was like I was never sick it was like I never sinned in the first place I'm so grateful for that promise Lord so grateful Lord that when we messed up and done things we can't undo and tied Noss we can't untie but Lord we know when we pass through that little room we'll be changed oh God I thank you for that help us to think spiritually Lord not to always be carnal about these things but Lord to believe you and to trust you and to love you with all of our hearts until we see your appearing Lord there'd be someone here that would say well I I just don't really understand it Lord may you may you just give them Revelation Lord may you help them to realize that it's not putting it together that's that's not how we understand lord it's by the revelation of the spirit Lord you just reveal maybe one word or one part of it that'll just speak to our heart and in our life and we'll be able to go out and take that word and defeat the enemy with it I pray You' granted a word in duee season I pray you granted tonight we ask in Jesus name amen hallelujah oh it's a reality something keeps holding me sing it now oh something holding me oh yes every day I see oh helping me Faithfully to overcome my trial let's stand together why
