blood excuse me in the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even at the fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll ones rolled together every mountain and Island were moved out of their places the thing we had just a week ago is nothing compared to this ok this is going to be widespread damage right because remember if we're talking about a nature cleansing then this is all just truly just a pre-tribulation that we're having now we get spots of this spots of that you know this is going to be widespread we're gone the wrath of God is being poured out upon the whole world all right the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountain you seen out on the internet the other day where they that rich people are now buying those old silos that the missile yeah winning and they're building a doomsday concrete that you know am at five Megaton atomic explosion they can survive so many years they just never come to this spot yeah well that one right well now they're saying they can live there for seven to eight years they're racing their own stuff they have their own water supply they're saying they can live on the ground for seven or eight years till all this radiation gets away and then they can come up out of the bed they've never seen this and they can't come this is going to deal with they're trying to they're trying to survive man because right right they're trying to survive what man's do yeah they're on survival rap the dog you can go as far down as you want to on the earth right okay all right are wherever you want to go you can't have it man the kings of the earth and the great man a rich man chief captains mighty being every bondman ever freedom hit him selves in the dens in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rock followed us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand now you got to remember sadly who sees this the religious world sinners don't care about the wrath of the Lamb they don't even know what a lamb is because they're looking for the great day of his wrath to come and he should be able to stand so this is sadly this is actually also this is the fifth I'm sorry I'm sorry this is the Buddhist version I would say 50 is not stiff to you at all it's the foolish virgins they're alive during the tribulation they're killed during the tribulation so this is Christian people that are crying out to God but see remember the deception that Satan has give us that's why I want to get on these seals because give you a secret that I found the other day remember Alexis for cleaving any venture today it works out just fine now remember now this is going to help you when we start in the sealed upstairs wind speed but we got a lot of background today all right you might got a strain in somebody Rican food and get their rebel bingo don't worry I want to show you something that they've really helped me about the seals go brother remember he he rolled up paper like this now remember it's gonna help you a lot is this the seal or it's back to see that's not the see this is the seal but the seal when it's broke so the first seal was a white horse rider but not this part this is the seal when the first seal broke this broke this didn't this is the thunder the assistant part that God wants you to see the supernatural element besides the revelation the Prophet said the revelation when this seal broke that lotmore's rivals Antichrist but it was not what John was getting ready right it was why steal that with a seal so that's one of the steel that's what we have main reactor that's not the revelation we need to get out of here this is a revelation we need to get into heaven alright so this is the wild horse riders the Antichrist like well yeah this is the outer earth there but that's what had this seal that's one had this seal same Selfoss a white righteous church God's acknowledge you and you've got it stayed over nobody can see what really I wrote because John listen I was looking in Revelation 10 John was beginning to write down what he saw so it was not so much a mystery that John could ride it right but he but say that's the part we don't get God told him the mighty angel said seal it up John with what with seven seals the seven seals we've been through really just six the six seals that we're going through now it's what back the rubber band that's one had sealed the real revelation is what we're getting underneath that okay you last s this is the thunder when the seal breaks this is not the thunder this is the thunder the unwritten part yet brother Gramps it had compared with every scripture than the Bible is and what compares with every scripture in the Bible redemption there is not one place in the Bible you cannot read without reading about Redemption that's why John was getting ready to write it down because John knew about the penance about the plan of redemption he just didn't know the whole right that's right so see that up John now there's not 14 seals he didn't break seven seals and then put several back home remember when he sealed it back up it was sealed until the seventh angel comes to break the seal of the white horse rider who is the Antichrist but what was underneath that seal was what God wanted to say what had it sealed this guy though he's not 14 sealed now I see how close they are in the Philippines seven seals on the outside and settling on the backside you can see them but they're not there's only seven seals it's the Thunder that breaks under the seat this is the seal right wild horse riders anti crud all right brother Ram tore that steel off and he left this for us because this is the mystery the mystery hidden under the seal it's the seven thunders of Revelation in seven to ten whatever here 27 so if you look at it that way now in our mind this is what I thought seal number one this is the wholesale that it's not the whole signal this is a seal that's one had sealed up it had this sealed up but that's not the sale this is the sealed the first seal that broke when he broke the seal there was a thunder the thunders a voice it dog when the seal broke now look the voice of God we know broke the seal but the voice of God is not this sealed this seal was showing the Antichrist riding off see that's why I bet a lot of people say all of them read the seal book seven seals broke what else we got a deal it's what we got do they forget the part where John was forbidden to ride and told to seal it back up and don't ride them until the time of the what in okay and that's right now that's right so when the sale comes off we get the revelation that the property Godhead and then the book of predictions oh yes for being music so let's think about that and we'll get started on that maybe not this windy but maybe a little bit later on because it really bothered me that people would say is as Bob was speaking to a person in the message what about what about what do you mean the first seal was not only to reveal the Antichrist there was a hidden mixing in it well my heavens read revelation 10 there was something sealed up to John 60 luck and at the end time the mystery of God will be finished that's the mystery the first mystery is the seal I read and closely going in them in my mind all week we're better I'm sitting beside the revelation there's a supernatural element underneath that revelation so in other words you get a revelation you said that's it no that's just oh that just that just breaks the seal and he rides off so that you can understand what God's already wrote right here so this is not something new john was starting to write it in other words it was not unfamiliar to gun because immediately when he saw him or hurt him he said and I've started in other words I began to ride let's read that smoothly don't we go to Revelation teens right and we'll read it though right now we know the crime that's Christ in verse one here in his hand a little book opened and he said upon Fuquan scene left foot upon the earth cried with a loud voice and linework when he cried seven thunders started their horses then when the seven thunders at under the horse I was about to ride there with no hesitation John was getting ready to write down waist also it wasn't to me it was a mystery to John and he was getting ready righted a and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me now remember Christ is on the earth remember the mighty angels on the ark hear a voice from heaven say sealing out there's something else happening not a second person but Christ is breaking the seal down here the seals break on earth won't the Thunder sound owner right so there's no redemption in heaven yes retention happens down here enemy okay so that's my everything happened down here that's right but the boy says seal up those things would just seven thunders uttered and write them not he stopped right there in the engine but sour sauce down seeing an eat in the earth lifted up his hands I swear it and swear by him that live forever and ever who created heaven things therein now we know that's Christ that there should be time no longer biting the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished and here declared to his servants now look at that right there why did he put that in there he didn't say his servant the prophet prophet spoke from Genesis to Revelation then was never not a prophet on the scene sure now there was a gap between let's get it right there was a gap between Malachi and Jesus of 400 years okay but what did they live off of what the Prophet said before all right so it's always white so one this is what I'm looking at is the mystery of God should be finished that he declared from Moses or Abraham or even Adam was a prophet that was the voice of God for his time rights right from them that time to the town that's a man somebody said something yes for their work they were talking about the the times and and stuff I said something about the Bible I said well the maddox something new coming I said wasn't it it's a young guy so what's new tell me what's new what's not what's new what do you mean wants to know that if the Bible doesn't tell us I said the Bible tells us then you see he comes down out of heaven in revelation 20:10 tells us what it looks like and who's don't live there how we're gonna live so that's all I need to know and then Conklin's into eternity and we do them you know we live the Bible he said you know you're right he said it does tell us all the ways we go up he talked about going home till it till we go home that's the African stream so anyway but he had declared it to his servants the prophets so those thunders have to be declared by prophets from the beginning to the end so it can't be now we know that brother Brown was the prophet in the same town ain't no doubt about that but Willie did a good job yesterday by explaining the understanding not beyond brother branham but the understanding that drew the profit gone his reveal the word for you and i write some a man that some o leading okay cuz people stuck in a pin list the people are stuck in a Pentecostal thought or a Pentecostal aid oh no no there's something hidden crack it's a secret right that's what that's what the prophets have to them the Bible word was making known was trying to reveal that was the secret right because somebody had to keep her good pulling back and identifying what the prophets had brought home went through correct and then if a couple of mystery for us to be so then you have a revelation of the mentor that's right and that's what we're getting now it's about a ministry says that this 60-ton like what were what we were going to talk about today was this seal broke in Genesis because there was a nature cleansing in Genesis the flood a huge major incident in Genesis was the flood he just cleared everything off but remember stand stayed here in ham when across the flood is started again showing that that's nothing new heaven a new earth that that is the havin trouble my brain today that's the Millennium coming into millennium everything's clear off when there's only a select group going through the devil is still back right he wasn't destroyed in the flood okay so we probably see how they saw the continuity Bible child everything yeah that's one of the thunders or cannot be anything out something about cannot be anything that the prophets had not already spoke because I will do nothing until I declare it to my servants the prophets and that right there says the same thing servants the prophets he has declared the servants of problems to none prophets is the only way we're going to get it but remember prophets were the word but remember they weren't the manifestation of their prophecy they were not the manifestation of their prophecy some of a prophesy haven't said why how does it work cannot say I failed what about a young man that I say with the young boy he was at home and I think walked out one day and said the virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child his name will be Emmanuel and all that and he walks by combing and I'm sure maybe sit down under a tree and said well that was about dumb they a person ever been born a virgin shall conceive me really because remember the Prophet that went and prophesied against Israel and then he went up on the hill and sat down and wanted to die I can't remember much wandering his head up hey God if one of them why the anointing came off them they weren't born again see now we have been privileged to have a Paul or Iranians martin luther colombo all the way up to brother branham that was a prophet that was born again because see they could write the word those prophets didn't write to her Moses now remember Moses wrote but man he was he was a special prophet amantha he was a special prophet Moses was special guy must be special because God took his body somewhere and hid it he came up into the Offaly over here somewhere he's fixing to use him again actually connected to this okay so there are special but remember everything that was declared was declared to the prophets okay now was brother Browns message the thunders yes part but no not all because remember inside his message was all the other prophets remember he had to compare with all the other prophets what he done is he brought well God did it God brought everything together so the you and I now can when the seals broke you know what a lot of people done a lot of people put the seal back on this this to them was more important than what was written here no this is the most important right because this will get us out of here this just shows you the Antichrist is and what he's doing and all of his work look like what we read but that's what struck me the other day I was trying to think of a way that I could explain that where you can understand it and I believe the Lord showed me how to do that because the seal is different than what's inside the steel is what these seals revelation sees one through whatever we're gonna read already read that's what sealed it up but it was a mystery and what I'm doing this I don't want I'd like to have one of those seals like the Romans had that they they took them and dip them they use beeswax and Cadillacs and they would make a stamp and it's stamping and what they do they roll it up and put that stamp right here because remember the seal remember give him what brother Graham said seal there's a finished work so when he sealed it this was done this thing could be written over it couldn't be added or taken away there's only one book that you can't add or take away from that's the Bible right but it was sealed out with that seagull and to the day we were death of your Redemption then the steel tore open and guess what you can see what's inside but you can't say what's inside unless that seal breaks but as it breaks I stinking the other day when I heard a clap of thunder remember it doesn't just go remember when the lightning hitting rumbles of thunder going Boom Boom remember I'm talking about roman candle do you really know when he's talking about when he said Roman camp man fireworks right okay but what is a roman candle bed you ever seen wrong that's exactly what happens and that's when he's talking about Revelation here's a roman candle and you got eight bottles go out like this this is just say five well when these go out these break off and these break up you end in now in human terminology it ends there's only so many times that it divides being God it never stops this revelation brings this revelation I mean halation which brings this business to homecoming yes it's like the time to Rolling Thunder roll boom boom boom boom boom that's not just enough oh brother Brown called it a loud clap of thunder but remember and all-natural it's not just a fun it roll it rumbles and that's what it does now this the revelation of this Mystery Continues to go on and on and on so I get through the seals first for this issue this is just a let's go back to revelation 6 I tell you what while we're over here let's go to 11 well we're at last Sunday cuz in this nature cleansing we see that this I'm not gonna read all of it we know this is the two witnesses we know what they do we know they bring destruction to the earth in a natural form now see they're not here to spiritually destroy the earth see there I am to the Gentiles Gentiles or even there their judge the door shut we're gone and they deal in and I want brother bagel and he brought out I've listed here this morning he brought out a point that's very true we get so narrow-minded I read that quote sandy I was gonna read in church my dead brother answers people so narrow-minded these he put a red pencil between their eyes and when the Prophet said that Jim come out there so narrow-minded then you put a lead pencil between their eyes and it Bible it means anything but see I was so narrow-minded thinking that the 144,000 happens to be an injury people Jacobs people which is the true twelve tribes of Israel is in Iran Iraq Turkey they're scattered everywhere they're not sitting in the city of Jerusalem they'll come back that's what's gonna make the other news Mayo but somebody from Turkey and Iran and Iraq or Syria put them in Israel right now taking tapes up ahead and put them in Israel and to me they just broke the whole thing wide open because see I narrow mind is we got Jerusalem and there's 144,000 no Jewish people are scattered everywhere we know the Jews are coming back but they are the ones looking for the Messiah yes the prophets will start in Jerusalem for heavenly days the only time it can happen is in town they go on the internet listen to social media whatever you want to call it they hear these two people speaking and they hid that Jew roots of them and the Jews that are in Jerusalem of our life no you you people are not coming in here but that's Jake those people yes Daniel spent some time in Turkey talking to some people they know they're God's people they just can't get back into Jerusalem they're the real descendants listen the 12 tribes came from Jacob right they're not saying in Jerusalem right now that's the problem they're scattered everywhere so I thought wow that's exactly why I let them the staunch Jews that are inside the city looking for the Messiah to come back and here comes my great people from Syria and Turkey and Iran and Iraq coming in saying we found it you listen these two guys preaching in your churches you must not be listening to but we hear something we've never heard before they get converted in them Jews are gonna be real ill that's a good point that was a good point because we get it in our mind that all the 144,000 remember those four twelve tribes twelve little twelve thousand people from each tribe those tribes were from Jacob and they're not in Jerusalem that some could be but not the whole of the twelve tribes they're scattered everywhere all over that Middle East and when they start converging on Jerusalem the hold forth adopts Jews are not gonna like it so that's a good point I'm here and then I just started all the 12 problems sentence somewhere in Jerusalem now there's only like three I have a million people in Jerusalem in the city proper four in Israel there's only four million people in the whole country of Israel 144,000 is not sitting in there they're out here remember they were dispersed right they were dispersed but now remember God told them where their land was up and in I had Jeremiah or somewhere he told them exactly where they would go Dan you go over here here from you go there and remember a lot of that's not in Jerusalem priory is real proper see we get narrow-minded about week we would say well that will brother branham even narrative more than that he said Palestine now Palestine not even Jerusalem remember the Palestinians are frightened Israeli they're fighting each other but he said Palestine is where Abraham was from came and that's where the cities go there he said that little spot aground in Palestine so there's a lot of things that we then you know if you just let God talk to you every once in a while like brother Dale said if you'll shut up and listen to what God said he'll tell you then it's not exactly not some people take some things that's worthless but once somebody tells you something you go and then what happens is like witness said yesterday the Holy Ghost just want to put this together not man the Holy Ghost puts him together he's just waiting on you he's waiting on you to say huh that's what that is because he's talking to uniques telling you and he's telling you these things so the same way with these two prophets when they come into Jerusalem now remember this is another thing that you got that you got 10 with it doesn't say they stay in Jerusalem it says they're killed in truth it doesn't say that anywhere in here doesn't say they stay inside the city it only says that when their time is over that they'll be in Jerusalem so they can fly the turkey free to go fly to Iran he walked serious of serious right there in Syria and Lebanon and all of the Lebanon you see what I'm talking about so let's not be so narrow-minded to profit systems they're not going to stand for three and a half years in the same place and I'm gonna stand in Jerusalem in you know no I think what I'm saying is they're moving around because fire is all the plays well you know they go to Turkey to get people out somebody comes against them because remember all the earth is plagued by them because remember it's got of it it's got to come by the preaching of the message you can't come any other way except by the preaching of the gospel the preaching of those two prophets is going to bring the 144,000 together all right so what's gonna happen is the two prophets you're gonna go out and preach just like we got hey how does some of you come in a bin stand preacher somewhere or you heard something on the internet you heard some tape to come into the message you heard of tithing you're a preacher so who's gonna get any different no kind of opens it up now where you can see on the two prophets can travel and go to different places because remember they're not gonna be heard until the three and a half years ago or so so they're like I said before last Sunday don't you think that by the time about six months when they start preaching that number one the Mossad is gonna be after them that's the KGB of Israel and then if they go to Turkey and something happens there and they get you know their intelligence agency the CIA is gonna be willing to kill them so see God's gonna protect them until that time of the three and a half years and then it says when their testimony is finished the beasts of the center now the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them why because her message is over Moscow Walmart comes down all that all that comes together right in there all right okay because the mosque of Omar Edgewater that's a store in all of Israel side you know because that thing is it's here acted right over there right over there temple it's right there in Solomon's Court so that's just a sore spot anyway but remember we'll be done but this does give us insight in this seal breaking from the from the first of the Bible all the way to the very end all the way to the book to right here when I say the end I mean the end of the world as we know it when the battle are beginning happens that'll be the end of the world as we know it and we know what is this okay that'll be the end of it from a natural occurrence yes so we've it sort of man yeah son of David if you want Jews don't have to come back to being a hundred-foot without that you say that they all in one spot the projects people but only in New York or whatever you brought in the back in sure but that will be the sign of bigoted idea he's preaching to the Jews without her memory won't be the son of David until the millennium remember he's not son of David till the Millennium so that answered the whole thing that pushes it on further that's right okay because you got a son of God son of man then brother Brown says I mean sorry son of man son of God son of David remember I preached on that not too long ago but riding between there the son of man comes back to us now what's he gonna do to Israel he's not going to son of David Sunday was over here in a millennium that's right go that's when the promise the promise in the Bible was that he would sit on the throne judging the twelve tribes of Israel there's not twelve tribes of Israel over there now recognized okay right right but watch the two prophets going to do they're gonna recognize them bring them together now look what they're going to preach they're gonna preach it so much so we're there you know Dan they're gonna know the Danites are gonna know that there's twelve thousand in there if all the ones they're gonna understand and know that they came from that tribe only two prophets can tell them that remember when brother Branham went out west to that Indian Reservation right and they had a problem with their landings and all that brother Graham sat down and said you you you grandfather and this America this one and this one way wasn't it the spirit of the life it hit the spirit of Elijah in one of these prophets that was sit down and say what makes me feel good that God have take ten people and send them down and say you come from your whole heritage was in the heritage of Levi your whole heritage was the heritage of the Damned and your home heritage was this what a powerful dog lessor 2,000 years dispersed everywhere but God knows he's actually this one the day ain't gonna bring them right now cuz remember folks you and I are Nations they're gonna be only 12,000 and he's fat that's all I don't 44,000 and - we're going interactive you can't forget the problem kind of 24,000 and - we're going on a rapture not 147 - 48 so so the spirit of a life that's going to come in and say right here this is your lineage this you know what Moses here's Moses standing there beside of him he's one set the whole thing up right he's you want to set the whole thing up back from Jacob he was the one that literally led those 12 so he's gonna be as happy as all get-out of yourself by man we're putting this back together so what uh what a great thing I don't want to be here to see it but I'd like to hear him tell about it after we get written into the Millennium I'd like for him to tell us about okay and I believe they will I believe they'll tell us about but you see how they stick sealed though is so important because it's breaking right at the very end it's breaking and it's a nature breaking because remember the two prophets are not spiritually doing anything to the world except 144,000 right that's it so the spiritual part is you and I the sixth seal has the break to us a nature cleansing by the spoken word has to clean us up to get us out of here we're the only thing standing in the way of them two prophets coming call there's no date that they're supposed be over there we're the reason of their high over there now he's getting us ready to a place to get us out of the way so that God can deal with the gym but man said God waiting on you and I adoption time when God throughout its fullness all those quotes come back to one you know the Prophet is telling us so it's a nature cleansing becomes by the spoken word because remember all these things are happening in nature now is happening because of the devil the devil is the prince in power the air so that hurricane that was all the devil but these two prophets though are going to call a nature cleansing by the spoken word of God take 144,000 out start the world into chaos and then leave right so the seal is broke what is that seat sealed the prophecy two prophets they are that seal but now look what underneath that see what we've just been talking about and we can keep talking about we can keep talking about but the seal is the two prophets once that's broke we can see everything else is underneath and how it all connects together let's go [Music]
