========================================

well you're own all right let's take our Bibles and turn over to the book of Hebrews chapter 9 you want to look at uh verse 19 got it say Amen amen for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and Scarlet wool and hissop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the new testament which God hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and with without shedding of blood is no remission let's have a word of prayer Our Father Lord we just come to you this morning Lord with such grateful hearts Lord thanking you father for another wonderful day that you've made Lord we're here to praise you to glorify you and to honor you and Lord I I'm I'm humble Lord I I'm not worthy Lord to be in this position but father as you blessed us Lord Lord we just thank our brother Lord for the opportunity to stand for you and we just ask you to take total and complete control of every word we say every thought Lord may you bless your people and help them is our prayer and our desire bless the words that we've read father we know they are already anointed in Jesus name amen amen so we're looking at at this we know it's the Tabernacle that was in the wilderness and as we look at the Tabernacle um I'm the easel as you look at the Tabernacle God had Moses to build every bit of this according to God's pattern the pattern that God showed Moses and he told Moses don't you deviate one bit bu it exactly the way I said to all right and then Moses came back and told the people but then what did God do God took two men and he placed within those men the knowledge of how to do these things and so it was not until God chose those two men and placed with them the the knowledge of how to do it that it was actually done all right so then the Tabernacle the tent everything there was built exactly according to to the pattern that God showed Moses in the mountain now when when that was all complete the Tabernacle was complete everything looked just the way God had showed Moses then it had to be Sanctified right and it was Sanctified by that blood that was sprinkled upon it but it still wasn't complete because God still wasn't there right that's right it wasn't until that pillar come down and rested on that Mercy Seat that God was actually there that's right so when we look at that that actually represents you and I right you come in here you make a sacrifice what do you sacrifice your life is a Living Sacrifice you make the sacrifice and then you're washed washed in the water of the word Sanctified set aside for service justification sanctification you go into the holy Place baptism of the Holy Ghost but then you still don't have God dwelling in you you've got to get back into the holiest of holies and that's where you and him have perfect communion until then you can go in and out up and down left and right have all kinds of of things going on but when you once pass through that Veil and he closes the door behind you then you and him are sealed in together you're sealed in Satan's sealed out as a prophet of God said Satan can't come to you but you can you can go to him and what what we do often times is we step so to speak out of that Holy place what are we talking about brother Tim you and I were all born the wrong way that's right and that nature is always trying to take control of your vessel now the vessel itself is not the nature it's just the house just like the house you live in at home that's right that house doesn't so to speak have a spirit of its own right but when you come into it you bring the life into the house that's right but you and I are just a little different cuz we have our own Natural Spirit and until the Holy Ghost himself comes in and takes up his Abode right the wrong Spirits always in control right amen and so as we look at those things it's the very pattern back there was a tie because they never did Moses never had the Holy Ghost dwelling inside him like you and I have that's right amen now he had a seed down inside right right but he could not have that seed take total control of his vessel because Christ himself had not yet died so the Holy Ghost could not dwell in Moses Moses could not be the perfect type of Christ right because he couldn't have the Holy Ghost taking total control but yet Joseph got so close so close right but yet there was always something y okay brother you you you can go back to being brother W good job good but as as you look at that pattern that's like an an eternal pattern because it just keeps repeating all down through the scriptures over and over and over it didn't stop at the Tabernacle in the wilderness the moving Tabernacle no it became Solomon's Tabernacle and then from Solomon's Tabernacle it became the one that Herod built and now well it was actually the the one that zerubabel built and then the one that Herod built and now now they're waiting to build another One MH but in between those last two comes the true Tabernacle amen right yes sir anybody know what that true Tabernacle isus Jus us us right yep because we're the body right that he dwells in we're the Tabernacle no you not you are the Tabernacle that's right of the Holy Ghost the temple amen so we're that Temple and as we look at those things we step back and we look at the message of the hour if your spirit that's in you is reckoned dead and you're are anointed with a life that was in Christ is upon you that's Romans 8:11 now this is it is the rising of the sun paragraph 8 uh 69 if the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you it also quickens your mortal body amen that same life them same Powers them same beneficiaries that he had here on Earth from God he redeemed you a seed that was for on by God Amen whose names was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that's right and the Gospel Light of the Resurrection the confirmation of the word that's it how did we know he was the Christ because he proved what he talked about amen How will I know the message of the hour God proves what he promised and he talks about it that is the identification that we are beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he has talked about so we we have today the proof mhm of the Resurrection yes sir if that same Spirit dwells in you right and so often we do not allow that Spirit to really control our life we That's right The Human Side takes control and that's when we stumble and fall that's when when we have doubts when we have fears because in him there is no fear sir he is love perfect love and perfect love casteth out all fear all doubt that's right and when we step out of that holiest of holies and we step into that Holy place that's when the doubts and the fears and all those things take control that's right and we you and I should seek to dwell in that holiest of to never come out of that holiest of Hol Satan's job is to draw you out amen that's his task that's what he is put here to do because God has chosen him to be so to speak our Perfection because the trials and the tribulations of your faith brings about your Perfection and it's always trying to pull you out of that perfect position the scripture tells us that by our words we shall be justified or we shall be condemned so the power of life and death It also says lays in the tongue so the power of life is in the tongue you know brother Brown makes the statement that the lips are the sex glands yeah now that staggers so many people until you go back and look at what the Original Seed is exactly the Original Seed is the spoken word so the spiritual sexual Affair that Eve had with a serpent was her yeah yeah was what he told her right he drew her out with that spiritual sexual Affair by the tale that he told her and he drew her out and once he Drew her out of that holiest place she no longer had protection so now he woed her and he got her to come out to him and it was over with boom because then the flesh followed the spirit and the same thing happens every day in this world by people all over the world that's right now one of the things that we often forget is that sinners are not condemned for sinning that's right they're not condemned for drinking smoking cussing carrying on adultery all those things that's right right the prophet said they're condemned on a higher level right and that higher level is they have rejected the sacrifice right right now he said only Christians can sin that's right I TR that's such a staggering thing it's so far from the denominational ideah that people in the world can't believe it but it's been given to you and I so we can understand our daily walk our daily Journey that's it because when Jesus brought them in to the upper or the not the upper room but the Last Supper MH and he instituted foot washing and communion M what did he tell Peter he told Peter if I don't wash you you have no heart in me that's right and then Peter turns right around and says well wash me all over head hands he said you don't need to be washed all over just your feet y the hands and the feet is what was washed in that picture right there if you look at that that labor you will see and you go back into Exodus there and you find out what God told those those priests to do was to wash their hands and their feet what was the representation it's the representation of you and I having foot washing washing when I wash your feet it's my hands that's getting washed and then you in turn wash my feet my feet get washed your hands get washed that's right and what is that doing it's washing away away the daily quote sins that we get caught up in because we walk in the world yes you can't help the filth that surround you you you you have to walk in it God put us here for that purpose that we can be lights in a dark and sinful World we're put here for that purpose we're not put here to be monks set aside in some place to never interact with the people we're put here to be a bright and Shining Light we're not supposed to be a a candle put under a bushel right we're supposed to be out here walking among the people so that somebody can see your light and they can hunger and thirst after righteousness and be filled just like you are AB so that's the whole purpose of it and the Lord when he instituted that foot washing it was already pictured way back there in the very beginning it was coming and it's that foot washing that had to take place right you had to be cleansed you first had the sacrifice then you were cleansed and then once they were cleansed then they could go into the holy place to perform the service unto the Lord right so sanctification cleans you and sets you aside but it doesn't put you in service the prophet of God said the baptism of the Holy Ghost puts you in service so you go into that Holy place and then you can be in service to the Lord maybe you are praying for somebody else just like the altar of incense right there that's right the the in the Book of Revelations we're told that that incense is the prayers of the Saints so when you take that and look at it see it's pictur all the way back in the beginning what started you end with what you start with it has to be the same picture at the end am and whenever you look at that you and I walk into that hole holy place as an intercessor for someone else offering up prayers for their needs that's why you had the the prayer requests that were given here earlier that's what we do because we are Kings and Priests that's right and in that Priestly office we offer up those prayers into the Saints we also take the natural Candlestick and see to it that that light continues to burn that's right what the church Church yes right this church is a light into this un this little neighborhood so you keep the church in good working order you pay for it you take care of it you come you service to the Lord play music somebody's got to clean the floor somebody's got to do this somebody's going to do that it's all part of the service unto the Lord and it's just showing from way back there and today it's the same picture it did not change the type and now we're the antitype we are actually doing the service unto the Lord but then it goes beyond service and into the fullness of communion right so you had to First be justified with a sacrifice Sanctified with the cleansing at the labor then baptized with the Holy Ghost to bring you into that Holy place because if you never get into the holy place you can't get into the holiest of holies that's right but there's no door from the holy Place into the holiest why there's no door on the outside why because it's picturing you and I there's no door handle on your heart and on my heart it's that free moral agency it's that your own self-will you choose to open that door unto the Holy Ghost if you don't open it then the only thing that God can do with you is baptize you with the Holy Ghost to the spirit level and use whatever gift he's put in your life for his purpose amen amen and that's why the prophet of God could say you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost every day of your life and die and go straight to hell that's right because that place of communion was never opened up unto the Holy Ghost so he himself could take possession of that vessel and that's the reason that you and I today must have that token life of Jesus Christ dwelling in us because it is what gives us the right to take the Rapture right amen it's that token life on display that will bring about the rapture it will literally take you into the Rapture you can't miss the Rapture if you've got that token life it's impossible for you to miss the Rapture that's right amen because it's what's going to cause the Rapture that's right and even now we're already in the Rapture because we have as a as a prophet has told us throughout the message that we already have begun that because we have already changed from somebody who love to drink smoke carry on do all those things to a person that loves to serve the Lord to read the word to do the things with the Fellowship of The Brothers and Sisters in Christ that before you wouldn't have anything to do with that's right thank you know I can remember a time when I told my natural Dad don't even talk to me about God anymore I don't even want to hear it m see I want nothing to do with it why because I was following my own way that's right I thought but I was actually following Satan's way that's right because there's only two ways there's God's way and there's Satan's way and you will serve one of those two masters there's no other Spirits out there although people try to make it out that there is a third way there is a gray area but there's no such thing it's either right or it's wrong it's either God doing it or it's Satan amen so you and I walk in a world today that they have made it so great there's no such thing as God or the devil yeah oh yeah they're the same thing yeah right that's right but you and I know the truth amen sir and the truth not only will set us free but we can in turn impart that same freedom to others if they will take the time to lend their ear and listen to what we have to say right that's right so as we look at this in the invisible Union of the Bride the prophet of God says and so were you sons of God and Daughters of God before there even was a moon stars or a molecule you are Sons and Daughters of God for you are the you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning that's right for there's only one form of eternal life and that was God right that ain't what he said no and that was you that's right before you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you was in your Earthly father right but you are manifested too In His Image in the image of God you are made and you were manifested for the glory and The Fellowship Of God y now if we go back to that Tabernacle like I said in the very beginning it was all fine and good and done perfectly and everything was there that was supposed to be even after the blood had been sprinkled on it everything was now Sanctified and ready yep but it took that atmosphere of God himself coming down and when he settled down over that Mercy Seat then that Tabernacle was complete right because the purpose that it had been made for it was now doing right right and you and I were made to be Sons and Daughters of God from the very beginning and just like that Mercy Seat housed the word down inside of it it was under that Mercy SE it was down on the inside yes you and I come to this Earth with the word buried within us but it takes that atmosphere of the Holy Ghost to strike that word dwelling within you and when that Holy Spirit anoints that word life comes from the sea that it was dwelling within it from the very beginning that's right because in the Book of Genesis it says that God put the seeds out there and the life was within the seed right it's there but it takes something to strike it to bring it to life how many times have we heard the prophet of God say on tape how that that baby would come into the Earth the water would come the blood would come and the baby comes forth he said and then something would have to strike it right a shock a little spank and then the life comes it takes that right atmosphere and it's the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost himself that drops in and brings to life what's within the sea exactly now it also does it for the wrong s because just as it brought forth Jesus Christ it brought forth Judas is car just as it brought forth Peter it brought forth cesis so all these things that we see whatever life is in the seed that's what the holy spirit's going to bring forth yes I have a question does that does that make God a respector of person if he if he decided to choose his seed in some people and the wrong seed in other people before they were does it make him a respect of person it does not because of who he is because of his great for knowledge he knew the end before there ever was a beginning so he knew what Esau was going to do God knew Esau was going to sell to Jacob his Birthright God knew Esau despised the birthright before Esau was ever born right and he knows what choice you will make what choice I will make he knew what choice William Brandon would make he knew Jeremiah what Choice he would make he told Jeremiah I knew you before you were ever conceived I knew you and made you a prophet into the Nations so it's because of his great forn knowledge that he knows therefore he can predestinate that's right the for knowledge is the key but if he did not know then that would make him a respector person that's right but because he knows what choice we'll make before we ever make it then that makes him just and righteous so if you have the desire in your heart to serve God you're on the right path even if you keep failing um I'm asking this for my sister I'm sure even if you keep failing and you're trying yes you know God still with you take care of it amen let let me put it this way there is a thirst all right right but before you can have a thirst there has to be something to satisfy The Thirst first so the satisfier is here first so if you have a thirst to serve God God is here right to satisfy that thirst so if you continue to walk the scripture says they that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled that's right so just keep walking keep walking and God will open up unto you what's necessary for you to have that righteousness yes and going into that Tabernacle when you were in that outer Court there was no covering so when it rained you got wet right when the Sun was shining you had good days so you have good days and bad days in that outer Court of the Walk of justification but as you go into that inner Court that's right it was veiled it had a shield over it it shielded you from all the outside stuff so walking in justification man you going have lots of ups and downs and ins and outs doubts fears all those things brother BR said the only way you know that you're a child of God is you get up and go again right and not quit and not quit it don't matter how many times you fall it really doesn't it just matter how many times you get up absolutely absolutely you say 25 after yeah that's close we need we got a big crowd thank you brother Tim good question
