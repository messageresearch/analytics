messages will maybe try to be through this series and maybe just do some the preaching parts of it you know to try to pick up some things to be understood remember now the Bible study will be the first Saturday in October so we remember that and then remember the fall festivals of what 27th 27th so remember that in the new and as Terrence has announced Alf as of today he doesn't have to call me sir he has to call me sir up until it gets a certain part now he catches up with me so he doesn't have to call me sir so then there will be cake and ice cream after the evening service yeah and then two of the Lord willing brother Daniel will be ministering brother Martinez will be ministering they say Martinez we say this we say that we got us we got a place in the country down there and they've got a whole name to put people they could fill up the whole county and we call it Martinez you know then they say Martinez I think he knows who he is anyway some that that would be alright but he'll be ministering the Lord willing this coming Wednesday for us and just prayed the Lord would bless okay any other announcements October as I said the festival October 27th so get everything ready for that and there will be ministers coming on in there we still don't know for certain yet about brother Vernon from the Philippines because they haven't let us know where everything's worked out for her to be able to get her passport or whatever it has to be done to get her to be able to come so just pray the Lord would bless and lead in that okay father we thank you for your grace and your love thank you for all things and we ask you now to just be with us as we try to minister your word under your people and you come and speak to our hearts and let your loving grace be with us thank you for all things and we praise your great names you said you promised us that you'd be with us and it should send your word and it would heal us and deliver us from destruction so we believe you thank you for these things we love you in Jesus name Amen seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently now how is it that we're born again being born again not of corruptible seed not of our thoughts or ideas and things what is it but of incorruptible now what is incorruptible you say well there's something that can't be corrupted okay then what does the scripture say by the Word of God so that's the incorruptible Rite which liveth and abideth for ever mmm-hmm then we'll go to the second Peter Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith now who's he writing this to to the church it's not written to the world it's to those who are born again Christians fill with the Holy Spirit walking in the light of the love of God all right Simon Peter serve it an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises what did the prophets say by these promises all right that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity you may be seated Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now trying to trying to climax adult with us you know into the doings and we'll try to then well I guess we need to do right about now is how questions and answers so anybody has any questions anything about what we've been talking about on the statue of a perfect man you know would you please turn them in and that way I can cover them we'll take a whole service we'll take whatever it needs to be able to get you to understand because we won't we want everybody to know what it's being said I want you to know what I'm saying now whether or not you agree with it or what you do that's between you and God I can't determine that part but I want to make sure that you know what I mean all right so then if there's nothing else just write out brother Dale what do you mean you know I don't I don't have no problems with anybody with questions I love questions and answers we have that once a month and we do we have a wonderful time because we just let everybody get involved anybody can ask the question anybody can answer the question so that's the way I love it to work we can fellowship together around the word all right now you have to have a controlling factor arrived so we try to control that point as two things but yet still you know we want to to keep it in that but now we've been talking about the statue of a perfect man and we've read here over and over and over as Peter is saying and we've covered the the emphasis back word that you know that we're built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone built upon what they teach all right so here's Peter coming over to teach the church how to come to where he's at what does the schoolteacher do you know I mean what what disease you know schoolteacher what does the schoolteacher do they teach you what they know or what they've experienced or what they've been brought through and there's no need of of sitting there you know if I was a schoolteacher I would emphasize like I did with one of the brothers who went overseas with and I said not listen brothers you'reyou're emphasizing here that God sent a prophet I said all that's well and good you've done a marvelous job of presenting it but now next year are you going to take that little maybe a couple of hundred and maybe they might get two or three more hundred and two and you're gonna put them all in one group and and you're gonna teach them over again that brother Branham was a prophet I said that's not very much advancement I said what you need to do is you need to take these you've already taught it set them aside with someone to teach them what the Prophet taught well you know we got a I got a notice that the country heads from where they were sending these things the people said you have told us that God sent a prophet now teach us what he taught well that would should be what should be the joy and the thoughts of thoughts of all of it and that's what I've tried to make emphases off Peter writes the Statue of a perfect man here in 2nd Peter and he's already spoken first Peter about being born again and the different things you know you know and how that takes place and then when he comes to second Peter he says addressing these to them of like precious faith you read the book the message you're supposed to or the statue of a perfect man that what you you this is not addressed to the world this is addressed to those that are in Christ but this dress to the babies in Christ that we may grow thereby and grow into the virtues and things to were they were because why would you teach it any other way that they're growing into that and we've covered now to try to get the emphases we've covered that even Paul picks up and run around said Paul and Peter he said they only confer just a little bit there so matter-of-fact bro run said he never told but it never did but they did because it you know there is a little section that Paul and Peter was together for a few days but yet they never discussed probably the message or anything Paul goes one way Peter another Paul comes back out he meets God on the backside of the desert he comes out preaching the same thing Peter preaches so they can't be any difference between Peter of the statue of a perfect man as he's expressing that you add to your faith virtue or knowledge temperance patience I don't like it they can't be any different that in Paul saying that adoption that you're born into the family then your positionally placed in the family or adopted in to the family you know and all and they got to be saying the same thing because that is the essence of the Word of God alright now I've tried to make that emphasis over and over and over to us the word this is not written to sinner's the Bible is not written to sinner's it can only tell a sinner days lost it is not for him it can only tell him he's lost he needs to be saved oh yeah hate and read the judgments or whatever you know things like that but still it's not for him it's only for those that are in Christ Jesus as babies to grow in the word and understand and that's what that's my emphasis for 40 years now so I might as well just keep on going it you know because that's what I believe I believe what the Prophet taught all right but now knowing that we have to understand by way of the Prophet I emphasize especially the last message and the one a little prior to it though the things that what that you can't take natural wording of human terminologies because remember the best you can do this Bible was handed down to us from Greek Hebrew etc etc all right in that doing that would have to be God to keep it straight all right and he did keep it straight that's why I love the King James Version because it is a translation of translations the King James Bible is not a translation from from the manuscripts as much as some of the others some of the things you won't even read good news to modern men he's taken a lot of it from Greek scholar you know the the the Hebrew the Greek but they brought the King James Version is the translation of translations and brought it unto us and I believe that don't you and I believe God vindicated it by the Prophet coming and using that to speak to us of the things that God wanted us to know well our huh see then in the natural wording as I've emphasized as it came down when you come to virtue our natural word runs it to virgin birth you know all right you know I'm an excuse me virginity all right to wear that you're just a virgin but that's not run around said that's not according to what this is saying this is saying virgin T as a virtuous life our our you know living in Christ and and having to these things to dwell within us all right see then that way you can't just take something to say well I believe this well I see we've had a prophet now if he went to a theologian he'd tell you that this leans over to this he wouldn't give you the answer that it can be brought over here to a virtuous life in time all right just like him in patience and temperance and time all right if you asked a theologian or interpreter an interpreter a translator from the Bible terms is not supposed to be translating what he thinks he's translating words right you know I mean those people that bring in us those things are translating words they're not supposed to be translating by revel they're not supposed to write it now this is what I think they're supposed to put down what it is said and that's what it is so the natural would be the Virgin part the temperance would be not drinking alcohol right that would be what would be there from the theological side of it but here comes a prophet to tell us what God is saying and that's why I love it that way see who would have read of Peter there in Chapter you know the first chapters 2nd Peter we're talking about - those that are like precious faith where would the theological terminologies be able to express that and tell us what that's saying I say and this is only written to those that are already born again he's already covered the new birth in chapter 1 you know in in first Peter 1 he's already covered the new birth being born again that's why I keep reading that over and over and over and over he's already explained it now he's telling you how to a growth development to get to where he was like a school teacher is trying to get you to pass the test right and all of that and go down through there and we could come in to a lot of things of tutors and think of the statue of a perfect man because they said they'd say actually real true where you go to college and you get a tutor that when when it's finished of that grade it's not you passing the test it's the tutor but he's instilled into you once you answer the questions is what he told you so who's Tyson's ask the tutor all right the Holy Ghost is one person to test it all of us all right but now listen here's the thought for a little bit see you you that way you can say well the Prophet says this so we got to go by what he says all right and when we go by what he says then we can understand all right so if he says something that sounds contrary to the natural who are we supposed to follow we're not supposed to follow the theological side or terminologies of what a word says we're to follow it as to what the Prophet brought us from the word for us to see that all right so Peter says add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness add to your faith all right now there's a key there that we need to understand okay now to look at the pyramid that's what we call it all see you'd call off and you'd say well there's one two three four five six seven eight two three four five six seven eight well there's only seven Church ages so now we've done fall we're done fell off you know we're missing the point so we go back to the prophet and we ask him say what does it mean then okay all right so this is what he says the brothers will pull it up back there off the statue of a perfect man paragraph 141 okay now here is what we do what's the first thing how faith and be born again that's laying the foundation okay now what is the foundation faith what do you do now faith and be born again okay yeah then after you lay the foundation secondly you add to your foundation add to your faith Peter says here first you have faith then you add virture to your faith this is the next column first pour your fat pour your foundation faith then do your faith at virtually all right going to the next one progress 65 of blasphemous names they were through that one so all right I'll give you these what we're gonna walk them back there so I guess you see me carrying the notes you know look what he says first foundationally it's faith second add to your faith now is that what Peter says add to your faith virtue all right now I want you to look and thank women for a minute you say well you know you're just you're too much this that but now I want you to give me the answer if you could do it hey we got to go to the Prophet and let him answer the question so have we got how many ads have we got in this pyramid I mean the ads see that's where you you don't follow what the Prophet said faith is not an ad now I've taught you that for 30 or 40 years all right so it's not new all right faith is not an ad faith is a birth first how faith and be born again they don't say had faith the Prophet didn't say ad food he said how faith and be born again all right now then he says ad virtue okay see how faith can be born again add to your faith virtue to her virtue our knowledge etc etcetera company now that's what it takes to become a servant of Jesus Christ Christ builds his church in seven Church ages his bride a personal woman Church seven Church ages constitute and make the bride somehow they say some of this and you know a different one all right seven church ages okay now think about it so you're mathematically gonna get yourself out of line if you don't follow the Prophet C and what he's saying okay let me make sure we're getting this tape I got 65 back up to the top of let's read a little bit on the 65 code we got a little key in there hey Virtanen add to your faith it's not yours it's God give it to you but when he gives it to you it becomes yours the virtues are not your virtues they're God's virtues but when he gives them to you they belong to you is everybody with me but he's got to give them to you all right see so we know the Prophet said you have faith him be born again he said don't worry about the rest he said Carter's going to be automatically added what automatically because God is going to add to his own faith so how faith and be born again and watch what he say it you had temperance and patience and from godliness to brotherly love brotherly kindness and then love being the capstone seven of those things seven of those times how many virtues are they if you say well okay faith is a virtue then if you're doing it the other way you got one two three four five six seven eight and you're running off if you say faith is a birth a baby when it's born it's born the baby right it's not something that is it does or whatever it comes forth as a child all right the end it can be added to that child to the word can grow up the food to the scene so he said now there's seven things no brother branham seven things if you're saying faith isn't add you got eight things but what if he's saying faith is a birth not an ad then you add virtue so now you got one two three four five six seven see we're having to go to the Proverbs we can't go to a theologian to ask him a question because he couldn't answer the question but the Prophet can answer the quiz so how many ads right how many verses on seven and when the ads are they seven all right so you get what I told matter this past Wednesday night I didn't bring these all right now go to God's only provided place of worship then I gave him these sisters which would be 1a now look what he's talking about in 1965 all right he's talking about the pyramid being those foundations up into the King's Chamber and just before you hit the seventh wall there's a little introduction point where a messenger comes out to bring you to the king the messenger John the Baptist that introduced to the king but the headstone was rejected and they don't know the stone is grown and whatever it is they don't know where it's at because it's a rejected stone but that's the stone that caps the whole thing that makes it to pyramid through the complete seven Church ages not eight ages or anything seven ages aren't now look had grace had this at this where is he that second Peter right he doesn't call it out but that's his his point right look there are seven adds alright now we got him in sixty five three years almost later and he still holds his point that there's seven adds and look at the key the last one is Christ so what is the last the headstone which is Christ see I'm just trying to make something natural to where you can look at it for you to get the spiritual application of it of the new birth so how many how many virtues are they if you make faith a virtue then you run out with the wrong number but if faith is a birth or a baby coming into the world then it starts just growing right okay alright so in the statue of a perfect man what is it how faith and be born again that's the new birth then add to your born to get experience virtue knowledge temperance you come out with your numbers being correctly and you've got seven virtues and seven adds and all of it fits into the right category to where that you can look at what the Prophet is saying to us all right he's not taking a theological side because it would be dealing with a number eight that's fine we can go with the number eight and we will eventually but yet still hold a point and many virtues are they you said with a it faith or it see no you can't start on faith faith is a new birth see that's why Paul is so important to understand adoption with Peter of the statute of perfect man because Paul is dealing with the child being born into the body a natural child born into a natural family is what Paul is using adoption to express which is the what which is the new birth to bring us into the body of Christ giving us new eternal life and then the growth development of the child is the adding of the virtues so Peter and and James is doing the same thing our Peter Peter and Paul are teaching the same thing that way you can hold the Bible together with understanding to follow where we're at alright see then there's the importance of it okay you can't take the ages and go into eternity you're going to injure ages and eternity will start eternity will be the eighth right that's your eighth but you stay with long as you're staying with the ages so there's seven church ages there are seven virtues one for each age and that's why that then there's no problem when we come in to what we were trying to do there Wednesday then what we were talking about the odd part of how that's in the natural Philadelphia in the natural would be called godliness because it's Philadelphia meaning brotherly kindness but then here comes a prophet alone and he puts lady OCU as brotherly kindness that's what I was trying to get you to say that's the same thing you're just looking at it wrong one of them is bringing out an age or a point of an age the other one is bringing out the age that we're living in all right and see it's wonderful then if we understand it now if I get time I got a lot to read on these things but you know if not we're picking up later because listen Church we're talking about something supernatural something spiritual something by revelation that must be understood that's why people try to understand the message by intellect and you can't do that and what's so funny is here I spend my time taking these things to show that they do not contradict one to the other one that they come out to say the same thing and lay it out in perving on the one that's called the inner life I don't get to have I'm sorry I don't get that what you're saying is I don't understand what you're talking about to the yeren intellect if Paul said when I went to him whatever says it have I become your enemy because of told you the truth you know have I spent my whole life to try to bring this message and break it down to the people and become the enemy to the people you know an enemy to it and then when it does see then I make statements and people do really go haywire I said come and explain it I said come and explain it explain to me how are you going to get number-wise without going the way that I went if you put faith as a virtue you've got eight count but if you do what the Bible say it add to your faith virtue is added to your faith it's your faith God has given this is my I the Prophet said God gave it to me he gives us the new birth that's the faith of God that's a revelation of Jesus Christ to you there's a new birth there's your baptism of the Holy Ghost but that people can't understand what brother Branham says it and blaspheme his name he said it's a moment most missed out they ain't talked correctly of the baptism see how no problem we're saying the born-again experience right here of faith is the baptism of the Holy Spirit but then that in here comes a baptism of the Holy Spirit hooking up to your headstone because I'm teaching a baby born into the family is that Paul is that Peter born into the family you burn then a growth development goes into that child to bring that child up until it has the very nature of the father then it'll fit together I don't have to deny anything the Prophet says bring it to them and let's say I mom I'm serious I cry in my heart you think I'm exalted and all these that you know I cry in my heart I'm trying my best to get you to see Jesus Christ that's always been my goal not to see ideas and thoughts and things but to see Jesus Christ but to be able to take the entire Bible listen church there's doctrines that says if this what I'm talking about right you're gonna have to turn this pyramid upside down now some of you heard those doctrines but wasn't you paying attention then the dead didn't you order realize hey wait a minute that was wrong but wouldn't brother Adams coming up here and he said he said you come all the way up here to God in this place that's really worried stop he said you ain't got to hold a ghost yet we'll look it up he he he said we didn't have no Holy Ghost you don't have the Holy Ghost like they had it you have the new birth that faith that is your new birth that is the baptism with all go that is the 3,000 outside that receive the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost and brother Branham said what the baptism of the Holy Ghost exactly like the day of Pentecost some people say what I just don't see how they can be that does that change it cuz we don't see it but we ought to see that hey what we're doing the reason we're here we've had 50 years to study the message to get it were that it's not contradictory which the people are still to the point you say something and then we'll computers gonna keep it up yeah but he don't understand if he understood this right here that brother so-and-so talked then I say well listen come on get brother someone so let's talk and no problem I'm not arrogant or hateful or mean I'm trying to be the truth if brother sword so can straighten us out get him if we need straightening out let's get what it's straightening that that's all I've ever done but it makes me sound like seated I'm some kind of a hair I got a hateful old dude that don't listen to nobody else I'll listen to you but I ain't gonna listen to you say well this is the way I think it is brother damn don't tell me what you think tell me what the prophets said well I think he meant now don't tell me what he meant I didn't tell you what he meant when he said that to be a virgin part of the statue of a perfect man they weren't it says you know virtue that that has don't have anything to do with a natural virgin person did I interpret that or did not read what he said well I just don't like your witness praise God I don't like it either but I've done I've hollered and screamed this for 50 years so there's no need to quitting now we just keep on hammering it because I can show you where I preached this 40 years ago this away got the tapes to cover it be glad for you to listen to them let's see people doing the listen they want their ideas and their thoughts unless I think was brother Oh see that's where even that's not well we don't have no right to think I didn't say that your prophet said sheep have no rights now you talk to him mother he's a cheap no hell no rights they forfeit all right a born-again Christian today you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior you you've supposed to have forfeited all of your thoughts and ideas that were contrary to the Word of God I said supposed to admit we didn't I said we we studied out things on our own and tried to do this out the other but see after a while you come to find out that what we're doing is just beating our head against the wall back up listen to the Prophet and many ads are they he said seven heads and many virtues are they seven virtues faith is not a virtue faith is a birth perchik one two three five six seven seven virtues now the message is right the Prophet is right well I've always know that what you did you said you did and I'm just saying you make it up on your own mind there's seven ads and the last ads the women got to it you we're covering it now on virtue I mean on the on charity coming to the last we've come through dealing with all of the virtues and things up to where that we got to brotherly kindness and we're brother branham covers I did in that whole message I gave you the quotes where you wouldn't think I was twisting it do wrong brother Branham says the six church age was Philadelphia then he says the age that we're living in now is brotherly kindness and that's the seventh church age now what are you saying brother Branham when I like is the one that I gave you you have it somewhere in here my brother branham explains he said to sit the seventh church age the sixth church age flows over into the seventh you know how each age was they flowed over into the other like a star snip he said the sixth church age flowed over into the seventh he says seven church age is really just to carry on of the sixth so the age of itself and the virtue for that age in comparison to the things of that age it's brotherly kindness the virtue of the six church age that goes into brotherly kindness but just curious or I don't over into the seven to carry it on into brotherly kindness being the message to the seventh but did you listen let me get to this honor did you listen I've listened three times so far so I think order know whether you say you said so-and-so will come and show me than I said so-and-so I'll tell you whether it's right or not good I done heard it three times this week you see the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Prophet said on blasphemous names he said the messenger was pouring the water of the sister Sheppard's dream into the rock box but said it run out and bought out all of the trash he said then said he took honey and poured it in and he said honey held right because he said the Holy Ghost no age can hold a Holy Ghost he said the individuals hold all the flesh not the age or anything like that it can't be done all right so then what was he saying the Holy Ghost that you receive as your new birth begins to start bawling out all of the trash I said it begins because it it has a long journey in most of us and I'll agree with that that we all have problems with this that or the other that's why I'm trying to teach it the way I have and never been to a point of people saying well I'm born again bless God I'm perfect you can only be perfect in Jesus Christ so now what do you saying are you saying you're perfect are you saying he's perfect which one's right we know he's perfect and if he comes and lives in us then he's still perfect living in us but he said he said what was that water he said that was that Holy Ghost boiling out all that trash right and he said it won't hold it run out and run down he said but then he took honey and poured it in and he said it didn't look like it was gonna hold but he said it did hold and he said brotherly kindness is what the honey represents and he said Darby is this age because that's where we've had on blasphemous name paragraph 125 and the honey represented brotherly love brotherly kindness which is the age I just got through telling see of brotherly kindness the age that we live in now so then there's a compound meaning of the Holy Ghost there's a compound meaning in the point of of brotherly love you can have Philadelphia as being brotherly love and you can have it the church age and you can have it with a great missionary endeavor to send to the world that was brotherly kindness but that was not the full meaning of brotherly kindness because they were I told you then the other day they was true and false into that there was true and false into that age but what about when you come to a message that is so pure until honey is the only thing hidden represent it with and he said he poured the honey in and he said to honey he'll and he said that's a very age that we're living in now is the age of brotherly cognition do you see what it's getting at the Holy Ghost is getting greater and greater to me the growth development each one of these now listen each one of these is a birth you're born in the faith you've birthed into virtue vert and the knowledge birth into tempers he said well I didn't know we had that many births a birth means they're coming forth in to get you dicks in there in just look I mean coming forth into a baby is born into the world it comes forth into the world right and says these virtue is that if God is birthing that sealing it in but you're gonna prove within the seal hold it or not because one day you're gonna seal the whole thing you go not seal the whole thing that was what I was trying to get you to see Wednesday so the honey that poured in is a whole lot greater sealed in water because that honey would hold its the deeper understanding of the Holy Ghost and what God is doing right he gave these virtue to each age and sealing that in brings us to the basis of whether that would deal with brotherly love during the six thirty eggs flow that right on over into the seventh church age and you got brotherly kindness because in the seventh church age he's not only pouring the message in now listen listen to what I tried to say Winston let's see if you got it he was pouring in the message to bawl out the trash come on then he brought his own message he wouldn't listen to that Wednesday you said well young is missing no see you got a poor in the faith of the fathers you got to come up the Statue of a perfect man to where it comes to the basis that you can be able to comprehend the seals brother Browns message never begun in 4846 come on and give you quote after quote but especially like the rapture his message begun after the opener or as the opening of the seals right in 262s right at the end of 62 going into 63 he goes and starts looking in the forty and the fifties or sixties in especially in fact spoken words regional seat he brought the message to show the faith of the fathers read the spoken words regional see he brings a message to show the faith of the fathers and showing that he taught it correctly but then he says Lord what will I do I got him out on the limb he said where can I go from here now you remember reading that spoken word regional seat he said got him out on the limb and what did God say said pick up your pen and write he picked up his pen and he verified the exact message that brother Branham was preaching he wrote it read that part where he said the Holy Ghost said pick up your pen and write within when it finished they come to that same spot that he was worried about what was he gonna do and what did God say as of yet now read it and see if I'm telling you the truth spoken word written you'll see as I've yet Malakai for is not fulfilled brother Adam thought in the fifties in the early sixties at Malachi 4 was fulfilled it was for what it was supposed to be that's what I told you Wednesday night please listen to what wage say get away from your baby ideas and opinions and listen those disciples never taught anything about the son of man old Matthew Mark Luke and John wrote about it come on but they never taught nothing in their doctrine about it show me where Paul even taught about the Son of Man he taught it all the way up to the chains and never mentioned son of man here comes a prophet in the 50s right about 1950 and he starts talking about son of man sure he had some scruples in there that needed to be straightened out later on that he had a straight Knight himself nobody else could do it all right but there was things he was looking for like I said he thought was poking words originally he thought he had preached milik I for now you have to take this for mouths word of mouth as a brother in this message he's dead and going on now but he told that he asked brother Branham said are you not this like melikhaya forward things like that are you not that he says yes brother but said you can't tell it now that was the words of a man you will go to judgment and meet him there and let him answer what he's talking about but that was his words he said brother Branham said but you can't tell it why because it wouldn't time he gets the spoken word reading her seat he sees it the Holy Spirit says that of yet Malachi 4 was not fulfilled well what did he set out to do that's what I said you tied her home about the lifes of 62 and then you got brother ins ministry for three and a half years to compile the same as the Lord Jesus with the red line which you got him as I said in the rapture an event not in the age of preparation not in the age of the healing camera but said when he began to sound forth his message do you believe that or do you need for me to get him to pull it up if you want it pull it up raise your hand we'll get him back the artist to do it but he says that as of yet Malachi 4 he sets out to fulfil Malachi 4 he knows right then that there's something wrong with the way he was hidden and he brought his own message come on church that's all I was trying to tell you Wednesday night the Holy Ghost of the faith of the fathers were balled out all the trash if you wouldn't listening in are you listening now the Holy Ghost of the faith of the fathers will boil all the trash out they can't be no Christ left when you come to the faith of the Father come on you can't have any because when you come to the faith of the father's you don't come up through here and you don't got rid of this problem with your tongue and with your temper and you got rid of this part here you got rid of these you got rid of all these things and you're coming out with the faith of the father's then it can be capped off when you gonna get it this morning but we'll get to it then that can be capped off reach statue of a perfect man over again and notice all that wrote around says Holy Ghost coming down through now boy he talks funny don't it Holy Ghost coming down through Christ Holy Spirit welding all of this together read the ball and see if he said it we got to that part we're still on brother the kindness we tried to title it charity we'll pull it back and change it 7 adds change the title brothers joke - 7 adds instead of because we ain't getting to where I want to on love or charity I'm trying to get you to see church that brother Brendan's message went into a higher form you have to admit this that when he comes up to 260 to 63 and the sealed open that the message went into a greater depth right went into the things that had never been known by no man no man understood those times had never been spoken it was sealed up in the pyramid the same pyramid that the sister had to dream she had to dream about the statute of perfect man the statute of perfect man is identically with of the virtues and the ages and the things coming to work that there's a topknot didn't put home see this message then went from just being balling out to trash that all have been done by the faith of the fathers seems now listen come on now listen to what I'm saying I've told you 40-something years that when you're born again at faith you have eternal life your soul is just as eternal as it will ever be but we still have problems we have troubles and problems and things but I swear the statue of a perfect man proves it we still got temperance bless God I ain't got no temper well why did you face red solves that problem but you see what I've taught all alone try to get you to see see then when the prophets message went into a higher form through the opening of the seals there's your honey that's being poor to him that's what causes the cap to come down that's what causes it to do and it seals in because like I said Wednesday you just count those two down because they will draw it out we already drawed it before and showed rather and said there's a little flange up there it doesn't show as the drawing on the statue of a perfect man but there's a little flange you can draw it one way or draw it the other way don't make no difference there's a flange connecting these two together don't lower the headstone leave it right where it's at if you bring it down it won't fit it'll be too small it'll hang over you feel mad we'll go do it leave it right where it's at let the Holy Spirit filling in let the honey let the honey of the Holy Spirit fill that in so much until when the head does set on through and the natural you'd have to set it down on it but in the spiritual you don't have to set it down on it you let it build up growing up into him and that's what I've always taught you to be that headstone is the revealing of God's Word I've always taught you I believe the headstone it's the opening of the seven seals you tell me something else it is there's a lot of things that this is that that is that but it comes down to the opening of the seven seals oh there's honey in the rock my brother what about this message but coming to honey the two messengers pouring in his message they will tie together the headstone with the body because listen church if you do to look at it and see it if this thing was drawn correctly because you can't draw it but if this thing was drawn correctly that would fit right here or fit right here and there's four sides to the pyramid so the headstone would fit any of the four corners you just turn it over also this entire pyramid is right there that's the entire pyramid the the faith of the fathers brings you up but this message brought what what did the prophets say in the sealed book he said by the opening of the seven seals he said we understand the mystery of justification the mystery of sanctification were that these people understood we go back to the faith of the fathers and we take it on to the finishing it's been talked to your church but yet you just do you take it as listening well I don't know whether that's true or not we'll come and tell me but no you go tell everybody else I've told you before you go do that you are causing schism in the body and you'll answer here or there ain't going there what's on I didn't say that there's gonna be an answer the deeds done in the body whether good or bad according to the Bible not the white throne we don't go to that but we're gonna give an account somewhere so you go ahead and talk among yourselves why don't you come and ask me what I'm talking about I don't know what he's talking about to you once you come and ask me what I'm talking about see you're the one that's causing the confusion because you won't come and ask me that schism in the body of Christ read your Bible to see what schism is people contrary to the word taking their ideas and opinions it leaves coming ask me I'll be glad to sit down with you for a week and talk about this time what I'm not going to run you down just cold I think you got some idea you're going to have to straighten that out in your own mind to decide what truth is that's why this doors back guard was made going where they'll go get away ain't never run nobody off and don't want to run nobody how but there's one thing about it the Word of God will eventually get us so why not get it now yes but brother so-and-so sister I didn't know brother so-and-so was the pastor of this church right I thought she's supposed to go to the pastor to find out what's going on I didn't know you're supposed to go with each other what you see Church that's where you don't know don't follow it you understand let me say it one more time and go through you're born again at faith by the new birth that was the 3,000 people outside that Apostles was born again right here where it says Holy Spirit that was their part because they have the faith of the father they were taught three-and-a-half years and when the Holy Ghost that failed they even twice in your scriptures we've given in the Book of Luke on those one but it says he opened their understanding of the scriptures that was before Calvary before he even I mean before the coming of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost he opened their understanding of the scriptures but he didn't give him the new birth he breathed on him in John and said receive ye the Holy Ghost with brother Owen said that was a promise he didn't fulfill it right there I was a promise they went to the upper room and received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he had opened their understanding of the scriptures until they knew a lot of things which were 3,000 outside it heard one sermon it made them newborn babies desiring the sincere milk of the word and Peter says okay you're born again I'm writing this to those that are born again is that what he said anyway he said well now listen you've got to come to these virtues to have what we have well I got the Holy Ghost praise God but that ain't all the Holy Ghost the new birth is not all of the Holy Ghost there's a group development of children in Christ just as natural burst you see that Holy Ghost has been trying its best to help us what have I taught you from the very beginning 327 church age book this messenger Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 will do two things 1 turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father to reveal the seven thunders which are the revelation contained in the seven seals it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn our hearts back now that's a verbatim quote order to be able to quote it for 50 years because that's what I saw fifty years ago right at it 47 but has your group development brought you to understanding of the word because we got to come back to flex the fathers before you can even talk about these other thing see that's been my key the whole time everybody talks about to seal tonight okay but they don't tell you they're so scared of it until they won't talk to somebody that knows and only you get all upset at me for making a statement but go home and take your Daniel 70 weeks book and open the front page and read the little insert that's in the I think it's the front page with a little insert it says if you don't understand the Daniel 70 weeks you cannot understand the seals the plagues the vials and the thought but who wants to talk about Daniel seventy weeks they don't talk about it like I told you we've said in meetings were out of 20 ministers 10 of them didn't even have a book lotta man never read the message where they could tell you all about it the people around it to us all they hear well brother so-and-so straighten him out on that he stumped in that floor up at Lula one day and just shattered the roof and the bottom before he's straighten about no no he didn't straighten out nothing he just showed us he's old how illiterate he was he needed temperance and he definitely needed patience to wait on us right but do you understand what I'm getting at you understand what I was trying to get at Wednesday the Prophet was pouring the message into the church to boil it out that's the statue of a perfect man that'll boil out everything but see then the seals opened from that and there's your honey that seals the whole thing together in brotherly love no wonder it'll hold no wonder it'll hold what are you concerned I called a man just recently that I had already told him if I ever ever any trouble about what we're we're differed that just to forgive me by sitting there studying on the statue of a perfect land and brotherly kindness we're brother Branham says under that brotherly kindness he said you ate together you talked together and he said you're brothers I just reached over got the phone and called him I said brother I want you to know one time if there's anything that I've ever said or done towards you would you forgive me I said I'm studying on brotherly kindness so I think I need brotherly kindness but would you forgive me he said yes and you forgive me if he said this I'm not well I'm trying my best what are you doing - good minds patience coz the Lord told me that he said if you'll have patience with the people that approve you had patience well they've been tried strongly been tried - worth it I don't do too good on patience but I'm working on it let's stay in come on musicians I need to get into the other things I got written down you that got the notes bring them back we'll we'll get to him next Sunday Lord willing thank somebody here for his will done preach but I got plenty of time that honey in the rock front rock is a revelation what do you do what do Shepard do with the honey the sheet was sick what did he do with the honey he takes a honey rubbed it on the rock certain rocks now not all over certain rocks because there's certain elements in that rock that he knows that chief needs and he rubbed that honey on there and that she licks that rock gets well it'll take it'll hold it'll work what we got this anybody have a need take on these times [Music] Hey oh I his name and here listen closely to me that honey pimply is put it on a revelation that's where we need to lick that rock of Revelation is here only home bless his name yes go thank you last night anybody else your name Lord Jesus your little sister has the blister pack in her hand four cups yes couldn't take it away just let it all to God oh no plane no agony [Music] Hey [Music] go lay down [Music] ah yes [Applause] [Music] see what is holy [Music] it is the Holy Ghost that seals us the head has to unite with the body to prove the seal is right who brotherly kindness is his age the age of the seal and the Prophet said true baptism of the Holy Spirit he said now there's a true baptism he said there's a Fox baptism he said they were true this and the phone said he he's not trying to bring anointed one resigned statue a perfect man but he's talking about the Holy Ghost coming down through Christ Holy Spirit he said sealing and all of this together we see the Holy Ghost sealed you in at faith but yet as these shades come forth it's sealed in and he's virtue kind of for that sealed in but didn't there be a final sealing when they had in body your knives a final sealing will be coming [Music] what a day Lord Jesus we just asked you to go with us and as we dismiss for a little while and come back together and bless this evening give way to have word that we need to understand and help us to walk in your life got us and keep us Lord in Jesus now you dismiss [Music]
