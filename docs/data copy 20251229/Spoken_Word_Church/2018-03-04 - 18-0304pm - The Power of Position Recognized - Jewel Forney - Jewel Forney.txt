like to what the scripture says until we're speaking of Joshua telling the word of the Lord came to Joshua I want you to notice how he started at all he says stay not with the body of Moses but with the message of Moses how come others had already died at this time how did it God would tell Joshua stay with the message stay with the word this is not Moses this is my voice speaking to you so we think the Lord is if identity and I want to use a title from that this evening the power a position recognize the power position recognize recognize me to proceed with with a clarity or imposition is - in a place to make a decision on your own his own hello you know I like that right there in a place to make a decision on his own I thought about Joshua Joshua it was in a battle we know the story and he come to a place that Joshua to make a decision on his own honey but we realized it we we look at the good we look at the de city he may wear le was not his thinking it really was not his mind but did he see that he had to mate hello hearing the battle was getting great and judge would needed more daylight so John you had to make a crooked decision so judges a we need stuff we need Sun to

like how do you you know you might come to church to wave your head to make somebody somebody might be down in the vine Leila gonna look at sister how she prayed the Lord in the glory of God drop on their brother that might be your position Church honey you know we realize today I told people that say you know like that we say oh brother if they shout they run into our hallelu that shows a sign of power know that sometimes they don't show their jump them to show the sign of an answer maybe you don't have to you don't have to run now you know how to do all that but what God look about true praise from the heart honey have you gotta turn it come out of your eyes and it carries saying holy to God he accepted he just talked about the power position right here honey and I'm not gonna be all

to Genesis honey we gonna find out what we must do we gotta go back to June see what we got what it what it up is if we die her just we die here just taking up space and time how do we got something we got to do haloo I took a different let me just go back just to again I'm just laying the foundation for a few minutes from the book of Genesis Genesis 1 again Genesis 1 and I want to read verse 28 kids are 1 verse 28 and it reads like this I want you to note here further a year ago God here you don't hear the created Adam II and it alone him in immigrant he uh he a male female he do hello Genesis between April and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply hallelujah don't you know you're just taking up space you know you're just taking up time I don't want you to be fruitful and I want you to multiply I'll do that where did he say these words would you be fruitful multiply multiply the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish sea and over the fowl of the earth over every living thing that move up on the earth your position animal want you to take the word and I want you to control nerve honey I want you to multiply I'll go with you - Bray's sons of God just like you ordered Holly hidden what Adam had power in his mouth he had power in his word - sweet all he had to do it spigot it happened I positioned well to be able to speak the word

lose he lost his power to control his tongue huh his power would to be able to speak and they keep it under me when Adam did this he lost power to control it and that's why we didn't win I look over now we don't control you that we should be things that we shouldn't be Adam starts to be confirmed it would be start speaking thing that God didn't say I'm afraid God never mention it word hello

his heart for us to try to see and that's what we believe amen let's go on into the communion and just follow our own in the communion you know we do you believe it a brother is preaching we still believe in baptism - enough to see somebody go I've seen a lot of things we've seen people get baptized in all kind of conditions and and everything it was 19 degrees I think today my wife got baptized and she had ice in her hair which come up out of the water and it was like two or three more that day same day baptized I've never seen yet I know Satan no challenge some day I let him challenge because I don't believe me I've never seen of all the baptisms that I've ever done in brother Colley we we baptized I think it was about four or five of his family one day and it was thirty degrees was baptizing them down an old river you know but I've never seen one bad coal come out of all the years of baptism and I don't know how many hundreds that we've had never even a bad cold cuz he'll take care of you doing what's right I wouldn't cure to cut a hole - and baptizing it wouldn't bother me yes I'm a coach it's what you're doing it for it's a wonderful thing to get to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus to fulfill his word and to believe it that's wonderful we just tell her brother how much you appreciate you all right we come to a time of communion and that's one thing we are firmly believe in we believe in the three ordinances you know we believe in the water baptism we believe in the communion we believe in the foot washing so we have all three of them at one time you know to come in and to thank God about all of it like I said we'd like to end it today by baptizing somebody if you want to add be fine you know we were baptizing with some really dicks family and one of the ladies came up she was thanking him you know because they wouldn't think and we was baptizing in just an old river I don't guess but they kind of dressed up you know sunday-go-to-meeting clothes she had this real fancy dress on it was oh it was fancy you know and time we got to talking just a little bit about baptism I said come on house and let's sit down and talk about it before we do it so we did we said discuss the baptism us any questions you got about it well she didn't come to get baptized there was other pimp members in the family that was you know we got through baptizing the others here she comes out in that muddy old creek with that fancy little you know sunday-go-to-meeting dress and she was dressed nice but she she asked me for she said I know y'all don't believe in wearing pants and things we said I don't have anything to I go home I said would it be all right said my was they married that time I don't know was he married into that it is engaged anyhow she he's got some pants should be alright I should wear I'm home don't worry move I should wear them because that's not right coach you needed some clothes even worrying him over that took care of that coz you see it was just being nice or okay let's go into the communion Paul we get into the Corinthians and I love it out of all of the great apostles and all of the ones none of them was given the opportunity to explain communion Paul knew all of that Old Testament tops and shadows and things he was chosen to explain the communion for have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death to become thought about in the message people are saying we don't take communion no more called the Lord's come well I don't think that's what he's talking about you know that part of it he come a long time ago he come me 2000 years ago but you know cuz you gonna show his death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep first we would judge ourselves I love this scripture where we would judge ourselves we should not be judged now look though but when we are judged even if something were judged we're chasing to the Lord why that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hungry let him eat at home that you come not together in the condemnation the rest of us set in order when I come let's just have a few moments of silent prayer praying one for the other this is a time to pray and ask God to cleanse you to make you worthy because he's none of us worthy no no there's no human being in the world that is worthy to take the communion because we'd all be admit there's little this or a little that this little problem they would keep us but he said was perfect he required it morning Matthew 5:48 be ye therefore perfect even as your father in the evidence birth he required it he made a way that we could be perfect I see a sign you don't sit on a bumper stickers I'm not perfect I'm just forgiving everybody think well that's a beautiful statement it's not a good statement you don't even realize if you're forgiven there's nothing for you to be but perfect because you're not guilty and being not guilty it makes you perfect okay let's just have a few moments of silent prayer praying one for another
