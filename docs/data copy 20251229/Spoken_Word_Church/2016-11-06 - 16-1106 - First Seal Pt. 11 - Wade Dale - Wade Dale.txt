========================================

let's go ahead and get started um remember Sister Gwen's mother she's in emergency room now in pain remember um Louise he's in Canada and his mother-in-law and father-in-law remember them so keep them in your prayers the motherinlaw heard from and sister trud is traveling so that's the ones that are not here today but um let's go ahead and get started we got a few things to cover and then what we'll do is we let what you hear from Bara Barbara's in she's Inver D no he's not gone as far as yesterday but he did ask for salvation okay so he did her brother going to Dan right sister bar yeah sister bar all right so let's read the um let's background a little bit on the first seal and then we're going to read in second seal and kind of start into it a little bit and what I want you to see is U we were discussing last night um and some brought up the point of of what we you know what do we need to do to you know get this thing going or you know make this thing more um other words get it going get it going so if uh's pH he's turning it off but that's good thank you brother mine rang upstairs in church and I was thinking this morning you know I I don't want to get have the wrong impression of people that don't need to study or read or do anything anymore but with all the things that we have going on I mean honestly look if you work a 40-hour work week or 48 some of them work 50 Rebecca maybe 60 hour work week there's got to be time set aside for God sure but now once you do that though and you get home and you sisters have to take care of the kids and wash and cook and clean and we Brothers have to cut the grass and do this and do that keep the car going you see what I'm talking about that's just everyday things I was thinking this morning and here's a real good example show me one place in the Bible that Abraham asks God to let him be the one that would produce the promised child find one place in the Bible there's no place that Abraham started crying out to God God I want to have the promised child Abraham or Abram didn't have a clue but God knew the end of Abraham Abram going to Abraham's journey and listen Abraham is a type of a True Believer right we must have faith but now watch him in his normal everyday life he was trying to produce what God Said and he messed up he was trying you hear what I said trying to produce promis child here's Hagar I can perform Sarah's de she had children since she was you know we've never had children before let's try this let's try that I'm going to give her away you see all the human things that he did but God wasn't looking at that and when a when uh the Bible doesn't say that when God in the former mezc came down to Abraham and said Abraham now you're going to have this child through Sarah so he knew that he got a revelation through his journey but still Abram Abraham never said God I want the child I want to be able to produce a child it was God knowing that Abram would turn into Abraham that would produce the child all the way through the Journey so that's our that's our example to go by I was telling the folks last night that uh um to live a good normal Christian life is what Jesus did but he lived such a life that the Pharisees and the Sadducees the religious World thought he was a devil he wasn't in he was in in the temple sure but he wasn't in the temple like they were in the temple in other words they didn't see him go do the things that they did so they considered him Bel above but he was almighty God right he didn't have to get up in the morning and say I'm God I got to act like God no he got up in the morning you know what he done he was hungry so he eat breakfast I'm sure he helped his daddy in the carpenter shop for a while till he started his ministry but we got to understand that we cannot Abraham or Abram was no superhuman somebody it was just that God saw that Journey come to an end a fulfillment of that Journey was that Abraham had that child Abraham and Sarah all right so that's the same way with you and I same way with these seals I think sometimes like brother Dale's been preaching you know you say adoption and everybody goes way up to manifest the sons of God well we got to get there we got to get to manifest the sons of God and I believe some were at manifested sons of God but do we have to say that is the criteria for us to be adopted children of God no we're adopted in a family when we're born again right so the same way with these seals I think sometimes we especially as preachers and and Bob knows what I'm talking about Aon knows what I'm talking about you try to come to a a point in your sermon that you that you build up and then boom you you know you lay the hammer down you know or you are you you you try to end with a point that kind of fulfills all the sermon do you have to do that no you don't have to do that same way with the seals these seals were broke to the prophet of God in a room he went out and preached it to the people and then he told them on the Sixth Seal he said you're not even getting this it's not even for you that's right so what was he telling them now he wasn't telling them not to be Christians this has nothing to do with Christianity baby form Christianity okay there's going to be let's say billions there's going to be billions of Christians in heaven that never got the opening of The Seven seal there's only going to be a certain group of people that's going to get the true revelation of this and take a body chain very minute small like one in a million as brother Brown said or or two two out of what one in a million two out of two million um Israelites Joshua and Caleb ever understood what Moses were talking about the rest of them didn't have a clip but they were counted the generation that came up now they they went over in Promised Land right that's right they believe what Joshua and Caleb said so they come up through Joshua and Caleb's Ministry and went over into the promised land right so that's what you and I are doing we're coming up through the ministry of brother brandom but we have to go through like we were talking about last night is you know we can quote quotes like it like I said we haven't read many quotes in the seal book when brother Brown preached the seals he had a Bible and a tab and I was just reading here and I I didn't I'll flip through it I'll find it but brother Brown said you say you have those seven Thunders it must compare with every scripture in the Bible you can't say that brother Brown's message was an extension of the Bible or an addition to the Bible cuz if you add or take away your name will be taken from the book of life and the plagues will be added to you so be careful read feel careful when you start saying that brother bram's uh message should be in red letter I don't agree with that that that's not that's making him too much God okay now we can take the red letter what is red letter it's just something man did yeah it's just something man did the whole Bible should be R yeah God spoke it from the beginning to the end right but they but but when the scholars come down and said okay that's God in human flesh in human form let's punctuate it by putting it in red letter does everybody understand what I'm saying so they going to come a time people I'm going to tell you something there going to come a time where if you don't have it in here even up here you got to have it up here before you have it done here you got to have it up here cuz they're going to take the Bibles away and they're going to take the message away and what we were talking about last night even if you were to have the message on your phone or in on an iPad if you don't got no power right right God either going to have to supernaturally turn the power on which you can but you got to have it inside you got to pack that thing inside of you so much pack that word so much inside of you that what can God do he can Quicken right what you need when you need it that's right right right now why let me give you an example why didn't Jesus as soon as the storm came up why didn't he just stand up and say peace be still the Bible says that they all almost tore the boat apart before they woke him up right water was this deep in the boat why didn't Jesus just get up right at the beginning and say peace be still somebody had to cry out for somebody to help them it's the same way with you and I Jesus was in our boat but he's got to wait till you cry out for him and when you going to cry out for him when you can eat steak and potatoes all day and eat what you want to and drive what you want to and you know go to your home and turn on the heat and turn on the air no but you got to remember you got to have Christ there before he'll come in honor his word that's the same that's to me that's what the seals were when brother brandom got a revelation of these seals it was not an addition to the Bible that's right it was what was hidden in the Bible from the foundation of the world it was there it was always in in the in the writings but man had not been able to open it because man can't open it when man tries to open it guess what happens when Abraham Abram tried to help God he got a wild child he got an ishmail right but you still got to give him an a for effort he tried he tried to produce what God Said but it wasn't what the provided way that God has now we have a provided way the provided way is the message of the hour but face final resting place of prophet said is in the word of God so that's why we've been reading the scriptures reading even some scriptures that maybe brother Brown didn't read because look he didn't have time he preached the first seal in one night two and a half hours and the greatest opening of the Bible there ever was and he did it in two and a half hours well inside all that is the Revelation that we need to what get the Revelation break it down to the people and then you got to have a revelation you got to understand what the prophet said what we can do is is we can it's like the old saying you can lead the horse to water but you can't make him drink it that's right he's got to be thirsty enough to want drink it right so the first seal we went through it and we we've combed it over this is number 11 I think and I think we've covered about every Avenue I was thinking yesterday that's why I was telling them last night you know sometimes you just you just meditate the Bible says meditate I think David meditated David meditated on what God had done and thinking about the things of God and and and all that and I was just meditating on some things and I thought well brother favorite scripture was what Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever well I think we can punctuate at the end of each seal you got to see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you got to see and then what is that Jesus Christ it's in you the hope of glory amen right right I believe Christ came down not in a physical form but the word open you know sometimes we use we use those symbols and we have to because were humans and God knows that we're human but the mighty Angel come down now that didn't mean that Christ was way up Y and didn't come and he just came down in 1963 no he was with the prophet the whole time he was with um irenius and Martin and Columba and Luther and Wesley he was here the whole time but man had shut him out in denominations he had they had shut him out and he was outside trying to get back in right well the mighty Angel which is Christ came down here because you can't take a body change saying he's up there right it's like I saying last night we always pray we look up why do we look up God it's not up there and and we should respect by bowing our heads and closing our eyes but why do you have to you said oh you Jesus said at the tomb of Lazarus he said father I'm I'm going to say a prayer but it's not for me it's not for you and it's not for Lazarus it's for the people around me that I'm going to say this but other than that he would just walked up and said Lazarus come forth brother Brown said one time and I really like it said that Jesus was prayed up before the foundation of the world well see that's what you and I if you like last last night brother devil was talking about two Souls the two Soul Doctrine is that you get a soul God gives you a soul and Satan gives you a soul but I read some quotes from brother Brown said that Jesus was the only person that came to Earth knowing what he was right cuz he was back there our we were back there in that form but not this form we were back there in the form of Jesus Christ but our mind was blackened what our mind was blackened to that but now that the seals have come and been revealed now that the prophet's message has come I can look back and see that I was back there before the foundation of the world in the attribute of Jesus Christ called bride cuz he didn't just develop right attributes he always had but he wanted to display them so he added the way to display them is the perfect Plan of Redemption and salvation that we have today so we come to a place to where we look at these seals and we go man it's the greatest message has ever taught and it's true but we've got to get the like I was talking about last night we got to get the essence of this message this message is not do and don't hair and dress do this don't do that sure we had to start with that that's where you start with the foundation MH but Paul says leaving the principles of doctrine of Christ let us go on into Perfection right not leaving again in other words going back and all and it's okay to preach that there's a fine line there you can't say well we're not going to do this anymore no you you have to be led by the Lord to do the things you do because everybody's in different right different levels everybody's in different levels so you have to go back some time but why do we have to continue it's like brother Dale said we got to get them Born Again get them born again and they won't do the things that they that that they did back in the world same thing with this this was something like brother Brown said he said it's not something that God had to rewrite that's right this is what he wrote and this is the way it's been for in his mind it never was it never did have a beginning that's right right it always was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever all right so that at the end of each seal so what first seal when open the lamb when the lamb opened one of the seals now watch the lamb had to open it man can't open it so the lamb had to open the seal right and I heard it was a noise of Thunder one of the four beasts stand come and see now what Beast was that the lion cuz we're going to go back and cover that when we get what we're going to do is we're going to cover the first four seals and then we're going to stop cuz brother BR said the Rapture takes place on the four seals right you said oh there's 5 six and seven we we'll explain it don't worry it's where you got to see that if you take a quote and live by one quote you'll die by one quote okay that's right Paul said to letter her kill it now he knew every law cuz he was the Pharisee of the Pharisees right actually he actually listen Paul this is what's so strange Paul could walk into the temple and be blameless and being um uh a born- again child of God but God Almighty they chastised him for walking into the into the temple and he always was telling him how F he wasn't you see what I'm saying M Paul had a basis of the law though behind him they knew who Paul was at the beginning so Paul could go in and do the things that he did and that was good because see Paul could reach the people that was in those in those congregations right cuz he had Jesus in his soul now I knew that one thing for sure Paul knows that more than anybody that's why I believe the first church age messenger was Paul being that he was that he had that Lon attitude l i o n lion like roaring of a lion because he knew that what he thought was life was death what he thought what he thought and lived by for probably 40 or 50 years he thought that was life and that was actually killing him until God come and said hey I'm Jesus who you persecuted and he said I didn't even know you lived on Earth you know in other words I heard about you but he knew then that that was Christ in you that's why Paul could say Christ in you the hope of glory he knew exactly where Christ was well see that's what you and I have to do well you say well brother is in me right then he's got to reveal the same thing that he revealed to the prophet he's got to reveal the same thing that he revealed while he was on the face of the Earth Christ himself because remember this is the son of man Ministry this is the son of man ministry right here these seals was the opening of God in human flesh back on the Earth again to you and I and I saw Behold a white horse and he that s on him had a bow I was thinking this morning too watch watch Satan right at the get-go now remember just like we went we haven't went through it yet but in Joel talks about the Palmer worm Locust caterpillar and cankerworm all right brother B said it's the same bug with different stages right this is the same thing CU I read a quote just this morning brother Brown said these four horse riders are the same as those four um bugs that eat the church down cuz what's the first thing he's doing he's got to get in church Satan had to ride into church he didn't ride out in the bar joint he rode right into church like what we're talking about the N Council he rode right into church and that's where he started his work right and he hasn't stopped he just keep eating and eating and eating and eating but like the prophet of God said he said four Messengers ate it down four Messengers have to bring it back all right we'll get into that when we get into that in after the fourth seal but we got to see what these seals are then we'll stop on number four then we'll back up and prove to you why that it has to be the Rapture happens on the four steel but that doesn't mean 5 6 and 7 is not open to you that means that 56 5 and six won't happen till after we're gone basically right knowing exactly where that come to through two prophets all right so when two prophets are on the earth we're not here so that's the reason that he could see that the Rapture would go and you say well that's justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost that's only three brother Bram brings in invisible Union or somewhere in there he brings in one more called the word see you can have the Holy Ghost yes and not understand all the word that's right but you can't have the word and not understand the word that's right with with all these others if you come the right way those who is Justified we've already said the Bible say Paul says whoever whoever's been truly Justified will come to that glorification which is after the four cuz see when the Rapture takes place we're already in glorified bodies right so see you say well is that written somewhere brother R it don't have to be written down if if we go in rapture we are not going to be in these flesh bodies does it have to say that no it doesn't but that's what's hidden the revelation of that fourth seal is is that Redemption is done redemption's over for the Christian believer justification sanctification baptism HH and the word of God the word of God being fully revealed all right right and I saw and behold a white horse and he that s on him had a boat and a crown was given unto him now we went through all that talking about they were they started as a saying and then see at the end of this seal to open up the next seal they had to Crown somebody to give it a voice you understand what I'm saying to give it a voice they had to they had to Crown you can't Crown a spirit that's what brother Brown was talking about you can't Crown a spirit so he had to come into flesh listen why do you think that s waiting for me and you to take a body chain he doesn't know how that's right he doesn't know how but he's fixing to know how right cuz he's a copycat he copies after remember not original that's right so when he sees God incarnate himself in a group of people and they start living and speaking bodies come out of the ground and he can't stop it what a mighty God we serve What a Mighty God when he can't stop it he can't stop this from happening somebody's going to physically stand on this Earth one day and say Bride come out of the ground somebody's going to do that whether you believe it or not I believe somebody's going to stand there and say not Graves open up like the denominations you know the graves are going to open up and Jesus is going to come down through split the skies you you done way over somewhere else we talking about that last night this has got to be a secret going on when the bride comes back out of the Grave I don't believe everybody in the world is going to see him I do not believe that I believe only the elect that's right that's left alive that calls him out of the ground they're the only people that's going to see brother Tatum sister Tatum brother mo mo oh I believe we're the only people that can see them and if you can't see them what are you going to do you're going to say brother Aaron brother Aaron's going to come say man did you see brother Gary and brother you know Richard and all see all you see all them and I'm going if I'm here I know one thing's for sure yeah I ain't got Holy Ghost yeah okay and I'm either going to be mad about it and persecute you call you crazy and have you put in prison you see what I'm saying how this is all this is way I see it's going to develop right and then all these preachers in the messages ain't going to see anything that ain't got the Holy Ghost just preaching the message by the that's right they're going to look out and they're going to not see anything that you see and they're going to what they're going to Brand you a heretic and have you put in prison what stop their mouth is that what Paul was trying to do with the Christians what was PA what Paul trying to do he said I put them in prison and caus them to blaspheme that's right all right that's a little bit off the subject but this what's coming through this message that's what's coming that's right dead in Christ shall rise first MH we want your Al and remain to be caught up to meet the Lord together in the air so we'll see them the whole world will not see him this is going to be a secret catching away so much to where brother R said people will go on to church thinking they're getting saved and getting the Holy Ghost right that's quote that's right right so to me that shows that everybody's not going to see what we see right that six Dimension is going to come in through here brother R going to come into this Dimension but we're the only ones going to be able to see it just like brother brandham you know he could he could see spirits and things because of being a prophet well Jesus could see the same thing right what that was another dimension he was looking in another dimension but standing in this one that's the same thing you and I we have that coming to us but we've got to get these seals together for the Redemption of this body because let me ask you a question what's the only thing holding us to this earth what's the only thing that's holding me from walking through that wall is one thing and that's the body that my mom and daddy gave me right you don't have to open door for a soul to leave what he just Steeps over in another dimension I can't do that with this now Jesus did with a glorified body when we get a glorified body we'll do the same thing but I'm talking about a human flesh body even listen here's a big key that should help you brother brandom couldn't take his body into that sixth Dimension hello he said I looked back and saw my flesh or my body laying in the bed that's right he couldn't that flesh is the bar that's holding us here right when Adam and Eve did what they did in flesh it didn't mark their soul it didn't Mar their soul they were Eternal right but it marred that body so much till God had to put them in a dimension to where they can't get out except what death is the only thing that leaves us that gets us into another place my brother R said death is our it's our we use him it's something we use it's our slave that we Ed to get out of this into another dimension but with a revelation of the word though when brother Brandon went across a current time they're they're telling him we in other words go back and preach a message because we're not complete we don't eat or drink here that probably baffled brother Brandon for a little bit but when he come back God showed him that that glorified body or that theophany body doesn't eat but they're coming back to get their human body connect make it glorified and then like Jesus listen Jesus had a glorified body when he ate fish right right he had a glorified body when he ate that fish and like I said many times that I Illustrated he didn't eat it and it hit the floor right it went somewhere it had some substance to it his body had substance to it so that's the same way with these seals what's coming forth of these seals is is to show us that our body is all already redeemed yes Amen to Wi the Redemption of our body to Wi to witness or to understand Paul already said it those who he is Justified he is already glorified he never said that glorification is coming he said it's already here because if you're born again today like I said you're already in rapturing condition that's right you just got to get your body lined up amen and if you have to go by the grave that's okay because that will purify everything you'll come right back but those that are alive and remain are going to stand with those seven Thunders I believe with the opening of the word the full opening of the word and stand and call the dead out of the ground but Satan starts right in church they then who crowns him remember who who Crowns Who crowns the devil who gives him his power right we do that's right cuz remember when we get into the Millennium what's the first thing brother R say Satan's Not Dead the spirits or the the the evil spirits are not dead right what they're just put in another dimension because he has nowhere to work what our minds are going to be pure yes Hey listen if we can stand and take a body change and then take a Rapture and go over in another dimension while the world's getting blown to Pieces Satan's not going to bother you anyway he'll be finished bothering the bride that's right now there'll be some that he'll try to work through which I don't understand completely I'll be honest with you but as one thing for sure the bride and the 144,000 can't be touched okay Satan can't touch them anymore when you get a glorified body you can't be touched that's right by Satan right I'm not saying you can't be touched you can't be you can't be influenced by Satan let's put it that way you can't be influenced by Satan and he went forth conquering and the conquer so what did he do he rode out in that church age conquered everything that was to conquer except what the True Believer okay that's why the dividing line is somebody ask was talking about foolish virgin or something foolish virgin is is closer to this as Satan is close to being real I mean being in the church sort of the foolish virgin but now you got to remember the foolish virgin they had a place to put oil they just didn't have the oil right all right that a place to put it because the on that had it said you need to go buy it your lamps are empty you don't have anything in your lamp in other words you don't have the Holy Ghost right and they're going to be so close but they're going to be in a deception because here's two things I want you to see this in all that you do if you're ignorant of what you do you're ignorant to me it's it's it's not bad to be ignorant because ignorant is just you don't know better you need to learn okay like we were talking about last night the definition of insanity definition of insanity is doing the same thing over again expecting I'm talking about expecting a different result right the drunk gets drunk he throws up he goes well next time I probably won't throw up well does the same thing you understand what I'm saying it's the same thing over and over again but now to be ignorant is not bad to stay ignorant is the problem so to me foolish virgins are are ignorant and not been taught cuz to be ignorant is not being taught now if somebody stands up and teaches you something and you turn it down whole different ball game yeah that's a word rejector okay all right so let's keep that in mind if you know better right and you do it remember that's the first deal iniquity that's right iniquity that's no one to do better and not doing it or no one to not do it and you do it anyway right but to me the foolish virgin is just going to be blinded by false Shepherds and not be told the whole truth right so that's the big difference and that's same thing with you and I if we've ever been made not if it's ever been made known to us cuz look this is the greatest message that ever come right right now um let's go to Wesley cuz there was Bibles for sure in Wesley's age in Luther's age they were putting it together and starting it but in Wesley's age he could read the Bible he read this right here but was ignorant to that yes is that okay he was ignorant to the fact that this was going to change his body yes right so but now does that make John Wesley lost no no he was ignorant to that right but see I think that's why brother Brown said being so important when you come up to a place to where everything's been made known it's either right or wrong right there's no gray area in between that's right all right so that's why that you see white white white church they had to be a real white church so that there would be a white righteous looking Church looking church so they could come together cuz look Satan deceived everybody even Luther and Wesley the deception was still there father son Holy Ghost baptism um no eternal hell and all the things like that you don't think it's so strong you listen whatever started back there is still going on today and 99% of the world Roman Catholic Baptist Methodist Pentecost all except a few believe that hell's Eternal that there's three gods and there's this and there's that and the other so look the deception is not over in a corner that's right the deception is worldwide when he gets on this horse it's like the prophet of God said he gets off this horse but it keeps going that's right where's it going in the people that's right that's where it's going in the people and they're taking off with it they become what was sitting on that horse I hate to say that but that's what's the truth that's why we need to see that that horse is going in that direction not this direction okay got it I don't want to be too loud start preaching we got to start teaching teaching all right so we found out all these and the seventh seal was his coming which I said was Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and forever but you must see then on this first seal that that God even that God that came to you 30 years ago if you got born again 30 years ago that when that God came to you that was God Almighty have you ever thought about this there's a man named God that named Jesus Christ but he's almighty God right right there's not three people sitting up there a daddy and a son and a spirit there's one man that's right that one man before the world was ever formed before you was ever formed okay he knew everything you would do from birth to death or birth to to change he knew everything you would do plus he knew if you made a choice to go this way what you would do that's right now that's just you what about the billions of people been on the face of the Earth he stood back in eternity Brother Ray which is eternity so he didn't have to he didn't have a time limit he stood back in eternity and he knew every person that would ever live every move they would make I can't fathom that one man did that one man and that he would come down and take on my flesh flesh like me and die on a cross yes to save my soul amen what a mighty God we serve he's so he's so infinite we can't understand it that's right we just can't I can't understand I mean even the little things that we do understand that we understand right I mean our our brain has they say you only used about a tenth of it but even if you used 100% of it you still not standing at the place where this great creator that created everything and wrote every one of these words before they ever were written on a piece of paper he knew every word that was going to be written and who would write it who would be born what do you tell Jeremiah before you were born I knew who you were I see when we come to that place that God has so much control cuz see if we see this as a mystery of iniquity it's that I'm hiding something that God don't know about hello cuz Satan sure did hide something that the people didn't know about that all right yeah right here if you read this what a lot of the commentary says oh that's a white horse that's the Holy Ghost right even the prophet preached that way for for a while but we know that true understanding is is that never was the Holy Ghost that was the Antichrist all right so see to me then the to me then what the what the U seals what the seals should do to you is it should make you more aware of what's already going on not what's been not what's coming what's already here and working yes these four horses are still here until we leave amen amen that's why we leave on the four seal that's the whole key is all the four horse riders are finished brother R you see said he said you see no more Beast which is the Beast are to help us right that's right four beasts L ox man and Eagle are to help us which is the Holy Ghost right so the Holy Ghost is talking to John saiding hey write this down and then I'm going to seal it up M until the time of the end right and then at the time of the end I'm going to open it up all right Revelations 10:7 you know all all those things and the days of the voice when all this is to be revealed so we come down to the end of the first seal and you know it's like I said you're looking for some big Crescendo you know you it's like an orchestra but really it's not it to me it's going to be the quietest thing that ever was cuz it's not a public show right the only thing it's going to be is is it's going to be obviously Christ in you the hope of glory and you and Christ talking together not more volume than you ever have before that's what I was saying before you say well God don't I want God to talk to me more well he talks to you all the time if you just listen tells you what to do what not to do sometimes we just don't listen we let this guy continue writing right here right continue riding and then he gives us what like brother Jill fory said he gives you a box of rattlesnakes and you just take it that's right you just take it somebody hands you a box of rattlesnakes you just take it no you better not especially if you know what's in it now we know what's in the box amen see now we know what's in the box okay same way with the first seal to me the first seal is the greatest seal because it shows God's love for us he's opening up something that he's never opened before never opened before even when Jesus preached it Matthew 24 for many shall come in my name and say I am Christ and shall deceive many now that is exactly what happened as soon as Jesus went up Satan came down and he started riding and like the prophet of God said that horse continues on and it's continued on right to this day right here all right to deceive now I want you to understand mystery of iniquity the mystery of one true and living God the mystery of justification cuz to be really to be truly Justified to go into glorification to be justified how can God hold anything what's the scripture how can God how can anyone hold the charge of God's elect okay right how tell me how I didn't do that right that's right yeah you did well well yeah you did in that old life but I was thinking the other day the things that I did remember the song of the things I do I do them no more we don't do them anymore but the thoughts are still there that's right because Satan has that one hold on you and really it's not your body it's your mind your memory right it's your it's what goes through your brain is what is killing you and me that's right but we've got to come to a place to where God you've got to put it back from Satan if he takes it and tries to give it to you like the box of rival tonight I don't want that that's right Satan you may know I did it I may know I did it but God doesn't know I did because he can't stand he can't stand here today and judge you that's right for what has been truly justifi that's right right that's the point you cannot if you get if you come to this end of this first seal you've got to see what you are God made manifest Amen in another form called a bride amen not your body that's right your soul right your soul we got to get this amen your soul never did wrong if there's any little speck like a like a a a black pepper you take one Speck of black pepper and put it in the ocean there still a black Speck out there somewhere but not with God it's gone it's fin finished and done right he sees you white and righteous that's right but now remember you can't say well I don't have to that that means cuz see a lot of people say the opening of the seals is we're already in the Millennium so we don't have to do right it's just this bodies what's doing it see how that's real close yes CU it is that really I mean we're all adults here your soul is not what you and your wife do when you know you that's true that's not your soul doing that that's your body doing that that's your flesh doing that right not your soul so you got to realize that that Soul inside of you if it is born again it never had a bad thought it never had a memory of what I used to do that's right cuz if God has a memory of what you used to do you can't be justified that's right that's good that ought to make you excited that's to me that's the end of that seal is is that but now listen you going to prove who you are that's right you can suppress it and suppress it and suppress it though that's true just like the woman that taught Sunday school but when she got ready to pass away what happened brother Bram said the real person what the thing she had pushed down for all the real person came up and she knew she was black inside right but if you're pure inside today if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul you're just as Eternal as God and listen the Bible says you don't have need of nothing and but see that now see people will go in the opposite dress and go well I don't have to go to church no more I don't have to study I just go do what I want that proves who you are right proves who you are right right you going to we're going to prove who we are but that white righteous church that the real one the real white righteous church is White has no spot Bible says have no spot or wrinkle the Bible's already told us what we what what we are we just not believing it what we're doing is we're running it through this filter that's right and this guy is still doing his job amen well you're okay you don't have to right so when you come to the end of this it should be a revelation that I am just as Eternal as God is and what's inside of me came from him and what's inside of me is going back to him all right but now what I done now same way with Jesus when Jesus said I come from God and go back to God that flesh never was up there with God that's right right so he picked up a flesh down here that's right is that what we're doing that's right we just have sin problems that's right we're blackened by that he never was so we don't have to worry about that we have to worry about this part here that's true but if you don't see that you're just as Eternal as God is that seal really has not open that's right cuz to see one true and living God is like brother R said the Oneness of God is God and Adam and Eve back in the Garden of Eden like they used to be you say no that's three to God is one that's right right one the Revelation one true and living God is God with his CH with his family that's Revelation one true Living God not that we're just they're just going to be one person no no we're a many membered body amen we didn't choose that that's what he chose that's right we just got to see that that's what we're chosen for we'll start on the second seal next time now look this one this one here shows you there's a mystery there that we still have to see you you can't just say it cuz you know what soon as you leave this room Satan's going to test you on it amen and then tomorrow he's going to test you on it the next day he's going to test you on it and he's going to keep testing because he has one thing that that could work through and that's through your brain that's right the best thing you do is resist the devil and he'll flee from you and then let's go on to Perfection as Paul said and start on the second seal all right let's go
