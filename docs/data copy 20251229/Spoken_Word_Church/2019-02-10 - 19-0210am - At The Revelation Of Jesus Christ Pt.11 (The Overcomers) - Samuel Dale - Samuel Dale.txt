officers of the church we need to meet if we can and basically everybody comes to the Bible study so we'll try to do that and get everything set and kind of go through a little line at five between five to six I would be the first Saturday in March okay we'll be going through what the officers are and how doing we've got a lot of things to cover so remember that okay all right is that all maybe it is I'll find another note sticking over here somewhere in a minute and I will be there okay we're going to first Peter that we haven't read but 11 times so far so well I thought well we're going to end this today sitting in there now I got about eight more sermons okay so you know it just goes out of way but we're going to first Peter 1:13 and then we'll go over to revelations 3:21 okay father we thank you for this day and the opportunity to be able to fellowship together around your word we pray that you'd be with us and got each and every one of us and Lord open our eyes to not understanding that we might walk in your love in your grace be with each one remember brother dougherty's our Lord touch his eyesight and just remember all the other sicknesses among us remember a wife Lord and having the problem with the sinuses and congestion 'z and the things and Lourdes little Abbey with ear infection and for the owl Lord and just many of us that are sick you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe you just have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us and got us in Jesus name Amen okay and we've read this before and what it is it's coming down to a point to establishing something that I believe is taking place in this day I remember my whole emphasis whole point out of messages has been one thing to try to get us to look at things more positive to look at what we're doing look at today in the hour we're following we can look out there and see the world and how it's falling we could say all those things but that is not going to put us in the rapture I don't care who what goes on out dire its the revealed word that is the thing that we need all right so that's doing that and it's getting to the point of what present tense right you remember what the prophets said I'll review this in a minute say it to 15 times all right our problem is looking back and looking forward he said that's where Satan's tactic was to get us to look backward or look forward and not look at what's taking place right now you say but brother Dale I don't see much going on open your eyes you can read the newspaper and see what's going on well you know if that's going on there has to be something taking place in the bride all right no what did the prophets say when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for Satan will be powerless before her oh that's a simple statement in there okay but just remember that we're for a gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ now at the end time to where the Word of God is fully revealed is that what he said all right now let's go to Revelation 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now as I said what has been our point why is it that we cannot stay on the level that the prophet left when he was here now I say that with respect to the point of what I'm talking about I believe if anybody ever had a positive attitude all right not talking about our day in people in times you know I believe it was the Prophet don't you that everything was positive with him it was never negative it was always positive to you okay now and if that now that didn't do away with his heart aches and troubles as a matter of fact that brought more of them that created a lot of problems but a positive attitude is the thing that we all need and why not we're 50 years almost or something heists the going of the Prophet all right as I kept emphasizing why did the children of Israel have to stay 40 more years or 30 technically and down in Egypt was because they had turned down the word that had been brought to him right now could it be that that's what's happening now or is God given an opportunity for mankind to turn it down and it sure looks like they're doing it because what used to be even on your Internet's and things of great things you know I'll catch the vid not that what does the other one bleed the sign oh boy great brother branham was a prophet everything was great all that once brought around as a false prophet now that's according to them you going the internet now and they see what they're doing to this message now then the message is fine it's what we're doing with it all right it's what we're doing is messing everything up so that we don't need our folks all right 50 years we've been here because of you and me with brother Dale I've been alright you know I'm just sitting telling it like it is we don't have 50 more years a few more we're gonna be in a nursing home if possible you know but I want to get out of here don't you all right I want to believe what has been brought unto us so what did the Prophet bring recognizing your day and its message all right there shouldn't be any problem to recognize the the fact that God has sent a prophet that shouldn't be any problem there's witnesses sitting here that was Darwin the Dead was raised the sick was healed and things like that to the word you know by the prophets ministry all right so I'm sitting here that was dark all right we don't have we've got witnesses living witnesses still unto that day as being true you know all right now then the problem must be in the basis that we're not accepting what God has declared for the day that we're living you know we're not accepting who we are and what we're here for thank God did he sent us a prophet amen but that didn't finish it all there's got to be a bride who becomes the word all right and not to just read it not to be able to quote it okay but for it to be a living reality in our hearts and our lives and that's been my whole point just to try to get us to see if we are the bride then when are we going to start walking in the light of the bride that now I'm not folks I'm not this way well I I think one of these days something's gonna happen make us get desperate you better get desperate down I mean you said well it's gonna bring desperation is gonna put us where we need to be let me quote your prophet all right we believe him what is supposed to bring to pass the things upon the bride if you're looking for persecutions and things to happen what's supposed to bring it I thought it was the readiness of the bride I thought it was the bride when she begins to realize who she is then that out there it's already set in motion but then it's gonna come after the bride but it's because the bride has realized who she is what she's doing all right see then we start should start saying thank you lord you know for giving me what you have given me the message that I can can study it and believe it all right now get that point across and we'll move on now so we've come up through the church ages we started to lose series about nine or ten messages ago on the seven church ages all right and bringing up those ages give you a Feist run through to the visitors and I ask you to read the church ages and you'll see what is each one you'll find four things that happens in each church age and if you'll read it you'll see each church age has those four things all right so it's a pattern or a layout of the way God does things first he'll always tell the church who is the unto the Angel of the Church of this unto the angel Church then he'll say the saith the Amen the faithful and true witness all right so number one is what always he tells who he is okay second now they may not be laid perfectly in order to read them but they'll be in each search aid the second thing we talked about was the fact of God would praise his people for their stand for the word he saves had a praise or has praised - showing the the fact of what each age is going through now he said what each overcomer will relate to that age we have we we're not trying to drag this out of trying to cut it short but see each age there overcomer will be related to the age of what's taking place all right no number one he shows the church who he is number two never aged now you read it number two he praises that church broad let me say bride because you know the Prophet uses church a lot but let me say bride all right number three he rebukes every age for leaving the word for the things they have among them for the things that are that has been brought you said but the bride now there's word that we go into you know we go in the message people well and I've heard this - God didn't rebuke that true bride if I knew I'd read a little bit I mean they something wrong you're reading he rebukes the true bride just as well as he rebukes the false bride God because he rebukes him for getting away from the word oh no they stayed with the word no now you're in bad shape because I got pretty good remember of natural thing you know we used to basically all be tied up and organized religion somewhere following somebody or somebodies twisted up for thoughts and Trinities and no eternal hills and ideals like that so don't think we've come down through there as a goody two-shoes now he rebukes ever age for getting away from the Word of God all right so what does he do first tells who he is second he praises the church third he rebukes them but that's not the end of it because every age every age it ends with an overcomer and telling that overcomer what a great opportunity it is to be in Christ for that day in time that you're living and he shows these age what their inheritance is all right there's your four things now each age will do that you read it then you read the next stage the next day all right it's a pattern that God lays down to wear that we can follow and see where we're at now you get to the seventh church age there's very little preysing now each starts off telling that he's the beginning of the creation of God revelation 3:14 next he does a little praise of the bride coming through but not as much praising as the previous ages a lot of times because look how far we have gotten away from the truth so perverted and so twisted up until you know there was hardly anything left until he wound up being were you say don't rebuke they will how come he's knocking at the door of the bride trying to get back into his bride right so it's a it's always telling who he is telling the point of praise telling the point of rebuking but then telling to the overcomer what what each overcomer expects you remember how we started the series to me it's marvelous that before he even started writing to the church ages you remember what that was chapter one he spends verse 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or 11 all pray telling who he is now what's the next thing verse 12 13 going on to that one standing in the midst of seven golden candlesticks like unto the Son of Man Girt about the paps with a golden girdle that's God in broad form feminist perhaps but you know God in right and in broad form alright so here was my point and it's always been before he starts anything of the book of Revelation you would have you would agree at least that the book of Revelation shows the most horrible things that art will take place in this day right you know you got your floods you've got your earthquakes you've got all of your things you got all of the world falling apart everything coming to an end all of that is in the Book of Revelations but before he starts telling all of that he tells you how perfect the bride is you remember that that before he starts telling all the bad thing he tells you how perfect you are all right then he writes the ages and the finality of each age is to the overcomer of that age and what they're going to inherit all right to the overcomer they're going to inherit certain things alright now here's the point you remember he said that each church age inherits what to proceed in church age brought forth now proceeding means to go forward but don't get tied up with it if you look it up Webster it can go backward alright so that's a perfect word that he used the Prophet used that to say each church age inherits what the previous age gets with it'll also hold hold what the future ages will get and then we're gonna read scripture in a minute and then you'll see what I'm talking about but get the point each age inherits the same as the other now listen listen to I'll try to explain something and and I get tangled up in it there's a human being but I believe that there's degrees in the body of Christ you you agree with that there's degrees in the body where everybody's not at the same level same point or same taller it's according to our abilities it's according to our amount of word that we've been able to hear it's according to what and and each one of us can be at a different level and different thoughts you get the Statue of a perfect man see you've got people all the way up through here okay are you listening then that that way we're not on the same level of understanding because that's normal I mean you run an IQ in here and what we'd have you'd have from my body part mine on the bottom all the way up to the top you know because I figure I'd be the lowest IQ in the crowd because that would be that's this truth all right see we're not the same all right now now don't get misunderstand when I'm talking about the proceeding aids inherit what this aids gets or that age over here gets what this aids get and we all come out to be to where that we inherit all things all right now so you didn't understand what I'm getting at so you take the ages and you get the first church age to the overcomer that age he has a right to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the paradise of God second church age he gets a crown of life and he's not to be hurt with the second death third church age he gets to eat of the hidden manna a new name written within that all right fourth age power over the nation's give him the morning star yeah future change clothed with white raiment I'll confess his name before my father six church age pillar of the in the temple of my god you coma no more out and I'll ride up on him my new name seventh sit with me in my throne as I overcame and sit with him and his strong all right now those things Darnell is not talking about your education abilities all right you following me it's not talking about where you are in the basis of what stage you are in Christianity or anything like that I hope you understand what I'm talking about that goes with that point that that's according to our abilities you know allows us to be but when you're talking about the church ages now each church age gets the new birth you agree no matter what church age it is each church age gets the new birth all right so now each church age then would have these things laid in front of it to be for the overcomer sure the part of the overcomer has related to the age that you're in okay that's to the overcomer in the age you're in that's related to that in the morning stars because the so and so because of this alright but understand what I'm saying it's not talking about your growth development as much as it's talking about what you are given think about it then the think about a wonderful age that we live in we just don't get to sit in his throne that's wonderful that's great but we get white raiment and your name confession before the Angels you get to eat of the hidden manna you get a new name you'll not be heard of the second death I mean is that the only age where it says number two age says you won't be heard of the Santa you mean all the rest I'm gonna let you be hurt of the second death no that's not the emphasis the emphasis as each age gets all of these things that was where we kind of ending up the point to talk about the first agents you get to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the paradise of God see everybody gets that ever born-again believer gets a right to the Tree of Life every born-again believer gets a right to these things that the others are counted overcomer but like I said the main thing of you dealing with overcomer maybe I should take 1015 messages on that but you know the main thing you're talking about the overcomer is this in relation to the age it's in relation to the bad it's not in relation to your new birth you have the new birth if you have the do burfi don't you are in age and got the problem but if you've got the new birth all right you will one day maybe not as daebak that maybe they didn't understand that maybe they didn't understand what they were getting but to you and me in this age we are supposed to have the complete revelation of Jesus Christ as we keep reading from 1st Peter at the revelation of Jesus Christ at the revelation of the full word at the completion of all things we should come forth to say hey I've been able to either the tree of life is this message the tree of life did he put us into the paradise of God by the new birth won't be hurt in a second death we can either the hidden manna we can be a pillar in the temple of God that's the six churches coming forth getting ready for the seventh and listen what is that what is the pillar in the temple of my god but a resin said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ coming forth in that sixth church age as the name being restored right six church age the name is coming back really it starts back in the fifth because it winds up with a name David and they're dead but yet that means there's something fixing to come forth and that six church age brought forth the pillar in the temple of my god what a revelation of Jesus Christ what are we talking about I got one in here where the Prophet said it what are we talking about what are all these things the revelation of Jesus Christ and where he's at and what he's doing and the overcomer in relations are said to the aged read then they overcome under each age get to church age book read what the Prophet says about that in relation to the age you're living all right now you following me get it in the relation of the age that you're living so what would be the greatest of all revelations that would wind up in this seventh church age even though it's the worst of all ages even though it's the the most horrible of every age the most deceptive the most you know spiritually speaking of a literacy you know not having knowledge of what's taking place is what I mean and coming to the point of in this age to be able to get to it this morning I know but remember in this age we come to be able to see how that we sit in the throne not on the throne there's only one we're going to Revelation 4:1 so you can go ahead and read it and get ready there's only one on the throne in Revelation 4:1 there's not a bunch of people sitting up on the throne well get all that out of your mind it's a revelation of Jesus Christ let her run him in what in the seal book where he says that lamb takes the book climbs up on the throne I believe it's in the sealed book right and sits down right Loretta said he becomes the one on the throne he said what is that he says the revelation of Jesus Christ it's not a troll' and a place to sit I'm serious I don't care about sitting on the throne with him you know maybe that's carnal to you and you don't like it but that's me as a human I don't want to sit on the throne none of us have any right and listen we have no right as human beings to consider the point of trying to sit on the throne with him what would give us the right to sit down no one has the right to sit there he's died by himself revelations 4:1 revelation 5 the lamb comes forth takes the book out of the hand of the one sitting on the throne what now and climbs up on the throne and sits down and said I'm the one that did it there are we in the message what are you listening each age inherits the previous age or even the preceding could get something they will get it eventually maybe they didn't understand in the day they living let's try to emphasize that a minute ago maybe they didn't follow that maybe they couldn't understand because you can see them with Trinity doctrines you can see how kind but yet still God never took him away from being his children Martin Luther might have been a Trinitarian to the core of all kind of books you know about him is what is his teachings but yet he wasn't thrown out of the kingdom so when the life stage gets to the overcomer of the life stage you see the overcomer of that age as I read anything the overcomer of that age gets to either the tree of life which is this message that we're devouring he's not going to be hurt with a second death cause he's gonna get a crown of life he gets to eat of the hidden manna the secret mysteries of the entire Bible he has power over the nation's because he's given it to you you've given the Morningstar good morning stars Jesus Christ is it gonna give you stars they're gonna give you a monitor no all of these is revelations about Jesus Christ you be clothed in white raiment but everybody gets clothed in white raiment all bride right and he'll confess our name will be in the pillar of the temple of my god what a run City taking brought back to the foundation of the apostles and prophets that's the pillar in the temple of God see he take heed back to the revelation it's not a building sitting out to her it's not a pushing a stone in a corner you say your carnal well is that striking Oh that I may be talking about me and you remember I don't preach somewheres else I'm not preaching to the Internet that's because they just get in if they won't it I'm preaching to what sitting right here today trying to get us to see who we are but what is the life's revelation that we read from revelations 321 sit with me in my throne all right not only strong though we're not trying to be that you remember the lady asked can my son sit on one side of the and on the other side of thee in your kingdom cause now listen what's he saying he said what a woman would have in her heart for her children to do that all right that's wonderful but just remember one time she was looking at something natural right she was looking at the natural instead of the spiritual she wanted one son to sit on one side of him and the other one said on the other now watch that can't be done because that puts somebody on the throne are you listening so he told her he said now it's not for me to give that right that's what Jesus told the lady little random said that trial our test had never come into being yet but it said it will and somebody will be able to do that not sit on his throne now we walk into the real truth evident one it's not only a strong prophet said it no that's not what it is it's in his throne a lot of difference in sitting in his throne and only strong always thrown you're gonna have problem because they can't be but one on that throne Oh wait'll we get down one of these days it'll strike home and you realize that someday I'm gonna say this this say it and then back away from it completely oh there's dozen messages down the road do you realize that one of these days the Sun ship will terminate oh I'm in the scripture and in the prophets message let's see if you can handle it so as I always say swallow take a good deep breath I'm not gonna say no more about it but you've got a time to think it over that the Sun will become subject they never will be but one on the throne they ain't gonna be no father and the Son and the Holy Spirit sitting on the throne yeah we got a long ways to go help me okay now listen that's off the message how can I overcome to make sure that everybody gets it on the Internet where he says each age the one preceding it in her it's all that the other one's offered alright so it doesn't matter whether it's forward or backward it doesn't matter if you're in the middle church age and you're going backwards or forward that's why I know I'm so carnal and that's what gets me everybody says brother Dale is so deep enough I'm so carnal until it's pitiful because you know how carnal I think everybody wants Alpha and Omega for the church ages he's how fun he's Omega and he's nothing in between my prophet said he's everything that's in between now he's when it made the statements there's nothing in between because there is nothing between Alpha and Omega it's the same God being Raviv but that's how carnal I get now looking at the it's a candlestick which would be the greatest age you'd never begin scripturally speaking if you're gonna take it literal and compound I'd rather been in the middle age which would be here right one two three and one two three yeah talk to our temperance he said what because the Bible says that he's in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks does that mean he's more in the middle or is he more in the beginning or is he more in the ending or or is it all of this and everybody preaches that he's Alpha and Omega and nothing in between that's the way they appreciate he's all that's in between he's everything so if you're gonna be carnal I'll be carnal with you so the Bible said he's in the midst so that would mean he's more in the tottering age than anywhere else not a rock he's the same in every age according to your prophet notice the Holy Ghost the Prophet said in every age right and the Holy Ghost is the same now who he's working through might be degreed because if they cannot have the ability to understand the word but he's still in every church age he's in the midst and each church age just keeps it keeps piling up until this age then what a wonderful statement to make to this age what a wonderful thing to come to this age and say to him that overcometh know what a horrible age to overcome but Brennan said one day they overcome soft living you know that's one of the things you think it ain't ain't none of us wanted to walk home you go over in Jamaica and it's raining and it's doing everything in the book and there's two 300 people sitting in a building and half of them are three-quarters of them had to walk to get there make us ashamed of herself and they're there rain sleet or whatever they're there now these brothers has been there they and witness to that and see whether the Lewis has been a lot of places were the biggest ports and the people had to walk get to church but you talk about when it shows up knowing that day they remember I don't believe I believe the Bible the Bible says we're all gonna stand before the judgment seat of Christ not the white throne no don't go wrong it ain't the white throne we stand before but we're gonna stand before the judge the deeds done in the body whether good or bad and yet you can lay out of church in time you want to and just justified well well we'll listen to the tape I don't ask for a raise of hand because it's the embarrassing how many of you listen to every service I listen to my own self two or three times a week me in a while or preach the next week I listen to or three time sometimes I learned from ownself and I sit there and Luke said Lord that was a good thought I'm glad you brought that in out okay forget it but listen what does it mean to sit in his throne instead of on sitting on that's easy to understand could you just climb up these chairs and you drive around but there's no such thing now here's one there's no seats the seats out around is left sure it's for the for you and me but it's not up on a throne it's not up on a platform as we'd call it a throne you know said no the 24 elders are all around all the seven you know I mean although the combat beasts all the things is there in Revelations for one we'll get back to it but there's one sitting on the throne how is it that you and I can think about sitting in his strong to him that overcometh remember what the prophets said he said it's not what we overcome it's how we overcome right it's not what we overcome it's how we overcome and we can only overcome by being in Jesus Christ right by the new birth is the only way we can be an overcomer without the new birth you're not an overcomer I don't care what it is how old you are how young you are without the new birth you're not in sitting in the throne you might try to manufacture something to try to get sitting on something but it won't work I just went through that there's only one there there never will be but wonder when the sonship terminates there never will be but one dark and that doesn't terminate like you think I'm saying it but it's way the prophet in the Bible says it so that's enough for me alright that'll come later but listen to see in his strong is in his domain which is the baptism of the holy ghost rah come on he we've been through all the years of the message in trying to comprehend this had any other surely it's easy to understand if you're sitting in his throne that you're in his kingdom and his kingdom is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth in your soul now that's how it comes up two bases to where we can say then he can say will sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and sit with the father and get strong not gonna spend a lot of time thought it goes too much into the message to take it but just remember the Father's throne is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth so you'll sit with me in my throne as I overcame and sit with my father in his throne now how did he overcome he came to earth lived on the earth he didn't have to receive the new birth to make him - that he already had he turn life it's situations of explaining our places all right so how do we get it in that thrown by the new birth that's simple the Newburg puts us in the body of Christ puts it here at faith in the body of Christ then the growth development brings on all the other put ever born-again believers in the body of Christ that's why ever born-again believer then get these things it's not that he chooses one age because of this or another age because I've explained that it's the overcomer part is because of the situation of life of that age yet but it is not given the new birth to one and not giving it to the other you know heard great men say you know well Luther didn't have the new birth Wesley didn't have it Pentecost didn't have it now to me that's his line as much as anything could be lying about because your profit covers a whole message in the church age will call the Holy Ghost in every age you say well now we didn't have this we didn't have that come on get down let's study the message are you gonna say the new birth is not the new birth are you gonna say he was wrong when he said the Holy Ghost in each age is that new birth just because you have a preconceived idea of something well we don't have what this has why not our quote would brother branham I'll show you where he put it in I beg you to show me where he took it out to East Church age would get the new birth in the body of Christ they would be a born-again believer in each age to receive the word of that age and make it live yes but we just don't have it like you see you tell me go even the prophets message where brother Brennan said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is was here back in the 50s he said just exactly like it was in the book of Acts now argue with those things you know you can't argue with it you're just squatting up and don't say anything see but tell me where it's at I'll show you where he put it in you show me where he took it out I'll show you where he said this in each age you showed me where he said it's not in each age so he says-- inherits the same thing now come on I thought you believed the scriptures I thought we was kind of over in Romans about eight what is it 14 15 16 so 14 15 where he's talking about that we are heirs and joint heirs with Jesus Christ oh now how did we wind up being joint our heirs by the new birth right the new birth gives our soul eternal life just as eternal what it is his love is nothing to say just as eternal is here it is his life the new birth is the birth of the word for every age and every time so it puts all of us into the same position but this age this is the age that it comes to that that will sit with me and my throne why did he place it in the seven churches why did he not put that in the first because they'd be no way to go to revelations for revelations for you find that throne revelation for you find that Kingdom you find that one sitting on the throne relations for okay because that's the one who goes and takes the book the new birth and all of the things alright not what we overcome but how we overcome the proceeding age okay we'll get everything so this age we'll have it all lumped up into our hands we get the Tree of Life we get all of the things that we read in this age what a wonderful age to live in we inherit all things no brother dad we just in hurt we just didn't hurt this we just got something for that age with okay go ahead and pull up number three let's read the Bible go ahead brothers pull up number three he that said upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son that's not just a 7th church age that's ever born-again believer ever born-again believer in her it's eternal life to be heirs and join heirs with Jesus Christ heirs of the Father because we received that eternal life joint heirs with Jesus Christ that puts us sitting with him in his throne now his thrones not to baptism with all those wait a minute now you're getting out of it well what is his throne because he emphasized to this church age if you'll sit with me in my throne as I overcome and sit with my father in his throne how did he become one with a one on the throne they know two people sitting up there now get that out of your mind it ain't Jesus and the father sitting there right what is his throne the Father's throne is the baptism of the Holy Ghost every church age has that what is his throne that we're gonna have the right to sit with him in his strong now remember not on but in his throne this age has the greatest opportunity sure because we let stand in a position of a wonderful thing because remember they without us cannot be made perfect day without us cannot be brought forth into the position they're supposed to be so it's gonna take us to do the pulling and what is our pulling we go through the statue of a perfect man we received the new birth and then we start the process of adoption adoption to bring us to the position that sure Luther Wesleyan never came into the adoption all stages that was reserved for this age but don't misunderstand now Martin Luther named everybody in this pyramid received the baptism of the Holy Ghost no matter what age it was the new birth of that age you see you're gonna listen to what brother so-and-so said he's to understood right here and declared it and I done told him twice that wasn't right I told him before he come to this building he wouldn't write he come right here and said it I said it again he said Luther and Wesleyan him and a juicer Street didn't have a baptism in the Holy Ghost I said brother we'll take bread around us a message and we'll just let hit answer you where the Prophet said I met people with the Holy Ghost what 50 years before he said exactly like the day of Pentecost well I don't understand that I ain't got nothing do with it does that make it not right because you don't understand it I'd listen if I was you I'd go back and listen I'd read it over because their simple illustration on the day of Pentecost 120 received the Holy Spirit outside there was three thousand her 42:5 three or five they received the baptism in the Holy Ghost that only got it at faith because they had no tutoring of the word so what happened on the Zeus's tree Azusa Street had the original genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that 2/3 of the to 3,000 outside God but around was exactly right yeah we think that we've got this figured out and I figured out come on let's talk about it why cause my soul is involved in this time it's not just the fact that I try to preach if my soul is involved but you see Jesus is thrown he had to come through and give the life that was in him and that made a way that the father's thrown the baptism of the Holy Ghost could come on their pinnacle the new birth all right and in the inheritances and the things down through the church ages would be dealing with the father strong spirit I'm quoting brother Branham but see that's not that's not Jesus is strong you said wait a minute you you you you you tell that to God no I'm not I'm not to God I'm talking about the God that's going to in more in this last days change his form in this last days to exist on the earth because remember now the next form that he goes to is the Millennium which is son of David you need to quote that is the promise that Jesus will sit on the throne as the son of David in the millennial reign the son of David the son of David is God in human flesh son of god was God in spirit phone so then for just a moment before it comes into that position out to be in the son of David to fulfill exactly he comes back as son of man all right as decent a van let me stay each other way to where you'll follow it because brother branham was ice on a man but a random was not the son of man all right well that's where we stand blunt and flying is we can be on that because you can't make him them but the bride of Jesus Christ is these will be the son of man the Word made flesh there is your age and what God is waiting for you and I to come to a place so is everybody else waiting for you and I to receive the word what is the son of man onto a page 12 I believe it's right either surprising the son but there's no problem what it is there something he said in the beginning was the word word was with god and the word was god he he goes from his throne goes for the Father's throne the new birth all right and then we get to sit with him in here strong why cause we sit with him in the father's from we got dire to the position by coming in the father strong the baptism when the Holy Ghost the new birth all right see somebody's gonna realize what's taking place all right not bragging been serious to think an old Trinitarian Baptist would come into this message and pick up this message and walk forth in it I preached my first sermon in nineteen in 69 also receive the baptism and Holy Ghost that year and that was two years and a message for I received it so I didn't do like most of you say that you're in the message so you know you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I never claimed that I waited until I had something certain I preached my first sermon and it was what the pride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man and I read from brother Brandon back then all I could read we got a whole lot more to read now you say what are you trying to make us the Word made flesh what is to end this thing up the Word made flesh who's the ended up the Word made flesh who's the word made faith the bride of Jesus Christ the body of Jesus Christ is the Word made flesh God he was the Word made flesh John 14 what did I want to get down at 14 or what and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us who was he he was the word who are we the word the probably said you become the word as you received the word let's say you're not gonna get it reading verse Almanac you say well how are we gonna get it you're gonna get it by hearing the word has to become any you and me these hours he is thrown that's the real throne he always wanted because that's his throne where his brothers are at right going the Romans they were join tires come on until you hit the millennium you have to stay in connection to get to the millennium because the millennium is God in human flesh the son of David his rightful throne son of David to do that you'll read it's not the mighty God I'm Way over I'll get it in a minute but anyhow we must become the word that's our job that's our position there's not a job as a position or a thought it would brother Dale how are we gonna I didn't make the books I didn't write it I'm sorry that I was able to read because by being able to read I've offended people I've become the enemy to people because I can read well I'm sorry for that but not sorry for the word this message is to be made alive by somebody and there is that throne that Jesus Christ had wrought to and gave up his right to then at that time he gave up that seat of that throne at that time now listen to what I'm saying he died he went to the grave he went for he gave up the right to walk right into that tree of life he gave it up and went to death but he walked out of there and defeated death we're gonna have to walk out of death we're gonna out and look at it face to face and just say forget it well are you afraid of die I can't die I can't die I died a long time ago that's not the point if you're afraid of dying then there's something wrong with your experience now humanly come on we gonna put a gun there ahead and go glory brains out and run in front of a train to prove something we're human beings that have problems about death when I look at somebody my sister burn the other day I ask the question always ask it from job every funeral I do I ask that question job said I know my redeemer liveth I asked that question because death has a sting to it until it's annihilated and there's death laying in front of you I said do you know that your Redeemer liveth if you don't the grave is yours right but to know who my master is because that's what Joe stood for said I know my Redeemer liveth in the last days I'll stand on the earth with him and he said I don't have to worry about it death where is your sting Paul says grave words you victory we've listened another day to the prophet and then a man said to him said aren't you afraid you'll scare people the way you're talking about the end and what's happening isn't these things no he said why would it's cure the bride I want to scare the bride think on these things to him that overcometh else it would grant to sit with me in my throne as I overcame he overcame by being the word and we can only overcome by being the word and it's not how goody-goody you are that's our problem we think it's something goody-goody that we can do our cause we don't do well I'm glad Lord I'm not like that no something's wrong we know we're gonna start believing when God tells us that we are something when we're gonna start believing it see a book wrote around gets over there and he's hammered down hard and hard about the church this away in the church that away and he mentions it he stops right in the middle oh he said I called you bride I call you bride well evidently before then he wouldn't capable of calling bride he said I call you bride the bride only wants to be satisfied were in his presence not to get up on the throne and sat down with him no let him get in to you and me there's a little difference in climbing up trying to be there and letting him come and live in you a little difference than that let him come and live in her heart let's down what do we got let's sing that of course through it all through anybody have a
