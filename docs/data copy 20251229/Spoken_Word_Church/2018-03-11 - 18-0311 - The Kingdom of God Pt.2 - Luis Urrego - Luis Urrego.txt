========================================

all right we will continue speaking about this kingdom of God and last time when we left off we talked about we were discussing how the kingdom is not it's not an external Kingdom and we gave some examples as to how the Jews were looking for a kingdom when Messiah would come was looking for an external Kingdom that to be built here on earth and that wasn't the that wasn't what was in God's image that wasn't his interest obviously it's like us you know I see it this way as God's building his kingdom you know he's building a kingdom within us right right we'll get to that later but character what does that day that power that character therefore Christ is gonna have a physical Kingdom you know later but it's got to be built spiritually first the character has to be there first because it's gonna be filled by his people by his children right it's gonna be it's gonna be his children they're gonna possess it right right but you have to have that character that Kingdom already completely built in you before you can compose that's the physical key thing so that's kind of where I want to go with it but let's just look at this but uh let's look at this here uh interesting scripture in John chapter 18 this is when Pilate was talking to the to Jesus and let's just read verse 33 says then Pilate entered into the judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto Him art thou the King of the Jews so he wanted to know if he was the King of the Jews or maybe he wanted to see what he would say jesus said answer to him say stuff because whenever you ask Jesus a question he's going to answer your question right he'll give you the answer did you just ask that's the reason why you said Axman you shall receive seek and you shall find him and he even gave an answer to to to to Pilate right he answered him saying Satan's sayst thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me in other words are you saying this because it's revealed to you that I'm or are you saying that because somebody else has said it to you Rome has told you that I'm the king of the Jews right so Pilate answered and said mi jus thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what has thou done so your own nation in my duty to answer that question I'm not concerned about these things your own nation your own people have delivered me that you to me Jesus verse 36 jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world so he plainly says it right there if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews this way if it was a if it was of if his kingdom was was when he would come when he was here on earth being come to establish a physical Kingdom obviously he'd have servants he'd have people just like a nation has an army has sergeants has man there hasn't you know people's support right but he didn't have that now we know that there was cuz I mean that he could call legion of angels to stop the whole thing and they were not stopped he never owned a truck but then where would we have been you see the plan of redemption wouldn't have continued right in scripture would not have been fulfilled and to Jesus in the physical right because we know he was just as much human as he was God when he was here on earth but his whole main point was to fulfill that Scripture the scripture had already spoken about him to do certain things and because he was the word he had to fulfill the word so then with my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence my kingdom is not from this worldly man Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou a king then no are you of him so he's asking them pretty much kind of the same question they just invented a good first verse 33 jesus answered thou say us that I am a king to this end was I born see saying yes I am a king and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth for this kingdom hear my voice so Jesus here is speaking heat now he's turning it back to a spiritual Kingdom right he's turning them back to a kingdom the real reason why he came here to earth right to bear witness of the truth and we know that he is the truth and we know that because he there's different scriptures that I am the way the truth and the life right that word is truth and another scripture says you know man so we know that he is the truth but everyone that hears my voice jesus said it's of that truth or in other words it's of that Kingdom that's the kingdom that he's come here to establish right Pilate said unto him what is true and then look like what happened and when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews now even when we think we continue reading we we don't see that jesus answered this question there because why Pilate immediately just kind of walks out he asks him what what is right him being a philosopher that he is or whatever you know what is true there is no you know kind of nonchalant what is truth and he walks out and Jesus then you know they give otherwise Jesus would have told him mm-hmm right weird of answered his question but he had already told him who he was at the bed and the first few verses so this is the kingdom that uh that Jesus come to establish all right and Romans uh let's read Romans chapter 14 you have your scriptures I don't have it up here now you know as when we first come into the messes and I told you guys that I was gonna get a little little I got a little carnal with this if you could say it that way but you know thanks to a lot of people the kingdom of God is hair dress and doing external things and I'm gonna read you a quote I've read you several quotes but I'll read you hear what Paul says because a lot of people are fixed that you know a sister comes into the message and they let their hair grow out and they think some of them get get get to you know I get to the points that well my hair is longer than yours that I must be holier than you and that's not the case yes because because I mean there's I'm sure there's cases where the sister will look down on another sister because their hair is not all the way down to the floor right no sister can't help that but right that's all right sister can't help that in you have an extremely long hair doesn't make you holier than somebody else because I heard you've always heard the phrase you know you're gonna have long hair but have long tongue yeah I'm talking about everybody at church but your hair is long and you dress right yeah and you're hurting the body of Christ right here Tom Evans my friend so you know some people would think well the unites the kingdom of God it's all these external things but we'll read Romans let's just read Romans 14:17 that's where the kingdom of God is not meat and drink in other words physical things but righteousness and peace and joy in in the Holy Ghost any man now when you have the Holy Spirit that's what's gonna produce this penis righteousness peace and joy it's not your own righteousness okay it's his righteous right amen and it's so easy for us to when we come become Christians or we come into the message for us to be so legalistic right right that we you know I can't do this I can't wear some man they think they can't wear long sleeve shirts you know but that's up to you if you don't want to wear the Lugg I mean if you don't want to wear short sleeve shirts right that's up to you you know we're not condemning you you're not going to be condemned but I want to see what I want let's see what Paul says let me just see what Paul says cuz I mean I saw it when I first come into the message I saw a lot of that oh yeah and and then you cut your that way as well but as you start growing in the Lord you you start balancing things in your life then you start seeing that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink amen so let's treat this this chapter of Romans chapter 14 it says I'm in Jeremiah and you know we just want to take our time scientists still have two more Sundays obviously you know Paul speaking here about this kingdom of what is not alright verse 1 it says him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations in other words there's going to be people Christians that are going to first come and get saved or people that come to the church and start getting safe they're not going to know everything they're not gonna know you know that's the reason we have to be patient receive you in the faith right right received them in the faith verse 2 for one believes that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs in other words one of them believes but there's a Christian that believes I can eat everything including pork including all these things but your brother weight obviously blazing right but then there's another one that says well I just eat out to eat vegetables but I chose a weak those about to eat another who is weak urghhh some vegetarians touring the spiritually weak so there's another one that that things well I should and now this is speaking about the Romans because right there was a lot of issues about Christians eating meat and sacrificed to idols during that time should we or should we not uh should we hug that there was questions in people's minds that Paul has to deal with but now if you take those things and bring them to our day we don't have to worry about you know I meat being sacrificed to idols that it could be I don't know what they do at Publix I don't know what they do but I just take it in prayer and continue on sometimes we can get so caught up with these little things you know these little external things and you forget of the big picture of the kingdom of God you see so so verse 3 let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not right in other words don't don't don't look down on the one that that puts up the Christmas tree and you don't put the Christmas tree up or vice versa right I'm gonna need the Christmas tree because that's a big thing yeah there's people they don't want to put Christmas trees they don't have the faith to put a Christmas tree but don't look down on them and I and you're not gonna you shouldn't look at one that does put them down on the one that does put the Christmas tree up because they're doing that's that's they have full faith to do it right so let's just leave it up in the rest in here but it did have a little bit like you know sort of a little bit type of snowy to look nice white BER story first three are items let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for God have received him right who art thou that judgest another man's servant to his own master he standeth or falleth yea ye shall behold enough for God is able to make him stand one man esteemeth one day above another much let's just look at Christmas another example one man in other words looks at Christmas I love Christmas right another steamin every day alike another one says every day to me is a life you know I don't look at Christmas better than another day right let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind right in his own mind he that regardeth the day in other words looks at the day and keeps it regardeth it unto the Lord right all right don't you do it for the Lord sink right no you don't you don't celebrate Christmas or you don't do things around Christmas because you're doing it for the world pull out your bottles of champagne and dress up as Santa Claus and you know and all that all that stuff you know you do it unto the Lord for the Lord he does not regarded it regarded he that eateth eateth to the Lord for he giveth God thanks and he that eateth not to the Lord he eateth not so to the one that does it and the one that doesn't do it they're both doing for the Lord right and give it God things for none of us liveth to himself and no man amen for whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lord's centra either way we are the Lord's because you know see God knows the reason and it knows your heart your reason why you do things or why you don't mean things and if you don't have the faith enough to not do certain maintenance don't do it because another brother or sister does it right you know and then we have to be careful as Christians to not boast because we have the faith enough to do it and another Christian doesn't you know it doesn't want to do it a lot of people you know when I came into the message and that's how that's how you know I got around people that you know you know I didn't want to do certain things or that they would do they were too written necessarily bad but I just didn't feel comfortable but they would just kind of do it in front of me you know and then it really like well okay and this person was an older person than me well that kind of you know that just kind of the ability you know put me put me down you see so you just have to be you have to walk you have to walk be careful around around people am I going to do something around my brother that I have full faith in doing but I know that it's gonna offend my brother would would I would would I would I would I put a stumbling block and my brothers walk it with Christ just so that I can get the pleasure in that I have full faith in doing whatever I'm doing around them you see my you all see what I'm trying to say this is what Paul is talking about [Music] first night first night foot to this end Christ both died and rose and revived for that he might be Lord both of the Dead and living in control but why does thou judge thy brother or why does thou setting off thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ for it is written as I live saith the LORD every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God verse 12 so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God verse 13 let us not therefore judge one another anymore but Judge this rather that no man put a stumbling-block or an occasion to fall in his brothers way that's pretty clear yeah I know you and listen to what Paul says here I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself so there's nothing unclean there's nothing bad of itself let's take the TV for example it's not bad within itself I can have it in my home but it's what how I use it right that makes it that makes it bad we all have internet on our cell phones it's just as bad as a deviant worse than the TV you know we brought about the TV and shooting the TV out of the house we should be shooting our phones and our computers out of there that's worse [Music] that's worse we've been more damaged through internet than theirs but it's the way you use it it's the way I use the Internet that's gonna that's you know that's gonna bring glory to God or not right so there it's nothing but it's not bad within itself but Graham said TV could been used for a good purpose and it has been used for good you know preaching the gospel and things like that but we know that that these things have also it's it comes from the from the knowledge of tree and the tree of knowledge of good and evil let us not therefore throw to see verse 14 know and portrayed by Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean or except but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him it is unclean so if you think celebrating Christmas is is bad then it to you it's bad all right I'm just giving Christmas as an example but don't you don't have to proclaim it to everybody else and get her convert everybody else to go your way and vice versa you that celebrate Christmas you don't make converting everybody out there you need to put at the Christmas tree you know that and all this stuff right right now let verse verse 15 but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat in other words if that brother be grieved with you celebrating Christmas now walkest thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died in other words don't don't destroy him with your with your doctor with your own thing your own idea about things you see let let not then your good be evil spoken of verse 17 for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost for he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of man verse 19 let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things were with one may edify right for me destroy not the work of God so in other words because of you know like let's not destroy what God is doing and let's not get sidetracked by all these things just because you want to be heavy about oh that you celebrate Christmas right all things indeed are pure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence so that person that eats and doesn't have full faith to him it's evil right it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended for his mate week past I'll fake it have it to thyself before God if you have faith for these things you know then you have it to yourself right we're all growing in different levels all right and we just be patient with one another and if you feel like a sister or a brother or well they're not to up to par to where I am let the Lord do the work right you don't need their Holy Ghost you can't be their Holy Ghost you know because it's the Lord that does the work for one here I always say if if the Lord does the work if we let the Lord through the work it's gonna be done right right well when we convince somebody else that's the reason why arguing doesn't does it bring it to anything foolish disputations and stuff like that you're not gonna convince somebody with argument yeah fussing never it's better you know when your father window when you see the fuss about to start you just stay quiet let things simmer down let things calm down 3 2 1 1 2 3 what the heck is it bothering me you say that she hasn't heard you say that sounds much better it is good neither to verse 21 it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink one or anything where how thy brother stumbleth or is offended who is made weak has thou faith have it to thyself before God happy is he that condemned that condemneth not himself in that thing which he allowed verse 23 and he that doubted his damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin but whatsoever is not a faithless man right you know if if to me now this is me if I was if I was in a third world country and I was I was sitting down to eat food and I knew that that food was sacrificed unto idols I'd still eat it because I have faith I know where I'm standing that it was and plus the thing is is that I want to be able to come at you know take because sometimes if you don't partake in what in it's something that now if it's something you know taking off your clothes and stuff like that you know that's a bit of different thing but this is me now I would eat for the sake of trying to convert these people right that's just me but now you may not do it because your conscience may not allow them you don't have to faith enough to do it and I'm not saying that bus and leave but that's just me sure that's just what I was because nothing within itself as bad as an all set right it's what Paul said and he said I'm convinced so you see so and he that doubted this damned if he because he eateth not a faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin and verse 15 last verse chapter 15 verse 1 we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves amen does anybody have any questions or any any comments about that for the joke blood blood I mean to me at one point at one point I thought it was it was bad eating blood now live drinking lots of fresh warm blood you know I just want to do it because I don't want that iron taste in my mouth and I just thought that's not what I eat but I mean I'm eating chicken and all the time we get we go into the in your Nui blood is your blood in there BAM based around these guy blood and I mean so I guess we're all condemned because we drink you me blood you're not hurt stay really within it so if you give a Paul said in another place you know as it Paul or Peter he said everything is good that God created if you give thanks you know when you give thanks but if you don't have the faith to do it then you don't do it that doesn't make you better in the kingdom of God than me you see a lot of that over Rachel they we're talking about an Testament kind of research that a little bit back especially during this time they would take an animal and bleed it out while it was alive and take the blood and actually come right out of the vein of the neck and just get gallons of it and then they were taking drink it but that was a ritual knotted to die they're done until their guy that's a very good yeah it was it was a ritual to their gun and Paul probably saw this and he said okay yeah you know don't don't drink blood of alive like oh that animal was life yeah he was standing and living and they punched his neck and the blood come out like water you know they were drinking it let animal was still alive but they were going to sacrifice that animal to them whatever God they had right that would be long I know other tribes in Africa in the desert where they don't have water source of water really change the mindset and I would have faith that God will do something to help me to bring me water or print something assignment you're not great wine I'm great yeah I mean we have we have a dish we have a dish and that big sister Trudy she knows what I'm talking about it's called blood sausage yeah and what it is it's they look good they take it well to us it's like a gut it's like chitlins they take they take the gut you know and clean it out they they stuff that gut with it usually pig with rice some meat or something like that and and and then it's sort of it's cooked in in blood as well it's be cooked in blood it's really good now there's a lot of Christians they don't eat that when they come to Christ they said no that's blood and I don't want to eat it for me I have no problem with it's good but I mean but again listen if I'm around Christians that don't want to eat that because of their faith I won't eat it because I don't want to be a stumbling block right there right I'm trying to help these people out spiritually I won't eat it I'll sacrifice my my pleasure of enjoying that for their sake and that's what Paul was discussing here yeah right amen so does anybody have any other comments or anything we have ten more minutes amen okay we don't have to like Ethan if you go out and leave it to people you know first you know if you come to our church you need to wear you've had people come in wear pants and people condemned it now we don't let it go long she's not gonna be here six months until we're there now yes sir okay but one or two three times you they'll either get the revelation or they leave and most of them leave and want to stay will come you know they get they become do Chrismukkah they see the the testimony your testimonial positions you know so and I was lucky I watched that in a lot more you did because back when I was 12 13 14 I mean you heard sermons for hours of dress and hair and clothes no jewelry and jewelry and long-sleeve short-sleeve women not to wear this not what I thought you heard yeah and it really didn't notify nobody know it because it's that's not what it's all about you do these things because you want to please the Lord right and it's born in you you want to do it right I when I used to do it when I was a Christian in the denomination of it uh you know I would wear shorts you know when I became when I came into the message you know I'm gonna hurt your brother brown I'm talking about these man wearing shorts and how 65 they look and all that stuff and then just one day I was running in the car with my dad to the bank and all of a sudden I was like I don't want to wear these things and you know not you know to go out you know I don't want to wear these things anymore and my dad my mom had told me to stop wearing my it's a different thing than you don't want to do something vigor within yourself and somebody else telling you and that one has to be Russian they did it's to be registered in all them years teaching what brother Dale's teaching us and there's now about salvation and judge navigation the same kitchen getting all the clicks pen would have preached that forty years ago at the Church of being a lot better so yeah absolutely because you can get a hold of go still woman to work their pants I mean brother Brown said that so if you wear pants you ain't got although going to me that just black and a lot if you cut your hair programs it's an abomination what brother Brendan say if the Bible says I keep playing but the Bible says these things right right so then so if you still do and you know they just pretty that's pretty cut-and-dried right and man the same way stuff that we didn't know you know shorts doesn't ask cannot do that and like you say that mom and dad was to lean back though if you're not a born-again Christian you gonna wear them just out spying a promise yeah that's fine but that's the reason why I you look at the youth well they won't do it around you when they're still living with you at some point in time that desire hasn't changed in them they're gonna do it oh yeah because they were just suppressed for a while but at the new birth doesn't come in there to change that that's right they're gonna go out and do it anyways that's right so it's very doctoring that determines a man's shirt sleeve length others there's no searches there searches in Latin America that they do that they used to be a lot of America I remember brother picture I'm sure there is brother Harold Hildebrandt with preaching one time over an Alabama brother he took your shirt no he took his coat off and it was short slave and I mean you know and he stopped in the middle of service he said folks if it offends you I put my shirt back on he sitteth ain't no word the Bible tells me I gotta wear a long plate chart right so he said I'm gonna cut back on which would be fine but he just kept on preaching got a real good job I remember that sermon probably because he stopped and say it and he had a short sleeve you know know that go from Penhall yeah the come from penico brother brother from South Carolina and he would tell me because he came out of what's called progressive Pentecost and the man couldn't wear they had to wear like their suits they always had to wear white long-sleeved shirts yeah they could never wear colored shirt like this they could never but that was Pentecost but then when he came into the message that idea was still in there but it just took a little while you know do them to kind of wait a second this is this is this is just external stuff you know right I've been to churches where the women can't wear flip-flops or sandals yeah okay one minute oh no showing of the toes no that still happens yes still going and you know you know just all kinds of stuff but you know what well then there are one church did he the pastor wants all his blades to wear their help am never a nun not always down who you see the whole church and all they do well they got nothing to do with nothing no but it's just one after all but that's you know if you put down and you spare that on the people to me that's a waste of time yeah the waste of time to do that because your seconds for beating the women about their life problem well what do you say that human Shh I'm trying to be I'm trying to be like the Bible today that's trying to be nice but yes they have these doctors that fill up along their time but yeah multi-ball the profession not putting away of all that but if we got riding the clothes and the dress and the hair I mean let's move on to them because that's the key guy right and look including what brother Brown said thank God when the cop is dick told us you know you if we were to go to the church say we went to Gina Williams Church we're sitting there and this lady walks in with hair short is mine and sits down and she's worshiping God and I never think you don't know if that girl brother Ron said if that woman gets born again her hair just as long as that woman said number five over that's never got now we got externally we condemn her and I've seen many churches we were in fellowship meeting on time lady walks in she sits in front of us her hair was cut like this not all that preacher don't preach them that one the whole service just on that poor woman and you know what if she was a born-again woman in her doctor come to our church she got morning in really repented of God with aunty she's got her hair girl okay so you know but but like you said though we got to watch the whole life but watch the whole thing consider the end of the conversation Jesus Christ the same you to consider the end of that woman hurt she can't help she cut her hair but got morning in three months ago and her hair still looks short but she's just as born-again as you are in might be more born some of them sitting there with a handle that's attracting the green well so I mean the hair is just a similar representation exactly to them it doesn't save you know it doesn't place a Calise right right it's just a symbol right well you don't get saved at a simple no no search here so all the women you know had their hair down but they had it down on top of damn and I could not enjoy the message because these women sitting in front of me and I guess secondly that when birth control because everyone unpacked one two three four five you know those women was trying to you know take care of their babies and all this hair was in the baby and she was doing this number all the time never heard I'm sure what was going on in the bullpen because I mean it was just a distraction distraction to her and me she couldn't get that baby sail down on her shoulder because a hairball in its face she was doing this number all the time I thought lord thank you that brother brother is not safe parallel where we're all supposed to be logical about things too right all right let's let's go ahead and go on god bless you
