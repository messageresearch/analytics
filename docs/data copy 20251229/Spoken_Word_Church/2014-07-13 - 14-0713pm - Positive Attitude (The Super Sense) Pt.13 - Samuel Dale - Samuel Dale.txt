see amen and amen and amen amen amen and you want to see him Hallelujah good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like turning your scriptures turn back where we've been reading in Hebrews 11 and try to continue our thought for a little while and then play a tape there from the super sense preached in 59 and is let the prophet say all of the things at one time on the best that we can do now sister uh Julie said that if we'd take a prayer cloth and pass them about that they would try to you know and I've sent two one for brother Mark and one for sister Jeff so just take them and pass them among you say a little prayer let it go all the way down come around make sure don't get it stopped just whisper a prayer and uh we'll send it to them to show them that we are with them and praying that the Lord would will take care of everything and we believe it because he is God and he changes not so just you know do that for brother Mark Jeff there and we pray to you know everything is well good to see everybody in the house of the Lord I I hope we welcomed everybody this morning I got to thinking about it did we well say welcome to you anyway so you know we're we're glad to you know see you in the house of the Lord and everything and I did wonder did I welcome brother Lewis and his family I didn't know where I did or not so welcome that's best way to say it welcome you know that's the best thing anybody can say when you can say welcome that's really a good point right well let's just get right into our thought and we'll try to uh bring this to a conclusion today on this part now not be out of Hebrews we'll be still in that because we're still on the positive attitude you know and like I've said anybody in the Bible that ever amounted anything had a positive attitude so that's what we're trying to speak about is a positive attitude and you know for you and I what for everybody else is wonderful but we got to have something for ourselves so let's just pray and go right on into the service Lord Jesus we thank you we love you we thank you for your grace and your guidance unto us and we just ask you to help us and Lord as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and we realize that in speaking that a lot of times our human words are inadequate to be able to express what's really even Upon Our Hearts to talk to the people but we do the best we can we ask you to just open our eyes that we may see you and to come and walk in the light of your love father forgive us we know cuz we are human Mortals we have many problems and troubles and heartaches but yet we know one who will take care of all things we ask you to be with each one of these that are sick we're glad Brother Gary there's back with us this afternoon we pray that you would just touch him and open up those things in his valves in his heart or I mean his lungs or whatever it is is closing the problem and we pray that you would just let everything be well we love you and we thank you guide us now and keep us in Jesus name amen Hebrews 11 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his TR translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the word so just make sure now that the prayer claws get around to everybody and let everybody uh pray over them and uh do now I pray that you understanding what I'm trying to say um I always always say whether you believe it or not I want you to know what I believe and the way I believe it and then in doing that then uh you know I I can wait and see and and hope that something will come out of it but we were we've been talking about faith and this morning especially when we got into talking about faith being the six sense all right and that six sense is greater than all of the five because we we know that the five senses is only to touch this world or contact this world but God gave us another sense to be able to contact him and we've covered how that even a sinner can be healed a sinner can be saved you know because that's God is able to enter into the soul of mankind to where that he can bring forth you know from that inner being part of us that is wonderful now just because a sinner can be healed doesn't save them that's that's the point we've always tried to make and see then the even the old test Saints they had their salvation for their day and their time and it was the blood of bulls and goats and things but it could not bring the life of Jesus Christ into them and and all and you know and we've been through that where that the animal life had no soul could come back upon the believer so thereby It could only be faith for that time that they lived and and be for them but yet there was a Salvation for them as their belief was in the the blood of the bulls and goats as of what God Said right and then coming into the New Testament we move into a different situation entirely because now we've moved into the position that we you know they did on the day of Pentecost that we canot just be uh Sons and Daughters by creation or the children of God or whatever you want to call servants but we can actually be Sons and Daughters of God by spiritual creation by the new birth to where that we can can say that it's not I Paul said that live but Christ that liveth in me all right now then that way I live by the faith of the Son of God as he said all right see then Faith to a Christian see that new birth puts us into a different real a dimension as we read this morning uh you know to where that we enter therein resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus all right and that gives our soul eternal life so it places within us the six sense and it's just not a believing unto I've got one quote where I was reading where brother R said Abraham had it potentially we'll review a little bit Wednesday and then go on with the questions answers but see back then it could only be in a potential form because Christ had not come and died to give his life so there was no way that Holy Ghost could enter there in had it entered in to the man before it had driven out the unclean Spirit look what a situation would be and see even in the New Testament God will not dwell in an unclean vessel so he has to drive out that unclean spirit before he can come into to give new birth to the individual all right now that should be uh clear to all of us and we should follow it but what I want to hold a point this afternoon and then we'll listen to the tape part of showing is that as we read this morning where brother Brandon said there's only one class of people that has really that six sense he said that's the Believers amen a born again believer then enters a real to live in that real right our problem is is we do as we quoted this morning that the prophet said where we fail in the garden we fail in those reasoning factors in things you know to the point of the C test fa smell and here because it all worked no matter if it was within in a spiritual sense it still had to come outward into those five senses and we could you know then Eve could see she could hear you know all of the things could go into motion but we know too that we covered that the prophet saying it like this that man is to be controlled in the natural by those five senses you know our lives and if one of them is not working then we're not into full control all right but that then when that sick sense comes in it comes in to abide within us and control us all right dominate us bring us to a place until we can be what God wants us to be all right in that that Rim all right then we got down kind of to the last part where he said it like this he said is praying I think it is and he said Lord wake up this six sense you know we have it we have it if we have the new birth we have that sick sense within us but we can let it become so uh dormant whatever you want to call it lifeless uh you know so uh not let it in full control until it becomes to a place that is hard for God to contact us because he contacts us through that six sense all right and then when he does then that puts us to a place that see we need to have that one inside of us woke up and we were listening to a tape the other night and even though brother R him and said you know he preached a message called U gowake Jesus was for one but he he's he's quoting something I forgot how that it brought out but he said why do we want to wake him up he said he's not supposed to be asleep and I thought well you know that's a good way of putting it he's not supposed to be asleep he's supposed to be awake anyway all right all right now but let's get into the point of dealing with you and I as Christians bring us over into our thoughts into the New Testament and in the New Testament we still have the condition of where that uh a sinner can receive healing it can be revealed to them that they're healed uh things gifts can operate in Sinners remember there were without repentance and they can operate and they can see things and different things but yet the real sick sense that only comes by the new birth and that should put you and I in a place to at least you know think about what we're here far and we're not here to just haphazardly play along and be good Christians and go to church you know and live and die and just you know we're here for a purpose and I believe this end time bride is here for the purpose of one thing for that that six sense can be woke up and we can learn to uh deal in that six sense more I believe that's what these virtues are for am I I believe this is what the faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience call you know love joy peace goodness meekness long suff all of those things the nine spiritual gifts and is in the body of Christ but we need it to be open up and he even said if I can remember it to find it in here he says that we just put the six sense form onto healing and things but see it's for everything you know it should be our daily thing and I know we're human God knows we're human you don't have to explain to him you're human but I do all the time don't you you know I mean I I really try to tell him Lord now you know you live like I did so you know but you know the point we don't have to explain it to him he knows but yet what we need to do sometimes is is to let ourselves be to the place that we can constantly believe him and I I like the quotes the prophet would make about a Christian and he said who was it uh Joshua he said he didn't have to pray up to stop the sun he said he's prayed up for the foundation of the world all right now if he was what about Born Again Believers okay now that's the point now I I'll get to a lot later on is us to think of things more positive instead of so negative because naturally the first thing you do I mean you get down to pray for somebody and the devil says you ain't worthy now he don't talk to you that way if he don't pray that he'll move off of me sometimes get on to you and I don't mean that wrong I just mean that he does that to all of us and you'll start and you think you're doing pretty good and you're feeling pretty good and you you you're getting ready to pray and about the time you're getting ready to pray the phone rings right something goes wrong you know and you know I listened to brother randam and what he's saying here's a prophet and he said get out in the woods and be praying before service he said get down to pray and he says to the briers or you know leaves he said sticking my knees and hurting them he said then I get to pray and move over a little and he said the mosquitoes come now here's a prophet you know but he's just honest he said I just get up and and start praying anyway you know what about a man that says is so in contact with God until he can speak the word as he did but he'd say I had to get in my car and ride down through Kentucky somewhere up to there he said Indiana he says to get in the spirit of the Lord and I think if I done that I'd be 25,000 miles around the Earth I'd make about three trips trying to get you know in the point of being able to pray but what is my point my point is one thing let's don't make something so big and so great until there's no one that would have the ability to reach unto it and I'm not talking about sinful lives we should be repentant to get rid rid of that and keep that part clean I'm talking about believing God that we should go every day and thinking Lord what do you want me to do what do you want me to do Lord might change a lot of things for us to do a lot of praying about what we're doing then you've heard stories told I was going this way and for some unknown reason I just turned went the other way and come find out there was a wreck on that road I believe in predestination if I was going to go it would have got me anyway if you believe in predestination you better believe in that little nod telling you go the other way right you better listen to that if you're going to talk about predestination because that might save you some trouble along the way all right but now think about it only the Christian there only one class of people that can really rest in the six sense and that's the Born Again believer because the six sense is not something and I hope I can get this point it's not something out yonder right see that would be C field smells in years you it's within you it's not out somewhere else it's within you brother R said we have our Resurrection where he says inside of us where's the change of the body going to come from well one of these days a bus is going to pull up you know no don't come from the end inside out all right so we're trying to get to see what really faith is and I know that when I ask the question that sometimes you say well why does he keep saying that but has God ever really dealt with you until you know yourself that it was God and God Alone dealing with you well I've never had that brother but yet think back through your life uh brother I can't remember his name but I remember brother Zer knew the man and talked with him and some way one man told the other one anyhow brother randam had told this man said he was coming from one place to another the Jeffersonville he said the devil fought you all the way here no brother I believe it's brother Zer pretty sure you know he went and talked to the man and he knew him he said did you feel any different he said no I got in the car and drove to Jefferson Bill there's a lot of difference in the story right the way we think but what was in that man's way all the way that got took care of the Prophet said the devil fought you all the way see think about the simple things of life you and I ever day are supposed to be walking in a six sense and I will admit to you and I wish I had more contact with it I wish I had as much contact with a sick senses I do the five right but still the Bible didn't say I'll be with you always it doesn't say that it says I'll be with you all way that's what it says always is meaning whenever it is necessary for me to be there to help you always is never leaving you right but all way is just when he's needed to be there he don't need to be on the moon today because as far as I know there not anybody up there he don't even have to be there to record but you think about it now so let's just get a few quotes and then we'll we'll get on with it I go with number we jumped over we got over to number 15 and all of these quotes would be relating to the new birth to you cannot have the six sense without the new birth and and the things and you'll see that it's relating to you and I okay this is a message Serv we would see Jesus paragraph or page 14 now listen to what your Prophet this one really caught my attention and we believe him to be a prophet but read this read it with me look CU he's talking to a lady about something and she says well well we never live back there and we never seen him see we didn't see God like they saw him look what he said and I have seen him and I said thing of it is I thought Lord now I'm before two great smart churches now you've got to give me wisdom so then I heard myself go to Talking I want you to examine it never thought of it in my life I said man today has to be like he was then because he's the same man he's made up for five senses and if he stood and looked at him right in the face he still he would still have to have that sick sense of Faith to believe him no matter what he looked like he'd have to believe him anyhow when I come across that one I thought it's running six cents in your computer and you got days of searching of the things he said but he said Lord I need it and he said I never thought of it he said then the Lord speaks to him and says that man is the same today he's the same man we're made up of five senses just like Noah was but what's the difference in us what's the difference in us and Noah now to an unregenerated person there's not a bit of difference just because we're born in the New Testament don't give us a new birth it's the same people all right but that six sense when it comes in and that's what he's saying so no matter how much anybody can do it but if he don't have that six sense he can never see it what a wonderful opportunity to be able to see and see God you don't never thank him for that look at the next one that super sense we'll hear this in a minute where he says may the super sense May the sense of faith that belongs to the believer because he has to have it in order to believe Lord give us more of it oh Purge it Lord and try us fill us thy goodness and thy power let us walk it walk all the days of our life by the six sense by the six sense that's only given by Jesus Christ the new birth is only given by Jesus Christ because he goes on to paragraph 53 for the same message he's given your to contact you but there was given a six sense and that six sense belongs only to the Christian and you cannot have this six sense until you become a Christian it is the only way that you can ever have any more than the five natural senses for the natural person but six sense is better known to Christians as Faith the Christians now all right jump over now to number 20 we'll try to get this one and then we'll get on with the message this is paragraph 60 of the super sense you'll hear him say in a minute he says you cannot believe it until you're regenerated the Bible said that no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost we went through that you know and he said people didn't understand him especially Pentecostal people he says you're only taking what somebody else said what you learn by intellectual what you learn by the natural five senses but when the six sense comes in the Holy Spirit is he telling you what the six sense is the holy spirit it takes away all the reasonings of these six and five senses and lifts you up into that six sense make you believe things that you can't see taste feeli smelling here does something to you then you can say Jesus is the Christ because you have witnessed it not by intellectual teaching has taught you but what you've experienced don't you you follow with me now in this dispensation in this part where we're talking of a sinner can receive healing right a person can receive salvation right you know that's lost but the main thing is the six sense of the new birth which is Faith all right and when that speaks that's the part of you that speaks to tell you like I said this morning when I had it all figured out I had it all written down I was ready to preach something and something said you make your Tope greater than your anti top so s up burn it see all right have you ever had something to just tell you if you ever really had a revelation that God is real or is it just what we had when we was an organized religion or that they have an organized religion an imagination a concept then you think they can take a trinity and deprogram you into believing in three gods I'm going to hurt and I mean for it to hurt because when you get hurt at least you'll do something about it you'll either get up and leave or you will do something about it how can you swallow all of these doctrines that's in the message that are carrying you to another God and yet you say you can't be deprogrammed I mean you're still wondering whether there's two Souls Two Lords River Jordans whether Jesus was God or not the biggest portion of the people are already deprogrammed and don't know it I'm sorry but is it the truth if you take you to another God and another God is our thoughts or ideas contrary to God's word see the biggest portion of people ain't got to worry about being deprogrammed they're already deprogrammed or maybe they never was programmed that would be one way of saying it that's why I fight so hard against doctrines because I know the human mind loves to play with new ideas you remember Mars Hill they loved a new thing a new doctrine they wanted to hear something new but I want you to listen to the prophet and listen even to some of the things that he says and I want you to think about your own self you'll hear in two incidences speaking of when he walked up to a wreck and there was the kid was crying or the person in the car don't move the car you'll break my back he walks around and he said that six sense came on the scene and said the car flipped back over talk to another about a woman you don't do it but just think about it God is trying to get you and I to see who we are that's what this message came for let's go ahead we'll we'll play the tape and then we'll get back and how the communion the foot washing once he finishes go ahead brother I guess we we have to turn out the lights I don't know where we'll have to I got the background all right give this to Sister Julie book of Hebrews and the 11th chapter just for a a short message being a little horse but I had a wonderful afternoon with Brethren and sisters and never got in till almost 6 o' and I just run into the room and knelt down at the side of the bed at the bedroom and prayed for a few moments got up and picked up my Bible and started to read and I seen a magazine laying there and I picked it up and it was wrote in africant so I couldn't read that and sometimes in reading you'll strike a word and that word becomes alive to you that's way a minister gets his his message just start reading reading the Bible something first thing you know you strike something then something adds to that something something adds to that something then underline it and just go to the pulpit and read it God will do the rest of it you'll take care of the rest now sometimes you get so carried away to you make little thoughts of what little notes of thoughts that you thought sometimes in a meeting where you have to come quickly to the platform that just read over them little thoughts that you had maybe the Holy Spirit Will quick them to you again done that many's a time now Hebrews 11 let's read the first verse beginning and we'll read quite a few verses now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen seen far by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear isn't that Rich let me read that third verse again listen closely through faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear is the word of God by faith able offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet spake by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God translated him far before his translation he had a testimony that he pleased God 500 years of life too but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him by faith Noah being warned of God are things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness which is by which is by faith now let us pray just a moment and bow our heads Lord our most gracious God and Father we come now into thy presence again with Thanksgiving and not only are we now feeling that we are in thy presence because that we have bowed our heads to pray but we believe that we are constantly in thy presence because that the eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the Earth and you know all things and you know the thoughts of the heart therefore Lord the reason we bow our heads is to ask this petition that you would forgive us for all of our trespasses and transgressions against thee and that thy mercy once more would be extended to us in so much that you'd open our lips to speak and our ears to hear and that Thy word might become real to us tonight that these few verses that we have chosen to read might become a great help to every member of thy mythical body on the earth thy spiritual church the church of the first born that church that's been bought by the blood of Jesus that's been washed and has been Sanctified and will be presented to God that day without a blemish or a wrinkle how we thank thee to have faith to believe that we are partakers of this goodness of God through the righteousness and mercy of our Lord Jesus praying now that you will heal all the sickness thanking you for touching that little girl just a few moments ago Lin doubled in the room in that there from Pain see her walk out that little childlike faith and accepting you and your mercy and we thank thee for this and pray that you'll remember Sister Baker's little loved one over in Kentucky and the ones that brother Neville spoke of and oh God the innumerable Camp of the sick everywhere and especially Lord those that are unsaved and Know Thee not if they should die in their sins they cannot come where you are we pray that you'll give us witness and power boldness to speak the word and wisdom to know when to speak it and then speak to us when we have said enough that we might walk away and leave the people in the amazement wandering of the great Holy Spirit in his work granted Lord hear us now we pray in Jesus name we ask it amen I would like to speak just far a short time upon the subject of Senses we are taught that the natural man has five senses in those five senses control his his or give God gave him these five senses to contact his Earthly home and those senses are known as see taste feel smell hear those five senses which are known to the Natural man and they are good and we cannot operate or live a normal life when one of these senses fail to act your sight hearing feeling smelling or tasting we cannot be normal without them there's something missing some potion of life that we cannot contact without that sense acting and there good and they're useful and they were given to us by God God gave those senses but they're given to you as a gift and it depends on how you what you yield these senses to will be the way that your life is controlled the way you yield those five senses your what you see what you hear what you taste smell or feel whatever those senses are yielded to they will dominate you and we are grateful to God that we have the five senses but by no means was these five senses given given to you to guide you they were given to you for Earthly contact but there was giv you the six sense and that six sense is belongs only to the Christian and you cannot have this six sense until you become a Christian is the only way that you can ever have any more than the five natural senses for the natural person but six sense is better known to the Christian as Faith it's the one that governs and guides you and it is superior to all the other senses it's a superior to all of the senses the other five senses now I would not say that because that we receive the six sense that the five senses are no good no more yes they are those five senses were given to you by God and they are to be used but when the five senses act contrary to the word of God then they are lying now the six sense cannot lie it's a super sense and that's what I want to speak about this morning I spoke on a super sign and tonight on a super sense and the super sense is the Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you and if you let the five senses be yielded to the six sense it'll guide you and bring all the other five senses under control of that super sense for it's so far above the natural sense as a spiritual man is above the natural it's as far and as high as the heavens is above the natural man and his five senses it makes you believe things that you cannot see it makes you act where you do not think the five senses would ever think about it the devil can get into these senses and lie to you but he cannot touch that super sense that's far beyond his reach that come from God it's called faith faith is that great thing and the five senses does not control the six sense but the six sense controls the five senses the super sense controls the natural senses and the the five senses is C taste feel smell here and the super sense is something that'll make you believe God's word for that's the only thing it'll speak about and it'll make you believe for things that you can't see taste feels smell here because it'll take God's word and it will deliver that word to you and make you walk contrary to any other thing there is but God's word by faith faith does it now in giving this illustration of the senses the natural man is borned with these senses so they are nature given senses and that's really only thing he'll ever know about it in his intellectual thinking he can only think as a man he can see as a man he can understand as a man you hear as a man but when he becomes governed are regenerated or we would call it borned again then that sick super sense takes a hold of him doing so that super sense raises him up into a spot that where he has Faith to believe things that he could not hear things that he could not see understandings that he could not understand he believes in anyhow because he's governed by that six sense that super sense oh how marvelous it is to know it and to think how simple it is to believe it now you cannot believe it until you are regenerated the Bible said that no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost we went through that this last week and SP such a stumbling block especially to the Pentecostal believing people when they hear me say that Jesus said in Saint John 5:24 he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life eternal life comes from God alone and no man can say Jesus is the Christ only by the Holy Ghost you're only taking what somebody else said what you learn by intellectual what you learn by the natural five senses but when the six sense comes in the Holy Spirit it takes away all the reasonings of these six senses and five senses and lifts you up into that six sense to make you believe things that you can't see taste feel smell does something to you then you can say Jesus is the Christ because you have witnessed it not what intellectual teaching has taught you but what you've experienced what is the six cense to do then brother brandom why did the six Sense come the six Sense come for this reason now six sense is the faith the super sense now if the six Sense come for this reason only that was to make the five senses in you deny anything that's contrary to God's word amenu that's what the six senses part the scripture speaks of casting down reasoning the the F five senses will you can reason well now why should this man why should but the six sense doesn't see that at all it's so far beyond it it's so much higher than it is until it don't even have any reasonings at all with it we believe it far beyond anything that the five senses would have to say about it now get ready for a healing service see we believe it you walk by that six sense you talk for that six sense you live for that six sense die by that six sense and rise for that six sense that super sense something that's in you that's different from what the natural man is the natural man only has these and they're all right if they can be brought in submission to the six Saint if the natural mind says reads the word of God and says that is the word of God is speaking the truth but if it reads and say it's not all the word of God or or it's was something it was one time but it isn't now then that six sense comes in and says he's the same yesterday today and forever amen see that's the difference that's why that's so many people fail to be healed they're trying to come with an intellectual conception they say oh I U I do this or I believe this and so forth but if that six sense is saying that then there's nothing will ever shake them from that six sense the six sense is come upon the human being to make them deny anything that's contrary to the word of God any symptom any symp that's contrary to God's promise the six sense says it isn't now if the Christian that's bned again and the first thing you know some Infidel unbeliever gets around to the Christian and said now look here there's no such a thing as that Holy Ghost you're just mistaken in that you're crazy if you believe such stuff as that there's no such a thing as it that six sense goes right straight to work let me show you in the Bible where you can't receive the Holy Ghost you see I can show here where the disciples got it but uh but I well you say look at the six cents of points you over say but he said the promise isn't to you to your children well that meant their children there that didn't mean for you it isn't for you but that six cense knows better why it's already in you they've said it too late you've already received it people who talk to through there's no such a thing as the Holy Spirit don't know what they're talking about like a boy once peeling an apple and was asked by an Infidel debating a meeting he said what do you want what do you want up here he said I want to ask you a question while he was eating the apple and enjoying it a very simple sort of a look like a delinquent person with the hair hanging in his face and one tooth out in front and an old dirty overhauled jacket on he said just one question I I want to ask you the Infidel just said there is no such a thing as God it's all emotion it's nonsense to it it's all it is and the boy said I want to ask you a question Mister is this apple sweeter sour he said how do I know I'm not eating it he said that's just what I thought walked right back how do you know when you haven't tasted the Lord how do you know when you've never received the Holy Ghost whether he's real or whether he is not how do you know where there's faith and power how do you know there's not joy unspeakable and full of Glory when you've never tasted the see the six sense leads you to that the six sense declares that to you there's no intellectual Powers at all will ever bring that to you the intellectual Powers will reason and say why it's psychology it's something this way it's emotion with the people but when the sick sense come in it denies all those things and moves a person straight into the bosoms of God he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him by Faith by faith Abraham by faith Isaac by faith Jacob all by faith it's a six sense that does it six sense denies all Simpson all symptoms anything contrary to God's word any feeling emotion somebody say oh well I was prayed for but I just don't feel any better six sense would never stand still for that six senses say it's a lie I feel better I'm getting well God said so that settles it yes amen amen amen God said so six sense only feeds on the word of God that's super sense it's super above the senses it's a greater sense it's a faith it's a power that stars and drives amen it's something that makes you do things that you never thought you would do it's the six Saints the super Saints you get prayed for say you got got a hand you get prayed for your hand you come up there and you believe that God's going to heal you the pastor prays for you you go back the old natural man will say this you don't feel any different than that hand you're no better than what you ever was but the six sense comes along and say that's a lie you've been prayed for that settles it amen like a woman that come to a meeting one time and she come come here meeting two of them they crossed the platform they'd seen the discernments them women were just just swallowed up they were both real Christians one come up in the spirit came and said you are suffering with a stomach trouble and her face lit up she said that's true uh and the Holy Spirit said through me said and it's an aler it's caused from a nervous condition you've been examined by a certain doctor and he said that you could not have that I had to have an operation have it cut out she said every word of that is a truth then seen she's such a great believer and it said your name is Miss so and so you come from so and so in such and such a place he said that is the truth what was it the six sense catching it amen the six sense and the Holy Spirit was standing side by side the Holy Spirit was speaking the six sense was saying amen there it is something has to happen when Martha run out to find Jesus and when she said Lord what's the six sense if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you there's the six sense Jesus pulled himself together and said I am the resurrection and life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this what are you going to say reasoning there's a man laying on a dead and the worms is crawling through him but he's just got through saying he was the resurrection and the life that's God's word that's six sense beyond the doctor's care beyond the thoughts of scientific research def find all def find all reasonings and cast them down it's witnessing to God's word I am I know I will be I was I am now resurrection and life man he that believeth in me though he were dead yet he shall live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this he said y Lord six sense I believe that you are the Son of God that should come into the world Hallelujah thy brother shall rise again oh to the Grave they went them two together there something had to happen that was a super sense with God standing present something had to take place the sense was super sense was God there was something telling Martha that she'd seen him she knowed him she didn't recognized him to be the very Messiah and she know if she could only get to him if she could only get close to him and present the case just he One Promise come from him that's all she wanted when he said I am the resurrection of Life ye that believeth in me though he were dead that's all Martha wanted to hear all she wanted because the six sense the super sense her faith was moving her to confessing believing this woman when she left the platform it was thus sayeth the Lord go home and eat Jesus Christ makes you well oh she went home that night a friend of hers living in the neighborhood was third or fourth behind her and she had a big knot on her neck and here she come all thrilled about her her neighbor was going to be healed that ulcer that had bothered her so much this is one of the hundreds of cases thousands of them and this big knot sticking out on her neck and she come up I said no one would have to discern that but you're happy about something you've been thrilled because that woman sitting over Yonder is a neighbor of yours Holy Spirit she thought how in the world could that man know that it has to be something to reveal it to him so when that was said it said you're thinking about your neck yes do you believe it'll believe I believe it she said with all my heart I said thus sayith the Lord go home and you will receive your healing the natural man looked around and couldn't see no sign the woman with the AER went home and tried to eat in my she liked to died oh the natural man the natural sense of feeling still declared the offer there so after about a week or two had passed she went through the neighborhood to all of her people in the church testifying the Lord has healed me and they said are you eating now no not exactly everything I want but she said I'm already healed for by his stripes I am healed no matter what it was she was healed anyhow one morning the children had gone to school and she got real hungry she was standing washing the dishes by the window she came to the meeting another meeting about a year later and she was washing the dishes and when she uh first thing she felt a real funny feeling go over and she thought what was that felt like I wanted to scream and her husband had told her said honey you quit talking about that healing said because although he was a Christian said you're bringing a reproach upon the cause how can you bring a reproach when you're testifying to his word you'll bring a reproach if you don't testify to it amen that if you were healed you were healed she said that man stood and looked me in the eye and told me my condition and the things that I had done and who I was and where I come from she said I hadn't been in the building 15 minutes when he come to the platform how in the world could this man know that I never saw him in my life and he told me thus sayith the Lord amen you're healed and she said I'll believe it until I'm dead she said I'll believe it anyhow so her and her sister blor friend had Covenant to God that they'd hold that faith that morning she felt real funny and a few minutes she got hungry so the children had left some oats in a plate a little dish and said oats always this burner up if anybody ever had an offer you know what it is so she reached down and took a couple bites of those oats oh my she said I I have to to pay for it I suppose but one of these days I'll be all right but she noticed she was still hungry so she just finished up the dish she waited a few minutes see what happened nothing happened felt good still hungry she fried her a couple eggs and poured her a cup of coffee and got some toast and had her real Jubilee she just eat all she could eat she went ahead washing the dishes and about a half hour later she was hungry again Hallelujah no ill effects she put on her little Bonnet and down the street she went into this neighbor's house and when she got there she heard she thought there' been a death baby in the family they were screaming and shouting and walking around the woman had slept late that morning and got up looking for the growth that was on her neck and it had disappeared during the night hallelu prise our god what was it God at work up here FAL Tabernacle when we had that meeting that bar that come in there and was prayed for many of e God gave those senses but they're given to you as a gift thing that's contrary to the word of God told me my from certain place that's right prise God what was it God at work up here at Cale Tabernacle when we had that meeting that bar that come in there and was prayed for many of was there to see him they brought him back in that emergency room Billy led me to him they had him on a platform for three or four nights or on the in the building he didn't get a prayer card so they put him in the emergency room I went in and prayed for him looked at him he said Mr brandom can you tell me some consolation I said yes sir son holy old got you this way he said that's right I said your name is such and such and come from a certain place that's right he said he said what about my healing I said by his stripes you were healed he went home testifying giving God praise and he brought such a reproach they claim in the neighborhood until one Sunday a group of ministers come in and sit down by him and said you must stop doing that you're bringing a reproach upon the cause and the young man sitting there said mister if you were sitting where I am if you were in the chair that I'm sitting in you wouldn't try to rob me of the last hope I got in Christ that by his stripes I am healed and you know more said that sitting there paralyzed feet hands body back and no more than he sent that and out of the Cher he went glorifying godall but his natural senses said he'll sit there the doctor said he'll be there forever or as long as he lives but the six cense says by his stripes I am healed and he wouldn't have nothing to do it's cast away everything contrary to what God said that's what the six sense is for old John Ryan not the r y or RH YN that was the blind beggared Fort Wayne there where we went that day and he was prayed for in the meeting that was the night before the piano played the great position now he near without anybody by it and when he was blind he's Catholic by faith and he he stopped in the line and I looked at him and I said your name is so and so John Ryan yes you're a beggar on the corner you've been blind for years yes that's right you're a Catholic by faith that's right I said thus sayith the Lord you receive your healing said thank you sir I said thank the Lord he said but I can't see I said that has nothing to do with it you you are healed and he said he went down along the helped him off the platform the natural man couldn't see nothing they couldn't see no results from that at all why I said he's just as blind as he ever was so two of his friends brought him back and put him in the prayer line again and run him through again hard let him pass through when he come back again he said mister you told me I was healed I said you told me you believe me' he said I do believe you I have no reasons not to believe you said you've told me all things in my life and he said I don't know what to do said there was a woman back there testifying you she had a gter a few minutes ago and it's gone away I said then if you believe me why are you questioning me I'm telling you the word of God he said what must I do sir knowing he was a Catholic and had to have something physical and he could hold you I said just keep testifying by Stripes I am heal and give him praise the old man for the next two weeks or three he stood on the corner and he sold papers he would holler ext3 ext3 praise the Lord I'm Healed EX3 X3 praise the Lord I'm Healed when he come back to the meeting you next night I couldn't hardly preach for him he'd raise up everybody keep quiet praise the Lord for healing in me praise the Lord for healing meall as a Catholic he didn't know how to take a hold of Faith but he know if he kept on saying and kept on kept on kept on until tell that six sense would go to work that's right praise the Lord for healing me you stand on the corner praise the Lord for healing me extra praise the Lord for healing me and he walked down the street and there somebody come out say how are you John praise the Lord for healing me all right and they life that him and made fun of him and another little news boy led him over to the barber shop for a shave about two or three weeks later from the meeting and they Barber put him up in the chair and lathered his face and he said John he said I understand some little smart EIC and he said I understand that you was down to see the Divine healer when here he said yes I went down he said I understand that you got healed just to make fun of him and the old man said yes praise the Lord he healed me and his eyes come open out of that barber chairry he went with a towel around his neck the barber trying to catch him with a razor in his hand and down the street they went God's word had went to work Hallelujah little Georgie Carter laying down I know what you all know some people here close laid there for nine years and eight

love him I thought oh God do something foring I started to go squirrel hunting that morning I looked out before day nobody was out in the yard picked up a rifle and started through the house there was an old rugged looking Apple hanging on the wall I thought why did meia put that on the wall I looked at another and another and another till six of hung there I jerked off my hat and fell on my knees on the floor looked up there and then a great big beautiful Apple come down and eat all those apples up I look standing above there and there's that same light hanging on that picture y standing there and Milling around said stand on your feet go tell Mr Hall thus say the Lord you'll not die but live I went down and told him he wasn't any different but he believed that he held on to it there was no difference seemed like a day passed no difference the second day no difference about the third day it started and here he is a living today after years and years amen notice sitting right here at Miss Weaver I'm not mistaken when her daughter came at the healing of Margie margan I went down there and there wasn't nothing that woman could do should be dead within the next few hours they had a shot atud they could give her and that was all it had a female operation cancer R through her spine they scattered it when they operated it there was nothing to do for the woman I want to talk to her about healing but she said sir you are a minister of the Lord God and I'm not worthy that you would come into my house counting herself unworthy for a minister come she said I've lived the life I've danced and I've done things that I should not have done I've used bad language or whatever more she told me her sins and she said I'm not worthy of it I seen she was hitting the right line she'd have to get Christ in here before that sick super sense would ever go to work we knelt down I talked to her about though your sins be as Scarlet she gave her life to the Lord Jesus Christ and when she did she said oh oh I feel so different Something's Happened to me something's happened to me I want to shake hands with all of you just then I looked out and I seen her in a vision going back behind the house to a chicken coop I said Mrs Weaver thus sayith the Lord God you will make a trip to that chicken coop and you'll live she couldn't go over the way she felt can't caner eat her up she couldn't go what the doctor said she was dying and that's been I guess 14 15 years ago Miss Weaver 14 years ago she staggered up to this Tabernacle when she simply didn't look like she's able to get out of the bed little old bony arms because she promised God she'd come and be baptized in the name of Jesus we picked her up out of a wheelchair almost out a chair tuck her down in the pool and baptize her in the name of Jesus and there she she sits tonight look at her if you want to see a species of hell why Hallelujah casting down reasonings and scientific researches and everything else amen because the six sense went to word that's it look let me say this again just for a minute Jesus passed by a tree one time and it was a fig tree and he looked at the fig tree now please don't miss this he looked at the Fig Tree and there was no figs on it and he said he cursed the tree and said no man eat from Thee the disciples looked around tree looked like it always did an hour from that it still looked the same God never opened up the Earth and swallowed it up God never sent a Fark and lightning out of the skies and burn it to a charcoal he could have done it sure he could he never did those things what did happen the tree had been cursed the faith of God had placed against that tree's life there was nothing physical you could see but way down beneath the Earth down in the roots of the tree death was setting in it had been cursed the six sense had come against it it had to die amen started dying from The Roots that's the same thing takes place with the cancer that's the same thing takes place with the tumor that's the same thing takes place with any disease when that six sense of power of the Lord God raises up against it Satan come out of there you might not see no physical condition happen right away but that Faith holds there just the same it's been cursed that six sense won't that super sense won't let it go it won't pay attention to how you feel how you look how you act it won't have one thing to do with it God's word's been applied the six cents takes a hold of it that's all she goes to work the cancer GS adrenaline away it dies from the roots and it's gone certainly by this same forceful six sense kingdoms has crumbled lap one wall against another by this six sense the Red Sea pushed back amen and a dry ground made a way for our children of God to escape on by this same six sense Samson defied a thousand Philistines armed with armors and Spears am he had no way to defend himself but the Jawbone of a wild mule that six cents went to work and he beat down a thousand Philistines Hallelujah by this six sense the Dead's been raised by this six sense Mighty Miracles has been performed it's the most powerful force that ever hit the earth amen is that super sense called the six sense has nothing to do with this down here if this down here declares it and says Amen to it all right you're moving on but regardless of what this does believe that there's where the power if you believe in your heart your fifth sense of thinking lays within your brain but your six sense lays in your heart you believe with your heart confession is made by the mouth you believe with your heart yes sir that six sense that powerful force listen because of that six sense there was a prophet thr into a lions then and because of that six sense the Lions couldn't eat Daniel Amen they couldn't they couldn't get near him because of that six sense that super sense by that same six sense three Hebrew children are sold into a fiery furnace and the def hi the Flames of the Furnace that six sense all reasonings would prove that they'd be burnt to death before they got to it but that six sense stayed him in there for two or three hours and when they opened the furnace they seen one standing among them like the Son of God that's the six sense fires wouldn't burn it yes sir was that same six sense one time that the Apostle Peter was Ling in jail and they were going to be heading the next day and down at John Mark's house they had a prayer meeting that six cense begin to accumulate around that jail where he has been covered by prayer that's six cents went to work the pillar of fire came in the window and touched Peter and said come on get out of here the six cense it was that six cents that would let St Paul be drowned on that Mighty Sea when that little ship was watered long it was a six sense that kept him from being drowned that super sense it was that six sense and when the serpent bit him on the hand he Shu it off in the fire am was the six sense that did that was that six sense that raised Jesus Christ from the dead after he had laid in the ground because he believed the word of God Amen said destroy this body and I'll raise it up again on the third day for David said I'll not leave my Holy One see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hellu is that super sense cast down the reasonings of these senses believe the super sense the sense of faith that Jesus Christ gives by that same sense God spoke when there was nothing what is that sense that super sense is God the faith of God in you the part of God that comes into you gives you the super sense but that same super sense God framed the world together with things which was not and did not appear he spoke his word and believed his word and a world Shu into existence Hallelujah the six sense the super sense oh God pour it out on me give it to me and to everyone who needs it Pour thy six sense into me Lord I'm willing to surrender these five my own knowledge thoughts casting down all reasoning Lord let Thy word be true and every man's word a lie amen every reasoning every be Cast Away and let me walk by the super sense the sense of the Holy Spirit don't you want that that's the thing that we want God bless you friends that's what you need that super sense will ask for something and it knows that he'll give it it's persuaded for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him if the six sent says God keeps his word I give myself to him I surrender all I got to him my sense says this will bring it to pass my faith in God's word then call anything else contrary to it as though it wasn't Abraham met God and God said you're going to have a baby by Sarah him 75 and her 65 Abraham called everything that wasn't was contrary to that is though it wasn't he walked as if he seen God and he he believed he called anything that said that it wasn't any reasonings anything else that the doctor might have said well Abraham you're too old to do that that don't make a bit of difference what the doctor said what anybody else said what his own mind said what anything else said God was right am he stayed with it that's the six sense the super sense God give it to me God let me have more of it to minister to his people is my prayer this morning when that mother brought that little redheaded baby standing here

saian let us bow our heads in while we pray precious Lord Our God and our father Thou Art so good to us you give us five senses to live by and to walk by in this earth or to or to touch the Earth we can feel things that's that's to be felt with our hands tangible things things you give us hearing that we can hear we're so glad of that that we can hear the word of God and by that Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God we're thankful for these six senses Lord may we maintain them all the days of our life but may this super sense May the sense of faith that belongs to the believer because he has to have it in order to believe Lord give us more of it oh Purge it Lord and try us and fill us with thy goodness and thy power let us walk all the days of our life by the Sick sense by the sense of Faith that's only given by Jesus Christ that what we pray for may we believe that we receive it have no doubt in our heart and you promised that it would come to pass these who had their hands up Lord I'm praying for them they had needs you know what they were I pray that you'll bring them to pass every one of them may it be fulfilled their desire I ask it in Jesus name amen GES and only the believer has it because we're in that position we live in that faith we walk in that faith and church if we would just realize it's so simple that we do that every day and yet we're looking for something you know great when sometimes the greatest of all things is us just being a Christian and us just being able to believe God's word that's being able to just say I believe it no matter what the world says or anybody else live I believe it what about it let's stand together as we get ready for the communion if you would listen to the next message or the other message ours in 1960s I believe it 611 1960 of Faith the six sense and listen to these over and over think about it for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had subset saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood do do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do you the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to him him s not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged and I love that we're chasten to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together un condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come let's just have a few moments of Silent prayer and just praying before the Lord and thanking him for the word that we've heard you know thank him for the ability to be able to talk about a six sense and not to just talk about it but have it living within us and knowing it is the new birth that we're talking about we're not talking about something that we've got to attain unto it's something that he has given us the new birth that's the six sense open our eyes Lord un Thy word that we may see ourselves therein and be able to walk into to that that we know is already living with in our hearts in our lives the baptism of the Holy Ghost the six sents even just with that Lord is the only way that we know for shity what this communion is about and to see what it took place what happened for you and I back there a long time ago but it's still real tonight we love you and we thank you in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread and we pray it's been made for this purpose today and that is Lord that we may partake of this communion and we ask you to just sanctify the bread we know it's not your body but it's in symbol of it speaking of it an example how truly amazing it is to be able to see an example that would be a live meaning in our hearts and lives sanctify the bread and the partakers in Jesus name then it's a very solemn serious matter be able to take the communion to be able to know what it is and not be blinded like the the world that would go up and take a piece of bread and think that that forgive our sins or anything related to that but we do know the one thing that by the giving of your blood you know the Lord himself made a way for you and I be worthy to take the communion and to know what it is and to be able to walk in it and that way we don't have to worry about the the things of life we have it we have it in our understanding this is not the body this is not the the thing that the Lord lived within but this is an example unto each one of us father we thank you for this wine that's gone through the process now and Lord it gets better every day we praise you and honor you Lord for giving us and understanding this is not your blood but it's this example of it but it is something that once we eat that little piece of bread and we take this wine even in the natural it will be blood cells created in our body because of that we just ask you to sanctify the wine and their partakers that we may all be one together in you in Jesus name amen come morning I walk by the river I'll rest me the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question how oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount caly and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I walk by the river I'll rest need the ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's Glory me
