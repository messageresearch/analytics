musicians that was wonderful thank you brother dick appreciated that amen can we get right into it I'm not in a hurry but I am going to have to leave after service so if I could get right into the next phase of this morning's message we will first John chapter 1 I'm just going to read verse 5 it says an awful lot in verse 5 tells us about the message of the hour that we believe whether you see it there or not and when you have it say Amen first John the Epistle of John chapter 1 verse 5 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all let's pray father Lord if we could just comprehend Lord those few words father we would understand the message we would be the hearers of it Lord and then the manifestation of it father so we're thankful for these few words that you've left for us Lord we ask father that you would bring them from the throne that's in our hearts Lord to the revelation of Jesus Christ father which we believe for your honor and your glory in Jesus Christ name we pray amen god bless you may be seated now brothers and sisters again I apologize for being so so cut up but I there's so much going on and I and I I'm no theologian I'm just a man who meditates on God's Word day and night and it begins to take an effect on me and then of course as time goes on you you know let me let me read something to you this just to help out a little bit now I've read this under many contexts but today's context will be just fine because of course there is this contention that that we can't do anything without brother Branham there's a contention of that now I do not believe that okay and I'm not impugning brother branham if you were to ask me personally from from a humanities standpoint about brother Branham himself who I never met I do have family members who after I got to know who brother Branham was I found out that my grandfather and grandmother had met brother Branham in Hot Springs Arkansas that if you were to say well who would you consider to be the top five men that walked the face of the earth well I'd have to put brother Branham and at least the top five if not the top three but he's not number one he can't be number one Jesus Christ is number one and he wouldn't want us to put him as number one but not to impugn that see but I want to shed some light okay God is light I want to shed some light on some things that were left to us from the Prophet I don't remember brothers if I give you this but I'm gonna because I it's I've got written down Church ages page 138 and 9 I would have to say it would be the revelation of Jesus Christ big thick red volume series probably where I got this from because I can tell this is not polished up nothing wrong with the exposition now I'm not impugning that but listen to what he says it was not give to Martin Luther the light that's on the word today neither was it gift to John Wesley John Wesley preached sanctification that Luther passed over and the light comes as we have need of light God says it and it isn't opened up to us because it's hid to our eyes that's not the end of the sentence until the day that God's able to reveal it now this is the way God made me I read that I'm gonna keep reading but I read that I go wait a minute God can do anything how can it be stated that this is hid to our eyes until the day that God's able to reveal it he can do it anytime he wants but in his plan he set forth a pattern of the way that light was going to become can't come through its phase as if I could say brother Branham talked to us about it we know this that there is a spring sunshine there is a summer sunshine and there is a fall sunshine one brings forth the life out of the seed and the little sprig of grass and one becomes a very hot sunshine through the summer time which in many cases could kill that little sprig of grass but God made it so that it could withstand that sunlight of the summer and then we have the sunlight of fall of harvest right guess what it's all the same Sun it's not a different Sun there's not a bunch of different lights it's one light that God has ordained to shine in such a way you see he made it so that the Sun of the fall was able to bring forth the harvest not the Sun of the spring but it's the same Sun we're walking in the same light and I mean here's the things that come to me I'll just be myself in the evening time it's not a different light than came in the morning all right so he says it's hit to our eyes until the day that God's to reveal it wonder what it'll be after we leave that's brother branham saying this I wonder what it'll be after we leave yeah I am persuaded that there's very very much more that we know nothing about that's the words of the prophets I didn't make that up cuz brother Branham was sent here for a season and we understand that he tells us in the spoken word as the original seed that the message was - so is that right it was a sowing rain all right I believe God also used him for the harvest rain but it was before the Sun was able to reveal it it was born out of due season but then the season will come when those seeds that were planted by that sowing would come into position so that the Sun the light of God if you understand me would be able to bring forth that crop brothers and sisters we are that crop I don't know if you realize that or not but we are that crop it is the time the Sun has moved across the arc of the sky to come to the place where the seeds that were sown are now ready to be harvested there is a problem the Bible says the harvest is great and the laborers are few everybody wants to reap the benefits of the promises of the word of God but many many many people don't want to do anything about it here with me alright but we're gonna try to by God's grace bring a change to that if we could now again III do this for my own benefit so that I don't just get lost in the things that I'm preaching on because I have such a good time as you can tell but I'm gonna finish what I wrote down this morning now the devil would like to keep us thinking let me let me back up so let's take a look at our adversary we need to be able to discern who that is our adversary remember that the two spirits would be so close it's a spirit that reminds me remember when the big man was going to take brother branham off the platform in Portland Oregon I believe do you remember that we're policemen and they were gonna step out and try some brother Babb said to leave him alone this is not a flesh and blood affair I want to reinforce it this is not a flesh and blood affair and as long as people make it a flesh and blood affair they cannot produce the manifestation of the purpose of God there's one thing that the devil did in the beginning that kept a commandment or a mandate of God from taking place in our lives and it's affected us ever since okay bear with me it's not a flesh and blood now the devil would like to keep us thinking and believing that it is a flesh and blood affair but it's the very thing that this that Satan did that got Eve to take her eyes off of the promise of God and he tripped her up he caused her to doubt and once she reasoned that the serpent could be correct as he was speaking to her now how did how did the serpent approach her with a pitchfork with fork tools horns if the serpent approached Eve with the Word of God hath God not said you gotta watch that devil though there's that word not again God how come he just didn't say didn't God say but half God not said and when that was presented into the sentence it was a question think about it hath God not said it was the opening for reason now I'm telling you brothers and sisters this same tactic is used today he that the devil hasn't changed you know why he hasn't changed because he read in Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever man he was not a creator he's only a pervert or of those things that he can get his hands on so he has to use God's Word in order to get anywhere but what he does is he misrepresents the placing of God's Word the positioning of God's Word especially to the believer you still bearing with me all right so she began to reason that the serpent could be want you to notice how I worded this could be correct then her eyes were opened and she saw that the tree was good for food now remember brothers and sisters I want you to remember something this is not flesh and blood it was not a literal tree growing fruit you all know that not to go into that okay it was something that represented something else we know that not here to preach on that but what I wanted to say was the deception of Satan is all for one purpose and that is to prevent something from happening well there's a lot of things going on but he's trying to prevent one thing from happening okay the commandment or the mandate from the Word of God that was given to manifest his children listen to how close this is how did the serpent trip up humanity through Eve by children how close it is he's so sharp that he looks into God's Word and he says ah I got it I figured out the promise of God and all's I got to do to be God has introduced my seed into the lineage of God and then I'll have children that God won't have and they'll worship me and not God whew that's close all the time you know I can use this word a he's a dummy but he didn't realize he was playing right into the hands of God's plan because God is the one who allowed the breach or the weakness to be available for the devil to use without God allowing it he couldn't do a thing but God allowed it so that he could express his attributes the reason that I preached on these things is so that we we need to understand brothers and sisters that it's coming back not just to the beginning but just before the beginning you see I contend that there was a line drawn an invisible line that Eve was behind who was that line I'm gonna tell you something it was the Word of God in the form of Adam she should have stayed behind her head she got out of her position she did not keep her post of duty she decided to step out from behind it therefore she had to cross an unseen line that left her vulnerable to the wiles of the enemy the message of the hour that you and I believe was given to us in this hour to a certain group of people who come to a revelation of being able to step back behind that line and fulfill God's Word in its totality without the Serpent's seat we will not accept the lie of the devil we will not accept reasoning as our way of viewing God's Word there's a line drawn right there and we're gonna step back behind it and it's gonna be as if the world never fell into the hands of the enemy you see that's the reason why Satan has done what he's done is because he's trying to keep you and I from becoming the fulfillment of Romans 8 the manifestation of the sons of God the whole world the Bible says is waiting groaning crying for that day of sweet release the whole world can you imagine what you hold in your hands can you imagine this afternoon what kind of authority God has given you but that authority that's been given you is just like he tested brother Branham as I mentioned this morning what will you do with them they're in your hands now I realize that because we're humans and we have psychological emotions and so forth many of us will stop when I say that and think well gee so do we let everybody off the hook you don't have to worry about who's on the hook and who's off of it holes were asked to do is become the fulfilment and the completion and the maturity of the promises of God and those for our hour now Martin Luther didn't have the light we've John Wesley too but in our hour it is the seed coming back to itself do you realize that let me read to something I know I gave this to you brothers it's a uniting the unveiling of God listen careful I forget the paragraph he Christ is the word how see Christ is the word and when we're in the word we're in Christ and how can I be in Christ denying Christ we're invited into him which is hid to unbelievers there's that knock on the door brother dick we're invited into him which is hid down believers by the veil of human flesh see they know that glory he's talking about who it's hit to they know that glory they read of it I'm sound stopping for a reason they read of it that's what we're all doing it's in the word hear of the glory of God and things like that it's just listen careful what does he say it's just a word to them see brothers sisters I'm not opposed to what we have in front of us in the form of literature don't get me wrong but over the period of years and time that people have been following this it's just become a word to them it's time to take this word that's been a word to us also and manifested he says to us it's a manifestation see it's no more a word it's a reality no that answers the question of why reality television is so popular serious because it's now time for God able to reveal this and Satan doesn't lay down he follows the floormat of God so we see television shows popping up they call them reality shows you know the Housewives of this and then the lost of that and then the pioneers of this and the gold rush of that and on and on and on and on and on and on what is it it's to draw away the real intention of God's word that is not a reality to me it's a falsehood think about it it's scripted how can somebody be lost on an island and naked with the camera crew following them [Laughter] that's right let me come on but did you know brothers and sisters that those shows are so popular because the people in the world today think oh wow what about us you see that's just a perversion of the reality of God God wants us not to become a reality television show God wants us to become the reality of his words whoa I just got a chill on that one to us it's a manifestation see it's no more a word it's a reality amen God said let there be light that was the word but now there is light it ain't the word it's light see what I mean now it isn't just a written word to us it's a reality brothers and sisters that's what carries the elect past everybody else I like to say it like this and forgive me if it it's it's it's not something I say to demean or belittle anybody but for the church salvation is the end result and doesn't that sound good come on but for the Bride of Christ it's just the first step salvation becomes the first stepping stone for the Bride of Christ to become the manifestation of salvation not just a word that you can feel good about think about it cuz you and I run into folks all the time that believe they're just as saved as we are and guess what they very well could be but when you begin to present the word to them in such a light that it's becomes the man that's why God used brother Branham all of the signs wonders and miracles of the Ministry of William Branham on purpose did you realize that brother Brennan called them the bait on the hook all of the signs wonders and miracles were emphatic unprecedented you understand what I'm saying vindicated how could anybody in their right mind that that really believed that brother Branham was the vessel God used and then say he's a false prophet how could anybody see the picture of the pillar of fire and I want you to understand I'm not raising up brother Branham I'm raising up the pillar and father it's the difference maker it's the same pillar fire that you and I desire to have living in our heart isn't that right that pillar of fires just like the fishes and the loaves on the day of Pentecost it broke itself off and it kept handing itself out and it never diminished as a matter of fact there was lots of leftovers and he put him in in a hiding place so they could be shared in the day we live in not just 2,000 years ago that same pillar of fire is here right now that same pillar of fire is what should be living in our hearts and it is the light of God God is light this is the message he said okay now you say well well brother there's eleven or twelve hundred different messages that we can and there's 66 books that's right but in order for any of us to be able to see with a spiritual eye what's in here it's going to take that light a flashlight won't do it as a matter of fact I I'm not gonna read it cuz I'm just I'm having a good time and I'm not in a hurry but yes we have a plane to catch now he might hold it on the ground hope you can tell I'm having a good time because I am but I have to put things down on paper or I'll be up here for days the Commandant or the mandate from the Word of God is given to manifest as the children sons and daughters of God these words spoken by God that would allow this to happen Genesis 1:28 I wrote down so let's let's go there I'm gonna I'm gonna do Genesis chapter 1 1 through 3 2 a Genesis 1 verses 26 through 28 read like this everybody knows I'm in God wait a minute let let me be able to kind of help you see what I see and God saw that any what it says and God said now in your own Bible I want you to understand something that the very first thing that happened was not light oh right away that mental capacity wait a minute brother God said let there be light and there was light I can read that in Genesis 1:3 but you're overlooking something before there was light there was sound and God said that is the original seed the light that came into existence from God speaking became the manifestation of what he said and God said let there be light he didn't have to check over his shoulders I said this morning to kind of wonder if it was gonna happen but did you know the prophet of God taught us something he said that God had to have faith in his own word so much so that it's what brought it to pass cuz that's a law that he instituted for you and I if we take God at His Word it does not matter what these I see that's why Jesus when Nicodemus came and said born again come on how can I enter again you see where he's coming from how can I intellectually enter into my mother's womb and be born again and Jesus said well you think you hear the sound of the wind but you don't know where it came from and you have no idea where it's going but the children of God hear the sound and they're not looking with these eyes for the physical manifestation now but they're looking for the spiritual manifestation it is not a flesh and blood affair first Corinthians 15:50 I believe says flesh and blood cannot inherit so the inheritance that you and I are that the devil's fighting us over in this conflict is not flesh and blood it's something much greater than that it's a promise of God did you realize that we are in a conflict over the promises of God not over what we see taste feel smeller here but I'll tell you what see taste feel smell and here is a result of God said and God said let there be light so in the scripture it even tells us that the first thing that happened when God decided to begin this of course it says and God created the heavens and the earth period is that right we don't know how long that took but when he began to want to implement his plan and God said let there be light is that right listen to what the Prophet says here if I can find it real quick in God's Word calls for a total separation of unbelief God was going to use the earth I didn't know it for the first 21 and a half years but God was going to use the earth listen now and it was in total darkness brothers and sisters that was my life it was in total darkness but because God was going to use listen now he was going to use the earth and it was in total darkness the Spirit of God spoke out and said let there be light listen now and he separated the light from the darkness all this is the reason I read this whole thing and it's been doing that ever since God's word has been using light which is the manifestation of his word to separate it from the darkness that's the reason why the denominational men and the men of high intellect and the PhDs and the ll DS and the and the so forth and their so Long's look at your brother branham and said dr. davis said you you're gonna pray for kings and potentates and come on get next year south billy it's the same thing the devil's telling us right now he's not gonna use yeah he's gonna use the prophet see where that comes from see where that comes from oh we're gonna wait for the prophet to come back well I'll tell you what the Prophet said when they say I'm dead and gone don't you believe it that's his word because this message is not about just one man unless it's Christ Jesus it's about the body of Christ which william branham is a part of I understand that he was a very critical part of it I'm in your body we're all sitting here you let me take your brain out you're still a body but you ain't doing much you understand I want you to see that see because the devil is trying to accomplish something by keeping you and me listen brothers and sisters he didn't keep brother branham from doing his part did he he didn't keep Jesus Christ from doing this his part he thought deep thought crucify Jesus because he was in the mind of God before that he was the mind of God before the foundation and he didn't why pass this theophany he understood you know what this is gonna be really cruel and really hard and it's gonna hurt a lot it's gonna be the most ugliest worst thing that could happen to a human being but not my will I'd be done and he walked to Calvary and he hung on that cross knowing that he did his part how do we know that because he bowed his head and he said it is finished he did his part but he did it for one reason it tells us in saint john 12 that a corn of wheat abideth alone that's it fall into the ground and die if it fall into the ground and die then it'll bring forth much fruit now here's the key to fruit it's not just the succulent sweet juicy flavorful call for part of it that matters it's carrying the next seed it's carrying the next seed and what is the seed that you and I realize is essential what let me let me ask you this what is the original seed the spoken word that's why I'm emphasizing and God said let there be like so it wasn't the light that we should be focusing on it was what he said because that's the original seed now what else does the Bible say and I'm cutting out a lot of my message it says every seed you see in Genesis 1:26 7 and 8 which I was going to read but for the sake of time you know it you can read it verse 28 says be fruitful and multiply and right there Satan knew if I could get into the serpent and I could get Eve out from behind her post of duty which was to stand behind the word which was Adam at the time a son of God brother Branham tells us in the spoken word is the original seed that Adam hadn't come to the revelation of the realization or the knowledge yet of how he was going to fulfill Genesis 1:28 but it was in him he just hadn't come to how it was gonna happen that's in spoken word is the original seed if you want to listen and read it six hours long so it'll take you some time but it's good it's good for you the spoken word is the original see is that right I mean we all know that I just asked so that you can confirm to yourself let me tell you folks something God's foreknowledge knew that Abraham was going to take Isaac up on top of the mountain God's foreknowledge knew that Abraham was gonna plunge the knife so then all of that was not for God it was so Abraham would realize but I'm gonna do this no matter what stop right there Abraham I knew you were gonna do it but I wanted you to know you were going to do it when God was looking for Adam in the Garden of Eden Adam Adam this is this is the omniscient omnipotent God he wasn't looking at him were yet I'm gonna tell you what he was asking at him Adam do you know where you're at you know yeah we got that in the 60s didn't win the 70s what are you at man where are you coming from you know it didn't mean that address it meant like what's going on what's going on inside of you oh and when Adam heard that he said huh I gotta hide from the Lord the Lord knew where he was at but he wanted Adam to respond you see God understood his own word he understood that what happened there in the garden was a hybridization of his word I'm telling you brothers and sisters Satan knows what he's doing he's sharp but greater is He that is in us in me than he that is in the world is that right I believe that believe that with all my heart so watch how sharp the devil is now you may not think I'm preaching straight up but the spoken word is the original seed I believe that with all my heart an order for the spoken word to fulfill Genesis 1:28 replenish and multiply what do you have to have I've spoken word you see and that hadn't been given that revelation hadn't been given to Adam even though it was in him in a seed form it was in there but it hadn't come forth yet how should I explain that to you has anybody ever read in here that Jesus Christ God manifest in the flesh as the son of God Saint John 1:14 did not know the seventh seal that's what the prophets said and I never questioned that I would just say Lord that's you that's you in a body of flesh how do you not know your own seventh seal and he said son you have to understand that the body that I was using that you called Jesus was a man but he was born a virgin birth see what I'm saying God's egg God's seed planted in the womb of a church that we call malli okay no sensation brother bharata said i could see it no sensation why because brothers and sisters when you give your heart to the lord you don't know it but god's putting a seed and an egg in there what just happened and you find yourself wandering around saying be it unto me according to thy word be it unto me according to white that's God beginning to plant what eve refused to accept through reason what she did was she took a seat you see how sharp the devil is he began to preach to her like this brother listen here gal you all have a problem you and Adam are not manifesting God's Word you see how he slick he is dead don't tell me he's not telling you and me that you are not manifesting God's Word that you can read about that's for the aging women you're not manifesting and what's the matter with you I got a plan he says I want you to look at my crop remember the serpent was a beast he was of the animal kingdom in the previous to Genesis 1:28 they were already in replenishing and multiplying so he knew what he was doing he had a knowledge of the principles of life were top right so he knew what he was he says hey gal tell you what I've been producing the manifestation of the promises of God all along and look at you you're barren what's the matter with that husband of yours that's a devil's tactic what's the matter what that word you believe nothing but we're putting it all back on God God's wanting us to take it in the form that he gave it to replenish and multiply which is the spoken word it's the very and why we believe the message because it's the quart of wheat but guess what the corn of wheat abideth alone that's why a lot of people see the denomination's see Christ by himself and the message followers see william branham all by himself oh no a corn of wheat abideth alone it'll stay just like that unless it dies falls into your heart when that seed goes into your heart and dies it no longer abides alone it has become the fulfillment of replenish and multiply here's the reason why the devil is trying to keep the fivefold ministry from manifesting itself because it is the mouthpiece that God uses now not a not any of us men can Satan I'm a fivefold Minister Salam let's just write my name in there God hath placed some so that was God's doing not man's doing but when God places something I'm gonna tell you what there's a price to pay if you get off track brother Branham paid with his first wife and his first daughter brother Branham nearly paid with his life when he went to South Africa and began to listen to those men who were using the same reasoning at the serpent used on Eve oh come on God talks to us to remember that that's exactly what those men told brother Bentham God talks to us to who do you think you are brother Badham straighter said well you Nathan in court and he should have got his thumb I'll excuse me and started hitchhiking back to Johannesburg but he didn't he let those men talk him in to going to the next destination and he nearly gave his life he had some kind of an amoeba bug that easier from the inside out remember he's he's a really good modern-day example for you and me you're not I'm not we're not getting away with nothing nothing if there's a price to pay brothers and sisters weren't paying it but guess what happens with the attributes of God willingly not my will Lord but thine be done if that's what it takes I'll do it why because there's something down on the inside of us in the form of a seed of God that says I can lay this body down I'm quoting your brother branham now he says this is in us I can lay this body down and he'll raise up again now notice how I said that I didn't say I would raise it up again I can lay this body down and at the same spirit be in you that was in Christ he will raise you from the dead is that right so the spoken word being the original seed and Satan getting in there and beginning to interfere with the process of God I think brother branham's wife called a hickey not the black mark on your neck I used to bend rebar hey here you go and that little machine that you put the bar in and you pull the handle and you get the angle on the bars called it a key we used to laugh when I was a little kid my dad said go get the Hickey saw been some rebar but I didn't know where that came from a little hickey in the promise of God is what caused all this to happen and I'm reason I'm preaching on it brothers and sisters is not because we don't know that it's because somebody's gonna have to take the thing and bend it back to its original position in God's Word then that becomes the original seed that can produce after its kind that's the reason why Satan's trying to keep the fivefold ministry under wraps because they are the ones that God gave the authority to not them you got to realize the men don't look at themselves that way they're just the vessel of tool being used to speak what are they speaking the original seat we're using the message and the Bible as our basis for our speech and God said we're all looking for the light that's the manifestation of what he said it's not an actual light it's a super it's a light that can only be produced by staying with the word that's the only way that God is going to vindicate you and I remember what the Prophet challenged everybody with listen now fellas ladies and gentlemen he said would God vindicate a ministry that was false he said far be it from God that's why I can challenge you he said that anything I told you that's the said the Lord has anybody ever seen it miss has anybody ever seen it fail has it ever gone wrong no nobody ever challenged brother Branham the 300 ministers in Chicago thought they were gonna and then brother Braniff said they had more sense than I thought they had because he called him up there bring your Bibles up here in US but he said in another place that they knew that the angel of the Lord was standing right there they weren't willing to go up against the angel of the Lord they were willing to go up against William Maher and Branham a man with an eighth grade education that didn't paint fetch tote pulpit remember what they picked on him for how could you brothers and sisters can I ask you personally isn't that the same question the devil is posing to you and I come on come on your life is a mass and this and that and then if you believe God's Word and every word of God it doesn't make a lick of difference what the devil does with your natural life you see it's not flesh and blood but that's not carte blanche for us to make grace into disgrace that's not carte blanche for us to become legalists or fundamentalists either what it is is it's the grace of God that comes into your life and you won't look to the right or to the left you'll just keep following the pattern of God until you become the manifestation of a son or a daughter of God because eventually the serpent talked Eve into partaking of another line to be injected and that caused a chasm in between Adam and Eve and the promise of God that they were to fulfill brothers and sisters I'm gonna finish with this here we are this afternoon God has given you an i the spoken word that is the original seed that seed must bring forth after its kind are you with me now I'll finish it with this how is that so brother Chris what are you talking about I'm talking about if you say if you say that's the end result for the believer today if you say to this mountain if you say it'll happen and brother branham was given to you and I as an example what are you doing brother banner what are you doing out here in the woods my son well I'm squirrel honey hadn't seen one all day what do you need he's scratching his head see he's he hasn't caught on yet yeah no what are you doing I mean he kept reading what are you doing I'm squirrel hunting what do you need a couple of times he caught it oh I need squirrels well then say it did you realize that all's that was to you and I was a preview did you realize brothers and sisters that the same God that used the profit that brings squirrels into existence stop the storm speak the goner out of his wife give Hattie mine whatever she wanted it's the same God now when are we gonna stop letting Satan an angel of light that's what it says in Corinthians and his ministry comes across the same way it says that his ministers and hustle mites when are we gonna stop paying attention to the light and begin to speak and God said I'm gonna say I'm gonna stop with this I've had four or five dreams in my 41 years of serving the Lord with brother Branham in them that doesn't mean I'm spiritual that doesn't even mean they have any validity but I'll tell you what I did have makes perfect sense to me today in this dream I come out of the forest and I'm looking at an open grassy field for those of age I'll mention Woodstock with a big platform built at the end of this field okay and and there was chairs set up thousands of chairs folding chair set up nice rows big platform with the back and a little top to it and a microphone stand and I'm thinking wow this is gonna be some meeting and I'm way in the back and there must be a hundred rows of chairs and way up in the front nobody's there yet I see three men standing at the front row of the chairs and one of those men kind of angle towards me when I'm looking has his leg up like this and he's leaning on it like this and he's talking to these two other men so I'm coming up from this part of this dream and as I get closer I realized that's brother Branham and he's talking to those two men I don't know who those two men were but he was doing just like this and as I started to walk up he must have heard me or since me and he looked and he just nodded his head and he kept talking so I just stopped right there and I heard him say this to these two men brothers I must decrease I'll tell you why brothers because the ministry that God has given me this is brother Branham talking not me the ministry that God has given me has produced too much light and it's blinding the eyes of many of the people that are following me so I must decrease it made perfect sense to me brother day because we've begun you know youyou they think he's Jesus Christ there's still the same you remember the little serpent and the message the bruised serpent brother Branham was gonna kill that serpent was named and he was interrupted by a minister who said here brother Branham do it this way remember go back and read it and when he turned that serpent crawled into a little puddle of what is water people's so while I believe that serpent was mortally wounded that's the term brother Branham used it wasn't fatal yet did you know there's a difference mortally wounded means it's a wound unto death but it could be like the guy that went to the pool of siloam it might be 37 years or 50 or 60 years before it finally takes you um fatally would be different dead did you know that that little bitty snake has raised its ugly head up again but but I say it like this brother branham said you can shoot over the target you can shoot under it you can shoot to the right or you can shoot to the left or you can hit the bull's eye and the and the and the gun factory said that gun wasn't made to shoot that little group don't you remember brother branham and his rifle he got so frustrated oh right I've shot the eyes out of squirrels at 50 yards now it won't group within 10 inches the factory tells him come on that gun wasn't made do you remember that gun wasn't made to shoot that tight of a group and brother BAM said I own the gun I've shot eyes out of squirrels I know this gun can hit the target every time but you know what people are doing today brothers and sisters they got the same gun they're moving the target to wherever the bullet will go they're not hitting the bullseye that's what's God has called you and me to do to stand on his word in such a way where when that gun goes off remember there's a lot of shells that didn't fire put it in the gun clip put it in the gun plate put it in the gun never forget to aim because one day that gun is going to go off and you want it to be pointing at the bull's eye please stand God is so good as you're standing I'm going to read this to you it's just a paragraph out of exists the sign of the inn sirs don't worry brothers paragraph 204 I want you to listen to what brother Bram says first a blast now you might not think this is significant but I want you to pay clear first a blast hmm and God said that was a sound right first a blast and I thought it sounded like a sound barrier every what you call it when planes cross the sound and the sound comes back to the earth it just shocked like roared everything then it could have been a great great or a a a great clap of thunder and lightning like listen to what brother BAM says I didn't see the lightning I'm just reading what he said I didn't see the lightning I just heard that great blast that went forth that's right brother Nick brothers and sisters we've got to stop using our natural eyes to look for the manifestation of the sons of God and we've got to begin to realize that it's God said and I'm not taken away from any kind of movement with shouting and dancing and and then falling out in the spirit and praying for the sick and having prayer I'm not taken away from that Paul said let's go on to perfection in Hebrews 6 this what we do if God permit when God permits it we do it but let's go on to perfection what is that bringing forth after his kind and that is the spoken word you love him amen if the musicians would come he's so good to us let me tell you he's surely yes Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary if you would sis whatever key that's in I'll sing it god bless you thank you for putting up with me Lord Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure we tried and true yeah [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] his
