got to be made right amen everybody ready to hear the word of the Lord we're glad to have brother brother Bob to be ministering for us tonight and we pray the Lord would open our eyes eyes that we may

in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy holy holy holy holy Ho Holy Holy I want to see you amen I pray that's your desire tonight let's turn over to First Kings chapter 19 and we'll just read a real familiar scripture to us all a little story that brother brandham taught us and has been preached so many times and really you know the reason this come to mind is the other night I I um I got to speak into my family and uh and and and this just kind of came out cuz you know I in this in this day in this hour we're living in we're we're really living in a crisis time because we're coming down to the to the the last few that are coming in and and things are critical things are crucial and who's going to believe the word right and I I want my family to believe so you know I many of us would look at our our our kids and think well well you know they're because they're my kids they're better than everybody else's or whatnot but you know that like brother day always says there without they got little horns holding their their Halo up and you know without without the new birth then there's nothing to to differentiate them from from anybody else we we've all got to be born again you must be born again right and that's what I maybe just take a little simple uh topic tonight and and just speak upon um a comfort in a time of Crisis because what is our comfort in a time of crisis so let's read uh before we go before we go to the word let's go to the author Lord God we just thank you God for giving us the opportunity to come around your word Lord Jesus thank you God for the word that you've given to us and God I pray Lord that you'll let us all have the right attitude and and open our ears and our hearts to receive what said tonight Lord Jesus God I pray that you'll let me have the right Spirit Lord Jesus let everyone have the the right Spirit to receive it in the tone and the attitude that it's meant Lord and I pray God that you'll Lord let the word as it goes forth be a comfort to us Lord Jesus because we need you Lord in this hour it's a critical Time Lord God and I pray God that you'll bless this service Lord and I just give it into your hands we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so let's look at First Kings chapter 19 verse 9 and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there when we know this is talking about Elijah and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here Elijah now you could ask the same question of all of us what are you doing here right we're all sitting in a church on Wednesday night is it is our what's our goal what's our motive and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant right thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away now see they they did all this after after God had just pulled out all the stops and he he he rained fire down from heaven and consumed the AC the sacrifice in the presence of the king and presence of all the people that said they were believers in front of everyone and they left him thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind and earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still Small Voice amen and it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering of of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou here Elijah you may be seated the Lord I his Blessing to the readings of the word I I wanted to just kind of stop in your mind on that verse 12 and after the earthquake of fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still Small Voice because all these evidences came by all these things came by but but Elijah was comforted by only one right now in this crucial time in this crucial time of this story we got we got a story of Ahab that that was just B this borderline believer that United himself with Jezebel somebody that came up that was brother Brandon taught how she was came up from an early age taught in that balum religion that the the real true Faith was incorrect she was raised her mama and daddy taught her that and and she was raised in that kind of atmosphere that's see how how crucial it is to teach your children where you say I'm not a I'm not a minister but surely you know some kind of some piece of the Bible surely you can start on John 3:16 and start with for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son surely you can you can try if the Catholics do it and they and they get a hold of a child at a young age and and it stays with them and we've got that promise in God's word that if you train up a child in the way it should go that when he's old he won't depart from it then surely we can take CLA take hold of God's word and apply it in our children's life apply it in our life now that's that's really what I'm getting at is is the only comfort that we have in a time of Crisis is in God's word right the only comfort that we have and if if we can reach out and take take a hold of God's word and believe it and not fear but believe it and claim it by faith then watch you can watch God's word come to pass now because because brother random said we're we're fortified behind God's word and you know how he taught in the Garden of Eden how they came back they came from behind that fortification and stepped out and and took one word off and and all down through history we've been in a crisis that started a crisis and we you know the greatest crisis there's many crisis you could be in a Health crisis things going wrong in your body things going wrong in your in your mind but the the greatest crisis of all is that that Soul sickness that we've you must be born again that that God laid the foundation laid the way back to him and and we've got the choice is is laid out in front of each of us whether to choose him or to choose wrong now let me just let me start off by reading let's actually go to go to quote number nine brothers I told him I was going to be a little out of order thank you my son because see the the word was was presented to Ahab and as as if you go back later tonight and and and study and read the scripture when you have a chance get alone in your quiet time and and maybe meditate on these things because Ahab he went over and and he saw you remember the story of that that U Elijah s Obadiah to go get Ahab and and bring him over here and Obadiah was scared and uh bring him to the where the the fire would fall and consume the sacrifice and Ahab was present when that happened he was present when Elijah made that bold statement that that just fill up all the trough with the water and and cover it over three times with the sacrifice and and he made that bold declaration that whoever who whose God answers let him be God and they all the the the uh the the non-believers stood around and and the Bible says that there was no voice to answer there was no voice to answer and I I I wonder maybe pose this question how many of us think as brother Brown told that story of how Jesus's parents left Jerusalem and they thought that Jesus was with them how many of us think that Jesus is in our midst but when the crisis comes along when the critical times along we find out that we've left him and the way brother random explained it is you got to go back to where you left him to get him now I want to speak maybe frankly to to to to everybody the way I speak to my kids is that we shouldn't uh this is a time of excuses of a time of trying to find uh little end little shortcuts and things but there's no excuses in the Bible there's this is a this is a true enough time a time to find out whether you've really got that still Small Voice on the inside that'll keep you in the time of Crisis now all these little things all the little emotions and and things they can't hold you in the time of Crisis you get all all all been out of shape by some that happens at work or some a medical problem or something or or uh whether or not you really have salvation and the only true peace the only way that you'll have true peace and true Joy is by that still Small Voice coming inside and living you and I I I want to just counsel you to make sure in this time of this critical crucial time to be sure that you're sure to know that you know cuz the only the only thing that would give give Elijah peace as all of these things came by the fire and the wind and the earthquake was that still Small Voice right the only thing that a Believer can have true comfort in is to know that God's word is eternal that the Eternal God wrote it in the in spoke it when he spoke it he created it's a creative action and he spoke it and it was written on the book so that when you believe it that creative act would become manifest and it would become manifest in your life that's why the believer can take a hold of God's word and and just lean on it like all these Believers that you know David had these three Mighty Men sorry I'm not even getting this quote yet give me a minute David David had these three mighty men that was that it was written of that they could just they were Mighty Men in the Old Testament because uh you think in the natural because they went out and slew a lot of people yeah now in the modern day you got I was reading about the most decorated man in the bi in in modern uh Army was uh uh I'm drawing a blank at his name now Aldi Murphy and and I think he he killed like 50 people at once ran up on top of a tank dropped a grenade in there and and and and did great explits but now here in the Old Testament we're talking about men that killed a thousand men a thousand Philistines 800 Philistines killed and they were known for their exploits because they uh two of David's mighty men were not because of how many they killed but because when they saw the enemy coming they didn't turn and run away right now all of these great exploits you think in the natural is because they killed a lot of people but their great exploits I believe is because they took God's word and held on to it they knew that David was the anointed and they were going to stay with him and stand behind him they knew that he was the one that was going to make God's word manifest and they were going to stay right with him no matter what so they reached down and took a hold of God's word instead it looks like in the natur they took a hold of a sword but they were taking a hold of God's promises and they took a hold of that promise and slew the enemy now in the New Testament that's what we're doing today we're taking a hold of God's promise and slaying the enemy all the doubts and all the Spooks as brother B said all the all the stuff that all these things are you can slice it and dice it by the by the arm of Faith holding that Shield of the word and watch it fall away if you'll cling to God's word his unchanging word his word is Eternal that's what that's what differentiates it from if if God's word is eternal and he puts his Eternal Word in you and you can believe it watch it come to pass Glory now look emergency we're in a a crisis time a critical time this is a critical time that we're looking at here in the Bible where Elijah's come to this this stage where the set by Ahab and Jezebel and all of these people in Israel that wouldn't believe and so God pulls out all the stops to get them to believe he comes and consumes the Sacrifice by fire he comes and makes a a public show because it God's he brings a famine on the land for three and a half years because he's trying it's critical the salvation of his people it's critical the salvation of my children I want my children to be saved more than anything in the world I want you to be saved more than anything in the world because brother brandham said the evidence of New Birth as those that sigh and cry for the Abominations down of the city those that are crying out for lost souls those are something within them just yearns that to see people saved and so that's what you can see God's spirit May manifest here in this little story of how he came down and he pulled all the stops think about in the Elijah of this day how he pulled out all the stops and he came down and he said and the Elijah that we know that we follow that he came down and said uh bring me your worst casee bring me your most hopeless case he'd had I was reading that he had crisis nights bring me your most critical your most crucial and and see them be healed when he went over to India and was challenged by the 17 the 17 different different sex and things he said bring me the bring me your worst case and they brought up the the crippled and the lame and we know all those stories because God is interested he he's interested in doing whatever it takes to see you receive that still Small Voice the evidence is not in big emotion big chills and chills bumps and and song services and and running up and down the aisle but the the the evidence is that still Small Voice that speaks to you in the quill in the steal in the quiet and opens your word and his word and shows it to you and that way you're fortified behind his word now look look how this this little life story of how God brought his Prophet through through through Mount Caramel signs and wonders and then he dra brought him over to this little juniper tree experience where he's laying under up under the juniper tree and he's he's thinking everybody's left me everybody's deserted me and and you know brother R said maybe that's sometimes how ministers think when you as soon as you you watch soon as you step off of the pulpit even song singers and things as soon as you step off from the platform the devil whack you a good one nobody cares what you think no nobody wants to hear that nobody nobody uh nobody wants to hear the gospel and and and Elijah had got a good whack whack and and there he was under the juniper tree nobody cares nobody wants to hear it but Jes got now now if you keep on reading right after he went through this little low part this little low valley then out on the other side comes hael and and yahu and Elisha God uh God God said I've got these three waiting that they're going to what Eli uh What uh H doesn't kill y's going to kill what y doesn't kill Elijah is going to kill and and he went and right after this little story he goes and finds his his his little partner elishah and and the and the story just gets on keeps on moving you think nobody else is believing like my my son came came to me a few days ago and he says Daddy people are leaving the message A lot of people are leaving the message and you know one thing L it another and we started talking about how man it's going to be hard to find a spouse before long it's going to be hard to find it's going to be hard to find a a a real true Holy Ghost filled wife a real true Holy Ghost filled husband but remember all things are possible to them that believe now you know how brother br to you don't go hunting around somebody that looks real pretty you'll find you'll find a nice little Jezebel waiting for you but go looking for that character that's on the inside and the one that knows that character more than anybody else is the is the one that created us all he can see the secrets of the heart so that's what I tell my kids when you get ready to find that match don't go like in that uh fider on the roof match you make your Matchmaker but let him be your Matchmaker let him find out because the one that can see the innermost part of of the heart let him find you one let him be your Matchmaker because uh you know there's there's beauty is skin deep and and that on the outside you know you know even Jesus talked about uh whitewashed sheeples looking at the the Pharisees white white and clean on the outside and and looks real good looks like a good churchgoer on the outside but on the inside dead men's bones real good coming to church looking looking real good looking like a good Christian says all the things but the still Small Voice is not on the inside now that's what I'm that's what I'm talking about examine yourself I pray you get in your quiet time and examine yourself because the hour is late uh you you know you just walk out your door in the morning you can just feel that the hour is late things are moving even just just without even looking at the events that are transpiring the uh the how they coming up with the battery powered cars and all those things that brother Brown talked about but just just the general feel of the of the of the moment you know that the word is being manifest in somebody somewhere and it's time to get in before the doors shut and the doors are going to be shut not by circumstance but there should be shut by everybody that's in there that's supposed to be in there will be in there when everybody that's supposed to be in there is in there the doors will be shut and it'll be too late and the foolish virgin will turn around and say I I should have known that to receive the new birth I had to eat the body word of Christ I I should have known that to receive the new birth I had to eat it and receive it and feast on it and let that word be made manifest and they'll ask you for your books and your tapes ask you for your Revelation you'll say no that's for me this is for me where am I let's see now look he got down to that juniper tree experience he got down under the junior PR tree and and he looked and he he looked around and he was real low because by circumstances by just looking at the church looking at the people all he could see was laziness now you know brother Brown talked about he when Billy Paul was young he said he'd go up there and he said it looked like he had his day and nights mixed up and you know how young people are they they sleep real late and stay up late and and so forth and and he said I I'd rather you just get up in the morning and just go out and look at the car and then go back to bed instead of just laying up in the bed being lazy and see how lazy this is he said you're going to be filled by something some people going to be filled by laziness or they going to be filled by the spirit now you can almost see we make excuses we make excuses well well maybe I'm filled with a new birth but I'm just lazy now listen if the Eternal God is eternal and he's put his eternal the unchanging God has put his unchanging self inside the believer there's going to be something calling out something craving for that word there's going to be a deep that calls to the Deep there's going to be something that fights within you against that laziness on the outside now the the age that we're living in is laziness the age that we're living is this old lay out of sea and laad desal you know whatever you get CAU up in and and uh uh just uh looking at your phone too much or or or uh listening to music too much or so many distractions but there that still Small Voice will draw you like an artisian well a deep well calling you and pulling you back to the word how can an eagle live without meat how can you live how can you sustain yourself without meat you've got to be you've got to feed if you if you got that lazy Spirit on you check up but make sure that it's not just covering up the Holy Spirit but that you really do have that still small voice inside of you if there's not something inside of you that's hungering for that word that's calling out for it make sure that you really are filled with the holy spirit that you really do have that that voice which is the word living on the inside and you won't be afraid anymore right cuz perfect love casts out Fe fear is we were looking at in B in in in the little Sunday school lesson the other day you know Elijah he was kind of wanting Deliver Us From Fear in the Old Testament you know that Holy Spirit would come down upon him and even in the New Testament brother random talked about how he would get get under that anointing and it just go way up so high and and and he after he got done preaching or under that special anointing he he come out and he'd just find himself walking and and not even know where he was or or anything and and he talked about how this was the same kind of thing that Elijah was going through how he he walked for 40 days and 40 nights and and woke up in a cave didn't even know how he got there he just he he wandered to and fro and and the Lord but the Lord was keeping him the whole time because you know God is so tender and loving and he wants to take care of us he don't he don't want us to he wants us to be with him that's what he wants you think well well God is so loving he won't let me go through something well here is Elijah under the juniper tree and he's under the juniper tree because he wants to show Elijah something if he lets you get up under the Jun juniper tree he's doing it to draw you closer to him he's doing it so that you'll learn to trust him to to believe his word because his word is eternal and if you put your trust in his word if you don't doubt and don't fear watch it come to pass ah Lord help me so Lord so Elijah he gets all depressed under the juniper tree and he winds up in that cave he winds up in a cave where he can get quiet because you know a lot of times that's what we that that's what we need to do to be able to hear that still Small Voice we got so much activity in our life lives so much running to and fro because in this day the devil's going to try to keep us real busy he's going to give you a lots of stuff to do I know I'm maybe the biggest one at fault here in this room that many people say you want to go fishing brother Danny and I'll say sometimes well I'm busy I'm a't that a horrible word busy cuz the devil will keep us so busy and then you'll find a lot of times when you get in the car where there's just nobody else and you're just driving down the road you start meditating on the Lord and he'll just drop down that still Small Voice begins to speak to you or you're just maybe walking out in the in in the woods or fishing or whatever and you're all alone and and you just begin to think on him you know how brother Bram said don't blank your mind out don't do like the the bruus and stuff and oh and all that kind of stuff but you begin to think meditate on God's word think about what did Brother Dale say the other Sunday that I didn't understand or or what was he saying that that's really got me that there's a little problem in my life that Lord if you just help me with that and that still Small Voice the speaker will drop down and begin to just open himself up to you that's when you begin to Rejoice that's how you get the new birth is get just let that that get it get into the quiet time and meditate on his word and watch that word come to life watch it be become Quicken let that Spirit come down and and and water the word that you've heard and quiet time that little cave represents that represents your personal relationship with God oh yeah it represents your house it represents your your your little experience you know El our Elijah had a cave too is't that interesting that God gave him a furnished cave with a table and and a and a pyramid hanging over it and a little place to sleep because God's concerned about our welfare and you think well well well God God has forgotten about me God don't care about about me well the quickest way to get an answer to that is go back into his word and read a little bit and find out he much he cares about you read a little bit and and and get quiet with him and and let that Spirit go come down and and speak to you a little bit and you'll find out real quick whether he cares about you or not so if we could just grab a hold of God's word right you know one time that there was despite circumstances grab a hold of God's word despite the way things look cuz one time there was these three Hebrew children that when all the world it looked like nobody else believed and they and the the the the political system of the day said well we'll Heat this fire seven times hotter and they got the atmosphere just right because they didn't care about the atmosphere of that furnace they got the atmosphere just right and brother bram's taught that the atmosphere is is your attitude towards God God's word the way you look at his word and that's why that quiet time is so important where you can get along with God and get your thoughts lined up with his thoughts and get your attitude right and then you can see the wheels begin to turn and and that's how they they got their attitude right I know that God will deliver I know he's able but if he doesn't then I'm still not going to Bow exactly amen now that's how it look look Elijah was in the same situation Jezebel had come around and she killed all the prophets and he said I'm the only one left but yet he wasn't afraid to get out there and declare the Jehovah to all the people let let whoever is real God let the real God uh be God that that answers so you know the he three Hebrew children got down in that fire and and and God came on the scene because he he he not only came on the scene but he walked down in the fire with him he got down in there with them because they believed him they clung to his word just like the the the three Mighty Men in David's Army and and uh all the all the ones down through history all these mighty men that were written of in God's word they all had something in com common they took a hold of God's word and they didn't let it go and they got up and did something they just s didn't just sit around and lazy and and sit up in their proverbial recliner and and watch the world go by I look at up the the tape sitting up on the shelf and and uh and never listen to brother brandom and never listen to uh you realize how how blessed we are in this day you know in Martin Luther's day if you uh received a message of his day maybe a couple years after he died then you couldn't go listen to his words you could maybe read it on the page and and maybe hear a little hearsay of what somebody else said about what how great one of his sermons were but or the same thing with John Wesley but today we can put in a tape a tape and a tape player and press play and it just it just boggles me how so many refuse to do that even because that the the lay out of sea and laziness and that's why the same way as in Exodus 19 or 1 Kings chapter 19 we're in this this critical crucial hour crucial hour of who's going to be saved who's going to believe who's going to accept the message all right let's go to uh that quote verse uh number nine that we were looking at and the uncertain sound what did he what did we do a few days ago we did the same thing Israel did elected Ahab to the White House that was November 1960 when they elected Kennedy and and you know Kennedy uh if you look a lot of people he was a pretty nice guy yeah he had uh uh a lot of his agenda and everything was was good but the problem was the same thing as with Ahab was that he was yok to that yet Jezebel system that had a a collar on that would keep him back now now that was ahab's problem because look what brother R said about him Ahab was a pretty good sort of a fellow but he wanted to repent now think about that he wanted to repent he was there when the fire fell but Jezebel he was married to her and he couldn't do it she was the neck that turned the head now now think about that how many today want to repent but they're yolked to to a denomination well of course those are things are are very common to us Yol to a denomination yolk to Yol to an unbelieving wife that's why brother R said you you're not supposed to marry a Believer to an unbeliever because these kind of things happen an unbelieving wife but what about being yolked to your your old ideas so many you see that they continue to be yolked to their own ideas and they can't let go you know the new birth is is part of the new birth is you got to die to your old self you got to lay all those old ideas and lay all that stuff aside and and say Lord make me a new creation a new creature put make me a a new wine bottle so you can put new wine in me change me and make me new look he wanted to repent but Jezebel he was married to her and he couldn't do it she was the neck that turned the head and we did the same thing put a man up there that's married to that Jezebel system that we run from and become a free Nation from oh you politicians that sold your Birthright of Christianity you know what politics is is trying to get somebody to like you and and and now listen we shouldn't care about anybody else liking us the only person that I want to care about and I know we have problems in our own self I I want people to like me get don't get me wrong but you know you can go off off the wrong end with that you can start uh being a people pleaser and and liking that pat on the back and and liking everybody saying good things about you but the the only one that we should be out to please is that one is the god of Glory oh you politicians that sold your Birthright of Christianity I'll stop on that let's go back now let's go ahead and jump on down to number 10 to see what what Elijah was really excited about as all these different things came by all the now as we live through life many of us have been around for so long and I've seen so many different things um my my dad was telling me he grew up in a Pentecostal church and he remembers his dad telling him said uh little Robert jump up and run around the building three times and and and just all these things trying to work up something trying and brother R said you see people come through the prayer line and and want to get healed and one one sister came through the prayer line and she's just start shaking herself trying to get worked up but that's not how it is you don't get worked up is the evidence a a lot of emotion a lot of shaking and a lot of fire and earthquake and wind is not the evidence but it's the evidence of what what a real Comfort to a Christian in the time of Crisis is that still Small Voice that speaks his word out I I my one of my kids other other day said Daddy whenever you start preaching you get to stuttering a lot well I might stutter a little bit but Lord willing you'll remember it with with stammering lips and other tongues right so so we're reading uh uh number 10 God hiding himself in Simplicity than revealing himself in the same when Elijah was back in that cave the smoke went across blood thunder lightning and sea and all these kind of Sensations we've had blood in the face and in the hands and Sensations and everything they they never bother that prophet he just laid there but he heard a Ste Small Voice what was it the word then he covered his face and walked out see that was it now I'm going get to that in a second but he he was interested in the word he was interested in the books and the tapes that line on your wall he was interested in coming to church to hear what the minister had to say he was interested in receiving the message for the day not interested in all these little distractions and things that go along you know just just growing up in the message that seems like just through through the things I I've seen is for many years it seemed like it was taught that that you know you well how do you get the near birth where you just go uh wait for something wait for that fire wait for that earthquake or wait for that wind wait for something to come along and and and well thank God for the truth that we know know how to get a new birth that that that Parable that brother Dell has been been preaching on the SE went forth to se the words got to be sown into your heart and then it's got to be watered by the spirit and it'll come up and you see what's in the ground is made manifest see how how simple the gospel is we just thank God for the truth and I I I I really you know that that little cave experience I've really been trying to hammer it on to my kids because I want my kids at least if they don't if they grow up and and don't see things the way I see it at least I want them to understand the way I see it and I I I encourage everybody to do that make sure that your little cave your little dwelling is is Sanctified and holy in a place where everybody in your home at least knows what you believe and I my my kids they've started coming up to me Daddy I don't understand why uh because I tell them you should be able to explain what you believe not not be like when I grew up but why don't you have a TV in your your house or why don't you why don't y'all do this and that well I don't know cuz my parents you know you should be able to at least have an answer have a reason of the hope that lies within you to to declare they they'll come up and say well Daddy why why is it wrong for women to wear makeup and things well well look at the only one in the Bible that wore makeup because to to to to to attract this man yo that was riding up to kill her and she put all this makeup on her face and batted her eyes out the window and try to try to change his mind and then whoops he rode her over with a chariot now the only one in the Bible that that wore makeup like that and you know another thing is because the the gospel teaches that that we shouldn't be Hypocrites we should we shouldn't be fake on the outside you know all these actors and stuff they put on that goop all in the movies and stuff but a real Christian should let that gospel glow come out let that that that real gospel Glo be seen on the outside you don't have to cover all that up with a bunch of goop and everything you don't have to dress up like the world separate yourself and sanctify yourself we were at the grocery store the I'm I'm getting off a little bit we were at the grocery store and we we looked over and we saw this lady she looked just like maybe that that story that brother around talked about that I I thought I thought her gallbladder busted or something CU she had all this it it was the worst case of of makeup that I I I think I've ever seen it was it was a mess but anyway God God wants us to be real genuine he wants us to be to to let our light shine and how's you like got shine going going to shine through a bunch of stuff all over your face you don't have to wear a mask that's right and I didn't know I was going to get on that but now listen that that that voice that still Small Voice and that voice you know when John the Baptist came on the scene he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness but now listen when Moses went in behind the Tabernacle he said the voice of one spoke to me from from The Mercy Seat when Ezekiel Saw that the wheel in the middle of the wheel and the cherubims and everything he said the voice of one spoke to me the voice of one is not just a man the voice of one in this day is not just the man the voice of one is the is the one that created us the the god of Heaven the voice of one crying in the wilderness was that anointing that he the Bible says that he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb and he came out filled and we know we know how to explain that now that the Holy Ghost came upon him not filling his soul but came upon him anointing him into the service of the Lord because until Jesus died the Holy Ghost could not come and give someone a new birth because uh uh we're the Holy Ghost W only come into a clean vessel and his blood had to die to sanctify us the voice of one crying in the wilderness and that same voice has to speak from within you to give you comfort in this crisis time right so I want to ask what what is your comfort is your comfort emotional work up like we heard brother brand speaking of is it is it when the singing starts everybody gets all excited when the singing starts and when the word stops everybody falls asleep and starts looking at their watch when is it time to go home what is your comfort is it shaking hands or signing a book as many denominational do and and or speaking in tongues you know I I I did I this might you got to be careful saying stuff like this because it almost sounds like you're uh I'm I'm g go ahead and tell this story the only time I I've ever spoke in tongues was I when I was a little boy and this was I'm telling the story because it was way before I got the new birth now when I was a little boy my parents they they uh they you know I kind of with you as as kids do they kind of uh get to preaching a little have a little mini service and everything so my parents would get me out there and i' I'd preach a little sermon and everything well one time I was preaching and and without the new birth and and the Holy Spirit came down on me and I got to I got to move a little bit and everybody in the room started looking at me funny you just started speaking another language now that's how the real the real speaking in tongues Works you're not you're not uh working something up I didn't even know I was speaking in tongues I I was just going along and but but now this was year this was when I was like N9 or 10 years old way way before the New Birth because speaking in tongues is an attribute it's not uh it's something it's an attribute of the Holy Spirit but but way this was way before uh the new birth and I I so so what is your comfort is your comfort a good lineage like many in the message believe that that if you can trace your lineage back and I I I tried uh tracing my lineage back a little bit and you know you find some surprises in there now what if we could trace our lineage back all the way you know what would you do when it when it stops on somebody that's that was a murderer or or something something horrible uh we can't we can't put our dependent our comfort on vain genealogy as Paul said is your dependency on signs and wonders you know you look through the message and you see so many growing up I heard I heard ministers saying they would had put credibility to to their Ministry because of a miracle that happened in their Ministry or or or because of of I remember some of the some seemed like some of the greatest preachers that you could ever hear they get up behind the pit and just sweat and and and fling a spit everywhere and and and and and just nailing it down and then a few years later you found out they run off some woman down in Florida or something and so what what is the evidence what is the Comfort exactly right is it is it getting all excited is it is it it doing all these things that our distraction to the real evidence the real truth that steal Small Voice right that so easily overlooked in fact it's so overlooked you got to you got to be real quiet you got to get along get along with God and just let him speak but we want to get all worked up is it crying now I'm going get on myself a little bit cuz many many have said I I I hear what well I know brother Bob's got the got the new birth because he cries a lot now listen that's not my evidence because I cry a lot it's not my evidence you know I you know they they call Isaiah the we Prophet because he cried and and all these things but crying is nothing new you can just get emotional and get real real excited and everything and all the tears start to flow but but we're not looking for just emotion we're not looking for a bunch of crying or a bunch or feeling a like you know brother Dale's always said you can get a good feeling maybe about just dropping an ice cube down your back if that's what you're after or extraordinary humility because you look around and and you look and see well I I want to find somebody that's so Meek and so humble but you know a lot of times that's not the evidence right because you know look at look at Paul that came roaring out and and blasted it and told it like it was and I was I was reading about this uh this famous preacher in the 300s that called John golden mouth and they he was such a fantastic preacher that they wanted him down in Rome so they this this fellow got him he actually piled all this Mone on him and said I'm forcing you to move to Rome and you're going to be my preacher so he got over there and he didn't stop preaching he just laid it down on the line he just he just kept blasting it and he G all the money they gave him he gave it away and what ended up happening was he they they ended up killing him because he wouldn't stop preaching the truth now now so what we're not after we're not after somebody that's all wishy-washy and and real sweet and humble and everything but somebody that will take a hold of God's word like shamgar and and all these these mighty men in the Bible like the three Hebrew children take a hold of it and swing that sword of the word and knock down the enemy tear down all those Spooks and all that falseness and all that all that stuff tear down all the lies that the devil tells you that that that it's not it's not for you that you can't you can't be healed you can't be saved swing that word just like Jesus did when the devil came to him and said and said uh won't you turn this these Lo these stones into the bread and he said isn't it written it's written that man should not live by bread alone by by every word that comes from the mouth of God won't you cast yourself down from the won't the Angels come and pick you up it's written that thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and he he took Jesus Took up he knew how to take up the sword of the world and swing it at the Devil and it'll feat the devil every time if you resist the devil resist it by just turning away throw the word at him and and he'll flee from you every time and you know I I just wrote this little quote down about how brother Brown said that sin starts in a feeling you think well it's right because it's a feeling it's a real good feeling but Christians aren't based on feelings right your healing your salvation everything in your Christian walk is not based in a feeling it's based on faith in God's word that you can look in God's word and say this is for me I claim it and you reach down and grab up that sword like shamard let running around he saw the Philistines come marching he saw the enemy come marching and he looked around I don't have a sword all he had was an ox good so he reached down by faith and he got to swinging that thing around his head and before long he had killed 800 Phil Philistines by by great agility by his ninja skills by by his Taekwondo no by his faith in God's word that God would bring it to pass if somebody would just s step up and and get up and go after that still Small Voice now those three those three uh brother Brown said the night ter the Terrors came by at the night Elijah was waiting for that comfort and when he heard it right yep it amen when he heard it what did he do it says and after the earthquake of fire but the Lord was not in the fire exactly right and after the fire still Small Voice Now many today have heard the voice they've heard the voice preach that's right they've heard the voice on the tapes they've heard the gospel even spelled out on the websites and just laid out with all the evidence just the same way as they did then where the fire came down and consumed it right in front of them but now Elijah did something that many today won't do it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantel and went out right and stood in the entering end of the cave now that's what you've got to do because God he's given us a free moral agency he lays it in front of you and he is it's almost like he he won't move until you do first he's waiting on you to move first you got to say I believe it right before he will move and make it manifest and we were looking at the little bible study downstairs that if you have perfect love if that still still Small Voice is living inside of you and drives out all the fear then you can lay claim to God's promises and grab a hold to it and say I'm Not Afraid what brother brand said I'm not afraid that I can live this word I'm not afraid that you will keep your word are you afraid now that's a qu that seems like almost a silly question because of course your response is no but when you go home tonight and you're fac by the crisis at work the crisis of just living the crisis of things going wrong in your body as you get older the crisis of your children needing salvation where is your comfort can you reach reach out and without fear grab a hold of God's word and say I know that even though my children aren't believing right now there's a promise I'm going grab hold of that and believe and believe that the promise when he said the I am the Lord thy God that Health all thy diseases you can grab a hold of that and say well I know that that's for me he might be testing me a little bit right now and and put me under the juniper tree but the promise is for me because it's written in his word do you believe that now now see see I you know uh uh Jude I believe it was Jude he said who would want to be a preacher because you know I saying all these things you know and and then the devil he you know he'll you you make a confession and the devil will come right after you to see if you believe it or not you make a statement you got to you got to live it but there's one greater than there's the one there's one living in inside of me that's greater than all the circumstances all the crisis of this world and I can I can boldly say that I believe it because there's you know brother brandom he uh oh here it is that's just timely this quote's laying right under my finger let's go to number eight convinced and concerned y'all doing all right just give me 15 more minutes he never waited to learn how to do or said now wait a minute I'm the Royal seed I'm the Seed of Abraham I'm circumsized so you know all these Philistines are good Warriors wait learn how to do it now you think you think I got to I got to go study a lot I got to go look and read about all all these theologians and stuff said a lot of the theologians don't even know what what the Bible's talking about that how are you going to know what the Bible's really talking about without that still Small Voice living on the inside to teach you you don't you don't need to go learn how to duel shamgar didn't learn how to duel right he just reached down and grabbed up that grabbed grabbed up that Ox goe by the word and and and believe God's word now wait a minute I'm the Royal seat on the seat of Abraham I'm circumcised so you know all these Philistines are good Warriors they've been practicing a long time I'll go down to the c c and get my PhD and lld and I learn how to do I'll learn the catechism all the church rules if he had done that that's all he would have know anything about y he'd have only know that and he couldn't have whipped it then he couldn't have matched the enemy y now here's the key you can't match the enemy right I can't match it but I remember I'm living under a promise Hallelujah that's already his powers has been more than matched and conquered and cast down I'm more than a conqueror right now not myself but I'm in him who conquered him for me see and that lives forth I'm part of the royal Seed of Abraham think of it a minute then get your Ox sced run that devil of Doubt away from you yes so you should not be afraid to say I believe God's word because you're not the one that has to keep it right you put it back on God's hand say God I believe your word and he's the one that will make it come to pass you can't make one hair black or white you can't add one one inch to your stature by thinking about it a while but he's the one that can bring it to pass you can't match the enemy but he can so now stay B fortified behind his word lay hold to it and believe it because we're living in perilous times a crisis time an emergency time now look Elijah got up when he heard that still Small Voice and an emergency requires immediate action right that's what when you hear the still Small Voice you know growing up it it seems like I I just kept you know I know how young people do they they they keep hearing that call repent repent and then well one of these days I'm I'm not quite ready yet repent but and emergency an urgent call requires immediate action right when the call goes out when when when we're at working the fire alarm goes off you don't just Dilly datle in fact if you do Dilly datle they've got people assigned to go around and make sure you get up and go out the building and that's what I'm doing here behind this pullit I'm encouraging you I'm raising an alarm get up and go because the alarm is sounding get up because it's going to be too late one of these days there's an emergency requires immediate action and and you know this that you let this layout of seeing Spirit just get o get over on you until you just you just you you just start looking you get hypnotized like like that zombie brother Louise you you just start you know you just but but the the way to get that uh yeah the way to the way to get out of that glare to this layout of sea and age is to get in God's word and and stay focused exactly right but look now that that voice that's calling I believe that voice has called the same thing all down Through the Ages this message has been the same and it's been a real simple message and we know we we know the the the formula is that is that you must hear the word first and believe it and let it be quickened to bring forth life and I want to maybe just present you with this one word today and that one word is repent because that one word has has uh that's that's the message that Jesus pre preached that's the message that John preached that repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and the the disciples went forth and and they told everybody they needed to repent the first words out of Peter's mouth on the day of Pentecost was repent and then and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of sin and the promise shall be for you and to your children and and so forth because now look you could take a hold of that promise and repent repent we we know the technical definition is is you know turn around and and go the other way but maybe I want to just put a different spin to it repent is get up get up and and and God forgive me God ask God to forgive you and and repent for all the things that that you've done and give yourself to God that that's what that voice is calling out for that voice is the voice is crying out for the people to repent and give over to God Amen you know brother Bram told this little story of of Al forar that he said uh do I need to do I need to get maybe he had a lot of money and do I need to get a hotel room so I can be have a little place off to the side and everything brother Adam said that's not necessary God can meet you right Wherever You Are that's in your bedroom beside your bed he can meet you after church at the at the altar he can meet you wherever wherever you're willing to get up like like Elijah did and follow after the voice he was Elijah had something different about it because he he he he was motivated by that voice not by the not by all the distractions and everything in Matthew 4:17 it says from that time Jesus began toe preach Y and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and Mark 612 and they went out and preach that men should repent I'm going to just pause here and get some water cuz I'm about to I'm going be in a Thirsty Camel again just give me another 10 minutes or so so what would the voice say today I believe the voice would say repent let's go to number 13 God will send the Elijah right just as certain as I'm standing in this pullit he will send and that Elijah will shake the people right straight back to the original Pentecostal Doctrine now start out at Pentecost and see how it was see what they did say if it'll be shaking hands and it'll be right straight back and when Peter preached on the day of Pentecost up there when they was all filled with the Holy Ghost and speaking in other tongues these men said now what can we do to get it Peter said repent right every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins let's go to number 14 what's the message going to be to Israel scroll on down to where I got it highlighted that's just before the tribulation period see oh how wonderful also Jacob's trouble here's when the 144 th000 has called out they the preachers them two prophets they preach like John the Baptist the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand repent Israel right repent what repent from your sins and your unbelief and turn back to God am now there's the problem that they had back then everybody thought that they were okay everybody everybody uh sat sat around believing that they were Believers believing that they were okay and and failing to repent because the first step to repenting is to realize that something's wrong right something's off kilter those men outside on the day of Pentecost they didn't really they didn't know there was anything to repent from until Peter came out filled with the Holy Ghost and opened up their eyes and took the veil off from their eyes and then they could see that there was something wrong with the condition they were living in and then they could repent and look at number 15 Peter was led to say on acts 238 how to receive the Holy Ghost he said repent every one of you then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of your sins and then the guide will take you from there on then the guide repent right now see there's that just one word sewn into the heart and receive in that good ground Let It Grow repent now you can do something about it if you see it if you see you got to do it repent repent of your sins your unbelief that You' disbelieved these things now see that's the pro one of my favorite little songs that this little church sings is is don't let this gospel we have become common to you right because this gospel becomes common over the years the people in the message just sit in the Pew year after year until it we start to think well now I know everything I know all about it and and and really you you start to get that that laziness that that feeling that I don't need to repent anymore when you're the one that needs to repent more than anybody else right you're sitting here right under the word and and failing to realize that you need to repent I I hope you receive that in the right Spirit first repent of your sins your unbelief that you disbelieve these things repent and then be baptized and then the guide will take you from their own see that's your duty it's your duty to repent right and and not just before you receive the new birth but after after you receive the new birth just going to work getting come home from the work and you've been slopping through work and it got all that mud on you Lord forgive me forgive me forgive me and you just keep on repenting it's your duty to repent I ain't got nothing to repent of it's your duty and it's your duty what he says it's your duty to be baptized then it's the God's duty to take you from their own lead you from virtue to knowledge to Temperance to patience to God and the brotherly love and the Holy Ghost seals you you do your duty and then he'll do his you can't even claim hold to God's word you can't even claim hold of his promises in the right way until after you've got the one that made the promise living inside of you and fail to see that you need to repent I wish there was a way that I could say the right word to just open up the take the tear the veil off the people's eyes that that that maybe if not now at home when you're at home alone to get by beside your bed and say God I I just want to lay all this at your altar I just want to lay all this at your feet and all the stuff that I can't get rid of in my life and everything that my family's not serving you Lord if you just take it all and and take control of my life that's that's the way to do it just put it all on his put it all on him and let it be his duty do your duty and repent and then watch him fulfill his word and the Holy Ghost seals you see then you're a full stature of God a real man of God a real woman of God anchored away in Christ I love that that anchored away in Christ let's keep on going let's go to number 16 let's let's uh this may be a real simple message tonight but you know sometimes that's what we need is Simplicity desperation is number 16 uh because he he was talking on desperations and and desperations comes in a crisis in a critical time now we should all be in desperations here we are right at the hour right at the moment of that that all my life I've been looking for the body change and here it seems like right at this crucial moment everybody's getting in a state of Slumber in a state of rest where this should be the most we should be more on fire at this hour at this time than any other time in history so what's wrong what's wrong with us something arises and when they do then it throws them into that desperation and really and doing that in desperation that brings out that real thing that you are how about that desperation squeezes out what's really on the inside and makes it manifest and there's coming a manifesting time there's coming a squeeze that's going to squeeze that out what's really on the inside inside and it's I believe it's here now it's upon us it's the manifesting time is is revealing who really has that still Small Voice and who just built upon emotions and things like that and really and doing that in desperation it brings out that real thing that you are it shows what you're made out of in the time of desperation it usually pulls out all the good things that's in you in time of death I've heard people when they know they were dying the things that they kept secret on all their life they in desperation they were trying to confess it now isn't that sad waiting until that last minute squeeze when they know that they're passing beyond the curtain and then they wait until then until that squeeze to confess to God why not now why not confess now why not repent now why not make sure you're right now why not get everything lined up and make sure there's no loose holes make sure there's no gaps make sure make sure you haven't taken any shortcuts make sure that you haven't looked at the wrong evidence and make sure that you're sure right take this and make it right go please go go do see in desperation they ought to have done that beforehand see not wait till the time of emergency will you do so and so for me the emergency causes desperation when we ought to do it without the emergency I'm finishing up in just a second actually the musicians can go ahead and come on up because I'm I'm going to wrap up in just a second and see what see what Elijah is looking for in number 17 and the message look Elijah he one day when he was looking for something to come to bring help to the people he looked and he looked to the old man 80s something years old was too tired to climb the mountain after been fasting praying but God told him if they would repent something would happen you remember that when Elijah came on the scene in First Kings chapter 17 he caused the famine in the land yeah cuz God's squeezing everybody squeezing out something putting desperation on people and if they would repent and then the rain would come but God told him if they would repent something would happen what was he looking he sent his servant up said go up and look look something is going to happen 3 years and a half and no rain not a cloud not even DW falling but said go look and Elijah or gazi stood and looked and looked and looked he didn't see nothing he come back down he said I didn't see nothing go back again amen go back and stay till it happens and Elijah goes back around me gazi and he looks and looks and looks and Elijah that little bald head sitting there in the Sun and his whiskers and his beard white beard and then little bony looking arms across his bony knees he said Lord God as he began to pray he said go back again now what was he doing he was looking for God to take care of his promise no matter how brassy she looked how much judgment is upon it right are you looking for God to make his promise now look the Elijah in this day when that voice screamed out screaming out for repentance is screaming out now to repent and to come to Jesus and that voice is not just a man but it's the voice of God now now I'm going to finish on this I had a little quote for them to play in the back and i' like them to go ahead and play it now and let's just let's just get real quiet and meditate on this as it as it please chairs everywhere be well and healed in the name of Jesus Christ God bless you brother step out of there and go on home make you well while you're standing on your feet praising God how many once you raised your hands a while ago believes that

crisis in this time of Crisis where people are are not realizing that they're lost not realizing that they're hanging their hopes upon emotions and things that are something else beside that still small voice but Lord God let that word your word be our everything your word Lord let us hang our everything that we have upon your word that's been given to us that we have freely before us Lord and

come and see if that little still Small Voice will speak to you remember it wasn't the great things that was heard but it was a little St still Small Voice Elijah comes walking out right cuz he knows that voice and he knows Satan can't impersonate that he could impersonate all the great signs and everything but he couldn't be that little still Small Voice that the prophet said the word Satan can't bring that word anybody else that just have E I will I will praise praise the L for siners slame give him glory all you people for his flood has the amen and amen let's give our brother a good hand I
