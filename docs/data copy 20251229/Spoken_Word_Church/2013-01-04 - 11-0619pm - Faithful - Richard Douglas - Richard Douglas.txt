remission of sins amen i'm so thankful for that appreciate each and every one of you for coming out again this afternoon you're under expectation for god to do something for you man you have to expect him to do it you know a lot of times i think we miss it because we don't expect him to do that that's right we get in the same old rut same old we kind of get almost ritualistic sometimes i just well

asked god like this you know you do it the least of my little ones you know all right to me i'm praying he'll reward each and every one of you for your goodness he said he would and i like how the prophet took that approach they said if he went to somebody's house he wouldn't even leave unless he asked for some water because he wanted them to be blessed right that's right so we should think the same way right people would be blessed if we've been around if we go with that right mental attitude toward undivided promising god you'll fulfill it he will feel his word for his word turn with me to the book of galatians tonight pray for me he preached me pretty hard this morning and i'm gonna depend on god like i always do but amen i believe you've come and helped me you said he would amen we just need to appreciate you pulling on the word this morning i believe god said something to us it'll help us in this journey galatians chapter 5 i'd like to read two little verses of scripture just a

like that where it says but the fruit of the spirit is love peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith i want to talk about the partner of faith tonight i would like to talk about faithfulness just for a few moments tonight this afternoon we want to look at faith and faithfulness faith and faithfulness are closely linked faith being the foundation to all that we believe and all that we act upon amen but without faith it's impossible to please god amen and your faith generates inside you faithfulness to him and to his word right faith is the undeniable power through which we can realize the reality of things that are as yet unseen and count them as though they are faith brings a revelation from the prophet god said faith is a revelation knowing who you are see first of all i believe a lot of times the problem is around the message thank you by the way is a lot of times as people we don't really realize who we are right we don't realize who that really we don't not really come to the full maturity to realize that we are sons and daughters of god that we i think a lot of times as a natural types of spiritual i believe a lot of times satan has tried to steal our identity right just say that we're some old church store that's just going to a church or coming to a gathering but we are the bride of jesus christ i'm here to tell you that the word of god has identified me amen and it identifies you tonight as sons and daughters of god the very bride of jesus christ that's right amen and your actions speak louder than our words right when we have faith in god we act in faithful ways we have to faithful ways by attending coming to church uh praying like we should reading our bible like we should studying the message like we should listening to the tapes that's just faithful acts of your faith amen right is that acts of faithfulness is the demonstrations that we have true faith in the true the living god that we believe that whatever we ask him according to his will he will perform it amen right brother oh i'm thankful for that right we see that that fat acts of faith are the threads holding our belief in god together james once said faith without works is dead he said you say you he said you say you have faith he said i'll show you my faithfulness by my words you'll understand that these signs follow them that believe me it's the acts of the holy ghost having faith in god he testifies that you are faithful to him by those things following your life we're not looking for signs and wonders they follow us amen that's right i believe where we're not seeing as many signs and wonders as we should is because we're not faithful enough right amen how is he going to give us the great things if we're not faithful over the small things that's right i think a lot of times we've hit our talent you remember the man got three talents he kept it he went and he gave god back three more then the other one he gave him two he was they was faithful but he said oh you the one that he gave one thought well they don't mean much love me we said in church with that well i'm not a preacher i'm not a teacher i'm not this i'm not that i don't mean much you mean a whole lot to god you mean so much to god that he gave his very life for you right we see that he is desiring meaning to be more faithful right than ever he wants us to be faithful he desires meaning to be faithful right he doesn't draw things right just to testimony in my own life as a young minister i started out ministering you know my brain said find you a pulpit finds you a pulpit you know you preach to the trees you preach to the dogs and preach to the animals and so i said well you know the lord laid down my heart i got on the radio he gave me that desire i preached on the radio for a long time before the lord started opening doors to preaching around you know he was training me he was gonna see if i was faithful right right you know i i think it's i i know brother it has helped me right because it helped me to understand the bible help me to understand the message come right out of this file right because when he was on the radio you couldn't say brother brother said this you couldn't say it come out this man you showed it in the bible and the bible backs it up amen this message is back it's the bible up right come on the bible is the gun barrel the message of the sights it was not in this bible he brought himself an angel from heaven told me anything was in the bible i wouldn't believe it they said say that angel told you to baptize that way we believe you brother brother he said if he told me anything what he did i wouldn't believe it right then what about us if anybody tells us anything that wasn't in his bible we shouldn't be faithful to it we should say faithful to the word the word has been faithful to me in you that's right we serve a faithful god but anyway i preached on there for a while you know god just kept you know we kept and i had a desire you know god gives you the desire to do something brother death can you do it right he won't see if you're faithful you're standing because you know you don't know who's listening right you don't know you know how no people are pulling on you right you know he was saying if you're gonna stand here i'm gonna see if you're standing here make a fool out of yourself for me i said lord i stand here and spit all over this place for you and every time i was on that radio broadcast i believed god i trust god god was saying something to them people i don't know i don't know who it affected or who it condemned or who it brought to life but i said praise god you said you would do it said your word wouldn't come back boy all right you see right here is a blind ministry it's really helped me and uh so it got to worth a while you know i started i talked to my wife i said what i said regina i just feel like i lost my desire to do that oh my you know i lost my desire to do that radio there was a guy helping me out my brother for them i said feel like the lord just took that away from me and uh you know what god pulled something away from you he closed one door he opens another man you know i said well i just feel like i don't know how to tell a brother but somebody does feel that next week me and that brother brad's a radio station he said look what she said finance is getting pretty touched and i'm ain't gonna be able to help you i said oh don't worry he felt bad you know he said because i wanted it to go on i said but you know god already told me it was done right yeah i said all you're doing is confirming that he's through with this it's something that ever almost every radio station i went on and preached they went out of business don't let me preach on your radio station in georgia amen but it's just that way you know what god gets through he says okay right you want to accept it right just do away with it and it wasn't me it's him his words true you know that's right and you know i went to you know you fell because well you know lord you really wanted the doors up but you know i waited waited waited i was talking to some brothers at church one brother said don't mean don't feel so bad brother said he's gonna be all right he said i feel like god shut that door and he's gonna open another door and you know what lord and behold you start opening the door i said my goodness lord that's that's where he wants to go now but see it was training see when we come to church we're in training we're sitting here for a purpose it's just not here just a social gathering god is training us come on brother how to contend for the faith in this hour he wants us to come to the unity of the faith amen he wants to know if you're going to be faithful over your things here right if you're faithful what it gives you here he knows he can he can trust you over there for the saints of judge the earth if we can't judge things here how we gonna judge him over there right just want to know if you're doing faithful even paul challenged them over in correctness when they couldn't do it he said how dare you take one another to the law you being christians he said then let the lead stop him judge what happened humility right let the little kids judge you since you adults can't do it let the littlest ones let the least of the faith the youngest christians judge it man you ain't got to pray for not to believe god to give you the right answer then let them judge you right right that's right it should be the same way he wants us to be faithful faithful over his word the word p-i-s-t-i-s i don't know how you say that word by the way you might be able to say the original greek word most often translated as faith in the bible it means to be of a firm persuasion or you have a firm persuasion tonight if you ain't i'm asking god to give you a firm persuasion you know what it takes a lot to persuade people nowadays progress the hardest thing is to get one man to believe in another man that's why he said that's why he come in flesh right god did that he was gonna see if they'd believe in a man that's right he was gonna defy satan and prove satan wrong right they believed him and their sons followed him right it says the conviction which is based upon hearing and is used in the new testament always of faith in god or christ or a thing spiritual another word that means opposite of it is the apis to a apistos which means not worth of confidence and unbeliever either you have faith or you don't either you're a believer or you're a believer or an unbeliever i mean it's the three right we're one or the other right so i'm believing tonight i preaching to all believers that believe in this message i like what a little little phrase dl moody used one time he said he says deal when he says i want he said i i said he said once it says deal what he wants said i believe in a faith that you can see i figured you can see the manifestation of you believing right right there's a it's it has an outward work right you know my mother was the lord was when i was having around the world and i was serving the damn stuff she kept they said won't you just clean it cut that hair trim that beard look like somebody i said well mama went there no good clean up the outside if the inside's filthy you know what i think it's worth a lot of times is happening around the message we've tried to clean up the outside it's to let god take work on the inside he'll bring the hair along he'll bring the equip the women wearing the slits and the high heels and all the dresses and things they wear he'll stop all that he took that away from me brother saying my mother didn't have to tell me my parents didn't have time to cut my hair i personally had to clean up quit wearing those rock t-shirts quit acting like an idiot the holy ghost just took that away from me he said you'll have no more conscious which means no more desire for those things and that desire has changed and you're faithful to god you don't want to do anything to hurt him anything to bring him to bring him to the pain that he's already suffered from you right he said he wants to see he said i believe in the faith that you can see a living working faith that prompts action faith without works is like a man putting all his money into the foundation of a house and work without faith is like building a house on sand without any foundation right are you putting all your faith now you're working this this message in this foundation which is jesus christ this message is nothing more than jesus christ before he opened the seals he preached god in simplicity hiding himself and revealing himself in his word jesus christ the theme of the message jesus christ was saying yesterday today and forever unchangeable right faithfulness let's look at faithfulness just in the natural just for a few seconds this faithfulness is a vital part of human beings right in fact it is so important that without it society will collapse right we can have faith in what they even in the people that have built our cars that they build them right that we can drive we have faith that people who just construct this building that they build it right there they won't fall in on us when we come in here right we can have faith brother said you the same faith that you got to crank your cars the same faith god awkward operation every day of our life demands us an act of faith right that cares carries us into countless actions which are we are dependent on the faithfulness of others right we need to learn to depend on one another right instead of being so self-sufficient me myself right you know we need to be an outlet instead of an immigrant largely because yeah i call them desert houses you know because you go in there there's no fruit there's no water there's nothing there just saying you know we want to see some life on that light amen come into our presence and meet the very living god that we serve the fruits of the spirit right now we want to become so salty that they become so thirsty i believe one reason of the lack for faith and faithfulness is that so many of us have been wounded and scarred by dealings and relationships of others that we can't have faith and confidence in one another right it's hard for us to have faith in them again but you know what jesus still has faith in us when we make our mistakes we fall and make our thoughts in our prayers he still trusts us right because he believes his word is true then why don't we believe his words true he will bring us to that place paul calls the revelation he said whatever i have committed unto god that he will keep yep until the end amen do we not believe like that all right then why wouldn't you one day we're oh i'm a christian next day we're a sinner what's wrong with us what's wrong with us we need an experience with god we need to born again experience we need the baptism of the holy ghost that's why people are tossed that's why we see so many strange doctrines around the message right this will believe in that and this one it's their lack of faithfulness to the truth so he has beguiled them right paul said who hath bewitched you who has seduced you who has brought you you did run well why have you stopped right why have you could be faithful to the truth i've showed you he said oh timothy stand fast in the faith in the gospel i have preached right amen it's that simple you say oh that's so simple but yet it's so powerful in all this there's a positive god is always faithful he has no false advertising claims amen if he tells you something like the brothers talk illustrated about that they illustrate about the soap the detergent that you put in the water he said they just trained the city during the horse dishes he said boy that was a false house i believe preachers have set up a lot of false advertising oh no jesus said you you must be born again that's right amen all right oh but we we serve a god that has never made a false claim never made one false claim never put up one false fear board right like the cigarette advertisement advertised a young cowboy other woman had dressed so look so seductive to the world oh if i smoke i'll be cool but they don't show the end right the end see satan wants to show the beginning but he don't show you the end of it when they're laying down their throats rotted out of their laundry or i'm glad they started showing those things they'll start fighting against we would have never thought that that makes me think about this we would have never thought they would come up against cigarettes remember i'm saying it'll be a time where they'll be along and smoking when we first heard that man as many puffers if we got around the world there's no way but i'm glad they stopped it in the restaurant prophecy being fulfilled i'm like brother holman girl they say well you ain't got no scripture they asked him one time said bro homie ain't got no scripture on on smoking he said oh yes i do he's thinking you know what this stinker it stinks to a believer i mean even my man a man or woman and god delivers you from that thing yes it's awful i said thank god for those like crying i won't let him smoke no more i said praise god i hope they don't let you have cigarettes no man it didn't hurt me but it hurts the smoker's feelings but they're offended because of the word he said you're offended because of me or my words i'm thankful that god has come to that brothers of that eye that we're a human normal christian but we could sit down and don't have to worry about it right man going that smell like a smoke stack right when they come in church you walk in i know you when you you travel you know and you come into a place and just go to a place brother down you probably haven't had youtube or the way like minister brothers are going to look on venus trying to get some some gas or something going i mean it's like a smoke factory you're going down here you come to church never do this man if you don't smoke you smell it i know there's a you know a brother too in the church that god if you ain't got rid of that god you take it away from you yeah you know you can tell when they smoke that like well they you know that's your wild people you know what you can smell it i used to like it when i didn't want to smoke part i could have it but i can smell it now i can smell it you thought you hit it you thought i washed my hands can't smell it never went into the store one time with these young boys and she said she said y'all smell like always smoking rap in the back oh my goodness you know you didn't realize it because that's how that demon love it and it smells so sweet tonight just like our praise and our and all all the glory we give to god it's so sweet to him he loves it then we ought to be faithful in giving it to him he he smoked pot you know he's young boy he becomes you know a friend i didn't hold that against him i mean i tried to be salty to him when he calls me still he don't work anymore but he still tries to be our friend he'll tell me pray for him or something you know but uh he was coming through there and i said his name his nickname it called we're calling brownie and his last name was brown his name derek brown shouldn't call his name but he's a good friend i don't think he hears he does trying to offend you you better he kept that army said that he said no i come to an arsenal man they're messing with the part what do you mean man you can't smell it on me can you i still smell it too when you come in the door i'm sitting in the office he said man i was over talking to the owner i said he smelled it on you man yeah i said if i smell it he says man i didn't make me smell that i said it's all over you man you're wrecking in it he said you got anything to smell him i said no you have to take your clothes off and take a bath and get that stuff already but that's the way we're coming when sometimes we come to the house of god and we ain't being faithful we stink in his mind that's why we come here everyone comes here we got to be washed by the ground washed and cleaned by the washing of the water because we rub shoulders with sin all week when i come to the house god says god wash me cleanse me make me clean that i might stand in your sight clean and spotless i said sometimes god little iron hurts but i want you to get the wrinkles out too well that steam will bring bring the wrinkles out a lot of us need to learn oh i'm thankful that god is able to give us that let's look at this remote at boaz he's seen the faithfulness of ruth toward naomi an unbeliever look at that she was even named because you know really she was supposed to have no part right with the jews having no kind of inheritance at all and she was named that's like a lot of us we shouldn't have no part at all but god who's rich rich in grace has just took mine in your place that we have a place in here in this beautiful assembly of god that god has given us to be part of the bride of jesus christ he's seen something in her she told she said she made a stance she said and now here come over she said well wait a minute i can't be faithful you know and they was trying to do everything to discourage those two daughter-in-laws the other one just finally got scarcity i'll just go back to my own family right but that one said let your people be my people let your god be my god i say let this message be my message let the god of this message be my god all right brother amen oh i'm thankful for that god always the prophet said respects faithfulness faithfulness you say well i just come to you over there and i'll see if i'm getting nowhere you're getting somewhere amen that's right you're getting somewhere that's where they come back it's doing something every time we leave this church something happens every time we leave these doors brother said we need to leave better or worse but you know what we got to come with this attitude brother sam i know we all tried to i said always i've said lord help me i want to leave better right a lot of times we need worse with more problems than we have but i want you to have faith and i said god amen i'm gonna because you're faithful and father i'm faithful tonight to be here right now and i want your word to change my life he said we see here through all the ages god rewarded them for the loyalty and steadfastness to the original light as each age pulled away from the light his faithful messenger always turned them back to the word they counted it a joy to suffer for him amen we whine and murmur complain when god puts anything on us or allows something to happen he don't actually put it on us right but he allows it and then we get a grown man lord satan said he didn't love you he wouldn't done that yes he did he got it because he loved me he had confidence in you he had confidence in me we gotta get to that and say lord i'm gonna stand faithful right like joe the song said though he slayed me yet i trust him you gotta put your complete trust in god he said his messenger always tried to turn him back he said that counted as a joy he said reflect it it says they burned with the light of his life and reflected his love patience meekness temperance gentleness faithfulness and god back to them but back them up with signs and wonders right that's why we don't see as many signs than one as we should it's because we're not faithful enough right he'll back it up the prophet said he would he'll back it up right he'll leave a faithful out he'll back it up very well he's got to back his word up not because i said because he said amen all right look at this we've never heard of this man before except in the bible and never missing nowhere else but octopus my faithful martyr he was so faithful god said i want you to write his name in the book i wanted him to be a memorial right he was faithful unto death he's wondering he's not actually telling about for us to go to a natural death so much right but he's asking men you will mean you be faithful to the death of self-will and become faithful to his will all right glory we see that supreme faith will give supreme grace for the hour for a supreme that we're living in i like what gentleman said what the book of john said lord jesus said he gave him grace for grace right double grace a double portion i like what the prophet said in the tithe church age he said i know your faith now he does not say here as he did to the pergamos church the church in pergamos you hold my faith but he is commending them for their faithfulness amen and as he does he always mentions their patience now faithfulness and patience go together boy that patience we don't want to talk about that because that kind of that's that's a hard one we're going to go through a lot of trials and get patience amen but they work together right he says in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness so that shows you faithfulness thou known you've got patience to wait on god know he's god stand on his word he said for it says in james 1 3 the trying of your faith work of patience he said there is absolutely no other way in which you can gain patience unless you're faithful amen he said it has to come it has to come the trial of your faith romans 5 3 says said tribulation work of patience how highly the prophet says here in the church book he said how highly god regards this outworking of your patience it is seen in james 1 4 he said but let patience have our own perfect word that ye may be perfect and retire lacking nothing amen man that's why he said there is no law praise be to god god will for us god's will for us is perfection and perfection is patience waiting on god waiting for god this is the process of character development we have to go to the school of character i mean it's a rough thing that character development that's the heart that's the school of hard knocks amen he's building characters that we might be able to sit with him and ruin reign together with him he said he said how highly god has commended the saints of the dark ages patients patient as lambs led to the slaughter loving faithfully they serve god he said that is all they wanted out of life is that all you want out of your life tonight ask yourself is that all you want to have your life tonight is to serve god and to please him in all of your ways right that'll be the very desire of every christian here tonight that'll be your soul desire he said that's all they wanted just service to the lord yeah oh my he has served us so great can we not be can we not be ambassadors let me serve him like he served us he says how great was it to be was there war for their reward to be man i am so thankful for that i like what jesus was talking to simon peter here in saint luke 22 31 he says and the lord said unto simon simon behold satan has desire to have you and he desired to have me and you too you better believe he desires you hey when god got us he got mad he lost one of his converts hey we went perverted we was converted right amen he says he has desire to have you that he may sift you as wheat satan wants to sift you but you know what through that sifting process it brings all that out getting the dross had to come when the fire come on the gold and all that draws come out and he might push that away the very guy that had to go i like what i like what the one little thing was said in there said that the the the oneness i've got who said this he said lord bring it back to me he said that the master is never never very far from the furnace the face of the first when his gold is in the fire all right amen amen we've seen that in the testimony with the three hebrew children he said put them in the fire and i'll show you they'll come out reflecting me right he said in saint luke 22 13 he says oh i love this same thing for me he says but i have prayed for thee that thy faith failed not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brother man say peter couldn't do that for nobody he was doing a lot of good preaching right but he couldn't straighten his brother until he was converted right hey judas preached good sure but he went converting he couldn't go to pentecost right now you're getting given to the experience with god i like what it says in second corinthians 5 7 he says for we walk by faith not by sight not by sight for faith is the sense of things hope for the evidence of things not seen right people say oh if i said i believe it he said old doubt and thomas you didn't believe he said but blessed are they who haven't seen and believed they're greater they're greater they have a greater reward than me all of us haven't seen the prophet never been in one of his meetings yet we believe we believe it's nothing but the truth second corinthians 13 5 it says examine yourselves whether you be in the faith not just in your faith now defense he said prove yourselves unbelief is unfaithfulness the word means unfaithfulness faithless one of faith weakness of faith oh my honey young man when the apostles come and try to cast out the epileptic spirit out of the young boy he said oh ye i like what the boys did and said he said lord help thou my unbelief right i like what paul said in first corinthians 16 13 he says watch ye stand fast in the faith i am that's right amen the unity of the faith the faith of the gospel right to your established in the faith the faith the faith the faith for this hour the revelation of this hour the revelation of who you are who god is amen that you're part of his glorious bride i think what paul commended timothy in here in 1st timothy 3 9. he said holding the mystery of the faith in pure conscience right that's the key right to defeat today in a pure conscience right right having no desire for nothing but jesus christ god has always been faithful that's what the prophet said we know that too he said he does not change due to age we're changing today but we're changing from glory to glory he's changing me right he does not change as to place and does not change as to his word right then why are people around the message trying to change the message a lot of people are trying to change the bible to make it fit in but we need the bible to change this to make us feel that's right there's the key to it right brother i want to ask you a question tonight have you ever this afternoon have you ever faced a task that seemed beyond your strength or your ability so many times each and one of us have right simply overwhelming obstacles we didn't know how to handle but who was faithful he was faithful he said ah be faithful i'll keep lori if you'll stand in the faith right then i'll be faithful to you god will never leave us not forsake us he said i'll be with you even in you to the end right i like what it says in lamentations three turn within the lamentations chapter three read a little something right here the prophet jeremiah 3 22-23 he said it is of the lord's mercies that we are not consumed you don't think satan desires to consume me in you you better believe he does right he said because his compassions failed right oh my what a faithful god he said they are new every morning he said great is thy family oh my we can't exhaust them brother then we don't try to exhaust but a lot of times we make mistakes but he's an inexhaustible god he said i'm gonna wipe what you did out yesterday because you repented i'm gonna give you a new portion all right this morning man every day he's wiping our slates clean and he's faithful he not only forgives us but he forgets amen and the greatest thing in mind in your life the battle that we fight the most is to forgive ourselves right now that he's faithful that he forgive us then we must learn to forgive ourselves that's why we live under so much condemnation is because we have not caught the revelation to forgive ourselves if he's able to forgive us then why don't we forgive ourselves but we let satan carry that same old cloud over our life day after day moment after moment hour after hour until he beats us over the head with things that god don't even see god don't even see it right i like how the song says it says what sins are you talking about i don't remember them anymore man what about it god he don't really forget he just posed it over there right into the sea of forgetfulness and then puts up a sign no fishing that's right i'll tell you tonight be careful where you fish because the game warden will get you you don't have license to fish in everybody's life maybe when it goes under blood be careful what you pull out i like that my pastor said it one time so be careful if you dig up that old dead man you'll find yourself caring in yourself so we have to be very careful god has given we need to give everything to god and trust all right we have to trust god for everything right believe god for everything brother says i wish i could just trust him just trust him for everything he said but you know the people don't let me the world the way it is it won't let me do it here's a life principle we're dealing with faithfulness we have a gift or a talent you use it faithfully god increases it so you can do more not less more right the increase of your talent means that you do more not less i see a lot of times the increase of the talent brother samuel death is what they do and then they get god increases them but they start doing less less unless they start reading less and start praying unless we see a lot of preachers doing that right you get less but it says more amen he wants more right he's not satisfied god's a moving god all right let me know the way so like them spirits those anointings are moving they don't match up they're moving forward they're faithful they're fighting every day right keeping the devils off of me sorry amen oh i'm so thankful for his grace turn with me to isaiah 53 i'm trying to hurry hey man you're in a hurry amen let god have his way amen i love him i just love this word this word is so rich just a simple little thing but principles that we need to live by stand by you know it's not the big foxes that's for the vine it's the small ones the little things we leave unturned brothers in the box that we leave undone the small foxes it's that little bitty worm that eats on the leaf it's that little bitty worm that gets down there and crawl eats on the roots and kills it right isaiah 53 said challenging me and you who has believed our report to whom is the arm of the lord revealed challenges the word report the word report means to give an account of relate tale to serve as a carrier of the message man are you willing have you released his report so much that you're faithful in this message are you a carrier of this message that you're living the life that jesus lives right he's living his life through you now have you believed his report is he going to find us in that day shall the son of man find faith right shall he find faithfulness so he found fabulous i still believe in the message the pure message not some strange doctrine some wild idea but the plain simple message the gospel is he gonna find you faithful to it believe in it well if you lose your friends your family whatever is 10 faithful all right all right this message is a separator i found that out it brings a separation you lose friends you lose family and i'm telling you but i'll tell you what i haven't lost because i've won i've gained jesus i'm a winner as the song says either way amen i'm so thankful for that i want to turn to daniel i'm going to try to stop right here i'm going to turn to daniel look at those three faithful servants here for just a minute and challenge our faith tonight daniel chapter 3 16 and 18. here's shadrach meshach and if we know this proclamation went out there's a sound of this the music and all this going that they'll bow down to this image but i said that image was the image of daniel right a godly man henry's by the image of the prophet and we see him bound now now it's a very dangerous thing hey when that one when john fell into worship that angel he said don't worship me i'm one of your brethren no true man of god will accept worship paul and silas they wouldn't accept it when they started telling them you're this you're zeus and you're this god and that god they begin to rinse their clothes off and say we're men we're a brother like you right but i like what they said right here it says shadrach meshach and abednego answer that to the king and pass this proclamation just to shorten it for me we are not careful to answer thee in this matter he said if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace but i like this part right here and he will deliver us out of that handle king but i like verse 18 he said but if not be it known unto thee o king they wasn't scared that we will not serve thy gods now worship the golden image which thou has set up i like that if not faith all right lord if you don't deliver me i'm still going to serve you lord if you don't heal me i'm still going to believe you lord i believe it i'm standing on your promise may have not faith if not it be your will then father let your will be done we will not okay bow to any of your gods or any or the golden image that's right satan wants me to bow to an image instead to the god right he's trying to get the bow to images of men we got a lot of images of men around the message but we need to bow to the truth of god i'm thankful for god's grace thank god for his mercy i like this new challenge isaiah challenged us as we stand this afternoon challenged us half we believed his report right right i want you as we stand we ask our step father i'm not trying to say i don't believe lord but father i want my faith to be in the right place amen where i can be faithful and who else this age that i very out we live in god has has give us this report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed to me in you that was the arm of the lord this message is almost the lord that has gathered us up to his bosom up to his side to worship him with spirit and truth we're so thankful for his grace faithfulness a simple little thing but faithfulness is so powerful because god honors it right right if you're not a faithful of the small things and how will you be faithful over the great things right there's small things we need to stand faithful to god and be true every head now every night close have we can we say lord raise our hands and say lord i want to be more faithful i want to stand more true father i want to be a stronger believer i want to be more mature father i want to come to a full adoption

myself and just kind of partial to it i like to do it and and i like to do it the way brother branham done it and you'll hear me say it down there you know to do because that's the way i like it he said to fulfill the great commission to baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost he said i now baptize thee my brother or sister in the name of the lord jesus christ see
