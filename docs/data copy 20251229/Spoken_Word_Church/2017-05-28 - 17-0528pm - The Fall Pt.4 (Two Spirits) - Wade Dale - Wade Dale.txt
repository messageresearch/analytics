join that good music and good stuff there brother Louise got that velvet jacket on and getting some blue suede shoes and that fella had to brother that's right good to have these young ones coming along and helping us all out got I was talking to a Methodist preacher the other day neighbor friend of ours and he said we're losing ministers like crazy we can't get anybody to come and then dad's brother he's 80 1 or 2 and he's trying to retire they won't let him because there's just not that many good preachers around I said well come on up to Lowell I said well we got 4 or 5 pretty decent ones and I said we we don't have a shortage of them up there maybe you could come up there and maybe learn a little bit so I did get in a good discussion with the Methodists about about the once saved always saved course they was too bad that's there and they left first because the Methodist preacher did he you know he was he's a real nice guy since we've been boys our neighbor and he said I have a problem with that somebody you know like you've always heard that you know if you get saved at 9 years old your name gets put on the book and Baptist Church once saved always saved you can go live like the devil but when it comes to the end you know it's like daddy said you paid the parking lot or you know kiss the kids or something you go to heaven there that's not it we know that we know it's a process and I told Phil I said I said you know your your founding father there John Wesley I said he was pretty staunch on living right and he said yeah he said we've got away from that so maybe we see a stir and in in the people and I'm not I'm not being inclusive or exclusive today but still we have to know one thing's for sure Jesus said there's one way one truth and one life there's not two or three different ideas they're not four or five I was telling this morning I'll give you a little this one was fresh for me because I've been thinking about it and told them downstairs I was thinking I saw somebody's name the other day and her name was like Carol Addison Dale you know how they - ate their last name they keep part of their last name they hang on to that no we don't hang on to that and I said well that's what the Baptist and the Methodist and Pentecostals done a magic book of Revelation says you've got a name that you live by yet you're dead right but when june thomas married Wade dale me and my wife she's not a commis anymore she became a full-fledged ale a ma'am so if you put a hyphenation in there that's what the denominations have done they put that hyphenation it's Jesus Christ slash Baptist that's not right it's either the bride of Jesus Christ or you're not one of the - Jesus Christ does not have four or five wives he has one wife and that's the bride of Jesus Christ standing here today in front of me so let's get our Bibles out and turn to we'll start with the book of James we're still on the on the fall this will be the fall part four and we'll subtitle it to spirits all right to spirits the Dale was hitting a little bit on it this morning so maybe we can continue on I like to let the way the Lord works like that because I don't try to steal his fire and he don't steal mine and we don't still Jose and anybody else wants to talk about the Word of God it just kind of all falls into continuity was no like brother Bob Wednesday night that was a good job best I believe he's ever done and in which you should be that way so let's turn to James one we read this last week and we're going to back up just a little bit and you know we're still talking about the fall go to the book of James 1 verse 14 all right let's bow our heads before we get started definitely father we pray today Lord that you'll be on the scene father we know you're here we now pray that will clean us all out you take over be the active participant in in the service you'll be the speaker you be the hear you be the one that reveals because you're the only one that can give revelation probably pray this you'd be with the ones that are not here the ones that are sick the ones that are sins take father standing here Lord in the pulpit I always remember right below my feet is a list of names that we're praying Lord that will come to you father my children included and a lot of the ones here in the sanctuary fathers and mothers and all included Lord we pray that that you will hear our cry and hear our plea for our lost loved ones with the our getting short we have a I believe the bride has an agenda we have an agenda to get the people ready for for the resurrection and then a change of the body and not to be playing around but to get right with what's going on father we played around long enough and all these different ideas and thoughts but I know that there's one truth one life one Holy Spirit and one true revelation and father we're trying our best along with all the others here all the support we get from the congregation that we know that you're here to do the work we pray that we'll just now all yield ourselves to You Father you'd be the one that does the work be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor be with the ones Lord dinner that are coming in Lord in the next couple of months just be with them and take care of them Father forgive us of our sins bless us in Jesus name Amen James 1 verse 14 says but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed that when the lust hath conceived there are four parts of this when lust has conceived it brings forth what sin and when sin when it is finished it bringeth forth death which is the four things that we're looking at so you may be seizing the Lord adders blessing to the reading the word now I didn't bring any more scriptures because I'm just going to background a little bit what we've been talking about we know for a fact like we were talking about last Sunday that the fall was not caused by the eating of an apple or the eating of a fruit hey man if not then we just need to start eating apples again to get us back to what we supposed to be right but the Bible says that you're the fruit of your mother you're the fruit of the womb of your mother right you are the production off the tree of your mother and your father so we ought to see now that when Moses penned this he wasn't looking at Eve standing under an apple tree mmm he said the God told him said don't you partake of that tree in the garden no ma'am and then we had the serpent come in which we know for a fact tonight I know there's ones that are that are new here i Sterling's girlfriend has got it down pat if she wants to see sterling she got come Church it's good to have her with us again today you're not a banister anymore I'm going to quit talking about your promise in about December of next year but good to have you with us but sometimes you know when people come in we have a brother here you know that's just come in and sometimes we talk about things and you and I you know been in the message 3040 years we've we've had an understanding of what went on in the fall and the world has been I guess the world has been taught that Eve eat an apple which caused the fall of mankind well we know that's not true that it was actually an act between the we were talking about last Sunday you see that in creative evolution now not in Darwin's evolution but in creative evolution how God created this one in this one and the fish of the sea and the fowl of the air and the cattle come up to the monkey and then there's always been that missing link you've studied it in school there's a missing link there man knows that man knows that the chimpanzee can't coincide with a with a female woman human and that we can't coincide with them you don't know what I'm talking about reproduce because of that missing link there's a gap in there all right so we know that the Bible says the serpent was the most subtool of all beasts and even Scofield to tell you that that beast was not a snake it was turned into a snake it was an upright creature the person that stands between to what the the monkey which is a higher form of evolution the monkey and the man stood something called a beast we know that's what the Bible says and then the Bible says he was more subtil which what he would he was able to speak to the human race and able to also speak to the animal kingdom all right so that was that gap in between uh that man's always been looking for if they'd read the Bible that's it and how Satan entered that beast and vicariously through that beast since Satan is not a creator amen same can't create he's a spiritual being but he cannot create God is the only creator there is thank God for that that we can rest that one person has control of the creation now what the Satan do he perverts what God's already brought you and then so he perverted this earth this earth was doing fine without without the devil but once he entered that beast and began to talk to Eve and tell Eve say Eve I know God said multiply and replenish the earth you're falling behind on the program there sister they look at me and mrs. beast and look at the animals look at the dogs the cats they're reproducing God told him to multiply and replenish Eric right hey man so they were multiplying they were there's nothing wrong with that but when you bring it into the human Kingdom where man was not supposed to come that way we were supposed to be spoken-word children hello man that's what happened with Mary Mary what mary did not conceive by sex act she conceived only one way and that was that God created the egg and God I love that word created created the egg and he created the sperm placed it in the womb of Mary she was the incubator it was put into a right environment listen it was put in the right environment an environment and it produced a ma'am so because of the fall when she though gave it to Adam and Adam for took that actually stopped God from doing any of his act a spoken word creation now it had to come by the loins of man sure we know that remember the Bible says that Abraham were the royal seed of Abraham right but not natural seed no no no no listen Abraham is called the father of our faith he lied give his wife away twice twice but yet is a father of our faith why he just kept going he just kept going sure we're going to have time to rely were you quiet but we're going to say God forgive me and we're going to keep on walking that's why Abraham acquired the promise because what he kept walking but the Bible says not seeds as of many but one seed that's at Genesis 1:26 man that one seed which is Christ mmm and it was never been by lust or conception or anything in the loins of a human being God wanted to reproduce by a spoken-- seed Word of God and then he did not want - come this way but by his permissive well the reason we were talking about this morning if you just to be real real adamant about this if we would have come spoken word children had there not been a fall there have been two sets of people there being a bride and God that's it that's it now we know that's good if you're concluded is that but now outside of that then you're lost unless you have something called grace God by his sovereign grace to be a savior to be someone that I tell them I feel we act like God sometimes because we kick them out leave it alone and let God do the work because outside of this now you have a foolish virgin you have a cup of water in my name you have Israel you have all the Old Testament saves thank you buddy amen amen so now look at the expanding of God you say well that was a horrible thing that happened in the garden sure it was horrible it comes all sin grief heartache cancer any kind of disease got started in the book of Genesis ma'am Genesis is the seed shocker we're going to look at in just a minute we ever get to it we're going to look that denomination's was set up in in the garden that Satan was riding right along in that garden with God's children amen got a rights amen but when less have conceived it bringeth forth sin you see how it continues to roll but sin when it's finished listen it's not it's not horrible to sin we were all born in it and then we were born in sin shapen in iniquity responsible my mother's womb a liar come to this earth dead you know what the Bible tells us what to cry at the birth of a child and rejoiced at a saint going home we have it right rivers we go to the hospital me go this sweet little child he's born dead he or she is born dead amen and without the saving grace without that Savior attribute that God now he is able to never had to never had to produce that he'd never had to be a healer he'd never been a savior if there hadn't been a fall he'd never been a healer had he not been a fall and something called grace would have never been in the picture amen listen this plan that God set up is perfect we try to change it we try to say I do it a different way but if God never had a new thought and if God is never wrong then this is exactly the way it was supposed to be man has hyphenated it man has hyphenated it and when saying that they're married to Jesus Christ yes they keep their old name Amen and this ain't got nothing to do what I'm fixing to regional anyway everybody all right yeah everybody okay but we know what happened in the Garden of Eden it was not that it was so much the sex act it was so much that Eve come out from behind the word and began to preach to the serpent she should have went and got her head which is Adam and said Adam I want you to this guy's talking some strange stuff but what did what level remember now Satan smart not an idiot he didn't go start talking to Adam he could he knew that anointing with Adam was so strong he really couldn't get to him but Eve he said I can get to her emotion because that's what it is he can get to her he got to her emotional part and said Eve look God told you to multiply and replenish the earth and you're not doing anything it's just you and Adam you and I you and Adam and she goes hmm maybe I can help him out a little bit well God don't need no help his plan was perfect to start with and this is part of the plan amen everybody all right man so now James says when Lester can see bring forth sin when sin is finished because remember Eve could have had that thought in her mind but instead of cutting it off see what she went to the next part then she went to the next part was held we were all born in sin we're all sinners but when sin is finished it brings forth death now God came down in human flesh to cut that off to destroy the effects of the fall amen all the effects of the fall that's why he's a healer that's why I'll heal you now that's why I'll save you now amen he said well by the way we're getting older it's okay we're doing something about that all right listen Adams natural seed though when he did the act with Eve was not to save her soul or to save her it was more I was trying to explain the other day to Adam listen he knew the principles while Adam Adam was not a dummy remember I don't went into this thing with his eyes wide open he knew what Eve had done he knew that she had done what she done and that she deserved death that sounds kind of like me and you we deserve death but what did Christ do he said no he said I'll take on her sin I will be her protector because she's not only Eve she's me if I got to kill me I'm not going to do it right there's the love that Adam had for Eve not that he had to have some lustful act with her to save her soul no her soul was already okay amen but to continue on listen brother Brahim sin Revelation chapter 5 he said Adam seed absolutely lost everything amen because we're going to read here in just a minute we're when the two boys came out the two spirits the two boys can enable came out they were not sure the Bible says righteous Abel because what he did a right act that's what righteous means is to be right all right he did a right act by killing the lamb and Cain did not accept that so he became the wrong one all right so now let's read here still look it wasn't the Adam or any of his seeds Adam seed absolutely lost everything it's not the seed of Adam no matter how much we try to beautify this world because remember look Adam his eyes were wide open he knew what he was going to do was going to sell us out right he was selling the whole human race out amen that's why the second Adam has to come to bring the human race back out amen the second Adam both eyes open knew what he was coming here for he was coming here to die sure he didn't know it when he was little but he did when he was older he said he even told Pilate he said to this end was I born a man so he knew what he had to do he knew that that first item had failed and that first item he could not what died for the whole human race he was not a creator either so we couldn't create sure they were able by sex to bring forth these children but remember they were still lost they were still they still needed a sacrifice to get by a man even Adam and Eve in verse 21 of chapter 3 says in the item he said to his wife did the Lord make coats of skin so the first animal sacrifice was not able right it was God himself God Himself came down killed the lamb took the skins ripped it off them throw it in the bushes and said here put this on those issues now you're covering a man you know what the word religion means look up the word religion it means a covering man now let's look number two go to number two revelation chapter 5 now our kinsmen have handed the seventh sealed book of redemption from the original owner the original owner when we lost it at the Garden of Eden through item it went back to the original owner that's what we were talking about last Sunday right at the end Adam had the ability to bring back Genesis 1:26 forth amen amen prophet of God said that Jesus his body would have come to leave okay alright so that was the first plan but now look God don't have plan a in B and C it was his original plan to start with we just don't know that we didn't know it hey man he knows in from the beginning I tell them this morning I I'm still trying to find that quote but brother Adam says when item did what he did in the garden in other words it darkened from there backwards he didn't forget where he was coming from but there was some things that he couldn't do that he used to could do and then hit some of the power had been taken away from him that all right but now here in the end time when Christ came back in human flesh and said I came from God and I go back to God I believe he's gave us here in the end time he's gave us the ability now to look back all the way back past the Garden of Eden into the mind of God where this book was written before the foundation of the world and know where we come from what we're doing here where we're going in at the prophet of God said what the seal was is what tells you what where you come from what you're doing here and where you're going amen so once we know that see the problem is is man has been lost in all these denominational ideas and even in the message with all these different ideas of well it's a Trinity well let's this well it's a baptism it's another baptism it's a sprinkling it's a pouring it's a Hail Mary it's a it's God that confused God's got one way one truth and one life and when man fell in the Garden of Eden somehow we lost that ability to get back to God because God said I'm going to put enmity God I'm Amanda he said I in other words God said look Adam I can't talk to you anymore because you have sinned you have something that I've got to have something between me and you now and then if it's a blood offering between me and you in the Old Testament it was the blood offering that covered the sin but it still the sin was still there but when Christ come and when he get away with that then now your soul is as perfect as God is it's his perfect his item was right there hello somebody I thought we were the second Eve I thought the second Adam and the second Eve was the second equals nothing will fall and then he's going to take her back to the garden I remember Adam couldn't take Eve back in the garden right Bible says right here that they were driven out they couldn't stand where they used to stand but what are we supposed to do by the Prophet message of the hour told us we're going back to the Garden of Eden amen he said those same flaming swords it was keeping Adam and Eve away from the garden and now what driving the believer back to the Garden of Eden amen all right we lost it in the garden what did we lose we lost the ability to be eternal body spirit and soul right that's what we lost and then you say how you know that you're dying even though you're born again Paul was born again Iranian smarten me you all the one just went on sure their soul is clean their soul is perfect but that sin curse is still attached to your body it's attached to you or living under a curse y'all ought to say amen to that because you know you are every every time I get up I get a new muscles it aches where it wasn't one before and I'm only 57 yeah you just we out need bro college a bird I mean used to how many times you just jump out as soon as you hit the alarm clock you get that alarm clapping brother Larry even me feet on the ground gone no you hit that alarm clock you go beat you got to move and they go no we don't yes we do but no that's part of it but what what is all this part of Redemption that we're talking about this is not some sad story what is the part of Redemption we're talking about God has made a way for us to get back and man remember he didn't come down to give us an inheritance hello he didn't come down here to give us an inheritance we already had an inheritance he just came back he said I am the way the truth and the life I'm the way back to that in Harrison right and then your inheritance was what I've been talking about that Genesis 1:26 man before the foundation of the world that I never had a bad thought never had a bad day never had a bad revelation never had a bad doctrine pure God Almighty is the only one that can do that amen and that's what we're if this is the book of redemption then he's going to redeem back every name that's in that book man that Adam was going to be able to produce had he not taken Eve side if you want to say that but he had to God knew he would there wasn't a crisis meeting in heaven when Adam did what he did come on he knew exactly what was going to happen and I don't say that he was happy in the way we think happy but he was like I knew you'd do that I've already made a way I think he kind of giggles at our age every once in a while because we'll do something we'll think we get by with it before the foundation of the world God knew you're going to do it and man that's kind of God I serve you try to get by with something sneak something by God please people head creep you can't sneak them by the devil you come to church and he's there already waiting on you and when you're not here he sit here waiting on a man but look we lost it in the Garden of Eden listen we didn't lose our inheritance God is not an Indian giver God did not put a name in the book in the Lamb's Book of Life you're what I'm saying the Lamb's Book of Life he didn't put a name in there and then forget about it or erased it out if it's there it was written in blood and when he went to Calvary when he was on the cross the book of name was right there with him hey man it took him three hours to die three hours don't you think how many names went through his brain when he was on the cross I was on his mind he died for me he didn't die for you I'm the only one I know he died for you better think you're the only one that he died for because I know he called my name what about you Amen where's the word Bob black when you need him all right that's Satan he came over he's a poacher now what did Satan do Satan slipped in and began a work that he thinks he's going to be able to take over God's kingdom kind of kind of crazy but I mean how would a man you think being deceived how would a man that that knew that that was my creator and then I'm going to do something to get over him or kill him or destroy him no but he's trying he gets he listen Satan gets an A for effort because I Joker when we're not even awake he's working so you got to get in that month but that title deed of redemption was taken back we know for one thing's for sure that it wasn't just some off the wall something it was a book of names that what Adam was to do was to produce sons and daughters of God Adam and Eve Satan stopped that process by what sin by an act that God couldn't go over but he said I'll put enmity between me and you but when I come back I'm going to bring that back together the Bible says God and man had met heaven and earth is kissed hey man he put all this back together and in the process grace was revealed amen so now let's let's read number three go read three and four and then we're going to start in Genesis here Genesis 4:1 we got to get with we're trying to get Adam and Eve I mean trying to get Cain and Abel out of the womb we ain't gonna mother womb yet alright now look I'm going to read you this and then we're going to back up and read Genesis chapter four and see that remember that book of Redemption brother Brown said was a Seventh Seal book man the seal just didn't develop in the Book of Revelations that's what John saw John saw that scene in heaven of the seal being brought to be right but remember as long as Satan's been here there's been two spirits and then as long as Satan when sooner he was created and the Bible says what iniquity was found in his heart there's been a battle there's two spirits and the prophet of God tells us that now even today there's two spirits who will read it from the church age book if we ever get to it when I watch brother Ram said I will restore 1955 now there's two spirits in those two boys talking about Cain and Abel all right if they was alive they had to have spirit now one of them was of the devil and the next one was of God it's exactly perfect Judas and Jesus Cain killed Abel at the altar so did Jesus killed Judas Jesus Judas killed Jesus that the author all the Bible's one big picture now let's read one more and then we'll get started because I want you to get your Bibles out to Genesis chapter 4 I'm going to bring it up here so you don't have to worry about it but if those of you that need your Bible need to get it out let's go to number 4 oh wait a minute I didn't read number 3 all the way through I'm sorry thank you that's why they hesitated they knew more about this and I did all right roll it back up now Cain and Abel both came to worship the Lord Cain built a church he built an altar an altar is a place of worship and came brought a sacrifice and Cain believed God listen Cain was not some evil drunk sight that never went to church he built the church all right Cain worship God so if God only requires for you to belong to a church make a confession in him for the devil tonight this morning and to bring an offering to him and a sacrifice he would be unjust to condemn Cain Abel brought an out made an altar he worshiped and brought a sacrifice they did the same thing both boys did the same thing Cain wasn't an infidel he was a very religious man did you know what the Bible says about the Antichrist it would be so close like the real it would deceive the very elect if possible now look this is now they profess religion now keep going now let's go to number 4 and read it this is same from I will restore notice there started the two branches there started the tree next time I can enable they grow right up through the Bible both spirits and they're here tonight and they're all over the world amen so the two spirits are working keep going a little bit go down here there's been an enemy the spirit of Cain and the spirit of Abel from Genesis all the way through the Bible all the way over in Revelations from the creation till now and will be until Jesus comes do you understand that they were both religious and then if you were if you were an observer you would see Cain and Abel and they would be doing basically the same thing all right they both worship the same God they didn't even have three gods they didn't have a Trinity they knew they was one God amen because remember God speaks straight to Cain and just a few minutes we'll read it but God they both worship the same God they both confess the same God but God vindicated Abel he said this is my one and that's not mine but both of them worshipped him both of them belong to church amen I don't want to be home to a church I want to belong to the bride of Jesus Christ and man I don't want to be on to a church you belong to a church Satan Satan builds good churches listen folks you know as well as I do Satan was the one standing beside God he was the worship angel he loved worship that's what got him so caught up he loved people worshiping him rather than him reverting all the worship what I said this morning there's no man listen to me there's no man on the face of this earth could stand like William Branham have the signs and wonders and all the vindication and not get a big head come on people think of the things he lived so close to Garden Inn my how would you like to have a man that would walk up and walk through an Indian Reservation and sit down and and take a piece of paper and said your daddy was this one and your mama was here and you had this child and it was your grandpa remember he did that he went to that Indian Reservation they were trying to figure out who was who they'd lost all their records glogg came down through that man and he sat down wrote out the whole belly sold him out told him how far back their great-great great-grandfather was man can't do that you give it to a normal man as if his head doesn't get this big and what he'll do is he'll turn he used a gift wrong but he knew that little man would use it right and he got in trouble every once in a while because we're all human but God vindicated that prophet because we needed a prophet to tell us that brother Dale was coming this morning I was hoping he'd get into that brother Brad said he said it takes a prophet to what turn a corner to see that corner stone it sure you can make a straight line but it takes the foundation of the apostles and prophets to make a corner make a corner why because that buildings Foursquare so it's got four corners and it took a prophet to turn a corner it took a prophet in the same time to turn a corner sure we had reformers and we had all the but it took one that had to restore us back to where we wouldn't know where we came from know what we're doing here I know where we're going amen thank God for that we live in a wonderful hour we live in an eagle anointing age where all of us can be able to see not see with eyes we can understand what this Bible is about we can understand what happens in the garden and know that it tides you know when I was 14 years old sitting in this church listened to the preachers 14 years old a long time ago when the church was this way you know they start preaching about Adam and Eve in the garden and you know fourteen-year-old kid you like manna know I knew that's what it was I think gosh that's all the way it could be it had to be sex in the garden it could have been an apple in it but you know what I didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost to tie the word together to tie it from Genesis to revelations or wear it tie those take those two spirits and show where they go but now see how God has brought us all up and all of us have matured to where we can see now that there's absolutely no way it could have happened then that way it's the only way it could brother Larry's I don't you know can't you go why can't people see that well it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent why didn't know just while he was riding and he saw what happened to the Beast and he why and he just write it down God said hide that you hide that because that's going to be a great mystery for those two spirits coming down all the way down through the church all right so now let's get started real quick let's go to Genesis 4 and we're going to go probably burst by verse if you'll bear with me for a minute I'm going to interpolate a little bit of what I think the conversation was about that all right an item knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain jahsh all that little Adam and Eve had a baby look one night with two children were born and she again bears brother Abel absolutely they were twins and then you say brother that's pretty hard to believe what was it California several years ago it even happened when brother Branham was alive because they had a picture of it that a white woman had sex relations with a black man in the morning and a white man in the afternoon and had a set of twins and one was white on the black so it can happen and it did happen it's exactly what happened Eve with the Beast in the morning brother Brown said in the hollow world he know that how do you know we've had blonde hair and blue eyes how do you know Adam had shoulder lean hair he was a prophet he was a prophet Moses Moses was a prophet without the new birth brother Branham was a prophet Newberg don't you think God to set him right over in the Garden of Eden and say look and he looks around and goes man he was beautiful Adam look at him okay so that's why we had to have an end time prophet we had to have an eagle anointing to get us up above all this other junk a man all this other junk that goes on in the world to get us above that to where we can see what forward and backwards because look eternity that's not just for word eternity goes as far that way as it does that way and then and she again now look now this is her doctrine even Adam knew Eve is laughing conceived and bare Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord now everybody's like well that must have come from Adam because she said I've gotten a man from the Lord every child comes from Lord don't matter if it was Adolf Hitler or John Dillinger they all get the Lord remember Satan is not a creator place the right thing together God has to put a soul in the body a man right and she again bare his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground because now remember Cain started killing the ground now before this we rated a couple of Sundays ago for those of you that weren't here that ground that he's planting these potatoes in and corn was cursed by God Adam was not cursed it was not cursed the womb was cursed sure in childbearing Adam was not cursed the ground was cursed the man right that's all right that all right I'm going to read it so you can get it and in Adam because thou hearken to the voice of my wife and has eaten to the tree of which I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and man this ground is cursed I've told you before I don't worry about the earth this big ball of Earth this is the ball of Earth I'm concerned with and this is the ball earth that God's concerned with because remember we are the highest form of creation God created right man is the highest form when we fail everything fell hello when we fell everything fell behind us now that's why Romans 8 says that what the whole world is groaning and travailing the whole creation waiting on what us to get back to that item part 2 where we're ruler there look everything's out of allocator listen go back to where in Isaiah 65 it says the line will lay down with the lamb that they'll eat grass and and there'll be peace that's what listen that's not something new that's what was happening in the garden before man came along and sin that's why we're going back to that towards the lining the lamb lay down together the problem is the line will eat the lamb on this style of all it's called a food chain you better be glad there's not one above us you'd be in that chain that all right and in the process of time so the kids were growing up that all right the kids were growing up there listening still to mamma's doctrine because mama says y'all came from the Lord okay I gotten a man from the Lord because remember Cain didn't have a daddy tanks daddy got cursed that whole beast line was cursed so Cain didn't have a natural father that's why that's why the Bible says right here that Adam called his wife's name now Eve because what she was the mother of all living Adam knew he wasn't the father of all living he didn't say me and Eve or the father and mother of all living he said you are the mother of all living because all this came out of your womb and one of them wasn't mine and one of them was not all right I ought to tell you something right there but now look this second Adam he's the father of all that is going to be eternal amen preserved in the Father people Jesus Christ preserved in the father you'll get that in a minute and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought forth to the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord all right so now in the process of time we see that that I'm going to interpolate here just for a minute and B Cain and Abel talking together and you know Abel's going to be out with a sheep and Cain's going to be kind of getting everything ready and planting the potatoes and planting this and he's collecting this and I'm sure that when you look at that altar that was the potatoes was in the right place and and Cain had the right color over here and had the right beans over here and had to write onions over here and he had to write this and if you look at that probably some roses flowing down the altar beautiful saying you were beautiful Satan is not a red long tail with horn the Bible says he was the most beautiful angel you see Satan today he'd be the best-looking man you ever seen in your life but he's a deceiver so here's came with all this beauty well you go back and you look at the Roman Catholic Church sorry if there's anybody Roman Catholic around here but still look at all their beauty their pump their circumstance their beautiful colors they're just Randall was a Catholic beautiful huge buildings mark of the beef mark of the beef that's where it came from right here we're going to see it the minute well we might got to try to stay on my own and able so Cain brings this great flowing altar and he brings all the fruit and all the beautiful colors just a gala brought all the see those flowers over there they're so pretty not saying anything I'm just saying watch Kane when you walk up you go yeah when you want to start about that when you walk that when you walked up the cane look being humans when you walk up to Cain's altar you go God's God except that being in our human and maybe even Eve would walk up and say Cain boy you're looking good I said good looking altar but let's see what God thought about it go so they want your mom and daddy thinks about is what God thought about it all right an Abel now watch Abel Abel goes out and gets him a lamb now you have to check it make sure it's not going to know any blemishes on he takes that animal he walks up to the to the rock right beside of Cain and Cain's got all this beautiful stuff and Abel takes that way I'm and it's kicking and screaming he throws it there he probably sits on it holds his neck out and not having a knife not a good Swiss Army knife anyway he takes him hacks that thing and I'm sure the blood is probably splattering over on Cain's altering Kane's like what's your problem look how beautiful this is and look what a mess you're making but let's see what God says about it he took the first thing of his flock firstborn son of God and the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering man God comes down and goes Abel beautiful that's exactly how I'm going to bring this back that's exactly property God said he got a revelation because he was tired I still I'm just I'm just honest he was tied back to Adam and Adam still I don't believe Adam became a grumpy old man what's the Paul happened no Adam had a job that was a job remember he was the only man he had to be like I said he had to be the doctor the lawyer the nurse the baker the the cook he had to be the whole thing I'm sure he delivered both children he was there who else is going to ever you can't call him in wife when there's only two people on earth so he had to be the Midwife he had to deliver him babies listen I believe Adam was highly intelligent I believe he didn't lose his intelligence because he had to God knew that too I know there's two men that I said I really want to talk about when I get to heaven Noah and Adam because Noah comes out of that flood living so many hundred years back this way when everything was just like it is now and he walks out of that boat to nothing Adam comes from this great almost eternal bliss and then he gets kicked out of the garden and finally he starts sweating he has to take care of Eve he has to take care of the kids he has to take now he's got to keep the animals off of him so he's got to build a shelter she won't come up kind of what we do now but thank God we're going back we're going back to that time when Adam and Eve all they had to do was worry about each other they just worried they just was it was just bliss but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth I love Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell Wow now look now they see that capital LRD so the Lord is speaking straight to Cain he's not speaking through an interpreter he's not speaking through Adam he's speaking straight to Cain and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted he extended grace right there that is Grace to came but what they can't do now look God give him both options and if don't quit moving in things if y'all do is not swell then lies at the door when lustres can see that brings forth sin when sin is finished it brings forth death now let's watch him go through those four stages right here for just a few minutes everybody all right say ma'am Angeles y'all stand awake today y'all need to drink more coffee or taste b12 or something everybody got their spinners y'all doing good today and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up oh wait a minute and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him what sin sin he's telling you he said if you do this then it is going to be your desire and that things going to you and him going to rule each other it's going to rule you and Cain talked with Abel about what Abel no give me this doctrine again give me this new thing you've got how did God accept that sacrifice and not mine because I don't see because Cain couldn't he have a revelation Cain couldn't see see means understand not physically see but Cain couldn't understand because Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass it wasn't just one day conversation they probably had a few church services hello they probably had a few church services with just him and Abel because there wasn't anybody else stepmom and daddy when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him that all right and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and look at that line spirit I know not am I my brother's keeper he's talking to God see how brazen he is he was talking to God he said my brother brother's keeper and he said what has out done the voice of thy brother's blood now what blood doesn't have a voice physical blood doesn't have a voice but what happened is is he heard Abell is over in another dimension now Abel's somewhere he's over in another dimension that they had nobody men before hello they've been no death before this right here Abel had to go somewhere so labels over in another dimension but his blood is crying out unto me from the ground and now art thou cursed from the earth which has opened up her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth and Cain said the Lord my punishment is greater than I can bear pour bless his heart behold thou hast driven me out of this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive Cain saying this Cain's passing his own judgment because watch what happens at the end and then we're going to go back and look at something real quick I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me and the Lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall be taken on him Sevenfold and the Lord said a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him keep going and came without from the presence of the Lord that was his mistake and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East of Eden that's why when I tell y'all I try to get to be preached to you before you get to the Land of Nod because Cain went to the Land of Nod so I don't want you to go to the Land of Nod alright so now what let's go through the Bible bring back Genesis chapter 4 again and let's just run through it real quick brother Dale did this a long time ago showing that the book of Redemption the seals are in the book of Genesis alright then alright how many remember that they probably went a lot of you here but anyway so now watch verse 7 God is giving caning out all right God is now look if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lies at the door and it says these shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him now look what was Cain's problem his doctrine Cain's problem was his preconceived idea that he was right is that all right say man and then so now we got to look when the lust has conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death now what is the white horse rider the white horse rider is what a white righteous church I'm right you're not I'm right because I'm white I'm white righteous Church because that's what's happening right here there's a wild horse rider that's riding so close till there is a true white righteous but there is a false because Cain is riding so close to Abel and so close to the truth til it's going to take God to separate them man and it's going to take God to separate it in the end time because remember it says it would even almost deceive the very leg listen I'm telling you if we were standing in the garden and standing off and watching what was going on we would wonder why God is punishing came we would wonder because you look at this altar and I'm sure Cain worship he didn't just throw the thing down he set it up exactly the way he wanted it I'm sure he prayed I'm sure he cried I'm sure he said God this is what I brought to you today this is the sacrifice of my sweat of my brow and and all these things and then you got Abel you think you think Abel would be the bad boy he probably just walked up here and goes god I've had some bad thoughts today and I know that I was born in my mother's blood and I know that there was something to do with blood I may not get all of it at the right moment but there's something there's something about this animal giving his life that's going to help me get closer to you he throws that thing down there and he just I mean the guy's probably looks like a mass murderer when he gets finished but God said that's my child that's my boy the blood sacrifice will always work works Cain works will not work that's why I said Abel had no work Abel didn't work he was like the prophet of God said he's laying on the side of the woods under a shade tree watching the animals and gets her you know he gets a he hooks a table and looks at Canaan says well it's time to time to go to the altar and he drags a lamb picks the lamb drags it down then throws it on then kills it dresses it probably and burns it well the prophet of God said God came down and burn for sacrifice Yoder how did you know that Bible don't say that the Bible said God accepted Cain's I mean Abel's sacrifice brother Branham said that God came down and vindicated it by consuming it with fire and then what happened on Mount Carmel a man God's consistent all the way through so iswhy brother branham even if he didn't see it he could go back in the Word of God and know that every time God accepted something he brought fire when he accepted you he brought fire hey man he brought fire and he burnt that old nature out of you a man now we are living sacrifice to God acceptable and holy that's what the Bible says about us okay alright so now but we see that that Cain is now obviously Cain's building a case he's saying I'm just as religious because right here he was talking about why is you counting this Roth in the cases I am I my brother's keeper Cain is so self-righteous he still thinks he's right right he still today thinks he's right a man so that white horse didn't begin a season look the book was sealed remember right so the understanding of this was sealed Daniel seal seal it seal it all the way to where the end time where the property God took those seals brother Brown didn't break the seal the mighty angel broke the seal the property God gave us the interpretation and man but who was standing in the garden with the book in his hand he knew what was in there so he showed up tight of the seals all the way from Genesis through the Bible and then the actual scene now let's look we're playing it out right now we're playing it out today today we're playing that we still have the white righteous church and we still have the white real church a man there's got a Satan has to be an imposter he can't ride out before God for anything he is never an originator Satan has not ever got anything over on God and never will so when that wild horse rider rode out when the seal will open God already had a white church on the earth he already had Abel standing on the earth he already had Adam standing on the earth but Satan comes out and says I'm just as good as rest up I'm just as good as they are I what's wrong with my church you know it's like accident Baptists the other day says why don't you in the Methodist why don't you show up churches I said when you get to heaven you're gonna have a Baptist City in the Methodist city and the Pentecostal city I take y'all can't get along down here and he giggled and walked off because he knew because I said why don't you accept Martin Luther's doctrine because you are Baptists so you split you saw why we go together yeah but you get down start talking my doctor that's what happened right here denomination and no denomination this is the two spirits that we're dealing with right now and I'm not saying I didn't say denomination and message so there's this much denomination in this message is when they was right here cuz look they'll kill you in the name of this message you don't believe what they believe you'll know those laws under a man property God said it's not killing the man physically now it's killing them what spiritually that's worse that's worse but watch this verse eight so now Cain's on his high horse in other words Cain's on his white horse the wild horses come out and he is not going to give it up he thinks he's right when that wild horse rode out in that first church age what he thought he was right but Paul already said before he died he said Grievous wolves are coming and are already even John says they're already here they're among you why because there was a white righteous church already on the earth a man then he comes Satan comes behind him riding with all these powers that were given to him listen no one gives God power but Satan has to be given power right if we'll ever understand that we might can talk about death and how it's destroyed and Cain talked with Abel his brother now watch now we see remember when lust is conceived now a conception is an act you sit down and talk about a plan but then the conception of the plan is if you're thinking about it you're getting ready to implement the plan so you come and you see the conception know what and Cain talked with Abel now what's the next color of the next horse that's going to ride what's the next color red blood and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him whatever here's doctrine that began with now it's coming to more into fruition because Cain is not letting it stop he's continually letting it go on when lust is conceived at red horse rider what was it the property guard said he went out what killing with a what a sword what is the sword the word Satan was given a word actually Satan took God's Word and just added one to it Satan took God took God's Word and perverted it so the next horse is read the conception we run through these real quick then I had a couple of questions I want to stop here just saying I had a couple of questions on the Genesis 1:26 man some of you not really understanding it and that's okay it's kind of complicated till you really get to understand it but I want to do next Sunday brother Prakash's coming so the next Sunday if you have any questions about the Genesis 1:26 and the fall of today will answer some questions so if you have questions write them down give them to me giving a brother Dale because I want to get that Genesis 1:26 man if we get that thing right then I believe it's it's what we're missing even though we have it even though we have it I don't know that we know what we have fully know what we have call that so Genesis 1:26 man never died never sinned and it's inside of us what are we doing God is trying to unbind it and we're trying to wrap it back up just like this right here God is trying to give Cain a time to repent he's giving Cain time to think about what you're doing son think about what you're doing because you're fixing that what you're fixing to go all the way into death you're fixing tool all the way into darkness where you'll never come out of it again because remember the mark that was put on Cain was the mark of the beast right you want to know where the marker be started Cain right down there to bottom let me go through this real quick then we'll back up but remember the second horse rider was what red blood brother Brown says Cain come to the point he said either God either take it or leave it now what about where did that spirit come from but do you know what in that second part of that of that red horse going out to the through the ages that coming up into the Dark Ages that's what the Catholic Church was doing that said you either take our denomination or we're going to kill you sixty-eight million Christians were killed by the Catholic Church and they admit it property guard said no telling how many more millions by their doctrine amen so that horse is starting he's riding he has now he's in the conception stage and then now watch verse 11 and now art thou cursed God said we're getting to the place where now where you're not coming back now art thou cursed what's the third horse rider what was Black Death the third horse rider now art thou cursed from the earth which opened up her mouth when lust has conceived it brings forth sin sin is the separator now art thou cursed in other words Cain you have send away your day'll grade denominations you have send away your day of grades I tell them how about if you see a man al old man from Kentucky that can't hardly speak a word in English he walks up in front of the denominational world he's preaching to five or ten thousand people and you know it's not so bad if we sit here and say that that the Father Son Holy Ghost doctrine came from the pits of hell go over there and tell that Baptist Church that only a prophet would know now look the people didn't the doctrine came from the pizza head the doctrine not the people the doctrine but watch now watch though dr. King if you'll do good you can be a label but Cain's problem is he keeps going in the other direction so there's a day where God winked at the ignorance of the father son Holy Ghost baptism of the Trinitarian God in three persons which is it's not even sensible because the person is the personality personality an individual individual person so you got three guards there is no three God there's one God amen and he's the creator he's the Christ he's a son of God he's the son of man he's a son of David he's the father son Holy Ghost one man amen that's what Cain couldn't see Cain's doctrine kept carrying him away it took him to the pits of hell because what he didn't do he didn't stop when lust has conceived it brings forth sin when sin is what finished when it comes to the finality and we're going to see right here real quick and maybe we'll come back to this again but watch in verse 16 Cain went out from the presence of the Lord what's the fourth horse rider The Pale Horse which is what eternal separation from God because God didn't cast Cain out Cain went out Cain let that was his whole problem he said I'm right and God you're wrong so the pale horse rider is what white red and black mixed together mates pale horse all of that doctrine of Cain and everything came did and everything that God tried to do for Cain culminated it right here when sin is finished it brings forth death Cain cannot come back never will come back we know in the mind of God he didn't know if wasn't going to come back but Cain didn't know that now let's read this one quote we'll stop right here revelation to Jesus Christ will we've read this before now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation show how that Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes Satan revealing his words now what happened Satan got into Cain and it's been hit it's all we see it but the world don't see it they all think they're right you say brother you think you're right we're closer to the fruits has ever been we had close to the fruits as anybody's ever been no we are all exactly right but we're getting there God come down one day and looked at you just like you did Cain he said look if you don't turn around sin lives at your door death lives at your door if you don't turn around so you got a choice Cain had a choice we see people say well Cain didn't have a choice in the mind of God Cain didn't have a choice but in the mind of God the only reason Cain didn't have a choice it's caused by foreknowledge God saw that he choose that I don't know what I could ever say that again but but that was good the first time that's all right that's why we take these things but really foreknowledge is he foreknew Jacob have I loved how could he condemned he saw when he wasn't even born yet in the mind of God he was condemned because god looked down sometime and said he saw you're a rascal you're just like Cain so you're mark and then it exposes Satan revealing his words attempting destruction of God's people look Satan is very religious he's not trying to discredit God by being a prostitute or a drug dealer or you understand what I'm saying if Satan can get me and you he's got it but he can't and then because of the foreknowledge of God he saw that somebody would want it and would be here to receive it and when God come down one day and said don't be like Cain today Moses stood there one day and so did Joshua said choose you this day whom serve that's what God said to Cain he said choose you this day now here say now Cain bless your heart you'll be okay no he said sin lives at your door today you'll either be the master of sin or it'll be the master of you and it became the master of came because of the choice that he made and then all right let's read isten we'll be done it exposes Satan revealing his worst attempts to destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word that's what Satan did in the beginning right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire hey listen he don't give up when God's getting ready to kick him over in the lake of fire he's still going I can't win this is heart you can't get saved that's his problem that's why I can't win he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation Rota of the true church and what she is what she stands for and what she can do and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the to spirit within the framework of the Christian Christian Church right there's a bar bother you just going to a bar bother you I go to bars all the time all the ones I want to go to I eat candy bars I love almond joys you thought somebody drinking did you don't do that till I do I drink all I want to I curse all I want to I run around all I want to but that want to left me alone coming home so I don't want to do it the more I did it one time but God came by one day and said two spirits two spirits today has been giving you an opportunity choose you this day which one you'll serve now in lesson though we can go through remember I taught that scripture when lust is conceded it keeps get when lust is listen God forbid don't get me wrong lust is not a killer got it listen foe we're human you don't lust now like you used to know but when lust has conceived it brings forth sin when sins finished it brings forth death right what came done is he didn't have anything in him to stop him in that process you and I had something called predestination by foreknowledge god I tell them this morning God give you an angel to stay with you from the time you were born to whatever day it is you may not to realize that but you know what if you were a seed childhood garden so I saw one day he'd come to you and say accept me or reject me and you accepted him it's like King David King David knew that when God through Samuel said David you will be the king of Israel and I don't believe David got the big hair but I believe David kind of walked around he didn't walk out in the middle I 85 I'm standing the middle of the road he didn't tempt God but he knew one thing was for sure they wouldn't know little or big Goliath going to bother him that's why he walk and he listened I've seen about this stage they have a song about the 10,000 warriors that was thousands of Israelites not just one day Venus brothers there was thousands standing here cowering down to one man and he was big listen you take 50 people the bigger they are the harder they fall you could take 50 or 75 even 100 people why don't they just rush and jump all over that man kill him they were scared fear had gripped them because they didn't know what would happen once they got down there but David said look I'm going to be king of Israel I'm going to be the king of Israel and I believe what my prophet said hello somebody I believe what my prophet said I believe the Bible told us in Revelation 5 we're going to be kings and priests and we're going to rule and reign on the earth what in the world is that man down there running his mouth well he was absolutely cadei vyd nothing David look right through him to a throne you and I have got a little right food death to a throne amen look here's the part right here we got to do and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely Florida today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it and with true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it against us but we will prevail over them

extremely privileged to be able to look at that Seventh Seal book because remember no one was worthy to even look at it so if you can't look at you can't read it but by Jesus Christ dying taking the book and open it and then the one that wrote the book comes down inside of you with the book open amen then there's your open book you are the open book you are then you are now the recipient you're the recipient of the seals being broke and then because I was telling them downstairs you know we're going through the seals if I'm saying if if the property God broke those seals I'm saying it for you if the property God broke those seals that did never when he whipped the top off of that pyramid and look down he said light had never shown Outlook it wasn't that the words were something different he just said light hadn't shined on those because you remember you can't add can add to the Bible and can't take away from the Bible had to be something that was a hidden mystery well why didn't a rapture take place that Sunday night when the seals were preached because he said you're not getting it in other words those people with their ideas I said ideas I didn't say denomination but with their ideas you know what they did they closed it back up that book was right there where they could grab it and their ideas closed it right back up sealed it up property God said it's not even for you he said but right around the coming of the Lord I think we're here don't you think don't you think that those things had been that had been hidden that no man no man has known you thank Cain and Abel do you think even Abraham Abraham I don't believe Abraham was sitting there one day and he's like man six thousand years from now they gonna be talking about me he just went through life he knew he was a little bit special because God spoke to him but he I believe he uh he didn't wake up one morning to go I'm the father of the face my man my name is gonna be written in a book forever no he doesn't realize what do you do brother Brown said those people just lived their life was led by the Lord lived their life and then now you look I mean Hebrews eleven studying a little bit now there's what there's the faith the you and I when Abraham come to the date of where Abraham said god I can't do it I can't physically produce this child I'm done I'm washed up I'm finished I'm dead and God said no no I knew that when you first started but I wanted you to realize that that's right man say you know Moses Moses was his choice from the beginning of the world but Moses didn't know he was the choice in begin the world but what did Moses do Moses worked into a place to write the five books of the Bible so I think he maybe knew that he had a little place somewhere but I think the bride of Jesus Christ I think like Leo said in the in the quote when she realizes the two spirits in the framework of the church what's our problem now we don't know we do we listen we do know the two spirits but sometimes remember they're so close till they'll almost deceive the very leg what's going to have to happen is is it's going to have to do this it's going to have to come to a separate in time where you got to know that you know that you know I'm telling you people it's coming to the day where we if we don't know I mean by revelation not just know if we don't know by revelation what this Bible talking about we're dead people we're dead people we got to know what this Bible says and get a revelation of the two spirits in the framework of the church Abel and Cain started in the garden you know where it's going to end up back in the garden but what's going to happen when we go back to that garden they was a second Adam took my place and there's not a Cain spirit going to go back in that garden he took and wiped out away when he died at Calvary he wiped that cain spirit away you saw no it's still here yeah still here because you just said it was did you what you see what you just did he took that away well I am still here it's still here well because then it must be in you a fish still here and man so let's start saying I'm redeemed by love divine glory glory Christ is mine all to him I now reason I have been I have been renamed oh I'm ready my love divine all gold ring glory Christ is my [Applause] [Music] I now reside oh I have been I have been redeemed they
