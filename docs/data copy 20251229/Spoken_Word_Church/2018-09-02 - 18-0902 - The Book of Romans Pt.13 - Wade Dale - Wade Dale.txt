========================================

let's see vitamin C coconut or something mara no oh I'm sorry let's have a little of freedom from you now same age okay alright so now let's get weird little skimpy today but that's okay alright Roman thing we started Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation for them in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the blogosphere the life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh forced him condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now Paul says walk not after the flesh we have to walk in the flesh cuz we we are flashing on all right but yielding because you got to put some Scripture together what policy is yielding your members the things that would not I knew that now it wasn't it fall with the drop again the drinks everyone you know you understand this there's some things though that he does in his flesh that he doesn't like there's all things we do in our flesh we don't like right there taking up but it's not our flesh that doesn't it's the spirit realm which one does it is that motivator of this one does so don't get hung up where he says who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit you go into the indwelling man Bob study was good lacks not living the time it was wrong it was so we had a pretty good crowd big mover got a crowd one here we got a pretty good crowd but but you walk out of the spirit that spirit is the Holy Spirit inside your soul that's not a spirit realm like the memories and constant affection imagination because we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the thing that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh now listen we all mind think of the flesh we got it this morning then to eat we had drink because you go bathroom you know simple thing so Paul's not saying that he's not saying we for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they have the spirit things of the Spirit so we just you know we've we've seen the doctrines of sinless perfection and like free list oh my trying to stop the aging you know you just can't do that so but we do walk in the flesh but what does in our flesh there's what something worrying there's the spirit and the soul man warring with each other all right so that's where that is because look he brings it all the where it's at for it to be carnally in other words even safer to be flexible and you know to be carnally minded is that to the carnal mind is enmity because the carnal mind is enmity against God and with these divisions separation so that's what separated atoms from God is when the first thing out said we'll talk about it upstairs this afternoon we'll be touched on it last night about Saint had to air Yves will appear first this is the most important loomed of this act that happened afterwards was in the flesh but she had accepted in her spirit rent nourish all that's where you go and not in her soul she was eternal in soul because she added that the osmium that Genesis 1:26 man inside of her but that middle realm memory the conservation imagination Satan knew he could get to that and that's when he played on he didn't play on her flesh he got hurt what the womb of her mind the woman of her mind is the first thing Satan touched the same thing with you and I the woman of our mind is the first thing that Satan touches you right right for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be zero man what the world's going on here it's not subject to the law of God the law of God has nothing to do with your brain and the very men it's what's in there okay it's what's in there that motivates that i stinkin last night we were talking about revelation and the peter james and all them that were walked with Jesus you know and then they come to the face of the father's day the Holy Ghost quickened what they hell now the Holy Ghost quick and something in Peter maybe they didn't quickening James we're still individuals we're all individuals in the body of Christ I can't say because Bob came into message two years after I did he's two years behind me there's no such thing no such thing why because God doesn't work that way God can work in just a few hours what man is tried to work in even brother Graham told us you know he said God doing one year but theologist has tried to do in 2000 all right so that's what he's doing now I think he's he's causing us to number one and understand what we're doing here is who we are what we're doing here and that the evil thoughts we have in our mind hello did not come from the inward man the deep man it came from that law of the carnal mind that when Adam said I was afraid no fear they never entered into Adam before now remember he was the son of God yet he has no fear in his soul you have no fear control if you're born again if you're not born again it is fair period is fair all right for it is not so much the vlog on neither indeed can be all right so it cannot be subject to the law of God it's enmity it is totally contrary like I said before we must realize we are contrary to God when we go to sleep eat get a bit of things of life that's totally contrary to garden garden wants to be this way not this way right here no way you do not want us to come this way but we did so we must accept that and then let him work through it that's what Paul's telling us he said look be carnally minded the enmity against God but it's not sensible log-on neither they can be watched so then they are that in the flesh cannot please God in other words all the fleshly things that we did motivated by the spirit or not kind please God but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if big word yes so be that the Spirit of God dwells in you now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his what will come about last night with the adoption at all is violence now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of it and Christ being you of the body is dead but the sin we must realize that we must realize that your body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because the processes now Christ being in the body is dead we're dying suppose being real playing here uses look if you're in the flesh you're not but the spirit of life is life because the process does what this is his whole summation right here but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead he just was dead the body was they had dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies now he's coming down he's talking about flesh of their flesh that fresh fish fish fish flesh flesh you watch right here mortal body that's not what he was talking about up at the top sure he was how much a mortal body was telling something working through your warm body this is telling you right here if you have that same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead now what happened when that spirit come back into Jesus's body you clean it it made eternal right we don't see stuff maybe this afternoon maybe next Sunday there's one thing Jesus took with him that he didn't send back on with a pink on one thing everything else he sent back he did not send back the gourd my body he did not send back the body change he sent us the ability but he did not send us the body change back with him on that Pentecostal didn't know budging he sent the Son of God the spirit guide to burn their soul out but his soul in and them live a Christian life that's not what's going to happen to me unless you pass on the with which in the great we're going to come to a place to where that that same Jesus it's now here and in your body the Son of Man which is God in human flesh that's what we have at the end time Paula didn't even see that he saw it coming he knew the tail because right here he's telling you he that raised up Christ in the dish you're equipping your mortal body that he never saw that he's actually waiting in the sixth dimension for that mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh wife we live after the flesh you shall die but in either the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live in other words do I ain't like we'll come back you know getting rid of those things dead will read some scripture tonight or this afternoon original quote for brother Randall talked about being David but we're still on for sale which is called death for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear now see you didn't that's what you live under and his brother is upstairs but he sent me up you know that's right that's right that's what I was gonna be he sent me a message about that and make it pretty pretty full family have that little poets come along now that little boy to come up with all them kids running around he wrote simply profound brother wait I've really been enjoying this unnecessary notebook Romans one particular comment you may send you stroke me very profound I downloaded the audio but I've not went back to listen Frankie you say something about the reason we fear is because we don't know what will happen in our situation I thought about that and that is exactly true the whole reason I was so fearful about Ivan when she was so close to dying it's simply because I did not know that she was going to live I specifically remember thinking that the Lord would just give me some daughter scripture quote just some kind of comfort or consolation that you're going to be okay this you will not die I would have not been afraid no matter how much you got the only thing kept telling me the Lord kept telling me to do is not fear regardless of the outcome in every situation of life in which I was afraid it was because I did not know what the outcome would be right now one of them what what about would the Bible give us this to say fear not is telling us exactly what did not fear okay he knows every single situation I'm sorry that is what comforts me so much about knowing the Lord is that he knows every situation single situation that we're facing or will face and he knows exactly the outcome for that there can be no fear in him and should not be enough thank you so much really but that's true yes that's reasonably fair but if we have come to a place where the seal go put the where all the mysteries are open that we know where we came from what we're doing here where we're going where's the fear in that where's the fear in that where you going well I don't know where we're going yeah we come tell us what we go through whet their comeback notice about Lois how sublime annow wonderful it is even if you pass away right but then there's another level that one's not gonna pass away he told us about that day so we've not received a pair the bondage again to fear that's what Satan wants to do and that's what he does in the spirit realm he keeps giving you the negative right he keeps giving you the negative ones to go you know the negative part of what while you can't do this you can't do that just tell him that maybe he can but if I got this period want to raise the music from Daddy don't carry me through the whole thing but say next one takes the fear out of the way is if you know where you came from we know what happened we know that when predestinate we know that before the foundation of the world God knew we'd come to this place wrote the Bible and now we got it right here to read three different men telling us what happened like I said last night I was thinking this week don't give us this great big lovely and to read it on the surface it is really nice but we got a prophet coming and Eliezer that told us so much about me Isaac that when we stop that when Rebecca saw Isaac she didn't need a sheet of paper right she didn't need a checklist well is he now he said he was in he know she lived off that camel and they was probably hundreds of people in that field and there was Isaac Eliezer had told her so much about him now Ellie's are dead run over let me that's right three's a crowd well he's aren't even going to tell em either right but he did his job he told her what do you look like what his character was and what he would do because he's over the whole time he told her it everything right and then she did something remember she did something single herself out maybe we'll get it a little bit later like them but she absolutely we have absolutely did now remember now listen to this so you put that into our situation Rebecca once leds are told so much about them about Isaac to Rebecca do you think she was afraid I wonder what he's gonna know she don't know affect him and she said he either has told me so much about you I feel like I'm not knowing you forever well that's the same way with with God we were lost we know that but we were always and always in the mind of God always in a month all right what do we do we come down here to develop the picture the Prophet said we come down here to develop the picture prove the same they got it's true that he knew us before the foundation of the world knew we'd be here and know where we're going so where is the fear the fear that we have is it like we were talking the other week if we don't know the outcome of things that's the whole thing make Spears we just don't know the outcome of thing but when you hone it down to a Christian life we don't know the outcome we just have got to believe what the outcome already is because LEDs are didn't write a new chapter about Isaac he told her what he already knew about okay he didn't write a whole so so brother Graham did come to write a book to write right a Bible but he did write 1,100 commentaries of what Isaac meant to him and means to us okay so that's the way it is the way I read it the way you should read it it's the level liquor part even in the Old Testament I've been reading in Ezekiel man go back to read Ezekiel again as easily get fall of little nuggets that means something to us you know you show us a Old Testament they were given for our example all right Isaiah Ezekiel some of those went down for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear how in the world can you be born again and been bodies now the only bondage were in is step back out to them to the next cubicle we were taught last night to the next box the memories unconscious that's where the fear is there's no fear in your new birth because there's no fearing died and died in your soul there's no fear later so where's the fear the fear is in that filter in between Satan out here talking to you and God in here competition okay there's where the fear is for we have not received the spirit excuse me the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption now that's what we're talking about last night we received the spirit of adoption now we're not adopted totally given the key given the checkbook when we first morning in know we're a new spirit babe in Christ a baby right and we then what grow up but look you got to be adopted into the family remember I read that and I'll pull it back up and we'll run it off where the commentator that's just not even the message this is just a commentator from our comments from a man that wrote a article about adoption because adoption was not to Israel in Israel never they just I'm sorry Israel adopted this from the Greeks and the Romans but what I read last night which is real profiling the guy said the guy said well excuse me you come into the family if you're born into the you know you didn't know that what you might know exactly the boy but basically when he said he said you get what you get when you have a baby you get what you get run but when you adopt somebody you already know their character you know what's coming you know what those people are so even in Roman times they could do later disown their own children for being disobedient but they couldn't disown the adopted child because they knew what they were getting when they about you know in man a same way with God he knew when he was getting that is good and I just came for my nominal God that I'll pull the article up and them on a PDF and let you look let you reach out to pass it out but you got him a good deep revelation of more in some preachers than domestic have about adoption but you received the spirit of adoption anybody that's born again it's just like he said you were in another family family of the devil right you were in another family you were adopted from that family into this family okay and he can't take you sent you back to that family once he adopts you into this family now he can have disobedient children that don't make it to adoption but he can't disown the ones he adopt so we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry and that word would be day to day her father father all right and only babies cry if I brother I'm Coney Pentecostal babbling baby gonna cry now babies cry but when you grow up oh yeah we may we may cry because of our kids but I don't any dark background becomes with kids remember all him that's when he said why just repent from making mankind remember the Bible says any side where I just really repent from mainland right what about God repent and that's what the Bible says and we know it's not exactly the way it is with us but but he didn't do anything wrong he just you know what I guess he knew what what I know he knew what was coming but when he happened he's like but it still surprises me might be but it surprised me but he just got aggravated with man we will figure out one day that God just more of a human than we ever have men I mean his emotions and all he's not a God with no emotion he's not a god with no laughter he's not a God with no you don't get stood up around the throne you know a little office tattoo you know he has emotion I repented from making man I was angry my anger was kindled he said yeah okay so I'm just telling you what's positive and Jesus planted a rope grow some people out of the temple we did that then kick us out man but it needs to be done all right so we've received the spirit of adoption not adoption so we haven't give the car keys to the kid okay we've been through this relevé of preached it's not preached it for years and years and years three stages of adoption right you gotta have a new birth to even be considered in adoption so you receive the spirit of adoption because my brother Nell said a wonderful quote but Keith Reed users at all time God will not adopt the devil v so he won't adopt the devil children and it's not that he don't care about them is that they don't care about him I mean God's compassion he cares about everybody when he knows he has one thing first if I was done now hearing down for the whole world but I know there's only a certain group that's good that's gonna exactly except what I be in all the other billions are just here for walking around you my brother Rams a cannon fire I would hate that that would be something I would but that's nothing we're God we go you know the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God now if you have a spirit of adoption if you're born again your the children of God now you may be like the brother Ramsay they went and served God all them years and he what happened to brother Ramsay is he got an evil spirit on this spirit now that happens to all of us some of its drinking you you can and your demon okay you know man your name I yeah although it's name your demon that's what this is for this is to get rid of that okay but that brother Ramsay a born-again Christian preacher gets the spirit only goes and drinks beer says I'm finished I'm done but you know what God did got brought him home well he was a disobedient child he was a mature Christian he ended a statue of a perfect man he would be doing that but being an immature Christian you still Christian Rembrandt see God took him home did not March name so he's gonna do the same thing with anybody is a spirit can get on you I promise you I promise you if you haven't you're in for a surprise ya know I say my hair because you know what the very demon that tells you everyday that you're not a Christian where do that it's in your spirit realm it's not your soul if you're born again it's alive but when it comes out here he makes it sound so good when you did this you you know it goes from listing things he's the good things a good listener you know in the LRV still always telling the truth but the truth that he's telling is the latter okay because what stands are you talking about him God standing over here and he's accusing us and gods going what do you know about don't remember I don't know that there's so much the devil brings things up but we bring it up we have our own self sure the devil you know what'll happen this is what will happen like with that brother Randy I think I'll go this way since I feel glad to go this way you he probably didn't say when I'm just gonna block drink beer I'm done I'm finished no he probably sat down one day and said you know what the people in my church can I tell Joe you know lobster's honey you need to get up go to church today he's ain't going to turn bunch of hypocrites and liars she said honey you gotta go to church he said she said yes you do you're the Bassman so maybe that was he sat down one day I only just you know was just going that freedom she just you know what that opens the door and then you what you let it fester and you let it you let it go and you let it roll it and finally you know what he says he's is fully I'm done with I'm going to still get drowned and forget about you know try to drown my sorrows watch what he did guys I mean thanks to what it did I don't think he just one day was preaching in the pulpit in next mighty morning he goes in I know it was some ongoing something that carried on maybe months but once he decided to do that God said well you can't do that bill a child you got to come on home that's what brother Ron said thank God for a prophet to tell us because if we were looking at it come on peopling we were looking at it from the outside we would say that man lost right but brother brown said no he was a son of God he was a child of the devil so we must be careful the spirits they have been witness with our spirit that we are the children of God all right so we're born again in a family with children God we are in the line of adoption now all right because we're not the devil's kids anymore God has adopted us Eastman I will talk about this after then we're the old the old and what got me yesterday was was Anna talking about even in natural adoption the two that she's adopted they have all new birth certificates just like Anna birth them in her garter yes they're total hold back life is done if you pull a birth certificate they were born to Anna Roberts and Richard Roberts at this hospital at this time I told my life and I see you've been busy you had babies in freedom hospital they asked her at bread or things thank you right now through all of you but they asked our city to live at this address then we got put down that grace you lived in when you yep so I pulled a quote from the invisible Union where brother Brown says almost the exact same thing but he's not coming to birth certificate he said your old Union has been done away with so in other words right now being standing here I can see that my birth didn't come from Peggy and Samuel Dale in Gainesville hopper with Hall County Hospital back then call Kenny Hawksbill on January 26 1960 that was my natural part I've been separated from that now my new birth have a birthday time well the Uni same brother 17 1998 the union of their natural parents is gone yes yes true well yes justice you know what programs say God put it in the sea of forgetfulness so he's not even remember that you Meredith Big Mac that you sorry he don't even remember that you were born forgetfulness he will not remember either that's what you don't know what you got remember month what women I think that's the time and I'm them don't even remember and these kids did not remember all that seven years that Thomas lived hey that's that's God you know Union just like games they just like the mom and dad never don't know that moment they never guessed it I just said it just wasn't my mile and I think that God can't remember something that's what he said oh my god we mean you know did brother Brahim say if someone's forgiven for something if you bring it back up it's on you yes ways that's covered by the blood that's why I said when people come up to the prayer line he said if they if they confess that he said it's under the blood he can't pull it out or he can't see it and God can't see it anymore see that's what we government to me the in town now here we are that we know where we came from what we're doing in where we're going there's no bad news medicines Pentecostal don't stand in a pulpit today and tell you and can be able to track your genealogy and your lineage sure you go to church in them then they go Baptist today and they say ok you were saved God come in and filled you with this spirit and now you're Christian than your little Christian life well that's about all you're here yeah right that's about all you hear you don't hear that that whole thing that you did is dead thank God can bring about that but so looking at it is afternoon because I'm going to bring a little bit about adoption because remember like we were talking that last night in that force field that we're in now you have to come to a full stature you have to come to adopt in you have to come to a resurrection and embody change all in that fourth seal because we're going after that so we must cover like today we're going to cover spiritual death part two but I was thinking this morning you know the mere resurrection that has to be thing you can't resurrect a live person that's why Jesus said I am the resurrection he's coming from me that's why then I got to thinking a little bit more see show me all the more sleep second service - I'm going to email so and that's why I got to it back with it God took back when he said I am the resurrection and the life he took that with it because there's nobody been resurrected to eternal life until the end I know I but who was he he was the son man that man standing there listen I am the resurrection and the life at that moment was the Son of Man but his body had not been changed yet but when he came out of that tomb and he said all power pay attention so we got a stand in our natural dead body in our natural getting old body and saying that's the only way you can get them dead Saints out of the ground because remember the Bible says we which are alive and remain shut off prevent or hinder those which are asleep the dead in Christ shall rise Jesus was dying in his body when he said when he said out of the resurrection his body was not and he looked fifty years ago right right so that proves that it can happen because he called Lazarus out of the grave being standing in a dead body but now when he come out of the grave he said all power in heaven and earth been giving them to me in other words this thing has no more hole this thing has now been glorified because I always had a problem with me standing in a dead body and be preaching the word and all of a sudden the resurrected Saints come walking in the door because of not me but because of what we believe in preached all over the world it'll be a worldwide resurrection okay so it'll be a worldwide sweeping to me a worldwide revival inside of us to be able to bring somebody down out of the ground God change your body and me be standing in a dead body I never understood that go the extra or their last night or this morning sometime when I pulled that scripture of the Jesus said I am the resurrection in LA he told mark then he said I don't know resurrection in the life well he was standing there who looks 50 years old when he won the 30 he was dying he was tired he wet so that's exactly see he's our example everything he does is an example what we're gonna go through because he's coming back I'm sorry he is back to do what he didn't finish he didn't send each member of the brown State remember well around 7 when he left he was bent he's got to finish it in the bride because he didn't bring all the Saints out of the ground he didn't even have a sanctum ran out of rent hello not one in the kingdom he did say what no I am to Kingdom till the bed Bangkok okay so so you're saying and this body doing what happened we're going to speak the resurrection and the dead Saints are going to come out of the ground about what we know go out to the tournament oh hey come on family it's not gonna be like a device you see a pile of dirt no it's a secret so they're just gonna hey is that body if that real body of theirs is in the six dimensions which is their salt that's the real you this thing down here is already rotted pretty much and some of them it's already gone back to the dust and ain't even a casket if some of them got to eat behinds and blah blah blah you understand but that body is going to come back into this dimension and that thing's gonna come right back ever okay the angle we know cloudy barely know you know and they're not gonna be going actually they're not believe they're going to know that before we do I just believe that I believe they're in that seeks to mention them they're moving closer to that wall because they'll feel the pole will speed that brother better sitting down slow down there you go how easy but it's already written this is the logo all right but you got to be adopted first you gotta get into the family before any of this can happen we talked about this all you won't talk about but if you're not a family dodging under math all right spare to self bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children and we'll finish around here and then we'll get back for Sunday know won't be here that Sunday you got anything right no you won't be here next Sunday look at somebody yeah I'm leaning over love them men then me and my brother we want them all out one of oh I'll have you follow me look and if children my children then heirs heirs of God why because you receive him and join heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also that we may also be what go I fight together okay those who he is justified you got to finish this Romans angled all the way to that scripture that says those who is justified is already glorified you not I get it which 130 Artie one more time Terry we did that's the whole summation of 1 through 29 but you got to go through these things you've got to go through them you know 1 because we're children were babies babies have to have structure what we were from about last night you know you can you can take little night sermons and throw my favorite brother rounds and say here they are there's no structure in their structure is a man standing in the pulpit and going laying it out we got it we are what we're doing here [Music]
