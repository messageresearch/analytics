bandam tells us that we are the blood by the Spirit by the spirit of God dwelling inside of us it makes us the Blood Cuz you know what people going to get saved Because Of You the Bible says whatever you say if you've done it to the least of my little ones you've done it unto me so salvation comes through the bride amen amen that's why that we that's why that we come to church we we try to get rid of all the junk that we've got out in the world and we try to uh try I say we all try to be Godly as much as we can but you got to remember like I've been trying to tell you you're trying to put something so high that you can't attain to and you can't like the song says this is all my righteousness it just goes so far yeah all right but the blood of Jesus Christ if we'll give it to him let him cover you eradicate it take it away and let the father do it let the Daddy clean you up by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the whole thing is we saying today we just got to realize we either we got it or we don't you just got you got to come to that in the quietness of your home or in church or somewhere you got to know that you know that you know that you're born again cuz if you're not born again you just you're not going to be there I'm just sorry you just not just you're going to fall off somewhere okay the Bible tells us is what you know what in other words what do we doing we can't even keep up with the foot shoulders when the when the horses are coming so we got to get ready to where we can fly with the Infantry we can go with the we can go with the calvary amen so that's the same with us uh the acceleration of the word ought to be to where that we're like man we're on the edge we're just on the verge of something we're on the verge of breaking through something somewhere because you know what it's got to happen it's got to happen and it's going to happen to a group of people we might as well just say it's us amen like I said this morning we got to have a Doctrine every church has got a Doctrine all right our Doctrine is that you got to come to the Statue of perfect man to be a walking walking breathing instrumentality of God to be what God wants you to be you got to go up that statue of perfect man you got to fight for for virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and you know what God's then pleased to adopt you um let's listen to him Minister not too long ago and and it's okay to roll the new birth in with adoption but remember brother said it's two different things your birth and your adoption is two different things amen it's just like the saved and and and and uh born again you can be saved not be born again but you can't be born again and not be saved well same way with the um with what we just said you there's just you can't be adopted without being born again but you can be born again without being adopted all right but that's going to put you in a place to where you're not you're going to be unfulfilled you're going to have an unfulfilled Christian life and you're not going to take the body change you're going to have to go by the grave so brother Dale taught us that for years and years and years all right so it's nothing new so happy Father's Day again brother Louis will be speaking Wednesday night remember Bob and Louise coming back from speaking and all the ones on vacation uh Anna and Richard and Aaron and Sarah different ones they on vacation and Geor and Danny forgot about that this morning they're on vacation uh remember the prayer meeting and on the 24th that's just coming Saturday at 7:00 getting ready for the July meeting which will be July the 1st and 2nd at 5:00 and then next the next day at 9:45 regular service on Sunday uh only one service though to be catered brother juul forny and brother Mike ult will be with us that weekend remember July 14 15 and 16 uh I've kind of got a little uh uh brother Joe's working on itinerary but uh we're going to need 14 or 15 rooms and some will some will um come together some of the singles and stay in the same room but we're going to try to get it rooms for the couples that are married um try to get you a regular room so we we're working on that so just pray for us that we get that done um we appreciate your precip precipitation we pre we appreciate the precipitation Lord thank you for the rain but participation would be a little bit different thank you for your participation we've got about 51 signed up now so U but make sure that if you're if if you're on that list but something happened you can't go you need to let me know all right because I we're getting um the rooms together and all that so and then remember um the church will be paying for your motel room but you'll be required to get your own way up there and get your way back and any meal that's outside of H the camp or with Camp the youth service that we're having on Saturday Fellowship on Friday we're going to have a service on Saturday then service on Sunday and then we're going to eat at The Farmer's Daughter which will be right immediately after that so we appreciate brother Dale letting us go and and paying for the rooms so we really appreciate that cuz I mean the rooms are expensive they're going to be you know couple hundred bucks a piece so for for per night so but we're trying to get the best rate we can and we're working on that now so just keep us in prayer all mind's clear everything good and remember July 29th we may have that worship service on Saturday uh working on that too so that's just tentative that'll be the last Saturday of this month of July man this year's gone by you know that so just remember that and remember also that um the September youth meeting that's why I announce these three or four months in advance but it doesn't seem to help because you forget about it but brother Andrew Glover will be here September third Saturday in September for our youth service on that Saturday and he'll be with us on that Sunday but that'll be our next youth service besides the one in July that's going to be up there and then we won't have one in August we have one in September so just remember that and camp meetings coming up in August we already got some people calling wanting to come and and Minister but Keith Reed will be here that week uh after and brother Jason Jackson's going to be with us that that month and probably some others that have already said they were coming and we're going to try to go to camp meeting if you'd like to go let me know and uh we get together all right so just remember that that's it brother Joe greens happens every year first week in August of every year so all mind's clear all right let's pray Lord thank you so much for what you've give us you've just Heap blessings on top of us Lord help us to realize that you have supplied our needs and not our wants and Lord our needs are are many but you said you would bring us out of every one of them if we just give it to you father today we give oursel to you Lord we give this congregation to you Lord we give everything that we have Lord that we can hear from you father songs have been sung the the different requirements that we have of tithing and taking up offering different or singing Lord they've all been taken care of now I pray Lord that we'd be all attentive and listen today Lord to what you have to say to us father we ask you to be the ones that are sick be with the ones that are not with us Lord that you'll bring them back into the fold especially the ones Lord that are out and on vacation I'm sure they're traveling now be with brother Jeremiah and that group Lord as they're heading back toward uh Alabama Lord I pray that you'd be with the young people there father just bless each one forgive us of our sins in Jesus name we pray amen part 114 we'll get there sometime in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us you said brother wait I don't feel anything you know there probably days Jesus didn't feel like being God either hello cuz the Bible said he learned by the things he suffered and being made perfect he didn't just wake up and all of a sudden he didn't have a tooth AER all of a sudden he he never was hungry no the Bible talks about him being hungry and him being angry h a little frustrated Peter get behind me Satan don't be talking like that yeah yeah he's he ain't Mr lydy like the world thinks he is but he loved you enough to die for you that's What mattered all right in the beginning was the word where was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and now we're heading up statue of perfect man and besides this in other words beside your Born Again experience giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness brother kindness charity you may be seated the Lord is Blessing to the reading of his word I want us to understand that this is attainable brother Brown said we can do this he said listen if it's required then he G had to make a way for it to happen right all right if it's a requirement he had to make a way for us to to be not like God but to be God to be in His image to get back and we'll look at it just a few minutes that you know what we're getting back to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden were naked the whole time and had no issues brother Brown said they had a holy spirit Veil over their eyes what happened was as Eve walked out from under that Veil and give them the key of knowledge of Good and Evil to be able to know that they were naked and the first time they got out from under that where did they go they went in the B bushes and made them some fig leaves and that's what we've been doing ever since so what's God doing anything that man has done to to degrade or to fall God has reversed that process to go back CU We Were Made In His Image we were made in his likeness we're supposed to have dominion over the fish of the Sea and the foul of the air just like like Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden before the fall so everything that God's done from there to here is to roll that thing back to do what bring that Holy Ghost Veil back over our eyes again that's right cuz when we get to Glory guess what there won't be any sex there won't be any yeah brother Brown said you'll know who your wife was but there'll be no intimacy there'll be no like we we have now this is permitted not uh not the perfect will of God it's permitted how we got here but it's the only way once Adam and Eve crossed that line they couldn't get back so when they crossed that line God said okay I know you messed up but I'm going to make a way for you to get back all right the Holy Ghost has been taken away or taken off your eyes but I'm going to go back in the end time and I'm going to put it back on but now you got to remember though Satan had a veil also because remember at this age they're blind miserable naked and don't know it right so see as as God comes down Satan comes with it there's there's really he's just a copat so whatever God's doing he just tries to do the reverse right so really you should we should know his tactics that brother R said we should know his tactics and what he's up to well we do the only problem is is sometimes the that veil of Satan got on their eyes in the church ages and made a a trinity Veil made a a three God Veil or made a a baptism in father son Holy Ghost Veil and put it over their eyes of the people of the religious people not just over the world over the religious people and they took that as Doctrine as we were talking this morning but our Doctrine should be that we can do this we can make it somebody's going to let's just believe it's us amen let's just believe that God has put you in a place and me in a place unique place that not just that we preach and trying to get you emotionally built up I wish we could a lot of you wouldn't fall asleep like you do but we just don't do that here that means you got to fight you got to fight for every second you got to fight for every minute you got to say God give me something I need something we're not going to be running the rafters or running back of the pews and shouting and all that if you did then you'd pretty much stay awake and all of your other ones would stay awake be able to see what's going on well praise the Lord anyway Colossians 1 says and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked wor that's pre pre- New Birth all right everybody with me we always like to say BC before Christ all right so BC in our mind we were Wicked and even though you lived a Pure Life you were still Wicked CU you didn't have God if you don't have God you're Wicked yet now ha he reconciled in other words what I just like I said before whatever got lost he's going to reconcile it back all right and he saw a group of people that would be reconciled back and how they would be reconciled back then he would see a group of people M Believers unbelievers and True Believers he'd see them and he'd see who would and who wouldn't that's right and the body body of his flesh through death to present present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight all right now that's what God said about us when are we going to start saying that about us all right you know like brother jeel will probably say in a few weeks he'll say wowy wowy woo what get all that bucket mouth stuff I ain't this and I ain't that and I can't this and I can't that get the baptism of the Holy Ghost it will cause you to do something different if you're continuing in the same way do something different right get the new birth amen really get a relationship with Jesus amen don't ever forget that get a relationship with the Lord Jesus then he'll give you a relationship with the message of the hour I promise you that he'll give you a relationship and reveal to you that brother random was the prophet of the hour amen and not a false prophet Bible says if you continue in the faith grounded and settled that's the statue of perfect man because of what is a baby a baby falls a baby has to be picked up a baby has to be fed a baby has to be told what to do Christians shouldn't have to be told what to do it's like I like what that brother said the other day he said you C you don't you will never have to beg a Christian to come to church never never will you have to beg a Christian to come to church when I say what I do it means you're not a Christian if you don't come to church all the time if you just decide to come when you need to uh sorry want to if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel listen this is the only hope I got I hope it's the only hope you got I hope you had put your Hope on something else to get you to heaven I hope you have why you sitting here today you have a hope of the Gospel that something's going to to spark in your life amen something going to spark in you not in your neighbor not in your husband or your wife in you something's going to spark in you it's going to take you up higher spark in you take you up higher spark in you take you up higher you can't sit here 30 40 years and be the same not on the pickle like you used to be and I don't know what a bump on a pickle for so that's about useless as you can get right sister Rebecca that's about useless I bump on a pickle I don't know what it's for gets in my way well I guess it's something hold on to so you can handle it he eat hey don't let me forget I'm bringing some pickles to the thing I got to bring get some pickles I've been I've been pickle wanting today so anyway you know what a pickle is right it's a cucumber that never goes back that's what US US is yeah we're changing we can't go back once the pickling process happens we can't be a a cucumber no more we're a pickle now we might look like a cucumber right and we may still have bumps on us if you go through the pickling process you become a pickle and we like pickles be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard you can't say I have not heard and which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereby I Paul and made a minister I I just would just love for a moment just sit and and watch Paul work like in the Corinthians he knows that they're having ey he knows that they're they're drinking at the Lord's table he knows the certain things that they're doing yet he's sitting there as a master builder he called himself a master builder he sits there as a master Craftsman and he's sitting there and he's he's you know sawing off the bumps to make that Corinthian Church into an Ephesian church cuz he you know he had both he had churches in coren which were Corinthians which were P much raw Heathen then he had a church in Ephesus he didn't have to go see every once in a while he' go see them once every two or three years and it'd be good because they were established settled and they were what that that was God was working with these virtues I believe in their life and there was only 12 of them right who now rejoice in my suffering for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body s which is the church wherefore I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery when you say this word mystery then that means it's not common all right there's a mystery there there's something that's hidden that's previously hidden that's now been made known as brother R said the mystery has now been history because the book's open there's always a wonderful mystery but once that mystery is made known once you see the movie whatever you want to put in there once you've seen the end of it there's no mystery to it anymore it's that AA moment you go ah oh that's what it is I like brother Russ dunker you you know he's from Minnesota and you know he talks like a Yankee but bless his heart he'll get converted one day but um you start talking to him about the word of God and he's only been in the message several years you know brother John and he and you start talking to him and he doesn't you know you talk to some people and they go hm right h no his is about 30 seconds long he goes [Music] H so now you know he's thinking about something not just going H he goes [Music] H it was previously a mystery and somewhere in that 30 seconds of H his mind is running why don't you let yours do that instead of shutting it off why don't you let yours get have that moment where you go that's refreshing that mystery was just refreshing that just absolutely thrilled my soul whether my body likes it or not or my spirit liked it or not your soul is always going to agree with the truth amen it can't help it so even the mystery H which has been hid from ages and generations now is made manifest to his Saints now remember this is in Paul's age First Church age they haven't had the seals broke to them yet so they didn't get the whole book they got part of the book they got the statue of perfect man up to where it says holy spirit but they never got the Capstone or the seals never open to even to the Apostle Paul who taught us all these great Mysteries but there was one mystery left and that mystery was a mystery of the opening of the seals and bringing Christ back to the Earth like he wanted to be so even the mystery which has hid from ages and generations is now made manifest to his Saints that's he's talking about in like BC 56 now we're in I'm yeah ad 56 now we're in ad 2023 we ought to know more about these Mysteries all right to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles now who is he talking about he really just narrowed it right down he didn't say Israel's going to get this this is not the Jewish mystery now they were Jews included but I'm talking about Jews as a nation it's for the Gentiles who is us right which is Christ in you the hope of glory now see Paul spoke this but remember when brother random comes and preaches Christ is the mystery of of God revealed one of the most powerful sermons he ever preached in his life he said if you don't get it in the seals come right back to here and and see this one more time take this message with a three-fold purpose oh God what he P was he poured into Christ Christ into the church take her back to the Garden of Eden now look hold it now brother Paul could get all God was he poured into Christ and pretty much all what Christ poured in the church but he couldn't take us back to the Garden of Eden cuz the seals hadn't been open he couldn't take this back to the Garden of Eden he he Paul could just say oh death where's your stay oh grave where's your Victory and he went to that grave he had his head chopped off so he couldn't preached Christ as a mystery of God revealed but here the prophet of God comes and preaches after the seals he preaches Christ is a mystery of God revealed showing us how God poured himself into Christ how Christ poured himself into his church and then took us back to the Garden of Eden condition before there was a fall Paul couldn't do that but the prophet of God did going back into the mind of God whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man and all wisdom look that you may present every we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus then we remember what godliness is is to be like God as brother bar said so that's what we've got to do work on that but work on it in a way where you can do it not where you can't do it all right oh I can't do it oh yes you can brother Ram said statute of perfect man paragraph 301 if you can't you need to deal with him because you know what now you're required to do it because you know it that you can all right and then re realize that you are deity that's why I said about getting the new birth if you have the new birth you have deity you're not searching for deity you're not looking for deity to come on the scene you are deity deity is deity is unveiled inside of you now what is this age it's unveiling it's not veiling it's unveiling the unveiling of God in other words the unveiling of the Bride that's what God wants to see in the end time he wants to see us unveiled to the world brother Ram said one time he said just for a moment God's going to in other words put us on a pedestal and say hey this is my bride they're here they've made it somebody has or we're all going to go by the grave deity fell on the day of Pentecost now look if deity fell on the day of Pentecost what about today amen de fell on day at Pentecost for one first church age 120 in the upper room 3,000 downstairs now we're a recipient at the other end of it at the open book part of it and it's falling yes the same deity but look we're required more they weren't required to come to a body change they weren't required to come to a resurrection you and I are required to come to that so we're in a dispensation that's different from that I believe God believes in dispensations you know why cuz I believe he set them up hello come on somebody y'all wake up goodness a lot of y'all are asleep Heavenly days pinch yourself you need a bowling ball hold this one above your head not down at your feet well I'm just going to tell you I'm sorry folks I'm a human as y'all are it's depressing when you got about 20 people doing this totally out you're not listening to nothing I'm saying nothing why oh I'll get it sublimely yeah brother Brown said look there's a group of people that would do only his will this is where he said pick up his pen and write so this is the Holy Ghost writing to me and you no one can persuade them different they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them so it's not you doing the work it's Christ inside of you doing the work it is himself and them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his day now look he said that in his day right all things when he was here but he did not complete all when he was here cuz you and I weren't there yet for it was not time yet I promise you today is the time the Bible tells us talks about a Doctrine which is according to Godliness the only way you're going to get godliness is excuse me is to have the true correct Doctrine Jesus stood and he didn't have to wonder whether he was preaching the correct Doctrine no he was the doctrin so being the doctrine he could preach the doctrine and 100% truth you said why I can't do that well get some Jesus get some Jesus get the preacher inside of you get some Jesus and he'll tell you what to say amen the dictionary says it's a set of ideas or beliefs that are taught or believed to be true and you know that we there's a lot of things that we believe that others don't there's a lot of things especially out in the world that the world doesn't believe that we believe are Vice all right but I'm not worried about the world I'm not going to worry we can't save the world I wish we could you know what if God can't save the whole world you sure can't all right so let's just quit trying just just just just live your Christian Life be the best you can do bring all of them in that you can pray for your family pray for your friends and turn them over to God best thing you can ever do in your life and if it so happens that you your church doesn't believe now brother Brown look look how cordial he is he he's cordial everywhere he goes because remember he's dealing with denominations he don't have message Believers sitting in his congregation that's right they that hadn't happened yet now there's Believers but there's not message Believers cuz they lot in people did not believe what he was saying they wanted to see the Miracles well praise the Lord that's what happened if it so happens that you your church doesn't believe or you do not believe just the things that we speak of in our as our church doctrine re trust that it will by no means bring an offense in other words he didn't want to be offensive because the very first step to successful Christianity now if you want the first step to a successful Christian Life read this to show that man has received the Holy Spirit is humility real God given humility that it must be given humbly but yet a church without a Doctrine now he still tells you look you can't be a jellyfish you can't just say well well you believe whatever you want to do that's what the world does you can't believe whatever you want to now you can't but if you're going to live Godly if we're going to be in the message of the hour if we're going to listen to the tapes read the books and come to the message church then there are certain things that you got to believe there are certain doctrines that you got to carry with you and you got to be the doctrine listen when we first come into message in the 60s late 60s women didn't cut their hair and didn't wear pants because somebody told them that they didn't really have read in the Bible because this person that we're following now this William brandom Guy we heard it on tape that we're supposed to not cut our hair and we're not supposed to wear pants so we don't do it cuz brother brandom said not to do it well that's not right the Bible told you not to do it long before brother R got here what happened was though that Veil that Satan put on Eve's eyes put on everybody else's eyes right think of the women now I Thank God I'm a Post deliver I deliver mail right yeah there are certain magazines that are just regular common magazines that I there's no way I'd have in my house you can't hardly get better homes in gardens to have something that looks good in it that that's not got naked women in it but think about 30 40 years ago when magazines were you got them in the mail and and all that stuff you got to say no that's not right you got to bring you got to bring not be the jellyfish you got to have a backbone say hey don't give me any of that well now it's just everywhere it's just treveling all over the place but thank God he give us a holy ghost Veil to help us get through this so we got to have a back in it and not only a backbone but teeth because the Church of God must eat the bread of life Romans 1:16 for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ I'm not ashamed for people to know that I live and try to be this message of the hour I have no shame in that you shouldn't either where you go to church what's the name of your church church what I mean really if you're ashamed if you're sh because listen most people know since that sign's been put out there 40 something 50 years ago they know what we believe the community pretty much knows what we believe they just kind of skirt around it you know and you get that I ain't perfect and you ain't perfect you know but I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it's the power so now if you're ashamed of the Gospel you have no power cuz this says if you're not ashamed of the Gospel it is the power of God and the Salvation to everyone that believeth as brother Dell's always said have we lived it in front of our kids to where they want what you got not don't want what you got think about that now let's look at this just for a minute brother Brown power of transformation 1965 now in God's Eden they were naked and didn't know it and now in Satan's Eden be it by science and education they are naked again and don't know it what a perversion look at today look at man trying to wear his wife's underneath clothes Bo that tree and she's wear trying to wear his clothes bless your heart sister Ash went in the bathroom the other day and a man came in I mean they're using both bathrooms now so there's no gender you know it's all gender friendly I guess you might say but brother Brown this is back 1965 I mean how innocent is 1965 compared to today very innocent very very innocent according to now but what happened is though there there wasn't as much of Veil out there there was some modesty yeah listen I don't remember any of my women School teachers wearing pants I do not Mom you I just don't remember them and and listen back then it was more prevalent for a woman to be a a teacher that it was for men cuz you have to remember you had the Old School Ms you know you had the school and I never remember them now they might have but I don't remember wearing PA of pant they wore dress you definitely wore dress to church that was no out about that you didn't see a pair of pants on a woman in the 60s and 70s going to church there was at least some yeah why you say why brother John cuz you didn't see that that back then I grew up in the 60s going even to a Baptist Church knowing that they did not walk in that door with a pair of pants on now shorts them Speedos or whatever they wear now the women and all that they don't care they just go to church any way they want to but listen that's no worse than us turning the word down so let's don't put us up here and them down here let's stay humble and say all right Lord had it not been for you I'd be doing the same identical thing all right but you know what you did by the grace of God you made yourself available to listen to what God said they have shut their ears off and their eyes have been blinded by the God of this evil age listen that God is still here and that God is bombarding me and you but we thank God we have the god that overrules all that amen amen he's trying to let his hair grow out like hers she's cutting hers off like his oh my man trying to be woman women trying to be man a perversion I appreciate a guy the other day he was he was being uh uh questioned in like a Schoolhouse type situation and and he's uh I think I told you you about the other day but he was U look talking to a transgender person and and you know the transgender like there there's no difference some you know could be a man could be a woman and and the guy looked there looked at that person and said all right answer me one question I don't want all your opinion answer me one question has a man since the dawn of time has a man ever had a baby and whatever that thing was said well no but but he said no I don't want he said I wanted you to answer my question yes or no has a man since the dawn of time every ever got conceived and had a baby and and the person said no he said well then there's a difference then there's a difference there has to be if you can and this one can't there's got to be a difference all right but see you see how the world though they took it and just turned it back around and went the other way and said well you can do whatever you want to do and blah blah blah that probably didn't do anything to that person he just went or that person just went out and believed whatever he's going to believe anyway but thank God for a man that could stand up and a in a group and and stand for what's right stand for the truth amen stand for the way you were born is the way you are that the same thing the church is doing same thing the layout to see and age now what is he talking about he talking about this Holy Ghost Veil listen the reason that you didn't know you were they didn't they didn't know they were naked in the beginning there was a holy spirit Veil K them now listen where is that Holy Spirit today the same holy spirit that covered Adam and Eve where is it today it's right here right it's the same Holy Ghost he don't change he didn't make any difference he didn't change he's right here now inside of you that's what makes you not be naked and try to show yourself naked to the world men and women but there was a holy spirit Veil that veiled them from NE nness they didn't know it the Holy Spirit was over their eyes they see nothing but their brother and sister see the lost they didn't know they were naked Holy Spirit now the spirit of unholiness uncleanness and lust has Veil them what the loudest in church age education science well it's scientific and he goes on to tell you that science says wear shorts because it's cooler he said no he said he said the people in Mexico and the people the Native American he said they put on clothes to sweat and cause air condition and cause insulation to uh so he said that was disproven all that but what are we looking for I'm looking for that Holy Ghost Veil to Veil us back the other way that keeps us from looking at the woman that keeps us from looking at the man that keeps us from all the XYZ you want to put in there whatever they got in the end time it's going to be put in front of your face young children beware that's right brother be careful right one wrong punch of a button you can be ruined for life y you just be careful you know what ask that Holy Ghost CU I promise you that Holy Ghost will never tell you to press the wrong button if you'll listen to the Holy Ghost he'll never tell you to press the wrong button cuz he's never wrong what our problem is is we override that and say well okay that's not so bad right just press play or whatever you want to do but the word Godly means a deity so we come up to now to a deity and it's where you resemble that deity in any way so in Genesis 1:26 God made an image that looked like him and looked like him and acted like him but now what did he do he gave him Dominion you say well brother way why you keep reading this I I want you to know that that same Dominion is what we're going to have to have for the Statue of a perfect man amen when you get born again listen you don't have dominion over everything you still got issues bad issues problems come on does it just me we still have issues but we must have dominion over them overcome remember it's not what you overcome it's how you overcome it you overcome it by the word of God you don't overcome it by your trying to will something out of your life please don't ever try to will something out of your life it'll come back every time but if you'll ask God to take it out of your life destroy it kill it murder it then you're fine all right so let us make man in our image and after our likeness so God didn't he created man and so he went ahead and just did it he there's no other way he made you in His image right all right the image of God created in him male and female created he them and now we see what God said about the bride which is the female part of Christ does everybody with me on that all right second Timothy 3 says persecutions afflictions which came unto me in Antioch and Iconium the persecutions he endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me y all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived so let's talk about brotherly kindness just for a minute we know what it adds it adds all through this and Philadelphia is the word for Brotherly Love or brotherly kindness love of brothers or sisters brotherly love and the New Testament the love which Christians cherish I want you to understand something watch how that says in the New Testament because I'm going to read you something in just a few minutes when Jesus stood up one day and told the disciples he said a new commandment I give you now he didn't change from the Old Testament all right he couldn't change the word of God cuz he was the word of God but he said a new commandment I give you he said you say an eye for an eye right that was the law the law was if if if brother Michael if I killed his brother I'm sorry about that okay if we killed him so well he's kind of looking a little B but there had to be a Reconciliation to that there wasn't any Court no if I killed Benjamin he came after me the law said he could kill me there was only a few ref Refuge cities we could get in and stay there and you know what that is folks that's Grace that's Grace in the Old Testament that gives you where say that I did hit Benjamin in the head but it was a hammer that I was hammering and the head fell off and hit him in the head and killed him well that was not malice murder that wasn't uh intended but still if I killed him he had the opportunity according to the law to kill me that's eye for an eye tooth for a tooth right but I'm going to show I'm going to read you something here that Jesus stood up one day and he said a new law I give you a new commandment that if a brother does that just give him everything you got if he hits you on one side give him the other side God is love but love TP typically produces obedience and for all who refuses to repent and believe in Christ they receive Justice I want you to think about that God is love and it's agape love and it's it's a love that has judgment involved with it not just lovey doy cuz listen this world is pent up on Jesus loves everybody and it really don't matter what you do come on somebody you really you listen to them out there in the world God is love it's just like Old Hippie love back I'm sorry back in the 60s free love you just whatever makes you feel good and I think that's the way it has become in the world cuz there's no judgment there's no God of judgment anymore everybody's going to heaven nobody's going to hell when the Bible tells us plainly that hell has to enlarge this gate so to get enough people in it so God is love but that love is typically produces obedience and brother R said love is corrective oh we hate that part and for all who refuse to repent and believe in Christ they receive Justice for those who do trust in Christ they receive what they don't deserve Grace is we we were talking about just now and have withheld what the really what they really did deserve and that was Mercy which side are you on do you have eternal life or do you still have the wrath of God abiding on you that's a question for you today because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold cold and informal brother brownman said you must be born again this read it this morning then you got agape love then you got felio love that's the love that you have for your wife and remember Agape Love Is never conditional it's the love of God right all right you said well yeah well there's there's certain things you got to do but your love for your wife and your love for your brother is conditional but it shouldn't be that's why you got to move from a from filo love to AG love all right FAL love will never save you FAL love will never let make you love your brother either come on it won't okay that's the love that you have for your wife if some man should insult her you'd shoot his brains out because it causes jealousy but that's filal love secondary love then comes lust for another man's wife then comes filth it just becomes perverted but all of this kind of love had a beginning but when that real genuine love of God cuz remember when God walked into the Garden of Eden the love he projected was agape love he's never had filo love right okay but now when when Adam and Eve stepped out from under that Veil they went from agape love to FAL love cuz remember they had a veil when they were naked they didn't know they were naked it didn't bother them there was nothing going on there was nothing happening they were just perfectly in harmony with each other all the time that'd be a wonderful marriage wouldn't it but guess what we're all over here in FAL love and so Adam and Eve was too and I'm sure there was some days I mean she lived several hundred years he lived 900 and something years had to be some contention there somewhere well praise the Lord some of y'all have been married 10 two years and oh Zach Black's not here I going get on to but when that real genuine love of God that I've been talking about comes into the human being by the new birth so the only way you're going to get is by the new birth being born again it had no beginning and it'll never have an end you are then a Son of God and a daughter of God and your affections are on things above F oh love would make you shoot a man for insulting your wife agape love would make you pray for his lost soul that's the difference the baptism of the Holy Spirit 1958 brother R said and then the first great spirit of God which is love God's like a great rainbow we couldn't imagine what he looks like so just we're going to say you look like a rainbow in spirit the perfect Spirit of love red blue the perfect Spirit of Fellowship just all perfect Spirits then they begin to condescend coming down and they come all the way down from fio love or agap love to fio love and on down to lust and down to the lowest and then God himself became a man Jesus but now remember when God became Jesus when he when he condescended down he didn't condescend in fil your love God can't change right God can't change if not he couldn't teach us how to have a love cuz he was a love he couldn't do any different he was a love he didn't have a carnal mind he didn't have he didn't wore in his members that what his mama was and what his daddy was he knew who his daddy was okay is everybody with me when he condescended he only condescended in that he narrowed himself in human flesh to die for me and you cuz remember brother R said he didn't become less God come on he didn't become less God when he became Jesus he was the fullness of the godhead bodily inside of him dwelt all of God which is agape love there was no room for f your love but remember he loved them with agape love but he knew they wouldn't love him back with ag gape love they loved him with a conditional love when he was healing them when he was feeding them when he was getting them across in a boat when there was a storm when he was walking across the water when he had a real good social problem going on they loved him but buddy when he come over here and that agape love started projecting if you don't believe that I am he you'll die in your sins that wasn't F your love that was agape love and that's the same thing going to happen to me and you that's why you're going to be persecuted for being like Jesus he knew before the foundation of the world whose names were written on the book and redeemed them back to himself there you are the story of redemption cannot be fully known until we see him and we stand in his likeness brother Brown now he comes in we'll finally get to this sixthly let's add the Bible said adding Brotherly Love brotherly kindness now that's a good one right here the sixth then he says seventh but it is the six all right adding brotherly kindness all right when we get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter remember like I've always said be careful when you're out in the world and somebody's crossed to you maybe somebody that's uh um somebody that's a waitress or a waiter or something you don't know what kind of day they've had you ever tried God bless you sometimes it'll just rip their mind off cuz they'll look at you like well thank you I mean they don't even know they've never said they've had some other cursings during the day but they've never really had somebody say God bless you I'm sorry you're having a bad day everything okay and give him a little extra money give him a little extra tip oh that hurts my brother sinned against me said Peter shall I forgive him Peter was a little bit Peter was saying I got it whipped here I'm going to make myself a name cuz uh I'm just not going to forgive one time I'm going give forgive seven times a day the Lord said no he said 70 time 7 Peter you missed it by a bunch now that's really Peter was going hey I'll answer that seven times a day well that sounds good good number Jesus turned around and said that ain't even close Peter 70 times a day 70 time 7 brotherly kindness now we see if a brother is all out of tunb don't be impatient with him see no no be kind to him go anyway somebody said not long ago I want y'all to to to think about this quote cuz I'm fixing to read you another one that seems a little bit opposite to that because brother R was a human being all right you ready somebody said not long ago how can you believe those things the way you do now watch and still go to the Assembly of God the Oneness all the rest then put see brotherly kind see see hoping someday see patience with him see temperent enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in brotherly kindness brother round said the seventh Thing 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven see seven things said now you're coming now I'm I'm going to read you a quote hang on a minute keep your eyes closed cuz I got to go to the very end cuz it was one I put at the very last cuz I remember it all right you ready this is the same person this is Brother William Mar Bram everybody okay this is 1962 on the Statue of a perfect man brother Brown says I was down brother WS I think they're back there somewhere one night there was a minister down there I was speaking for preachers together this preacher raised up and said now I want to tell you people something oh I think you're fine people all right I said I told somebody I said that that's one sitting right there watch now look brother rown was telling somebody beside of him he said there's one watch so Junior Jackson back there just got through speaking and he said was preaching on the grace of God he was burning up waiting he talking about this other guy he got up there and he was trying to understand now I W to say that brother brandham here I I'll tell you is an antichrist and he started off like that all night some of the preachers started I said wait a minute now don't say nothing Brothers there's only one of him and a bunch of us now here's the real thought of the Prophet I said just let him alone he's picking on me I wanted it myself so bad I didn't know what to do hm H he wanted it so bad to get up there and tell that brother that he was wrong and if you'll continue on with a quote he did get to ask the brother a couple of questions cuz the brother was telling saying that that the apostolic age was gone there was no speaking in tongues there was no with Divine Healing and brother Brown was preaching all that but he said I wanted it myself so bad he's picking on me I didn't know what to do see so you have to be you have to be what is it a balance we have to have a balance in this thing everything's got to be a balance so brother Brandon was a human being but yet he was balanced all right everybody with me now remember Jesus tells us he said all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them then it says that may they may be one as we are really to get true Oneness you got to come to brotherly kindness you got to have true Oneness cuz there can't be anything in between everybody with me there can't be anything in between it's got to be you and God all right while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name this is Jesus praying we read this the other day I have given them Thy word and the world ha hated them because they are not of this world even as I am not of this world I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world in other words I'm I I'm not want you to shelter them they're going to have to prove who they are they're going to have to prove prove brotherly kindness they're going to have to prove Temperance they're going to have to prove patience because I've got a bunch of Overcomers coming I don't have a bunch of wamps I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world but that thou should us keep them from the evil they are not of this world even as I am not of this world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth and this whole process is a sanctifying process yeah even though you're born again you still need your spirit realm San ified now here we go this is John 13:34 this is Jesus now the word of God that was in the Old Testament right now he's coming into the New Testament and he has been made flesh he was Jehovah at one time where the animal blood could not let him come down and redeem anyone there was no redemption in the Old Testament everybody understand that right all right there was a covering we'll get into that uh several several down the road Road we'll talk about anointing but that anointing that same Jehovah brother Brown said became Jesus Christ now then he was able to project agape love a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you think that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to the other Matthew 5:37 says but let your communication be yay yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil what resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other one also and if a man shall Sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have you cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go two miles give to him that askest thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you have heard that has been said Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor now watch Love Thy Neighbor and hate thine enemy all right you have been you have heard you've been told to love your neighbor and hate your enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you how many of us have ever done that I didn't think so we got a long way to go bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans do the same thing and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans also be therefore perfect now he comes all the way down through all that and tells us to be perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect John 159 says as the father hath loved me so have I loved you continue ye in what my love which is agape love am if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love all right even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment everybody with me this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you greater love has no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends Divine love 1956 now we are facing a day now this is 1956 before he preached statue of perfect man now we are faced in a day that when it's prophesied that Brotherly Love would become a strange thing among people and it's to my humble belief now watch and it's to my humble belief that that is the the greatest of all the gifts that's in God's Bible what was the two greatest Commandments they asked him and I'll read that maybe later on but what was oh what's the two what's the greatest commandment he said number one love the Lord with all thy heart with all thy might what's the second one love thy neighbor as you love yourself he said you do these two you're doing real good you know if you do them to you won't have to worry about the other eight cuz you won't kill you won't steal you won't do those things that's my humble belief brother Brown says that this is the greatest of all the gifts that there is in God's Bible now listen here St here here stands brother randman 1956 in Prince Albert Saskatchewan he's right in the middle of the greatest healing campaign ever since Jesus Christ walked on the face of the Earth all right so you would think he would say the greatest gift would be the gift of Divine Healing if the Lord Jesus should stand on the platform tonight and look me in the face and say I'm going to give you your choice you can be a great person a great Minister I'll give you a gift of preaching the gospel which he did or I'll give you the gift of teaching the word which God did and I'll give you the gift of Prophecy which God did or I'll make you a prophet which God did or any of these other fine Gifts of Faith any of the gifts that's in the Bible I'll give them everyone to you but then I'll withhold love from you or either I'll give you love and withhold the gift from you I say Lord take all the gifts and let me have the love see for no matter how many gifts we got they will never do us any good except the love of God is the motive behind the gift we must must have love brother Ram 1957 I will restore they had brotherly love and they weren't greedy they sold everything they had for the furthering of the church they were so together till even when one heard the other one died they said let's go and die with him such a feeling now Jesus spoke of this and said let Brotherly Love continue that was in the first church but look but something's taking place and there was a fellow come in by the name of the pommer worm we talked about a little bit this morning and when he began to eat on that vine of Brotherly Love he cut the very sapl line of it because it don't make any difference how smart we are how much we think we know or how much we want to be different from somebody else as long as that brotherly feeling isn't among us we're fighting a losing battle that's right we can't win there's no way for us to win so why are we not winning why do we not have Victory maybe we need to work on our brother kindness maybe we need to work on our Brotherly Love Christ revealed in his own word 1965 there was a certain person said to me he said I believe you're an antichrist I said if that would be pleasing to my Lord that's what I want to be now bless God I'm a prophet don't you call me that he's okay buddy if that would be pleasing to my Lord that'd be fine I want to be whatever he wants me to be I love him and if he should cast me into hell I still will love him if I go there with the same spirit I have now he looked at me kind of strange well praise God he probably never heard that before I seen four or five of them there young men young wives fine women I know how them boys love their wives so I said I said now here's the way to test it if you're a wife before you were married now you go back and say this married life now this is going to be a hard one this is hard this is tough I don't know if I could give June to somebody else a pre-marriage why are you quiet for I'm not going to ask her if she would I'm just saying I would you've been dreaming you were married you really wasn't married but you dreamed you were and you woke up and you went and you talked over with your girlfriend said you know I dreamed that we were married and we had children we lived happy and waiting for the coming of the Lord and everything thing and then this girl would say to you you know I love another man better than I love you I could be happier with the other man could you from your heart love her well enough to say God's blessings rest on you my dear go with this other man I want you to think about that one now check that each of you men are you women see well if your love is corre correct you would do that for you are interested in her welfare why because we want to be selfish and say no I'm in love with you I want you for myself what you know you could have her you can live with her she's your wife you she will be she'll marry you but she won't be happy she would be happier and then if you love her then you want her to be happy therefore whatever the will of God is let God's will be done whether I'm happy with it or not I want to live so he will be pleased with what I do amen amen therefore check your objective and your motive by that you know whether you love God or not what if he'd say you serve me if I'm going to cast you away he said I love you anyway now let's look at this word right here selfish to be selfish is to be concerned excessively or excl exclusively with oneself selfishness is one of the biggest obstacles to having the kind of close relationship with God and inspiring relationship with other people that many of us desire they sell selfie sticks go figure so they can take a picture of you no so they can take a picture of theirself and send it to somebody that's took a picture of their self and you comp they compare s i I just don't get these these um um uh YouTube influencers or these uh what do you call them um uh social media influencers I'm eating cheeseburger I'm going to the bathroom I I got a friend look at my dress look at my shoes and they get paid for that selfish selfish we got to get rid of selfishness and you know what selfishness is you owe me you owe me God don't owe you nothing that's right you owe everything to him amen God don't owe you nothing you owe everything in the world look he was so unselfish he died for people that didn't even want to he died for people he knew didn't want him right and he died anyway that's love Paul says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live now remember I preached a bunch of sermons on this because that proves to you one thing Paul had another life because he said the life I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Galatians 2:20 teaches us that living by faith in the Son of God means you no longer live but Jesus lives in you what is our biggest problem us who gets in the way Jesus no us we get in the way so if you want to have a close relationship with God and other people you need to learn to leave yourself behind that's right I like that second Timothy proves it for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and Unholy brother brownman 1950 says I tell you that's what's a whole lot of matter with the people today they're not friendly like they used to be the people have got too selfish got to a place where they think that now this is 1950 listen 1969 and 70 when I come well 74 when I started driving 75 I didn't drive in the 60s Donny did you waved at everybody there was no such thing as road rage when I was growing up was it road rage when you s i mean bad as you drive they still not road rage I mean you might have made somebody mad but you didn't shoot them for it run them off the road you might have got the middle finger of fade award but that was about it now they'll shoot you why the love of men he waxed cold there's no love for people there's no love for listen there's no love for life there's no love for life life is just whatever doesn't matter shoot bang bang you know whatever so the people's got too selfies got to a place where they think they live in a little world oh pra praise the Lord they live in a little world bys you know that's the truth you know it used to be out on a farm when one of the neighbors got sick we'd go out and help him right that's that don't happen no more if your neighbor died it took you two or three years to read it somewhere on social media or in the paper papers about gone now you cut the wood and bring it in and I remember dadding him telling how if somebody gets sick and the sharecroppers well they going to lose a crop everybody just pitched in and went out there and sewed the crop and got everything ready for them you can't do that now you don't even know your neighbor's dead unless you read it in the paper now that's brother brought them in 1950 selfish people pass down the street used two we'd grab a hold one another's hand and shake their hand like that and say how are you brother today when they pass on the street they give a little silly grin now listen I'm going find that quote because cuz he actually did that he's telling on himself cuz you're going to see where MAA says Bill did you not see that was sister so and so he said yeah she said well you just grinned and nodded your head a little silly grin throwing their head up in the air oh my no wonder Love's gone his wife rebuked him and I'll find a quote and I'll read it to you I despise that old somebody feel that they're bigger than somebody else after all you're six foot of Earth that's all you are that's right brother Ry 1954 we'll close right here the world come word becoming flesh this is when he took the India trip and came back I recognized the other day a selfish Spirit coming on me of saying this man's wrong I ought to tell him about it that's wrong God's the one to tell him about it it's none of my business but my business is to preach the gospel and love everybody and move on and love my enemies as Jesus loved me when I was his enemy oh when I was his enemy remember he didn't UNL you he was just waiting on you to love him he loved me to his bosom when I was unlovely he loved me to his bosom and anybody that's unlovely let me love him the same let the spirit that was in Christ be in US amen 1954 what you think of Christ let's stand our feet musicians come some people are so narrow-minded I like this quote you got to think about it because they don't hardly make pencils anymore everybody know what a pencil is okay well some of the young ones are going um there was a a they asked me to come and and notorized some paperwork the other day at a house brother John and I walked in the house to notarize it and and they were all right they were older you know my age and older and they were writing it all they had write like a little summation of whatever it was and I had to stamp it you know sign it so I didn't I didn't read it I just looked over it it was all in cursive writing well that ain't the problem the problem is one of the ladies said I handed this to my grandson to read and he said Grandma I can't read cursive writing they don't even teach it anymore it's all block letters computers do not write incursive only humans write in cursive if you know one I don't know one it's all block letters said Grand I can't read this it's incursive could not read a cursive frighting well anyway some people are some narrow-minded you could put a lead pencil between their eyes and they'd blind them think about that for those of you that don't know that that means if you put a pencil right here it put both eyes out cuz you're so narrow-minded this why brother listen it's a quote they just don't look to both sides they got some little Theory what selfish and run away with it you have to stop and look the thing over Romans 12:9 says let love be without dissimulation abore that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another Luke 6: 26 says woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you praise the Lord Brother Dell told me long years ago when I was growing up he said he said son if everybody likes you you you're a hypocrite think about that cuz that means you swayed over to this group you swayed over to this group you swayed to make this one and we try to make everybody happy but you can't please everybody trust me I'm a mayor of a city of 300 people and they're 90% of them first cousins are uncles and aunts so w unto you and all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets but I I say unto you which he love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and that word despitefully means falsely accuse you H can we do that and to him that smiteth one cheek offer him the other him that taketh away the cloak give him your coat give every man that askes of and of him that taketh away Goods ask him not again and he you would that men should do to you do you also to them likewise in other words do unto others as you would have them do unto you for if you love them which love you what thank have you in other words where is overcoming love somebody loving somebody that just loves you for Sinners also love those that love them and if you do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye for Sinners also do even the the same and if I lend to them whom you hope to receive what thank have you for Sinners also lend to Sinners to receive as much again but love your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again that's where you get down to where F your love is conditional if I buy you a car you got to buy me a car you know or or if I give you5 $100 you owe me something that's not a gift hoping for nothing again and your reward look and your reward shall be great so it's not going to give you you have no reward your reward is great by what giving unconditionally and you shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil we love him because he first love us if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar wow I've heard some of you I don't like this person I don't like this preacher so what you're a liar I'm just reading you the Bible if a man says I love God and hateth this brother or his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he has not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God loveth his brother also 1 John 3:13 says Marvel not my brethren if the world hates you praise God we know that we have passed from death into life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer ha eternal life abiding in him right hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay our down our lives for the Brethren but who so hath this world's goods and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love in the word neither in tongue but in deed and Truth 1 Peter 3:8 says finally be ye all of One mind having comp passion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrary wise blessings knowing that you are there unto called that you should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no G and this is one I read see he wanted it himself let's go to Mark 11 then we'll I'm going to try to get these finished therefore I say unto you what things whatsoever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them now wait a minute that sounds good but the Lord Jesus said and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive you it'll do you no good to Harbor a grudge or Harbor ill feelings because you've just shut yourself off from God forgiven you for what you did can I read that again and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither were your father in Heaven forgive your trespasses h i wow we can we stop on that one but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven well I I've got a right you don't have a right at all you do not have a right to rail I'm reading the scripture you don't have a right to do that but that's why when we get ready to take communion what do we do we stop right we stop and have a moment of Silent prayer and that's what I do brother John I do the checklist thing have I done this have I done that have I done this have I done that unwillingly I might have done something that I don't know about please Lord bring it to my attention or if I have willingly done something like brother Brown said if you know you've done something he said go aead and take communion but you better go make that right cuz God Will Make sure you do make that right one way or the other right that's why we have a moment of silence that when we can stand praying or when we can stand and take communion that what our heart doesn't condemn us as the Bible says it won't condemn you like I told y'all before and and I I told you from right here I said something bad that's why I don't say bad things about preachers I don't care if he comes up here and preaches the false Doctrine you just correct it and go on but but I had an ought against a brother and it bothered me and it was hindering my walk but you know what I still Let It Go for several months cuz you know what I'm human but finally the Lord pretty much said you're not going anywhere until you get this worked out so you know what was the most freeing thing in the world was making that phone call I said brother I said something about you that I shouldn't have said and I'm sorry and you know what he said he said brother wait he said you're forgiven he said you're forgiven when you asked first right at the first moment and he said when you come up say come preach for me and boy I felt good after that good and it's gracious like I had took a shower and I had mud all over me brother John I I was just I just felt so good well guess what I stood and confessed I stood and asked forgiveness that's why I always tell you when I pray when somebody else is praying for people up here I don't pray for that person it's between that person and their connection is right here the anointing is on this man all right the anointing is right here what I'm saying is Lord don't let me and my unbelief something I did today something I said cross something I said wrong to a brother or sister don't let that hinder cuz brother brother Brown said one unconfessed sin in a congregation will cause the whole congregation to fail not just that person getting her healing I don't want to stand and be standing in not the major judgment but the minor judgment and have to give an account why that person didn't get their healing cuz I was standing back there doing something different or I had an a against somebody or somebody uh I said something bad about person everybody with me we need to clear that slate remember bring the good ground in and when the seed comes you'll yield 30 60 are 100 fold but if not you're just going to hear the word and as soon as you walk out the door you ain't going to remember none of it cuz there's nothing inside of you to remember with forgive if you have all against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses let's sing a song
