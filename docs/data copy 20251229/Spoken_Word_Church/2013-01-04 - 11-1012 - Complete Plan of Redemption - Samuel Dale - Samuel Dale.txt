see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to Job 38 Job 38 now remember brother fory was supposed to be preaching tonight but he will be preaching not this coming weekend now but the next one which will be the 23rd all right so he'll be here with us preaching bars coming back in from Jamaica and preaching for us on the weekend there of the 23rd and I also remember brother Ron Spencer will be with us preaching the 29th which is on Saturday night and Sunday morning on the 30th and then we'll be having a dinner afterward and uh you know it won't be any evening service so just you know remember that and all of you sisters get together get everything planned for for the meal and the the doings and the you know to uh to get everything ready all right uh we thank God very much for the rain he's given us that's wonderful it's really helped everything that be doing and we pray that he'll just keep pouring out the rain but we need the spiritual rain more than we need the natural we ask God to to do that all right now um the on the Thanksgiving which will be the last Thursday of this you know November uh but I don't know we'll have to get together and figure out which Sunday that is is but uh what we'll do is the church will just cater a dinner for you on that Thanksgiving weekend to tell you how much we thank you you know for all of your comings and doings tonight and we'll have a a Sunday dinner on that uh Thanksgiving weekend we'll see what it is I don't know what the exact dates but uh should be pretty close to the last anyway cuz it's always the last Thursday so I don't remember the dates all right so just keep that in mind and we'll try to see if we can get something catered to tell you how much we appreciate it all right Job 38 our heavenly father we thank you for all things you said you give them to us freely but Lord no matter if you do just open up the he Windows of heaven and pour them out on us we still need to thank you we still need to tell you how much we love you you know we do but we still need to tell you cuz you tell us you guide us and keep us and I pray that you'd just be with us tonight and open up our understanding that we may see you Lord open our eyes and just help us to look to you the author and finisher of our faith lead us now to thine understanding as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts that we may walk in you and be led of Your Love keep us now remember all of the sick among us cuz you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe you you we thank you we ask you to just bless each one now in Jesus name amen Job 38 then the Lord answered job out of the Whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge GT up now thy loins like a man behold I will demand of thee and answer thou me Forest thou when I love La the foundation of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding see the only thing that brother BR said that was wrong with job that he was a little exalted you know within his own self and a little bit to the point so that's what the Lord is doing he's just simply asking job said well just tell me now if you have all this understanding and things tell me where this is see then it it takes him down in a hurry don't it says where was thou when I laid the foundation of the Earth declare if thou Hast understanding who ha laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who had stretcheth the line upon it whereupon are the foundations there aist and or who laid the Cornerstone thereof that's when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy oh who who shut up sea shut up the sea with doors when it Break Forth as if it were if it had issued out of the wound all right and he goes on he tells about making the clouds of thickness I left that off of it in the darkness but the main thing we want to look at is where were you cuz he gives the the key to it if you'll notice in verse six right all right you don't have to put it back up wherefore whereupon are the foundation there of fashion who or who laid the Cornerstone y so we'll get back to that in a minute you may be see SE the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we spoke on this back a while back when we were talking in our journey and our discussions and all in the message bringing it talking about the things taking place in heaven and I said I'd get down to it and we would come back to this uh again so I I want to try to take it up tonight in a way that maybe will give us a little understanding of something but I want to tie back to uh this past weekend cuz I want you to think about it because what was we talking about do we have a negative confession or do we have a spiritual Revelation right you remember what I was bringing now that anything whatsoever one step down downward whatever you would call it one word backward whatever whatever you would want to bring I was trying to get a point to you that anything out of a positive confession it would be re leaning into negativism all right right so I I hope you caught that point of what I was trying to bring because see I want it to be positive amen I don't want it to be to where we say well uh this is what I think you know what do you believe uh what is your input upon this I don't have no input we've either got thus sayith the Lord from the prophet of God are we in bad trouble you know but see that was what I was trying to get to point to you about is we don't need a negative confession right and anything out of saying it positive you're leaning to negativism and you say well no it was partial realization but now I hope you you don't get the wrong Point see partial realization is perfect realization right right right partial realization Martin Lu with the J shall live by faith that was the perfect complete y uh statement for the time amen right all right cuz that was perfect y all right you follow me see that would have been called partial realization compared to what we see now but remember anything imp partial realization is not talking about something negative am all right so don't get that thought into your mind see of what I was trying to bring it that we need a positive confession right and get away from our negativism amen you know all right now and see then we covered about the book of life and our names being written in the Book of Life and we talked about an open book amen now an open book because that's what our thought was you see the books it says in Daniel and it says in in Revelation that the books were open all right now we know that that goes to the white Throne yes and we will be sitting on the throne with him not standing before him at the white Throne all right but see then the books were opened now you remember what I was trying to bring out we'll get to it in just a minute and TI all together with the night's message the Lord willing that has the book become a brand new book to you like I told you I've heard people that have read three pages out of the seal book just is a point you know and they say the Bible's become a brand new book cuz they heard the prophet say that now the only way the Bible can become a brand new book to you and me or anyone right is for the seals to be broke right amen that's when the seals broke to the prophet he said it become a brand new book right not in the 50s Not in the 60 early what when the seals broke to the prophet right all right now when the seals break to you and I then the Bible becomes a brand new book right amen not just because you read the seal book and and can quote that quote see that's what people will say oh boy I come into the message and and and you talk to them about 2 minutes they don't even know what in the world world is sealed is about no that's right but yet it's Bible's become a brand new book well let's don't get caught into that business because if we do we we won't even be in partial realization that's right come on we'll be in sin right amen because we'll be in negativism right so you see the two messages I was trying to put it together to where we can see it and and really if you know the truth about it then God came here on the message on the open book and he opened it up to me here while I was preaching right as to how to bring it and and he did tonight just before the the service here that I had the notes and he said no this way so we go the way he told us to go that's right all right but now you follow what I was trying to bring we must have a positive confession about our faith amen amen MH the Bible says examine your faith you know examine you see whether you're in the faith or not right amen why are you worried about your Revelation right most preachers won't tell you what they believe you know they pedal are around it you know yep they won't come out and just tell you what they believe right because they don't want nobody to be able to you know they they don't want you to hammer it down say wait a minute that ain't right right n right so they want to put leave it to well that's what I was talking about I've seen people do that you know you you come up to them and say something and they oh yeah they go then you say something that was what I was talking about when you know that one what just talking about right all right but now see the open book then is only this Bible was open to the prophet when the seals broke right yes that's right you fall in my thought right that was what I trying to get across this is the book this is the Bible it had to be written yep before it could be opened right yep all right now so then we're in the book when it opens up it's going to reveal not only the day and time we live on the earth that's what most of you preachers preach about what's happening out here in the world yeah is our day no it's going to reveal our day in this message right what the revelation of redemption right right all right now that's what we want to get on to in a few minutes see the revelation of redemption but now get me then we can move on see anything outside of a positive confession is negativism right cuz you're not talking about partial realization cuz did you get what I said I'm saying it over again you say well Martin Luther didn't have it yes he had positive Revelation for his day right sure amen he had perfect Revelation for his day he had all that could be revealed for his day that's right but now comparing that to where we are yes partial realization but remember it was perfect to him that's right right Paul is not here but when he said you be Chang the moment twinkle eye to him that was perfect right I looking there today I believe was sometime when brother R said those prophets when they saw it he said it was was real to them right when non saw chariots Johson in the street that was real right right oh yeah he just as well as he'd been sitting right here watching them run into each other on the highway cuz it was perfect re Revelation all right but now remember what we're trying to do we spent about seven or eight messages dwelling about heaven and how real it is and whether God is real whether Heaven would be a real place or not and then we drop down the Earth and I we covered these things of like names written in the Book of Life we covered that while we were talking about it because that's what the Bible says happened there that's right so we covered then on this of the Morning Star saying together and the sons of God shouted for joy we we covered that and just you know hitting it going along and and to see then that the word has opened that we can see what's in heaven but we got to have the matching pieces here that's right all right you say but but brother Dale B guy was only in God's mind but if that does not come to a reality upon earth right that's it then what trouble is you've got that's right right amen you mean you got something that's in the Bible that would not take place upon Earth show it to me see you'd have a problem all right so then what we want to do is to see that what was in God's mind yes but if it don't happen here if Jesus Christ hadn't come here 2,000 years ago and died upon the cross that would have made the the Revelation 3 138 about the name written before the foundation that would have made that scripture anold right made it void that's right would have made it wrong all right so we're here in the end time right we are the ones now this could not be understood down Through the Ages like we're talking about it that's right amen come on they couldn't follow it cuz they didn't know it they couldn't couldn't bring it to the right place to they right songs there a new written down in glory in it's mind well everybody seen that say what's wonderful the Prophet come along and says good words ain't no re ain't no good Revelation to it he said because it all had to be written before the world right now so remember what we're doing now see we've left Heaven we've come to Earth and we're watching on Earth the things that we saw as we were talking while we were in the Heavenly reals right all right so now follow that thought and you you'll get the point now of what we're trying to bring all right when the more sons of God you know morning Stars sang together the sons of God shouted for Joy we've been through this we've read it let's read it again might change something in a minute when we get to the real thoughts so let's go ahead brothers and and just read a little bit number one on her notes this is taken from page one which would be paragraph one I guess too the serpent seed 58 928 the evening and what what he's saying dear God the Great and Mighty God who formed All Things by the power of His Spirit as brought Jesus Christ his only begotten son who freely died for with Sinners the just for the the unjust to reconcile us back into His Marvelous Fellowship that we have again with God as we are caught in the Blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world you say where's that at that's in Ephesians 1 that he chose us or Ephesians 13 that he chose us in him that's right before the foundation of the world that's right he told the disciples we'll get to it in a minute maybe this one here he told the disciples that he knew them and had fellowship with them before the foundation of the world right well now brother Dale do you believe that we would back there yeah but not like what people are talking about right right yep would back there as people no with little identities running around some kind of something we were only there in Jesus Christ that's right we've been through that and proved the point all right but listen as we are taught in the Blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of world when the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy went back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain that when God in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus and tonight we're only got it for tast of the great Glory Divine which shall be revealed at his coming it'll go on into that but think about it look at the next one and we read these before but a lot of people out there haven't read them so if they see it maybe they can read it right adoption part two or number two 196 518 paragraph 151 so beautifully displayed in the prodical son I was lost this is my son he was lost and now he's found he was dead and he's alive again bring forth the fatted calf the best robe a ring and put it on his finger and let no wonder when the Morning Star sh together and the sons of God shouted for Joy when they seen the Plan of Salvation God putting your name on the book before the foundation of the world God put in your name on the book before the foundation order well that looks like we was back there eternal life was back there right right God and his great attributes they were back there amen that's exactly right that's what the Bible said look at the next one the rejected King 196 5:15 the morning service paragraph 5 57 and brother brand actually what he's doing the girl is is rubbing his back while he was at the hospital having to do some test and things and started talking to her about the you know and she did about the oldest denomination and watch what he says roll it on that you can read the whole thing but this and I said no ma'am CU she had said well my denomination that certain certain he said no man' that was only about 200 years ago that organization but this organization started when the Morning Star Shang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy when they seen the coming of a savior right to redeem mankind all right now what took place there let's go ahead and read the next one let's get to reading out of way go ahead and read number four it up it's serpent SE paragraph 82 he I want to ask you who is this job 2738 which is 38 when he said where was you when I laid the foundation of the Earth Earth when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy who were those sons of God that was shouting for Joy look who are they they tell Jesus told them that I had Joy with you before the foundation of the world we are not creatures of time we're creatures of Eternity no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that comes to me I'll give them eternal life and raise him up at the last days no one can pluck them from my from the father's hand he gave them to me how you're going to lose see you're scared you're afraid y that's what he saying you're scared you're afraid you'll run around here and that's one of the best evidences in the world that you haven't been nowhere yet that's right it's a pretty good point you run around you don't get settled why not just settle down and say well I I'm like this if this ain't that you remember let me keep this till that gets here all right but I believe this is that you right you know I believe the prophet believed that going down let's read the next couple while we at it and then we'll get back and just preach a while Israel and the church part one or number one paragraph 59 look what he says with we had a little time to go to job 7:38 which is 3 7:37 which is 3 387 and see where he said where was you when I laid the foundation of world before I laid the foundation of world declare to me see where they're fing at or where was you when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy tell them to Jo buckle up yourself like a man I want to speak to you now Paul says he chose us in him amen the church before the foundation of the world yep all right so now brother R was putting where he chose us in him before the foundation of the world right in with the morning start saying together sons of God shouted for Joy let's go down and get the last one now which is spiritual Amnesia paragraph 88644 11 now to be a true Christian you have to be the son we don't want to forget that all that he was I'm identified with him right I'm identified with him notice and he is in me and I in him notice then every Christian that's a real genuine Christian Christian was with him when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal Realms with God 10 million years before the world world was ever formed I was back there with him if I got eternal life I was there with him I was identified with him when the morning stars came together the sons of God shouted for Joy now he just answered it right if you have eternal life right what was back there right so we get to reading out of the way what was back there what happened back there you see we spend all of our time and I do too but I like to think about it I like to think about what that was and we spent a lot of time preaching about in heaven and seeing the things and in the eternities and coming down and how that's eternal life is the only thing you're dealing with you remember that it's not a people or little identities running around up in heaven some kind of form we were chosen in Jesus Christ according to the scriptures and according to the prophet amen and he had fellowship with us before the foundation of the world according to the scriptures right but what kind of a fellowship was that and what was taking place we wasn't back there as people we've been through that sure you can say this is in God's mind that he saw it but now we went through that too in a message or two that God's mind is a way under greater than anything we could think of even as natural that's right right amen he said my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways all right well we found out that we wasn't people before the world they that's the prophet where were Spirits back then he said no we wasn't nothing we was only in God's mind but just remember now how we brought down predestination that predestination looks back to for knowledge right amen then what is it tall talking about and this is what struck me tonight so I'm going to try to bring it down in just in plain language we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what was before the world we spent a lot of time in predestination trying to comprehend what we were that's what good I have too all have I said we but you know as I said there a moment ago the Bible says that Jesus Christ stood as a lamb's L yeah but you know if that had never happened upon the Earth that would have made the scripture void with but you know one day on this Earth to exactly match what that was Jesus Christ died on the cross right see in the reality is here no amen the reality is here upon Earth if we can just see it then we'll see why that one day heaven will even come to Earth right right the future home's coming down right right it's not going to do away with heaven right you remember the story remember the message not going to do away with Heaven Heaven's going to come to earth right amen it's going to be engulfed by eternity we see we do we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what we were yeah that's right when really if the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Jordan we know the Bible says it did and we know that that was us and we read where the Prophet said that that was when we saw the Plan of Redemption well you know the Plan of Redemption would be on earth right are you listening That's right The Plan of Redemption wasn't in heaven Jesus Christ never physically died in heaven that's right he had to come to earth right to die amen salvation wasn't needed in heaven that's right oh yeah the angels that fa yeah yeah that's true that but don't work for them does it but it's not talking about them see we're going to find out one of these days that we are as this world the center of the whole universe not because we're the center of it because of geographical locations right but we're the center of the Earth because this is where God wants to dwell with his people amen right that's right that's what he designed this far that's right amen I think it's about time for us to start talking about what is happening on earth now and in doing that I only wrote one little thing across my page that changed the whole message that I was going to preach maybe someday I'll get back preach something but we established that somebody that's going to be redeemed upon Earth saw that Plan of Redemption before the world while in eternal life right okay and we didn't get to come to Earth as Eternal people because if it did there would be no need of a Plan of Redemption that's right are you listening that's right why would you need a Plan of Redemption if everybody's Eternal that's right so it's not that way for God you he was going to bring us to Earth while we were in Jesus Christ is the only place you can put us because that's the Bible see then in Jesus Christ was the full Plan of Redemption and thereby we could see it not as our eyes see but we would know that we could not be lost now think with me the reason we were shouting is because we knew we couldn't be lost right there's no way to lose eternal life you remember we went through a message on that Adam never fell from eternal life in his soul God's not an ending Giver the prophet said he fell from the position to where he would have become Eternal in body and the world would have been become Eternal right he fell from that position to death all right so then the only ones that would know about the Plan of Redemption would be those that were a part of God right before the world ever begun but for us to have stayed up in heaven would have never brought for Redemption and we wouldn't have never come forth because we'd have been in Jesus Christ right we wasn't little identities running around I went through that over and over with you that's right right don't never think about that we were little Mormon doctrine of souls up there in heaven you know running around little peoples running out with you no we was in Jesus Christ right cuz that's when he came to Earth he came to Earth with us in him Eve was in Adam Adam was in Eve remember all right so then really what was happening back there was us looking at what's happening now simple little Point what did they see where were you job when the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy was he asking him how far back he was how far could his thinking go back into eternity or was he asking him where he is now CU remember one of the quotes we read we read one we read two quotes in the beginning we're talking about could that have been when the their names were written on the book the third one was when we come to Earth you remember that go back to number three brother Joe okay can you flick it back up brother number four excuse me no number three number three you got it you got it when they seen the coming of the Savior to redeem mankind when they seen the coming of a savior 2,000 years ago like I said we spend our time A lot of times trying to figure out through predestination and for knowledges and what were we and what and we've left off what we really are now you know that we're living our predestination right you know that we're proving whether or not we did have any part to do with this situation by what we do you realize that if there was anything about us whatsoever it would only be the eternal life that eternal life would have to not come here Eternal right or there wouldn't be no Plan of Redemption writing our names in the book when does he write our names in the book according to the Bible it was before the foundation of the world but when did he write it in this book that's right remember this is the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne that's right this is the book that's in heaven right and you know that there was no way to reveal it until the book was completed right right that's right CS didn't come off the book and the prophet in the 50s he tried to preach it yes but he preached the white hor RIT or was the Holy Ghost right so what truth he brought was truth yes but it was not perfect realization are you listening when the book is completed the prophet said then the lamb takes the book all right now the book was completed when John wrote the life's part come on the book was completed right when John wrote Because he wrote of the church ages he wrote of the tribulation he wrote of all he wrote everything down right 95 996 somewhere in there right but it was wasn't opened right that's right it was a closed book amen sure we saw certain things yes and things were preached because that was the faith of the fathers they had those things and brought us those things it was written down and we could follow it to a degree but we couldn't get into the Book of Revelation right because the Book of Revelation had the Bible sealed up some things we could read and see and believe we could believe in Jesus we we could believe in the New Birth we should have been able to believe in one God right yeah cuz the disciples preached it y but you see the book had to be completed when it once it was completed it had to wait almost 2,000 years before the lamb could take the book and break the seal y right then it would become an open book or in other words an Open Bible M this Bible's open now you want to know what it says read it right you want to know what it means get the prophet right right ask the prophet what does that scripture mean why because it's an open book right you see it wasn't open until the seals broke right and it's not open to you and I until the seals break to us that's right you see when I tried my best to get you to to listen and and follow after those things of the opening of the seals right and yet people are say we sure we understand the SE my horse rider Antichrist how do you know it's an antichrist Prophet said it yeah oh y ouch try thank God Amen but what's your Revelation that's it well I don't have one I told you about years ago a man I preached I had a revelation of something and a man that used to be my best friend that sit in my home and eat and we Fellowship weekly and preach for him all the time he preached here and he sent me word he didn't want I done do me no more cuz I got off the message cuz I said I had a revelation he said brother bram's the only one who got the Revelation he said that's my Revelation that brother Bram had the Revelation I said well you know it's kind of hard and he said the same thing I did he said he had a revelation I said I had one right come on he even think about what he said he said he had a revelation that brother Ram had the Revelation well that was a revelation to him all I said was and I had a revelation of the same thing brother randam said and belied it right you see what we can do we can get tied up in our own little things but get back to what I'm talking about if if it doesn't happen here what was seen back there that would make that false prophecy right right you understand that point Everybody follow me right if it don't happen on earth right then what was written in heaven would be false that would be some man's idea opinion wrote down but when it happens on Earth exactly like that happened right now down through time they dealt with a partiality right right the book was open to the degree of what the discip IPL had preached right that's what I try to get the point in there the Bible opened to the point of what the faith of the fathers had talked about and you could preach one God brother around did before the seals broke Paul did Peter did John all them preached one God water baptism no eternal hell and all that they all preached it that was before the opening of the seals right but you see the book was still just partially open that's right brother R said we could what do he call it uh guess at it or Ponder probe probe thank you he said we could prob at it but said we couldn't see it that's right why because the seals did not come off the book all right 1963 the seals broke to the prophet he came off the book right amen then he could see the book right he could see what happened in heaven you know why because he knew what was happening in heaven was right then happening on Earth that's right come on is it in the Bible that the lamb T the book right what is that about five Revelation five Y where the lamb took the book amen see when the lamb took the book that Prophet went right there and started from right there he started in chapter 4 but he went into chapter 5 right and he started talking about the lamb that had took the book man and that's what he said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and and there goes a white horse rider he said thereby that's got to be the Antichrist right cuz he seen that fell that guy read your first seal he seen him riding off right the seal was broke to the prophet but have they been broke to you and I that's right when they're broke to you and I we'll quit trying to figure out what went on in heaven we start trying to realize to what I what is happening on Earth does it match heaven right right amen right I preached that five or six years ago matching pieces When In Heaven There Was An Angel flew across when that angel flew across there was a man on Earth named Martin Luther that called the revelation of the just shall live by faith that's exactly the angel in heaven it turned the world upside down like I told you many people tried to protest the Catholic church but it didn't work the moravians how you pronounce it right you doing good was the ones that Tau taught John Wesley the truth of sanctification but that was not that angel in heaven right but when Mark when John Wesley preached sanctification and got it in the way he's supposed to be bringing it and match that angel in heaven now listen when this end time Prophet came on Earth there was a seventh angel right amen right right spoke of in the Bible he had a lot to do with it and he brought the message right then you can see that seven Angel where was he at he would have to be a prophet to match what was in heaven right because in heaven it already been written some scriptures Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 right somebody had to mat at down here right right when it was matched down here it was because it was already there that's right right we read there where the Prophet said we dealt in the reals of the immortal by having eternal life you realize what I'm saying the prophet said when the bride realizes who she is that's right y yep and what she's doing here he said Satan will be powerless right what he said amen well I tell you what brother I just can't see poweress what are you looking for him to be that's right see there's are negative confessions when are we going to start confessing it I mean we're going to confess that God sent a prophet let's confess it in rap way let's confess that God sent a prophet to fulfill all these scriptures to speak of a bride come on right that's right but you don't hear that it's only speaking of him is what people preach yeah spoken words Original Seed he said this Prophet would be pointing to the skies at a word MN bride that's right when we match that they would seen there that's right you say well where do we match I mean you say actually what part of that word do we match the Plan of Redemption has been understood since Calvary right but that was where he laid the Cornerstone y you remember we read that's right who laid the Cornerstone the Cornerstone was laid on the day of Pentecost right Calvary in the day of Pentecost Jesus Christ but the headstones coming the end time amen see Church those people down through time could shout about their religion they had we were talking the other day in my wife was you know the people will say it you know we come to America for for freedom of religion that's not why we came here we came here for freedom from religion we didn't come here freedom of religion and we brought the same junk over here with us we come here as freedom from religion to get away from the Catholic church and all those things this nation was not established on the freedom of religion it established on the freedom from religion see that's what they're doing now is they're forcing all religions together right under a One World Government y to bring it right back to where we tried to get away from all that stuff but you see Church it wasn't time down to there to see it like we're supposed to see it you followed me the prophet read and preached as a matter of fact I think all of these quotes but one that I gave you one of them I think is 64 matter of fact I think all of them are below all the six I gave you are below 60 below the 63 of the opening of the seals come on on the day of Pentecost they saw the Plan of Redemption those people were rejoicing because they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right yep amen that matched in heaven as each Church age came forth and a bride of that age was sealed in by the Holy Spirit they were rejoicing right because they match what that was Amen brother R said when the seals broke to John said he saw his name you didn't see John wrote down CU under the that the prophet said it's not Samuel Dale is not there he said it be that name it was before the foundation of the world John saw his name before the foundation of the world why because he saw what was taking place on earth right John is taking up to see what's going on in heaven right right John takeen to heaven to see what's going on but he's rejoicing was because he saw his name and he was down here on Earth go he s over there of P right right and he wrote no wonder the prophet would say John heard the Thunders sure that's just opening to me he said John heard the Thunders well because he heard the complete Plan of Redemption right cuz listen church that's what I'm trying to get you to see what I want you to see is this part if a bride of Jesus Christ don't become the word to raise the rest from the dead then all that's behind us is false prophecy amen that's right amen come I don't mind stating it that way you say you get in trouble with God no I believe that's what he's wanting me to say it's all depended upon this end time bride to see the complete Plan of Redemption not a partial realization that's right amen right but to see the complete Plan of Redemption yep that's right and Shout about it Rejoice about it that's right come on because if you was up there in eternal life y then you're looking down here where you got it at CU you didn't come here with eternal life cuz if you did you didn't need no Plan of Redemption right that's right amen that's right you don't need to be redeemed if you have eternal life right oh we just need a new body you know that's what everybody preaches y That's Right would you see church we are the people that's got to see ourselves amen but the only way you can know you're there is to have eternal life here right amen that's right if you don't have eternal life here and don't know who you are then there's no way to know you back there right right what I say it we spend our time trying to figure out what we was back there instead of spending our time in in our own Holy Ghost understanding to see that Christ lives in you and I now amen that's right the Plan of Redemption is what they saw they saw the coming of this Redeemer a savior amen they saw Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago right right come on you'd have to agree with that but they saw all the way down through time of each age and the Bride of that age and she would realize who she is and come forth as a part of the word for that age but there's a word for this age amen because they didn't see a partial realization that's right and if you was back there if that eternal life you have toight not wasn't back there it never will be there cuz you don't have eternal life right that's right that simple brother de don't know whether I have eternal life or not well then start seeking God for that's right amen that's right it's like I told somebody the other day that they told me that they had the new birth they had eternal life I said yep in the day I got eternal life from that day till now I said I've never stopped seeking for eternal life right right that's right what do you mean you got it you don't have it if that's what you think that's right so that's what you think that you got eternal life but that don't make you more desirous right amen of eternal life that's right and you don't have eternal life that's right right right and then it's the only thing like I said it's the only thing that I've always wanted to give away cuz I know I can't I can't give it away that's right like I told my wife we were talking today and she made a good statement about it I won't go through what we were talking about I'll just make the statement of what we concluded finishing up she said honey you got to realize one of these days everybody don't want to hear you I said I've realized that a long time ago right but I said if the day ever comes I'm paraphrasing it where it won't get around in wrong thing yeah I said but if the day ever comes that I don't have a burden in my heart that's for people that's right that's and want people to see this message irregardless of whether they want to hear me or not y if the day ever comes that I don't want people to hear the word I'm lost y that's right I know I was lost but it doesn't matter if people turn me down if they don't want to hear me I still want you to hear about Jesus Christ right that's right I still want you to hear about eternal life amen I still want you to know the truth amen I've always said God one thing let me preach eternal life to my kids y because I want them to have eternal life don't you amen that's right then let's preach eternal life let's live eternal life the Bible says you're written Epistles right right known and read of all man right if nothing else we got one thing that that people have all in common about well you ain't nothing but word word word L that's what everybody says about it right you ain't nothing but word word word I just don't know nothing else to be I'm sorry I love everybody and I like I said I'd love to have everybody and I'll do the best I can I'll keep preaching as long as I can right to try to get people to see eternal life amen but listen folks let's quit trying to figure out if we up our dancing around let's start dancing down here you know what then you'll find out for certain you was up there because we'll match exactly what was there when we match what's there it'll all be over with as I said Martin Luther when he matched what was in heaven the just shall live by faith had to strike the Earth that's right and a man had to carry the message when Malachi 4 and Luke 17 Revelation 10:7 and all that when it come time that it was to be made known on Earth in the days of the son of man that Luke 1730 there had to be a man on Earth Amen to cure that message that's right he said I wonder if them other Messengers seen that you remember He said Each messenger would get maybe another name change he said I wonder if they saw that you see he didn't see it until the seals broke right right that's it the seals broke to him then he could Rejoice about eternal life you say yeah but the most horrible life that he lived was after those seals broke I agree with you because the devil fought him in every way that he could I Ain talking about a horrible life that he done wrong I'm talking about a horrible life that everybody turned against him until he wound up preaching to a handful of people in a trailer out there when his early Ministry he's preaching to 3 to 500,000 or something yep you see they just couldn't see that's right I've got the magazines where they say fast and pray for God to send a prophet right M he said they feel the pool but they don't see the day that's right come on if you're shouting before the world then you ain't going to stop now you going to shout now cuz they didn't see a partial realization that's what happened on Earth they saw right a complete Plan of Redemption amen now listen they saw it for Body Spirit soul and world and they was rejoicing yeah that's right the prophet even said he said the first time Angel was saying they was in heaven he said the first time on Earth was when Jesus Christ was born right right but they sang in heaven when they seen us rejoicing about what would take place us not as people and identities but as part of almighty God Amen right that's right and we are part of almighty God now by the new birth so negative has become positive partial is become perfect what were they seeing they was looking down here seeing us what was we seeing if we're part of that back there we was looking down here to see what we're doing right now right we would back there as people we back there in Jesus Christ that's right yep but those children are now upon the Earth amen right and if we don't believe that we are them who's going to be it come on brother I'm just going to believe I'm one of them don't you come on let's sing that one of them because I I just want believe it I'm one of them we was at a meeting one time and this big certain brother he got up there and we singing that song and he got up behind he said which one of them because you got this group and that group and that group I didn't like CU you see I want to be one of them amen that's right I want to be one of them that was rejoicing in my salvation before the world 181 if you want to say anything brother Dale the best way I can make it to you ever who that was looking down look down here to see and sees this end time when the complete Plan of Redemption is made known why can't we rejoice and be happy why be afraid why worry amen who's afraid of what that's right oh look what they going to do look about this that no they can't do anything unless God right allows them to do it and if it is it's for our benefit right amen that's right so let's rejoice and have a good time in okay go ahead brother there are people heart I'm so glad I are you I'm I want with rejoicing back you know what you Prophet said if we have eternal life we were shouting with the children of Israel when they crossed the Red Sea we rejoicing when David kill theive let me be if we WR ready qu be acquainted with
