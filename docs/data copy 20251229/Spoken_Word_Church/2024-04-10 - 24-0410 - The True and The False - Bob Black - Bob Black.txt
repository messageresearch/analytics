be back in the house of the Lord we had a we had a good time visiting our kids Zach and Lily and they're doing all right amen just want to let you know amen and uh we had a good time with uh brother Shambo and and the Saints up there um but tonight I want to speak on a a little scripture from second Thessalonians chapter 2 um verses 1 and 8 1 to8 and then we'll read Matthew chapter 24 let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word tonight Lord Jesus and Lord we just ask Lord that you'll Lord give us a little pickme up here in the middle of the Week Tonight Lord Lord you know all the needs and all the things Lord Jesus that are laying there in the in the believer's hearts Lord Jesus Lord I thank thank you that we've got a Word of Deliverance and a help Lord in the and the in the hour and the season that we're living in Lord Jesus to just help us whatever we're going through whatever trials or or all around us Lord Jesus you give us a word to help us Lord we just ask your blessing upon the service tonight Lord bless your people Lord God bless these words Lord as they're spoken we ask in your name amen amen now uh as I so as I'm as I read the scripture just kind of meditate on the on the uh thought maybe tonight that there's a true and there's a false and and of course we want to be a real genuine True Believer and of course there's a there's also you it's unavoidable to know that there's a there's a false as well and if we can look in the scripture and just kind of see what we're identified as and and if we're identified with the wrong thing then make adjustments and uh and and repent and get on the right track am but in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 if we read it it says now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or betr trouble neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or is worshiped so that he is God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity do already work only he who now lth will let until be until he be taken out of the way and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the mouth with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming you may be seated Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word so brother is talking about or or Paul here is talking about the uh the mystery of iniquity that already work only he who now lth will let you think about that what a strange say way that Paul had with his words he that and brother R will say he God that L us will let until he the church Christ the bride be taken out of the way and you know we you meditate on that we know that one day Christ is going to step out of the way one one day he's going to take us out of the way he's going to just just remove remove move the holy ghost from the earth and then the wicked one shall be revealed but but even back then even back then the deceiver when Paul was preaching the deceiver was already working so in other words there's something fake and you think back there all the way back in that Ephesian Church age Paul was preaching a real genuine gospel that birthed real genuine Believers that produced something real genuine and then alongside of them there was something fake all the way back then that Faker that Faker the devil work and that he could get himself inside of inside of men's hearts and get them deceived and get them to preach something that wasn't right even though they might be anointed by the real genuine Holy Ghost and have a real calling in their life that want to see Souls saved and want to go to church and want to do things that are right and want to sit in the Pew and all those kind of things but but yet down in their heart there's something wrong oh you think about think about what makes somebody right and what's somebody somebody wrong what makes somebody real and true and genuine real True Believer and what makes them fake what makes them fake where that devil that deceiver is down on the inside now in Matthew 24 if we'll read that Matthew 24 24-28 it says for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible I'm so glad that's put in there if if it were possible but of course that means it's close it's very deceptive Ive they shall deceive the very elect behold I've told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret Chambers believe it not now you think about what that really is saying there oh you you got to have a revelation of where you can find God somebody will say well if you go over to this church or you follow this movement or you follow these men or follow this man over there like like that then follow try to find a particular movement that you can get behind and grab onto somebody's coattails and follow them in like that but it don't work you got to have a real personal revelation of for yourself oh you see that's actually what what what's taking place when you come to church is is we're not trying to get you to a particular man behind the platform or particular movement like that but we're trying to get you to an in to introduce you to Jesus Christ we got the paintings up here on the wall if you can get in touch with Jesus Christ get in touch with the male if the male can fertilize the the egg if if if the union can take place then something will begin to happen and you'll have your own relationship with God and that's what will carry you through so if they say unto you behold he's in the desert go not forth behold he in the secret Chambers believe it not for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even under the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcass is there where will the Eagles be gathered together wherever the carcass is now we were we were up there at uh that when we were visiting Zach and Lily we were sitting out there looking over the field and there was a big old eagle flying and and we were of course you know the eagle he's he's flying around that what a beautiful sight flying over the field looking looking for food and we used to have this little joke when Zach was little he he he uh he might do his finger like a rhinoceros and he say he's looking for food well well that that's what that eagle is doing is looking for food and that's what any Eagle is going to be doing is looking for food and that's where you're going to find the eagle where the carcass is where the where the where the fresh kill and the season and the hour that we're living in that's where you're going to find the eagle amen cuz Eagles Eagles real spiritual Eagles are going to be where the word is I like how brother Chris Long explained Eagles there's all kind kind of different Eagles there's there's bald eagles and this kind of eagle and that kind of Eagle what kind of eagle we talking about we're talking about a bride Eagle we're talking about a supernatural Eagle I like that where eagle and this kind of Eagle is going to be where the word is so we're following the word we're following the word we're following the truth to a real genuine true Christian Life something that ain't fake something that's real and what's going to differentiate it what's going to what's going to be the way that you can tell is is the word the word is the thing that tell what kind of message are you bringing are you bringing a real message like those those those women that come from the from the Tomb of Jesus and they came they had a message but he's alive he's risen what about P Peter on the day of Pentecost when he come down and he had a re he knew what he was talking about and he was he had a real Revelation he uh the the word that he had been H that he had been taught for all those years that he had been with Jesus was quickened and he knew what he was talking about when he came down from that upper room now brother Brown when he was preaching the first seal he said we were talking the other day about people who getting off the track it's just like shooting a Target if that gun is perfectly balanced perfectly trained inside it it's got to hit the target unless that Barrel moves or twists or vibrations throws it off or wherever or a wind puff wherever it starts off at there's only one way to do it's come back to where it left the track and start again if it's going to hit the target if it doesn't why it just doesn't hit the target so what's what's happening as we follow the word the word is leading us leading us from here to here to here to until we just hit right on the Target now if we get off the word then we're going to miss the target if you get off the word into some seven Thunders doctrine of Two Souls Doctrine or some kind of strange way to believe this or that or strange way to believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost or you get off to where you know people people have read this sermon that I'm I'm mixing two sermons tonight if you hadn't figured that out the anointed ones of the end time and the the first seal so let's squish those two sermons together and you got what I'm preaching at but people read the anointed ones at the end time until they come away with the well we don't need any kind of move of the spirit and so you start going off that track and you're wrong you're wrong you you start going off the track well you can be fake because you've got you can be fake with a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost and your spirit but no message and so that doesn't mean let's just put away the any kind of move of the spirit though and on the other hand that doesn't mean let's get away get so fundamental and you know you can balance in everything and so that's what brother Ram said he said and and that's the way in studying the scripture I believe you'll never figure it with your mind it takes the lamb to reveal it the lamb alone can do it oh what a what a strange thing that when you read the Bible you don't read it like Shake you're reading a Shakespeare novel or or you're reading it like some kind of uh something you find in the supermarket line or something that you don't read it like a newspaper like that but the only way you can really understand it is to be in touch with the author that's right you got to you got to know the author if you really know the author then the book begins to come alive it begins to change it's different you I I I certainly know I remember when I used I started reading the Bible we were talking about this this weekend you start reading the Bible when you first become a Christian and it's that King James language and you're like I don't know what in the world this is saying what does this mean and you just keep forging ahead you keep reading you ask questions you look in you look in the message and search for that answer about what this scripture means and you just keep reading and after a while you start understanding the language and after a while you start understanding it better and then after a while then you can really read between the lines oh and then after a while it starts popping off the page you see that's actually what people people know maybe you're sitting here tonight you're like I wish I wish they would preach on the Seven Seals and that I could get that little that little nugget that's really going to take me into the Rapture but then when the seals begin to open up to you you realize that the seals have been being preached all along and you just didn't realize it you didn't realize it until the seals really open up to you and you begin to see the veil begin to pull off over your life and what's happened to the church over the last thousand 2,000 years what's happened to you as an individual and then it becomes real to you so see there's something happening as we're coming to church there's something really H super natural happening if you really fall in love with God and it's and it's exciting to you it's exciting to you it's it and brother R will say you'll never figure it with your mind you'll never figure it with your mind it takes the lamb to reveal it the lamb alone can do it amen now thank God that we've got a lamb amen thank God that we've got a lamb that that there's a lamb that's sitting on the throne that come off the throne to reveal these things to us to to signify that he's already paid the price that he's the one that's worthy and he's made us worthy by his righteousness to look in the book and read it we got a lamb to reveal these things so that means that God is going to have a a target hdden church a church that if they'll just stay with the word they're going to hit the target that there's going to he's going to have a church that is balanced that's right down the line that doesn't go off to this side or that side in everything right down the line he's going to have somebody that's balanced and he's going to have a church that is unmovable and a church that is true now that's what we're talking about tonight true versus false now it isn't that what the first seal is about you got a lion and you got that white horse rider there's something true and something fake now I I think that should stir everybody up that to begin to look into things like that that ought to wake us up here on a Wednesday night service when we're right here in the middle of the week and we've only been preaching just a few minutes what's the Target that we're shooting for the Target is Christ the target is Christ for Christ to be completely revealed and his bride to be completely revealed and you as I and I as individuals for Christ to just take over to just take everything over and and the target is Christ so that means that the target is those seven Thunders under the seventh seal Thunder Thunder against the devil Thunder where it's actually lived out and it's manifested and that that'll be thunder that'll be a Thunder against the devil where not just something that you know so you could tell somebody how much you know but actually lived out in your life so that it's Thunder that the devil can come and maybe maybe give a give you a good little mind battle but you recognize it's the devil give you a good little test but you can stand the test because there something real in your life something that's not make believe and the seventh seal brother R said now do you notice on the opening of this seventh seal also it's in a three-fold mystery this one I have will speak and I've spoke that it is the mystery of the seven Thunders the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery it'll be right at the coming of Christ because Christ said no one knew when he would return amen right there under the seventh seal the seven Thunders which is the mysteries of each seal the Mysteries so now what we're talking about tonight is you canare it what you heard somebody say about the seals you can understand all the terminology you can know the symbols you can know the seals technically you can know all the details of one God and you can have brother randam statements memorized but now the Thunder is the voice of God to you God revealing himself to you amen God revealing himself and putting himself on display in you cuz you know when a revelation when God gives you a revelation the side effect of the Revelation is is works because faith is a revelation and when you got faith it's going to work itself out it's going to act itself out if you got a real Revelation it's going to change your behavior it's going to change the way you look at things and change the way you act it will change everything if you got a real Revelation like we had uh last Sunday you just had a baptism if you got a real Revelation you need to go down to the water and be baptized you're going to do it amen if you got a real revelation of of how to treat others and it begins to change the way all of a sudden if you got a real Revelation you can treat somebody nice that that you know don't like you and it begins to change now that there's there's a real Thunder the Thunder the revelation of what's under these seals in Revelation chapter 6 it says when I I saw when the L opened one of the seals I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and brother an would say no doubt John might have jumped up in the air when a thunder roared in Revelation chapter 10 and it says is he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders utter their voices it's got to be lived it's got to be something genuine something real something real a genuine Christian Life a genuine Sanctified life I'm now I'm debating whether to keep to to kind of skip over some of these or not I've got so much Snokes tonight and I know it's Wednesday night and I'm trying not to get y'all upset with me he preached the seals on Wednesday night something real so the Thunder what's the Thunder is going to reveal it's going to reveal John chap pretend I am my father are one and that's when the Jews took up stones to Stone him I am my father what why cuz the seal the Thunder is Christ it's Christ revealed it's Christ what what taken over it's a takeover by Christ that Christ completely can completely take you over until your confession will be I and my father are one I I oh to think that you could say we can come to a place where you can say I don't do nothing except the father shows me I only do that which you know the father show me in John chap 14:30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me and God wants us to have that same confession that I don't have nothing in the devil I don't have anything to do with the Devil the devil will try to give me some kind of mind battle and make me upset with somebody make me uh you know and just just you can say no that's so what's the seals reveal it reveals something genuine something true now the first seal certainly it's going to reveal something genuine and something real and something false and deceptive so there you see that seal being open there's something genuine something something true something real oh thank God for a real gospel tonight thank God for a real baptism of the Holy Ghost and a real message that we've got we've heard and it's going to reveal something false and something deceptive and in Revelation chapter 6 it says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering un conquering now now of course we know we know that progression every there's a progression in in in everything justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a progression from angels to sarap from all the way up to cheram and you think what cherub what a cheram represents it represents that genuine power the genuine power power of the Holy Ghost a genuine a holy life somebody that's really filled with the baptism of Holy Ghost something that's real something that's true and brother Brown said in the seed shall not be air with a shook he said now remember according to Revelation the whole mystery of the book is sealed with Seven Seals that the reformers didn't have a chance to bring forth the four stages of reforming the four stages of four beasts that went out to meet the four powers of the world y the first went out was what a what a strange thing those four creatures that everywhere they go they're always they're never going back they're always going forward now isn't that the same way with a Christian Life we don't go backwards we're going forwards everything we do is forward no matter what's the whether it's the lion or if you're in that stage of the ox or the man or the eagle no matter what your stage is you're always going forward and it's the holy ghost power there's power in your life now in the in the in the Wilderness when Ezekiel Saw it there was the wheel in the middle of the wheel cuz they were on their Journey but it's it's that power the power of God and every case and he said what was the first went out a lion to meet the Roman age that was the word the original he is the lion of the tribe of Judah Christ himself went to meet that age and sat oh you think you got a a real genuine Revelation from God that God give you something genuine and true that's something that the devil cannot fake that's right now the devil can fake everything else he can fake coming to church and liking the worship and run up and down the aisle he can fake wanting souls to be saved he could fake he can fake everything else but he can't fake the word no he can't fake a real revelation of the word that's why when you get up in the morning and you're meditating on the word in the morning and you you start reading your Bible and and God just comes down you you know you feel that presence of the Lord and you start reading the Bible this this scripture is from me this scripture is going to help me today and it starts meaning something to you oh that's God that's something that can only come from God Amen cuz the devil can't fake a revelation Satan is a faker and a deceiver impersonating gifts and tongues and religion y and churchianity but he cannot impersonate the living revealed word amen no he can impersonate everything else brother but not the living revealed word amen now brother Brown said Satan can interpret anything he wants to and impersonate any kind of a gift he said I hope you're learning but he can't know this it's not even written in the word it's a total secret how can he not know this because it's a revelation right man you're only going to get this by knowing the author by Falling In Love With God by being able to read between the lines and that's something the devil can't fake I mean the devil yeah the devil can't fake so Satan Satan can't understand he can't apprehend he can't comprehend he can't know what a Believer knows if you're a real genuine believer sitting here tonight you got something that the devil can't the devil can't even prob at the Devil the devil don't know nothing about what a genuine Holy Ghost filled believer knows tonight and a revelation ain't fake right it it can it it can't come by Fai it's not given by a faker a revelation can only come by God Amen oh see sometimes we make we make things so complicated in the Bible but look how simple it is but brother R preached Christ revealed in Simplicity hidden in Simplicity revealed and the same and we make it so complicated and then you look at your own life and think how how how simple your life is you're just as simple as a Manger as a little stable and God God will come down in that stable and revealed himself and he can come down in your heart and reveal himself and that's as simple as the seals is that God can come down and hide himself in the Simplicity of your life and we'll make it all complicated as complicated as can be but it's so simple that God can come down and Tabernacle in your life and reveal himself in you reveal himself in a little church in Lula Georgia in the middle on the side of the road and what is this here y'all y'all changing things up on me all kinds of electronics back here and the first seal brother R said who is that white horse rider he said you're not blind you see who it is it's that Antichrist and that deceitful Spirit that's gone now and crept in so we got the genuine the genuine article and a fake amen the genuine and the fake so what the seal reveal it reveals how do I tell how how do I tell the difference right brother and what what's the story of my life how do I get rid rid of iniquity all those things all those I I I'm I'm going lay that to the side for now it's all right he said brother R said now seeing all this accumulation of evidence that the hour that we now live in I think it's a good thing to rehearse these things and to draw them out since the seals has been opened and find out the truth of these things as God has been so loyal to us with his great to show us these things he said I want you to know us here in Matthew 24 Jesus used the term of Christ Christ's not Christ but Christ's plural not singular Christ therefore the word Christ means the anointed one amen and then if it's anointed there will be not only one but many anointed the anointed ones see a false Christ brother what's anointed ones have to do with the first te seal it's fake it's fake and an anointed one is something that's fake amen a false Christ a faker somebody that's faking they love going to church and they love the worship and they love praise and and and maybe they they love doing doing what they believe they they're doing for the kingdom of God but down on the inside is fake and all down through the scripture you can see those two Vines Twisted together all the way from Cain Cain love going to church chur he loved offering his sacrifice balam loved he was a prophet of God he and his prophecy was true but his message was wrong you see the prophecy was correct but the message was wrong how do you tell what's wrong the message the word that the thing down on the inside is all cankered and twisted and wrong but on the outside they're in church and they're loving the seven altars and that bam had all the worship and everything was just looked just right along with what what what the real true genuine was but there was something lacking and he said a false Christ is a false anointed because Christ is the anointed there will be false anointed ones and they'll call themselves prophets but how will you recognize them by the word that's how you know it by the word whether they are right how will we recognize them will be by the word amen they might heal the sick they might Open the Eyes of the Blind and deny the word stay away from it amen don't care what it is stay with that word regardless amen because many times I've seen Voodoo and all kinds of things take place under healing so what what's he saying now you you might be all covered in oil but what's the oil covering that's right you take some oil and you put it over a cocko bur yeah and there's still a cocko bur underneath there and that's what happens sometimes people come to church you'll go to a good old camp meeting and you get real covered over in oil and then you leave the camp meeting and wonder like that question brother R asked how do I overcome you just keep slipping back and you know you go to a good Revival and you come back but you slip back and looking at pornography you slip back and talking dirty you slip back into cussing you slip back into your old friend group you just slip back and you just can't live a real genuine Christian Life it's because you got the oil covering over something that's fake you your message is is your message the word in your heart ain't there what it is is the devil's in there and and you know you got to get the devil kicked out cuz you can't give the devil the Holy Ghost how you going to give the devil the new birth you got to get him kicked out amen you got to kick him out first and and to kick him out what's what what does it take to kick him out you got got to put something in there and you put you put the word get the real word of God down in your heart and you watch The Devil can't stand around you know sometimes this might be a little silly silly way to put it but we we talk about honed houses sometimes and uh how you go to you know we we kind of maybe joke about how you know if there was if I saw the door to my house being open and closed or whatever I'd get busy and I'd be playing tapes in my house house I'd be pray I would you know you don't you you wouldn't put up with with something like I think brother Wayne Lawson was preaching along those lines he said if if if I if I knew there was a my house was haunted it it's time for the devil to get out well well what if your house what if your your your natural house is haunted if the devil was in your natural house it it behooves us to get busy and and figure out a way to get him out now if playing tapes and setting the atmosphere in a in a haed house could get that spook out if you start singing songs of praise and worship it'll get that spook out well what about the spook in your soul if you want to get rid of him you start meditating on the things of God you start reading your Bible and and and and and listening to sermons and thinking about the things of God and and lay aside all that gobbly goo of the world just forget watching all the Marvel movies and all the all the Tommy Ro that your friends want you to look at and you watch The Devil the devil leave the devil's going to have to leave because the word will boot him out yes sir well the strong man comes to the house and there there might be a strong man that he's as Jesus told that Parable he's got all his treasures and everything but when a stronger than him comes to the house you got to go you got to go and that's that's how you cast out Devils is the word will cast The Devil out every time you see somebody might you know a young person might come up and say well I I want to get free of whatever the spirit is and you you can pray over them and you can pour oil on them and all those kind of things things but if there's a cocklebur under that they're just going to go right back to the thing what what you got to do is just lay under the F I'm talking about the Fountain of the word you get busy get busy and get busy with kicking that thing out and you watch you watch God begin to get a hold of your life and God begin to take over and that's what's revealed in the seals how God will take over your life it's a takeover now now either the devil's going to take over or God's going to take over you can let you can let the devil take over your life or you can let God take over and how you let God take over is you get in the word and just lay under the word just get get in the word fall in love with Christ draw nigh unto him and He will draw nigh unto you and you watch him just begin to take care of all the problems you might be covered in oil but what's the oil covering a grain of weed or a cleur and how you tell the difference is what's the message what's the messag Peter on the day of Pentecost come out with a message he began to preach Jesus and tell him how repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and he had that was his message cuz that was what was under the oil but but the Pharisees they come out why are you healing somebody on the Sabbath cuz that was a nasty old cucker a nasty old something underneath it like just trying to do good but yet doing evil without even realizing it doing evil thinking they're doing good cuz it was a cabore something nasty and horrible even though they might have been anointed by the genuine Holy Ghost even though like uh Caiaphas was anointed when he spoke that uh what was it about uh yeah one one one must die I'm drawing a blank exactly how but anyway he he prophesied cuz he was covered the the anointing was on him and he spoke something that was true but yet the Jews went ahead and killed Jesus so what message is underneath brother R will say anointed one is one with a message and the only way the message can be brought out is by one that's anointed amen and that would be a prophet anointed amen there shall rise false anointed teachers anointed teachers but with an but anointed people with false teaching that's right anointed ones Christ plural prophets plural and if there is such a thing as a Christ singular than these would have to be anointed ones that their prophecy of what they were teaching would be the difference because they are anointed ones anointed on anointed a false message now so that begs the question now when we come to church what what do we come to church for you know there's a lot of people that come to church because they they they like they like the bait on the hook they like the the food that we serve they like the coffee downstairs they like they like the Happy atmosphere where we we throw our we give you love and we we you give you we give you that good old gospel hug and we we we draw you into our fellowship and everything there's people that come for that there's people that come because they want they want to share their story and they want people to hear and listen to them and fellowship but but those things can be faked those things can be good it's good it's good to fellowship and get in the anointing but what what about the main thing the main thing is to fall so in love with God Amen and so in love with the word that when somebody rubs you the wrong way you don't just give up and go away and turn around to fall so in love with god Till It's God that you're in love with not the church not the people that might betray you and might might deceive you and might do something wrong to you it might hurt your feelings but it's God it's God that you've got to fall in love with it's the word that you got to fall in love with the word it's the relationship with the word that's the real thing that's the real genuine thing that will carry you through when all else fails men will fail you people will fail you people will go different ways things of life will happen but there's one that will stick closer to you than a brother and that's the word that's Jesus Christ so now now that's what we're trying to get you to when you come to church to not draw you to a particular place or a particular person or group or a movement or anything like that but to Jesus Christ cuz if you get in touch with with Jesus Christ oh if you get with Jesus Christ he'll make everything different don't you want to be with somebody that can boot that devil out that can kick that devil out and change your life and change your nature and make you something real and something genuine and reveal these seals to you that Something's Happened in your life that God is on the scene something real and something true and that is not a fake oh we don't want fakers we want something genuine and we've got a recipe for a real genuine Christian Life laying here in the pages of the Bible and the pages of this message that God has given us in this day and what look at what a false message will bring a resurrection without death or you can have a resurrection but you don't have to die a false message birth without dying out maturity without suffering it all sounds good but it's wrong shaking hands with an Elder's evidence God can't do it but you can like Satan told even the the days of Miracles are passed see well you can be Anointed with a real genuine Holy Ghost but the message would be wrong and the message is what proves whether it's genuine or whether it's fake amen the rain falls on the just and the unjust now listen to this Parable that Jesus told in Matthew Chapter 5 he said I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you now listen to how Jesus explains this that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good think about what a good God we have that there can be somebody terrible he made his son to rise on Hitler he made his son to rise on musolini so he's saying if I can do that why can't you and he sendeth rain on the just and the unjust amen we've got such a good God that he'll send his anointing on an unbeliever in the church he'll send his anointing on a faker maybe somebody that won't ever ever really come to the true knowledge of the truth but yet God is so good that he'll give a blessing in church he maybe maybe he'll heal he healed him in a prayer line because that's that's the kind of good God that we have he sends his reain on the just and the unjust so what's that what's the parable that we can get what's the message we can get out of that if God can bless the faker why can't you if God can be good to a faker why can't you and brother R said now someone might say to me do you believe that that anointing on those on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine holy spirit of God upon a person and yet they are false that the genuine holy spirit of God can be on a person and they're fals both the weed and the weeds live by the same anointing from Heaven both of them Rejoice over it the same holy spirit that anoints the church get that gives them desire to save Souls that gives them the power to perform Miracles it falls on the unjust the same as the just the very same spirit so that means that the same spirit that makes you want to go to church can make an anointed one want to go to church The Same Spirit the same Holy Ghost spirit that makes you want to see Soul saved can make an anointed one want to see Soul saved I remember my dad telling the story of growing up in the in the Church of God of Prophecy and he said he got in the car he's just a little fell and he got in the car with this preacher and he said uh uh boy if you want to if you want to know how to make money then be a preacher but those people are anointed they want to help and they want to see Souls saved but their message is wrong their their motives and their objectives and everything is wrong because they're in it for the wrong things they're trying to they but they they want to go to church they want to see they want to see Soul saved that same holy ghost that makes you want to see a sinner saved can make an anointed one the same holy ghost that makes you want to worship and want to praise God and makes you want to be in the atmosphere can make an anointed one I want to worship right now see see why the scripture says it can be close it can be so close that same holy ghost that makes you want to help somebody can make an anointed one want to help somebody that same holy ghost that makes you want to sing in church can make an anointed one want to sing a special in church right but be false amen a false believer or a false teacher oh it's that word it's that Incorruptible seed down on the inside that makes you real or gen or or or fake the devil the devil is on the inside now what what and I'm not going to stay long tonight we'll be closing in just a minute but what how do how do we get that devil out that's what's in revealed in the seal how do you get the devil out if the devil's on the inside and he's the one that's making you fake making you act wrong and do wrong rejoice in church and worship in the spirit and like going to church but when you get home you act different and you can't treat your right wife or your husband right and you you're just horrible come on brother can't stay away from those sites on the internet that you shouldn't be looking at can't stay away from from alcohol or vaping or whatever whatever it is all those vices you just can't overcome cuz that Cocker is there and it's something wrong how you going to get that thing out that's why the first seal says there's a lion the lion went out how do you defeat the Devil that line is the word of God and you defeat the Devil every time by it is written it is written now what did Brother Brown say in the greatest battle ever fought everybody's got their eggshell that they got to get out and how do you get out of that eggshell whatever your eggshell is tonight you're going to come out just like an eagle does with your mouth speaking the word of God Amen you ain't going to come out speaking all kinds of negativity I don't think I don't think I'll ever be anything I don't think I don't think God's still moving in the church I don't think I'll ever be healed you're going to come out speaking his word amen if you're going to come out you're going to come out speaking it is written and that's how you going to get the devil out by speaking his word accepting his word believing it and you watch The Devil lead that's that's what in Proverbs chapter 16 it says by Mercy and Truth iniquity is Pur that's how you get rid of iniquity you get rid of it by Mercy and Truth oh if you can come with god with confidence like Paul said come with boldness believe belie in that he is a god of Mercy that when his Spirit begins to move it's moving with forgiveness if you come with a repentant humble heart that God will get to move and and you come Believing on his truth and you lay that your confidence in his Mercy with his truth there and you watch and see if you're your iniquity what's iniquity iniquity is something where you know you shouldn't be doing it you know you shouldn't be looking at those websites you know you shouldn't be living the way you are but you can't help it because you're a bur you just can't help it so you're going to do what a bur does you can't help it oh you what a fix that sin has put us in to know that you shouldn't do things but yet you do them anyway Bo but when God comes on the scene and Boots the devil out then you can do what God's word says and then you can walk in his word and live a straight holy life a straight separated holy life like all of these Saints in the Bible that we read about yes amen Moses and Aaron and Abraham see there it is some people come to church for the food and the fellowship and a pat on the back and somebody kind of bless the way that they're living and telling them they they're being a real good Christian isn't that how some people they want to get in favor with the minister so that the minister can say that you're doing all right oh but if you could get in favor with God don't seek favor from a minister or somebody you you know I I I I I meditated on us story that brother Ram told about the the the person in the symphony that they were playing up on the stage they were playing the violin and and and they at the end when they they finished their what they were playing they got a big Standing Ovation but the only one that they were interested in was their teacher now see the only the only we should only be interested in what God thinks of us so many times you'll hear negative feedback or positive feedback you know you preach a sermon and somebody won say I don't like that well might maybe they'll say well I think you're a really good preacher but you always you got to put those in their own special boxes cuz really ultimately don't matter except for what God thinks about you it really don't matter what the minister thinks about you or what your friend thinks about you what matters is what God thinks you about you so when you come to church don't come for the pat on the back but come for the revealed word because that's the thing that matters that's the thing that'll make you real genuine a real genuine believer it's a revelation of the word that's changing us and keeping us now that's what Paul said Paul said in 2 Thessalonians that that Faker that deceiver was already working the mystery of iniquity way back in that very first church age deceivers deceiving the people off into something yes a spirit working to deceive something fake working to the a spirit teaching something wrong about the New Birth teaching something oh you teach something wrong about the new birth and how you going to have a new a real genuine New Birth if it's just if it's all if the if the real if the real pathway is not laid out for you then it just messes everything up because the message is wrong and that's what the Antichrist is that Faker that Spirit of deception moving the spirit of deception moving and an anointed one an anointed one that ain't genuine they're anointed by the genuine Holy Ghost but their message is wrong Boy you know you hear good old gospel preaching that's right that out that ought to make a real Holy Ghost filled believer really Rejoice I I was talking to my wife the other day there's some real believer some real preachers around the message that I really hold in high regard but because of their stand and because they study and so forth but it seems like everywhere you go people don't really grasp what they've got I I was talking to my wife about some people at at another church way away from here many many states away from here and and the people were there were some people in the church oh man if you knew who I was talking about I I really admire this preacher but there's people in that church that are like I I just want to go back home I just want it's because everywhere you go people don't really realize what they got but if you really realize the treasure that you got with some real some real gospel preaching that where you got some ministers that will really study oh and and and I ain't trying to build nobody up not trying to build myself up I'm just trying to say it is what it is if you got some real genuine gospel preaching you ought to appreciate it you ought to appreciate all these brother brothers because because there's so much fake there's so much fake out there and and I've seen I've seen what fake does just up up there where we were this past weekend they they've been such through a such a horrible turmoil coming out of the uh well y'all know the the mess that came the great big Minister leaving the message and all the things that happen and it just caus fake fake causes such a mess oh but when you got a real genuine you ought to see people rejoice when they come out of that and they've got real genuine gospel preaching they really appreciate it on their feet the whole service I'm not saying y'all need to be on your feet and everything but it'd be nice but oh but oh but when you when you see something real genuine it's something to be appreciated brother R said in the anointed ones at the end time he said these trees the True Vine and false Vine he said you've heard me preach on that since from years ago how they've grown up together brought them in individuals and showed that from Cain and Abel the two vines that met at an altar right both of them religious both of them anointed both of them Desiring life and worshiping the same God and one was rejected and the other were received why why was Abel received and Cain rejected they both were religious they both were at church they both were worshiping they both brought their sacrifice the way the best way they thought they could and he said the only one that the only way that the one was received could have done anything different from his brother it was revealed to him for the Bible said by Faith by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain which God testified that he was righteous amen right what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you amen now now Faith if we really want to nail it down faith when you got a revelation you're going to Cast Away everything else that's contrary to that if God really reveals to you that you are healed it don't matter what the doctor says that's right it don't matter what the skeptic says in the parking lot well is it really for you it don't matter CU God revealed it to you that's what faith is Faith when when God really reveals to you that you're going to take a body change it don't matter what the politicians are doing it doesn't matter what how close their finger is to the nuclear button it doesn't matter nothing matters when God really reveals something to you and now there's the definition of what faith is Faith is how you look at Ron Spencer that he can he can uh you know throw up 10 times before he gets behind the pulpit and then when he preaches it's Faith that's holding them up it's faith faith well fa Faith does not look at the circumstances I I was watching him this might be on the internet but anyway I I I I was watching him preach that prayer line at the Louisiana camp and I was thinking my that's got to be something Supernatural that he can preach for three hours knowing all the battles and the troubles and everything he's in now he's an example of faith faith will hold you and faith is faith faith is it's something that is revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God Amen you know what God wants done and all you got to do is just walk in it you know what's going to happen because God words God's word says so that's right and it's based upon the word of God you think the True Vine and the false Vine both had the same anointing the water fell on both of them no wonder he warned us it would deceive the very elected if it was possible they look the same they're anointed the same but notice by their fruit it's what they produce that tells you the difference the fruit will tell it now see look at balum now he come on the scene he made his prophecies his prophecies were correct the anointing was correct but his message was we're all the same and that ain't right you think about maybe maybe today the hour that we're living in the anointing could be on someone to speak a prophecy correct but if they tell you well you don't need to come to church anymore just stay home you know the message is wrong the message ain't right see that's how close it is somebody come on the scene and say well I'm I'm I I've got these credentials or whatever and people will fall for it hook like and S Line and Sinker because they don't really know what the message is and the message the Revelation is how you tell the difference amen the word what is the fruit the word for the fruit of the season and we'll close on that as a musicians come forth the word that's what it is their teaching the teaching of what the teaching of the Season what time it is man's Doctrine denominational Doctrine or God's word for the season amen right now aren't you glad this afternoon that we've got God's word that his word is our influence his word is our everything and his word is that thing that will cast out the devil so if you need that devil cast out then just hang on to his word take his word and let it influence your life and just walk into his promises and let him take you over as we stand to our feet I I want a gospel takeover I want God to take me over and he's going to do it if you just believe his word he's going to take everything over till
