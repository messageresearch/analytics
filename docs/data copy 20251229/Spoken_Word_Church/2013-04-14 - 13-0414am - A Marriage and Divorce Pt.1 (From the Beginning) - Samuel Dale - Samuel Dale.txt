Matthew SE Matthew 19 and we'll read a few verses of scripture uh remember now the fellowship meeting will be here on the third Saturday in May and also I know you done prayed over these but remember brother Tracy Cash's father passed away so remember that we don't know any announcements he didn't this morning and all so we just pray the Lord would bless the family and be with each one of them and remember brother Bob black he's over in Alabama preaching this morning so Alabama is probably about 3T of Water Deep this morning because when he's he sweats like everything you know he he sent me a text and said he was holding his Bible close so he wouldn't lose it yeah he's better hold his Bible cuz he's capable of losing it you know sometimes so maybe they'll he'll get through today God will be with him and just pray the Lord would bless him amen and all of that amen amen any other announcements that we need to make uh we uh have the camera situation set up now so they can turn around at any given time and pick up any of you and see the hes in your nose is that good I mean it's it's really great they can really pull in and just right in your eyeball and could look at your eyeball and and see down in it but we appreciate the brothers getting all of this stuff ready and and everything and fixing it we just appreciate it you know that way uh the people can see and we can see we were lifing yesterday about it that you know get everything set up so good until people to just start staying at home and watching the service and I said well I can handle that I'll just sit in front of my desk we'll put a camera up and I'll stay at home so we won't have no problem we can solve the whole thing amen we announced that we were going to start a topic on marriage and divorce and I don't know how many services it will be and I tell you up up front I have no uh personal bones to pick with nobody anybody that sees this or whatever I just try to preach what I believe and about every five years I go through a series on marriage and divorce because of the young people coming in and the young children coming up and you know it doesn't uh I don't have anything I just try to say what the prophet says if I cross you I I'm not meaning to I didn't do it you know what I mean I if I cross your Doctrine I wasn't the one that caused you to have the doctrine so we just have to deal with those things within ourselves and and it wouldn't matter to me if I'm like brother random was we'll get around to it when his boy came you know and said he's going to get married and everything and he laughed at him because God didn't show it to him you know that he was going to do it he went out and got married you know and they had the wedding anull and he came back and wanted his father to do the wedding you know to his L I think is her name and brother R said no way you know so he had to stand them irregardless and we have to tell it like it is irregardless of where it fits in and all of that and I try to tell you the whole truth of it as much as I know amen and then you know that's the best I can say about it okay let's pray and then read Matthew 19 3-8 Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your love and your grace and to us thank you for this day that we have that Lord that we can come together and fellowship together around Thy word that we can Lord have an opportunity to be able to speak about you and Lord not then to have our own ideas or our thoughts because as a human mortal we would lean one way or the other because we're all that way but yet we will not try to lean but we will try to walk in the path of your love and Your Grace by the revealed word and just have your way now Lord and teach us to wait upon you guide each and everyone be with brother Bob there Lord as he's ministering today there in Alabama and just bless him and calm him down Lord because we know when doing like that it's kind of nervous and things but yet you'll be with him and it'll be fine Lord and we thank you and then just be with the with the cash family there brother Tracy and them the loss of their father and we pray that you would just bless them have your way now and keep us in Jesus name amen okay we will probably be reading this scripture on the basis of all of the the uh doings you know and uh getting it right I told him verse four so we will read verse three and the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and so for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twine shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more twine but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let no man put aunder they say unto him why did Moses then command to a writing of divorcement and to put her away he sath unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said I want to take my time and and try not to be too lengthy with with doing but yet to try to um do the best I can to answer and there questions then you write down the questions you know and and I'm honest sometimes questions are are asked and the person answering them doesn't know exactly what's on the person's mind that is am I turned on or I need to be turned up need to be turned up a little Joshy they're saying they're not being able to hear so we want everybody to be able to hear and just pull it up a little bit but don't peek out the ears okay that better we got you we can get up a little bit all right but I don't want to be offensive about anything but I want to try to tell the truth to do the best that I know of and as I was saying if you have questions write your questions out but write them as uh the basis of saying uh if so and so you know this is my case explain it cuz that way I'll be better able to answer it than to just ask me an overall question and we got a kind of comical thing that we do in the Bible study and somebody will have a question especially sister Susan may ask a question and she says I'm asking this for a friend of mine you know but uh that's okay ask GI for a friend this is not me but I'm wanting to know you know but uh we're glad to have our sister back there with us she's not a visitor with us she's welcome she's here with us but amen you know but all right now let's read a couple of scriptures and then get into some thoughts and and all and you know try to to be able to follow the prophet so let's go to Matthew 19 and just read this and go over it very slowly as we we go through Matthew and Mark as the reading and then we'll try to start making comments but I want to come in a little bit along the way as we go through to get your thoughts in your mind so it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these sayings he departed from Galilee and came into the coast of Judea under Jordan Beyond Jordan and great multitude followed him and he healed them there all right and what the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him they were not wanting to know uh an answer for themselves that's right they were wanting to trap him y right Y and you know they knew that he had made some maybe stands on things that he had talked of and done and they were wanting to tempt him right or test him or try him right and really they wanted to show him how smart they were you know we have studied the word we know what Moses said you know so that you know that they were tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause you see the tempting there is no scripture that Moses gave them writing a divorcement for any cause right they turn turned it into that right they had made it to be that they had interpreted uh the the writings of Moses but how could Moses give anything contrary to the word of God but see they were tempting him and saying can you do it for any cause you know forever cause you know my wife burnt the bread this morning can I divorce her you know uh she doesn't take a bath too often you say those are being silly that's how silly I'm trying to be because that's what silliness really is is when you're trying to tempt someone and then you're stating that Moses said we can put our wives away for any cause or every you know make sure you get it but that Moses didn't do that no right it's even hard to find the place in there uh of where it is and really if you go to Deuteronomy 24 which is a very odd scripture and that's the only connection I can bring to Moses and his writing of divorcement you don't see anything where he says like Paul you know did later on in his doings but it's got to be there because the prophet said it was all right but you understand what I'm saying now in no way do we believe that you can just put away your wife for any cause or everost we will go through the scriptures of the only reasons a man can divorce his wife all right then we'll try to cover some of that and the points that he can divorce his wife and remarry right but there is no scripture I'm going up front blunt Point see that way a lot of people click off the Internet won't listen to the rest of it because they they'll know that we're we're not going to play there is no scripture whatsoever ever for a woman to divorce her husband amen that's there's no prophet's message nowhere or anything for the woman to divorce her husband no that's right and marry again I will be honest because I try to be in a daily situation like we're living I think a lot of times some of the women today could pull away from their husband but not try to divorce them amen right you know cuz there's no divorce for a woman right see you say well we we can't do this out of the other the court will make you take care of your children right so you can don't pull up things on me to be you know like that we just blunt I am blunt anyway uh you say well that are you saying that some I'm saying some women don't have to live under the condition they're in you don't have to live with a man that beats you and all other of things like that you don't have to you said well now where's the scripture that's brother Dale okay I don't mind saying things like that cuz I'm trying to Pastor a church if you was up here you ought to be able to say those things too but are you getting the point they wanted to tempt him now they didn't pick on uh clothes and H and dresses and right their picking was marriage and divorce we're getting a quote in the prophet in just a minute that anytime people get together religious matters that automatically comes up all right but watch now what was his answer they said Moses said we can just put her away for ever CA what was his answer reading his answer you immediately see that he didn't agree with him that's right right because what did he say and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female now we'll get to that in a minute because there we got to cover two creation Parts there one where he's she's made in Adam and the other one where she comes into her own being all right look at verse five and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother shall cleave to his wife and they twine shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more twine but one flesh what therefore God ha joined together let no man put us under all right now what God joins together you better not play with that's the words of the prophet he said not what some drunken magistrate done or whatever you know because that's the laws of the land that you go down and do those things and they say unto him what did Moses didn't command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away why you agree that Moses done this and Jesus would have said that's right I wouldn't agree with the way maybe you said he was to do it because that's where he went right to the beginning he didn't go down to where there was a fall and a problem of marriage and divorce he goes straight back to the garden right Amen to give his answer so your answer got to come out of Genesis right they say why did Moses then give a writing of divorcement to put her away he sath unto them because Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wise but from the beginning it was not so now Moses gave a writing of divorcement all right blunt start with not for any cause or every cause Jesus answers that he turns you straight back to the beginning he doesn't turn you back to Genesis 3 4 5 7 10 or something you know where the fall that happened and all these things he turns you right straight back to the Garden of Eden all right and he says it wasn't so from the beginning now brother randam I'll give you one minute where he said and it won't be so over there right all right see now we're going to try to get into some thoughts now but I want you to read this one and think about it but I want to read Mark it's basically the same reading but there is a couple of of uh things a little bit different and you remember how the other week what I was preaching that if we can take this scripture and this scripture and they come together this one may have more in it on certain things where this one over here doesn't have certain things in it but we bring them together not as a contradictory but we bring them together as a uh an explaining right uh brother gave me some quotes off of the internet and I won't call the name but this brother is trying to prove how many contradictions there are in the Bible he does a good job I don't agree with him but to the carnal mind that just sits down and reads it looks good you know what I thought I thought you know what Lord Satan he don't need no help he took a vacation when the PE when the preachers of this message come along that's right the Bible calls them as Ministers of righteousness right Satan's Angels then he just gone on vacation he's letting all these preachers fight it out wasn't that what they were doing down at horb or is that horb when they were around the mountain and things and finally they said Moses said it's enough let's get out of here and go to the promised land let's do something all right pull it back up brother Mark says things just a little bit different in his sayings and the Pharisees came to him asking him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife tempting him see they don't go into Paul Matthew wrote one form Mark comes along and he picks it up from understanding because Mark and Luke were not original disciples but I believe they're Pro perfectly correct you know but he picks it up from the things he's heard and taught with the disciples so he doesn't bring it out maybe the emphasis of how that they were uh saying for any cause so he just brings it maybe as the point is it lawful for a man to put away his wife tempting him and he answered and said unto them what did Moses command you they said Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away now if that word is anything close to the human language of what we're talking about reason I wanted to get these scriptures today it says suffered and it was in Matthew which would mean that it was not uh God would permit it all right right in other words Moses was permitted to give the the the grace all right he he he suffered it it was something that was hard to do it was something that was horrible to have to face you think of brother brandom said going there that day to preach he said people are married four or five times you know and all and then I got it he said my own son sitting there it's so he's emphasizing both of them is that he Moses was suffering when this came about not just Moses was okie dokie I'll just tell you how it is we can do it this way now all the emphasis is upon the bases that Moses was suffering in agony before God remember brother Brown said I could how can I tell him he in 64 he knows and he's on the questions and answers and he's had the scriptures and but he said what can I say so he suffered with it a long time didn't he all right Jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept in other words y that's right you went out and done it you know you done it yep it was because of you that he had to do this yep right so he tried to straighten it up and do the best he could wa how would you else would you say it right Paul would come along and say I say that was pretty pretty powerful yeah brother randam said that didn't he but from the beginning of the creation of creation God made them male and female now specifically reason I'm stating that see from the beginning of the creation when it said the beginning and and the other one you you can Dilly dadly with words because there's many many many Beginnings in the beginning God created heaven and the Earth then you can read the next verse or two you know and say in the beginning God created this in the beginning God created that in the beginning God there's many many many Beginnings right so God is making sure that we use it in the word creation all right because now we'll get to it in a minute right Eve was not in an original creation so he says in the beginning of the creation of God God made God made them male and female all right now for this called shall a man leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife why because the prophet said if you get a revelation that that is your wife he said that's your wife for life you know that Adam and Eve had the same theophany you see how long it would take to preach if we went through every point if you want to somebody on the internet send me a note I'll be glad to send them to you go on your computer and you can find them without sending them to me Adam and Eve had the same the offing right okay was Eve a body running around inside of Adam not exactly that's right all right we're going to get to some things maybe went fishing yesterday and Zach he was sleeping and I was thinking so we was getting burn back and but look they TR shall be one flesh so then they are no more Twain but one flesh man and woman lives together long enough they even start looking alike there's a a scientific fact to that that's right now see that's why that a husband and wife is a type of Christ in the church now see it's hard to to try to keep down I got notes laying on the desk and my mind's wanting to go to page 14 all right wherefore what therefore God ha joined together let no man put us under all right now think about it and I'm going to want to mention this two or three times to where it will stay upon your mind the reason we read in Mark of the creation that and we don't have V over here kind of zero in keep up with me now he just sits back there on that little old thing he can follow me anywhere I walk that's no joke I can walk back to the back and he can follow me all the way to the back we were life in while ago you could standing in the office like Z wrote in you could see who was standing back there in their office and do it but all right so maybe I can move some he just keep it set on the Bo and I'll move around all right now let's think about first cuz the title would be you know marriage and divorce part one but it'll be from the beginning all right now that's what we're going to be dealing with so we're not going to be going over into a lot of other things we're going to be staying with the creation all right everybody understand me you know in my mind mind is hard to do that but I'm wanting to stay on the creation not the fall we'll start this afternoon and call it the fall but we're talking this morning about the creation all right so we know that and we'll read it that Eve was not in the original creation she was in Adam all right so then you got a creation of mankind and you got you know the you got a creation of the world the animals and they're made male and female male and female dog horse cow whatever male and female all right now when you come to the human race it didn't start out that way it started out with Eve being in Adam not as an identity not as a uh person running around and all of this that and the other but she was in Adam then she was taken from Adam right and made a by product all right so you know how I am on that I believe what the prophet said I'll try to go through everything he said on it but when you say byct Tru what do you mean well the man is a porterhouse steak and the woman she's just a little old h of hamburger with a bunch of uh what did you used to put in the hamburger mouth oatmeal we couldn't afford nothing El we didn't have all all you got so my wife would put oatmeal in the hamburger it's pretty good it it was ate a bullet it's kept us alive but that's what they think they think that she's just nothing right and you hear the preachers emphasize she's not even in the original creation but you've heard me say it too that God thought so much of Eve until he never made her like the rest of the animals you're only thinking of the sinful side right he took her from adamen cuz if that hadn't happen we couldn't come from Christ so I think you ought to change a little bit of your thinking on these points cuz you know most body by product and I don't like jokes you know preachers in this message will say that's the way women are they'll buy products all the time I think that's getting pretty close to being sinful I know a lot of men buy things all the time don't you our problem is we buy big things cars trucks guns where's Danny Danny's hiding there but now listen so there's two Creations that you're dealing with but now I'm going to make it plain to front when Eve was taken from Adam did he make her wrong just because you use the word by product does that mean he made her wrong if he did God's the author of her being wrong he can't condemn her for being wrong that's right solves a problem that's right right amen you know brother Brown is pretty specific about a lot of things but we just don't look enough we want to look at by product for all of the things we want down under here that says the bad looking things if you ever notice one we read it in a little while you know you're the byproduct of your mom and daddy is that pretty bad huh you're the byproduct your mom and daddy and you wouldn't be here if God hadn't have done that and made a byproduct you don't even look up byproduct I've tried to be common you know straight about it the word byproduct and Webster comes up to say in of equal value are greater but you don't ever hear these things you only hear the women women is just nothing dog meat well what you want to marry one for if it's dog meat I didn't marry no dog meat how can you be come together as one flesh if you call her a dog meat right now come on are we in the Bible oh we don't want to talk like that brother Dale we've turned you off well goodbye but you see if they become one flesh that's emphasized throughout the Bible right the two becomes one the problem is is where we stay to and claim to be married as one right amen right but we're supposed to be one if we're one then uh you might might order to get off your word byproduct so hard and try to listen to brother random as he's talking sure he's explaining things he has to you talking about rough read marriage and divorce I've asked you to read these things you talking about rough it's rough but it was a truth amen like one lady said he called me a vulture another said well he called me an eagle so it's According to which one you want but are you getting get the point now there was was there any fall I'll re repeat this if I have time was there any problems with the creation of Adam there any problem with the fact that he could be created male and female no Fallen condition there for those Pharisees to argue about was he right you see what Jesus done what could be a smarter I don't mean smarter but you know what could have been a greater answer that could could have been given to those Pharisees of course it didn't straighten them out but what was the better answer than he could have given to said go back to the beginning y if he' stopped anywhere they would have had argument he to stop with David they whoa Whoa man we got you now cuz David had a thousand wives yeah but you know if they' have went that way God was so great he would have just simply answered them and said but none of them wives could have another husband that's right he could have put it out there that's right that's right but yet he went right back to the beginning and nailed it down there's no way to argue then about marriage and divorce the arguments of marriage and divorce is irrelevant see our thoughts and our ideas about it is from Tommy rot right the word is true amen was there any problem then with Adam was any problem with a sinful condition existing when Adam was male and female was there any okay let's move up a step now let's see you agree with that one let's see if you agree with this one was there any problems with Adam and Eve once Eve was taken from Adam was there any problem with Adam and Eve when they were standing in the garden come on oh but brother Dale that's the way he made her quoting out of marriage and divorce I want you to explain to me how he made Eve I want that explanation how did he make Eve that would make her do what she done that he made her do that and then him being a just God and condem her that's why the brother one time wanted me to come over and preach for a week or so on marriage and divorce at his church and I just simply made him a good answer I said I plenty of tapes on the internet if you want to go back I'll be glad to come you set the date but I said go back to the internet and pull up marriage and divorce and see what I've preached about it and the way I preach it you probably or might not want me to come well you know what I had been yet and that's been probably 5 years ago but you know okay no problem see I'm just plunged about what I say show me something about Eve the way she was made did she get something different about her if so what was it I'm going to drop off of this now but I'm coming back to it okay what way was she made that would make her so wrong and God making her that way see the B product she was a byproduct why because she was in Adam right she was not in the original creation right the dogs the cats no the male female she was not in the original creation we understand that but once he made her what was the wrong that was made about her right I'm just asking simple questions I like questions myself but I like to see people that sits quiet and looks at you because you're thinking what in the world this guy going to say next that's right you learned a lot to not holler and scream had you you found out I wouldn't go in that direction all right but you think about it now we're coming back to that later I like what brother random said on marriage and divorce he said it I think on the conduct order and doctorine I know I've read a couple of times but I know he did marriage and divorce he said God made a way that we could marry our wives and it be correct and it's not sinful for you to marry a wife is normal life that's right right all right he made a way and he said it this way he said if there is a question anywhere God has the answer to that question all right so now keep that in mind but the point is two creations created first in Adam male and female standing in one being all right next Adam and Eve standing side by side now I want to know the sinful part there right I don't like to use bad words but did he make her so uh so much burning with lust yeah if he did then he made her y you got to deal with that not me he made her that way there's always answer all right all right let's let's take a few quotes and then from that point and try to work her way down through some scriptures and the quest the points of the Prophet go ahead with number three on marriage and divorce preached in 1965 221 the morning service paragraph 5758 this scripture this question confronted Jesus at the beginning of his ministry and it confronted Moses at the beginning of his ministry okay we could put another one in there which would not be adding but we could say it confronted Paul in the beginning of his ministry right because that was the three points it's a foremost question in the believer's hearts now look how your Prophet talked The Sinner doesn't care no right y but it's to Believers because the believer is trying to do all that he know how to do to live right before God you amen that all right therefore if any question comes up on religion you know you sit down you start talking to somebody about religion what's the first thing will come up he's TR just just start talking to somebody about a religious matter and watch it read right on over into uh marriage and div argument right any question comes up on on religion then the marriage and divorce case comes up why because it is the cause of the original sin okay that's where sin started that's the reason it brought up it's brought up every time because it is the very beginning of sin that's right okay now where's he going right back to the Garden what did Eve do look down she committed adultery that brought forth the first child which was Cain Satan's own son for in him laid evil it did not come through Abel Satan's son was Cain now I ain't going to get into that because there's going to be an argument there we got them laying down we'll get back to it you say no Eve didn't commit adultery well you're a prophet said she did amen yeah but they had never lived together yet they weren husband and wife I'm sorry they was a whole lot closer to being husband and wife than you and your wife was when you started dating right because she come out of him that's right so she committed adultery amen okay and so he goes back into the basis of the beginning and the original sin and he says that was the cause of it right or the original sin look at the next one questions and answers 6 4 real three paragraph 3:30 she said that was Adam's son it was not Adam's son she said I got it from God and we know she did right cuz God's the only one that can bring life and she had to it was a seed it was a seed but it was serpent serpent seed now you're going to the Garden you're going to pick up serpent seed and we're going to get down into something in a minute and let's see if it'll tie together with what caused Eve to do what she done oh she a serpent seed now show me where she was no show me where Eve was serpent seed that's why I'm reading this all right but it was serpent seed and he had to come back a virgin and in order to clear up that sexual act that had been done now he had to come through the wound right Adam was put here on Earth but he he never found out that he was to be a father you understand what I mean Satan knowing this he got to Eve before Adam got D and D is where the whole thing lays today and brother that's what makes marriage and divorce and everything else such a scruple as it is today so what is marriage and divorce going back to the Garden of Eden the serpent seed see so Jesus when he said go back to the Garden go back to the beginning go back to the creation there was no serpent seed connection to the original creation nothing in the original am I quoting him nothing in the original can be immoral immoral every how I pronounce my words dirty rotten stinking or whatever you want to call it on the internet I'm just playing old Georgia immoral nothing in the original creation can't do it that's right right but what was it it's the seed of the serpent what caused marriage in divorce to come into being the way Eve was created or the serpent seed which one was it see we only look then at the serpent seed as a SE act that's basically people talk about serpent seed but we're going to see in a minute why Eve had the ability to do what she done but get it it's a serpent seed so anytime marriage divorce comes up the serpent seat automatically appears right because there is your original attribute right here's where we go with it in the minute see sin is not adultery I got that quote laying here if you ever wanted it that way sin is not Ault that's an attribute that's amen so Eve had to do something wrong before the adulterous act could transpire to be to the seat of the serpent coming in but what was it look at number five just giving you a few things in mind and then we'll drop into her points this is taken from marriage and divorce paragraph 275 but you see women you are you are a jewel if you want to be a jewel but the desire has to be by you and you see why the marriage and divorce was that Jesus pointed back under it was because your kind was the cause of all sin that's the reason polygamy and divorce and things was introduced at the beginning it never was so and it won't be so in the world o Yonder now think about it so God created man in his own image I'll just paraphrase these we have to go with number six s we'll drop down to number eight so God created man his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them right and God bless them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth that's Genesis 1:26 and 27 right or 27:28 and God blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply so there was Eve and Adam in the original creation right he made them male and female made them to rule over everything because he jumps over to chapter 5 and makes this outstanding statement it still doesn't mean that you wait to that point to get to it because in chapter 5 of Genesis he said this is the book of the generations of Adam he's not explaining nothing he's giving you the generations all right in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created all right so when they were created Adam's name was Adam and Eve was in Adam right you go along with that amen amen all right when she's taken from Adam what is her name she doesn't get her name until the fall comes that's right you go on over in Genesis about 23 somewhere over in there and it says she's called Eve cuz she's the mother of all living her name is still Adam when they were standing in the garden as Adam and Eve standing there as two human beings beings so closely related together that they were one right but yet it's two separate beings no fall right no fall because it's she she gets her name later y That's right until she comes forth from Adam and the sin happens her name is Adam our name is supposed to be Christ we only have one husband we're Adam spiritual right Christ Jesus all right now let's read a couple of quotes and then we'll get to a point cuz I'm laying this down as close as I can relating to what I want you and to get your mind to follow me you say we you'll not tell us we doing that well why not that's right this is the way it comes to me that's why can't I tell you to where it comes to me and get you to listen come on all right go ahead with number eight this is taken from marriage and divorce paragraph uh 89 through it actually going into 105 but it' be two or three quotes he says the question the true answer that Jesus want us to go back to the true answer is to go back to the beginning then that would be in Genesis because the word Genesis is a seed chapter every question in the Bible and you always have to go back to the seed to see what kind of a seed is in the field to find out what your crops will be all right goes back to the beginning he introduces the beginning Jesus said go back to the beginning there was only one pair of everything on Earth there was there was one Adam one Eve they were joined by God Alone Now where's he standing Eve is taken from Adam the animals are created male and female Adam comes forth with Eve and Adam then Eve is taken from Adam now they're standing so in the original is never to have been one male and one female you say yeah but what about David and all of his types I got a few questions when we get down to that too all right I love to ask you questions it makes you think right sister Gail and that brother they ask you make you make you think I want you to think right I want you to go home and ponder over it see there was one now now he's up to the beginning of where Adam and Eve is standing together not Adam with Eve Adam and Eve is standing together now you have exactly what Jesus was saying cuz he's really referring to the two of them standing there when he says go back to the beginning right and you see that in the beginning when it was Eve and Adam as one there was no fall when it was Adam and Eve standing together as one you know and and put together as two people two identities there no fall that's right right yeah but he's got the dirty one over there that can make it come to Pi that's why she's a hamburger yeah that way she is a byproduct when she was standing there beside of Adam she was a byproduct that's right come on you're the byproduct of your mom and daddy and little kids you holding is a byproduct you reproduced come on right what was Eve give to Adam far to reproduce Adam what's a wife giving to a husband for right my kids are not mcil cutties they're all dals you know you you get the point in the beginning was running in perfect order and harmony with God nothing was out of cater nothing was out of cater Adam and Eve in the garden how long no problem don't have to worry about it all right what does she turn out to be then watch this going up to paragraph 101 I've cut some of these put extra numbers on them where we and I just cut it out to where I want to point because some of the things that's in it will be relating to other things that we'll get to later this is paragraph 101 notice why did she do such a thing look at it read it be being in that high order how much higher could she have been than the way God made her I'm hoping this is going to do away with some of your byproduct ideas being in that high order there's not a higher order in the world than to be the Bride of Jesus Christ right you sisters should consider that there's no higher position that you could want to be in than to be the wife of your husband you should consider that and say thank you Lord for giving me that head I got instead of trying to be over him right right right come on I'm smarter so was he yes that's right now you got a problem that's right yeah but my husband he just a dummy he don't understand well maybe you still your head amen so you just admitted your head's a dummy or you're trying to overrule him one see that's why we can stay six months on one topic why did she do such a thing being in that high order she was right there with him co-equal now where's he any sin there where is there any part of her creation are you with me yes where's any part of her creation that would have been sinful she was go equal with him y but we all know now that she lost her co-equal with man when she sinned and God said man will be your ruler from here out he said that's the scriptures but she was co-equal amen I know a little bit about the message so remember just on down a few paragraphs before after that brother R says Satan is coequal with God in the beginning but what was Satan coequal to God he couldn't create that was one thing he couldn't do but he got all kind of gift he's got all signs and wonders but he's even co-equal you see Eve would have been a whole lot closer as to being co-equal okay going down to paragraph 105 notice the reason she did this she was not in the original creation she is not in God's original creation she's a byproduct boy that's it that's that's it right there says therefore at the beginning when Jesus referred to it she was not original created it was not original created being of God she is a byproduct of a man when Jesus referred to the beginning now is he saying that Adam is her Creator not quiet don't go carnal when you read a man and he's talking he's just like you talk we run a lot of words what do we mean Adam wasn't her Creator he said that Jesus refer she was not original created being of God what's he meaning who created her the devil did now I didn't know he was a Creator I thought that got out the door a long time ago what's he emphasizing right that she was not in the original creation that's right all the animals come male female male female male female but when you come down to Eve she was in Adam she was not an original identity standing there but then she's taken from Adam that makes her a byproduct there's no sin where's the problem I'll emphasize this again remember the two Creations that we speaking of or the two Beginnings or whatever you want to go back to when Jesus referred to the beginning so in the beginning there was a time that even that Eve only existed in Adam and that was in the beginning of the Creations back there she was created in Adam right right but then she was taken from Adam now you got another beginning that's the beginning I read you back this paragraph before we talking about that brother brandom is talking about the beginning right God Jesus when he was saying he was referring to the beginning when they were made male and female two people that's the way it should have stayed was not supposed to been anything else was supposed to stayed on that ground see this is the one everybody loves to read though go ahead with number 11 let's see what I do I got 10 though where am I at I done lost one of my quotes pull up 10 okay he's got it I don't even have it I left it l in y questions and answers on Hebrews 1957 103 look what the prophet is talking about a tree reproduces itself vegetation reproduced animals reproduce them humans reproduce themselves they are the byproduct of original creation did you get it they're a byproduct you're a byproduct to your mom and daddy so there's not anything wrong with being a byproduct there not anything wrong with being a byproduct all right go ahead with number 11 now I hope I can get this fast marriage and divorce paragraph 106 and one down to 108 remember Adam was both masculine and feminist in the original creation one but then he was separated by rib okay now you coming out notice but a byproduct she there he wasn't Eve wasn't a byproduct when she was in Adam is everybody follow her that then when she comes out she's a byproduct and notice the only one of all only one of all God's creation of every animal and everything else she was the only one designed this way now what's your interpretation there she was designed wrong that's not what he's explaining he's explaining she was the only one that was designed that way right what as a a byproduct now you're going to make him take quotes and pull only one she was the only one that was designed that way no other animals nowhere was it designed that way every other female it was the original creation every other female was the original creation but he was not in the original creation see that had to be made that had to be made that way but now we agree there because the original creation couldn't fall that's right so she had to be made away right but now be careful how you making her come on brother because we just been through it and you at least nodded your heads that God can't create create something wrong that's right so if he created her in any form of your thinking of sexualities or any parts you want to bring you're getting to close to making God ordaining things that's right be real careful look at number 12 why some people can't keep the victory 1957 324 paragraph 15 or E15 now man's on the basis of free moral free moral agency and he cannot God could not take a man and say God could not take a man and say now I'm going to make you do this I'm going to make you to be to be a lost man I'm going to make you be a saved man he can't do that that wouldn't be the nature of God no he's not willing that any should perish but he wants all to repent but he was being infinite as he is he knew from the beginning who would be who would perish and he would not perish because he knew what would be he's not in willing in any way what so there for what is it he could by forn knowledge he can make everything work right according to his plan amen now God knew that if he left Adam standing there with Eve inside they would have never been a fall okay but he knew that if he removed Eve from Adam the fall would come because she was not an original creation like a dog cats male female Etc so he knew but because he knew he couldn't make it I read it he said he couldn't make you lost he couldn't make you saved that's right there in front of you by his for knowledge he knew that if he made Eve like she did she'd fall but you better consider some things along the way that we will get to later you hunky boy you you bring a w him up there big you know wi he could he fell amen that's right now we've got a point right in his original creation with Eve in him no fall right bring Eve out right so now what happened in the garden bypassing these but just quoting them to you Revelations chapter 4 paragraph 231 two trees s will one is death one is life free moral agency God placed the first man Adam and Eve right here on free moral agency he places you the same place right amen okay we're in the same place we can't blame Adam right and wrong was put before him right and wrong is put before you and I that's right am do you need any more on freem moral agency all right 18 Till what was it about Eve that made her be able to fall do you notice the phrase made her be able to fall I didn't say made her fall what made her be able to right and that Adam in his original condition existence he was not able to that's right but yet when Eve done what she done she produced the product and he done the same things she done now come on don't get me all twisted up so you you you hold on you say what but Adam knew what he's doing if he knew what he was doing and done it he's got more problems than she's got so don't run your mind in quotes real quick hold on that's why I said while ago a lot of you learn not to holler and scream because you don't know what I'm going to say next right so you weighed it out okay now what is your thought that' be where I'd love to have questions and answers and let you stand up and but remember it's like I told a man at work one time he said I want to talk to you about the Bible I said go ahead I said but now if you cross yourself I'm going to raise my hand you know I said I want you to talk about about the Bible but but I'm going to watch your word I want to if you cross yourself I don't mean if you're right or wrong we're not talking about what you're right or wrong about your Doctrine but I said if you cross yourself I'm going to raise my hand and say you done cross yourself you you ain't even you ain't even in an argument well he said about two words and I raised my hand I said we might as well forget it cuz he'd already crossed himself before he got started and see that's what most people have done they've already crossed theel by the preconceived ideas and thoughts right that's been injected by the preachers and things that's right until he brought it to a basis that you already have a preconceived thought in your mind but remember if you cross yourself you said what do you mean I mean if you think that there was some way that Eve was made that would have something to do with her um sex allery what's the word for it right that's good if you think it was some way that he made her uh more uh irus in a lot of ways see when you get started then I'm going to raise my hand and say hold on a minute you just crossed yourself because it mean God made her that way but when he gave her one thing Adam had it but he never used it but he gave her one thing that made her be able to do what she done what is that what is that that I won't have to raise my hand and cross it you say what do you cross yourself and what is it see the key is in the way man is made when Eve was taken from Adam now are we going to go with brother brandom or we going to leave him leave him out see if she was in theophany the same as Adam if that's right then Adam and Eve only had one Soul amen that's and it was eternal yep because he done breathe the breath of life into the nostril of Adam and he become Blasphemous names go read it Adam a and especially into Adam eternal life before Eve came out right right now how is it that a human mortal is created he's made in the image of God right even in the fall of in the state can we go through that amen but what is it about man that makes him what he is what's the difference in a dog or an animal and a human being you better get off of some of your thoughts I may take five or 10 extra minutes off of you but you better get off of it CU if you're thinking about some way in form of sexologies orever what you call those big words then I'll remind you that every female animal has that what but what's the difference in a woman and a dog dog has her desires come on you want to go fishing with me sometime but she only has it for her babies right do you need those quotes the female dog animal cat horse she only has her desires for her babies but she has her desires for her babies you Tak in the bar Kingdom especially the old boy bar a lot of times when the baby's born after a little while he'll come back and kill that baby you know that Mama will fight him and sometimes they the boy killed her fighting over her baby but the reason he killed the baby is to bring her back into receptiveness from him and you know what the day she fights him even to almost her death but a few weeks later she looking him up I'm sorry to talk plain but is it true Eve was to have reproduced Adam now every how you want to go with that that's your business ain't if you want to make it a creation if you want to make it a act if you w make anything leave sex out of and you're okay because it's not sex in animals it's for reproduction only what's the difference in a male and I mean a a female and a dog the dog is only for her puppies but a female for anytime she desires right come on is that plain enough but you get the point for any time that's where she's he said well that was where he designed her I want to ask you a question I'll leave it down here and I'll just quote you did he design her for any time that she wants or did he design her her like all the other females is it wrong for you sisters to want to be a mother is not that the purpose of getting married and Etc that you want to be a mother just like the dogs the cats and the things you want to be a mother right see Eve wanted to be a mother and she would have finally become a mother right as I say that's up to you to decide which you way I ain't going to argue with nobody you want to call it creation or you want to call it an act with Adam David do what you want to brother B did say Isaiah and N was supposed to come through the wound of Eve you can argue all you want to there quotes both way I'm not arguing I'm just trying to stay to a point Eve which just like every other female what went wrong so then you can see when she was made she was made Body Spirit and soul you agree amen if you're going with the one sole point of the theophany then Eve had eternal life in her soul just like Adam had eternal life in his amen sure or else you're going to have to make some statements that don't come from the prophet you're going to have to say that God made her mortal but Adam was eternal my hands up you just crossed yourself and make him a respector of persons and make him doing wrong make one one way one the other one come on but see by ba being not a dog or a cat what's the difference in the dog or cat and a mortal and a woman they both have the desires for their babies they both want to be mothers nothing wrong with that if Satan had an had not entered the picture what would happen in the garden don't you think that we would have come forth you know yes sir amen some way okay cuzz that was the would be the part then we could be a byproduct of Mom and Daddy but you see what Eve done was the one thing that you and I do that you're doing right now you are sitting there right now trying to reason out what I'm thinking about right you're trying to reason out what is he going to say see that's the only thing about Eve so when God made Eve he made her body spirit and soul and by her soul being Eternal with Adam she couldn't die in that part but she had her body and her spirit to deal with her motherly nature within her would be Desiring to have children offsprings from Adam would see what Satan done that's what you give Adam and Eve in the garden to defeat the enemy he's talking about the spirit of God he said that's what you give them was the spirit of God to defeat the enemy and when Eve reasoned with it and projected reasons with the word it fell apart and sin entered it's taken from identifications 1963 there was a time when there was no death on Earth there was a time when man didn't have to die but because that Eve reasoned listen to Satan's reasoning against God's word death begin to rain from that time on and it rains yet today but let me say this in the face of it up there is a time and a thing that can happen that will never change it's Eternal so we'll byp pass just a minute or two and think on Eve began to reason reasoning is what part of you body is see taste feel smell and hear spirit is reasoning memory conscience affections Etc right Eve was okay until she let till she stopped to listen to Satan and his reasoning and when she did y there is sin remember we read while ago adultery drinking gambling smoking Etc even the prophet would say adultery when he said eve committed adultery because Adam was her husband and she took another one with the Beast and when it did she began to reason reasoning is the product of sin now unless you say come let us reason together that's perfect all right but do you see what Eve happened do you see where she was not made any different the only thing that she was brought over into a position to where she could reason now I ask you a question what happened to Adam right that was Adam the animals in the garden were reproducing the Beast could tell Eve look what you're missing you're missing motherhood you know the longing in your heart and she began to reason but when she fell she went to Adam and Adam looked and said my wife I love her I don't want her to die she'd have died right there if he had left her alone he began to reason and his reasoning was I'll go out you want me to quote brother around him I'll go out of the garden with her and I'll bring her back he said but that was where his problem was when he went out of the garden he couldn't get back right right amen amen what would he have created some kind of a lustful point that would make God the product of it give her the same thing as all the other animals had that's right that he didn't call it sin and still don't call it sin for dog dos and cats and things are reproduce she begin to reason and the reason is what killed her that's what's killing you and I reasoning I want to ask you a question it'll be about 3 months down the road but I want to ask you a question after what happened in the garden polygamy came into being right am I right I want you to explain that to me how did the fall of Man make the animals get into polygamy you see there is a lot of answers but I got a lot of questions polygamy easily seen in a family human race cuz you get over a little while and one guy had two wives but how come the animals when into one buck and many do but to get you off the hook there are some animals that mate for life that's right now they mate as long as that mate's living but when that mate dies they'll find them another mate so they're still under the problem some animals that don't even fool with polygamy they'll die first but as humans what are we you see what I'm talking about yes how was Eve created wrong she wasn't she was created a mortal being perfect in Body Spirit and soul your little babies let's stand your little babies when they're born they're perfect right I didn't say Eternal never had no word for it that's all right just wait will it's done too late for the music just wait little animals why would they get under a fall right think on these things Eve begin to reason you ever heard run around and say Eve said I think he said that's where she messed up she just got add them to thinking and he messed up you see God knew it was going to take place right he didn't have to create products for Adam and Eve after the fall to bring families you understand my wording they were standing there with everything perfect a little baby when it's born it's perfect why cuz God can't create something imperfect it's not talking about it can be sick the second it's born that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about how God created it he created it perfect think on these things father we ask you to just go with us now yes Lord we go eat a natural meal bring us back together in you and Lord just give us that understanding because there is where we have to rest upon we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen you dismissed take the name of Jesus brother bu your br
