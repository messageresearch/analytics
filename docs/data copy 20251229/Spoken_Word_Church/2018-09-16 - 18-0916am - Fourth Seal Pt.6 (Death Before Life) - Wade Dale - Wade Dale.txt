Dale Gooden have them all back they I told them in Mobile I said I bet I bet my brother who got nervous about the time he hit the end of his driveway that's about two fathers he's been in a long time so so good good to have him back I'm glad they got back but we had to get Tommy mobile everyone said to tell you hello and we had a wonderful time and a wonderful blessing down there brother Matthew said to tell you hello and he hope to see you soon so I also remember I did anybody say anything about brother JT Paget's grandson okay I got him I got a message from brother Dutch Scott that he had been electrocuted that's Brandon the one that plays to get to her thing he was electrocuted and hit burned his hands now how bad we don't know but okay okay all right so all right well that's why you get message of a message of a message of a message and then you know we we got this thing going on in Galesville that they're talking about putting a casino in gilt Ville so so wait a minute you laugh you laugh but from what we're hearing now from the horse's mouth we may be getting one so pray to Lord Jesus that we get out of here in the next year so we don't have to deal with that stupid thing in front of our house so then they're telling me that all you got to do is have a Native American Indian buy a piece of property and he put a casino there so that may happen you don't know but see the rumors got started that this was going on and this was going on but if you go straight to the horse's mouth the horse will tell you so we went straight to the horse's mouth and he said yes that is exactly the truth so let's pray that that thing doesn't happen so right there in our front door so good to be in the house the Lord turn to revelation 6 verse 1 couldn't have always good to have always good to have brother Daniel sister debut with us always did I say that always okay and Rachel their daughter she's it's good to have her here - and where's Timbo Tim good to have Tim - but I

have any believers that that got thrown out of their homes tell you what though that thing if it hit at a category four had been a real bad but the Lord graciously the Lord run that thing down to a 1 by the time he hit the hit the coast and you know what one day that won't happen no more we're heading toward that where I believe that we can not have to worry about that junk that when God did that that was a effects of the fall so let's turn to revelation 6 we're gonna start on the 4th see again and today we're going to speak on death before life because you have to have a death before you have life when it comes when it comes to Christianity and even when you look at natural seed when you put a natural seed in the ground we'll talk about in a minute when you put a natural seed in the ground something's got to die so that life can come forth so we got to have a death before life comes and that's what we looked the fourth seal it's called death and we'll get the chart back out and kind of get everybody back up to speed so let's let's go to the Lord in prayer mmm the Heavenly Father thank you Lord for bringing our pastor and his wife and the Brethren sister-in-law home safe from the journey Lord that they feel refreshed rejuvenated Lord ready to press the battle father we thank you for our ones among us there brother Daniel sister David definitely not visitors Lord they just a part of us we thank you for having them here too Lord we pray that you just be with each one that's sick ones that are not with us Lord we ask you to just heal the sick as the word goes forth you said you sent your word and heal the people father so give us something from you today Lord without you being here it's just it'll just be a meeting like a lodge or something where we just gather and laugh and talk and have a good time but Lord come down with your anointing father we've sung the songs and we prayed the prayer we had responsive reading we've done the things that we're supposed to do to get Lord in order that we can hear from you Father so today let us hear from you Lord give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our sins bless the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor father just be with us and take care of us in Jesus name we pray amen revelation 6 and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see now who was that fourth beast the eagle all right and I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth you may be seated in the Lord and just blessing to the reading of the word we're gonna put the chart back up today so we can kind of brother Danny's gonna graciously help me do that good to see brother Daniel sister debut with us today's I said that already I do that because the aggravates Rachel that's alright all right now to back up and just go over hmm tell you what we spend money on these things and they still tear up that okay boo devil they're right there all right we've been on the seals and now we're on the fourth seal so I'm just going to back up just a little bit you're a mind back in order with the seals because you got seal one two three and four right now we're on number four and remember the rapture take place on the fourth seal we know that say man all right so rapture takes place on the fourth seal you say oh what about the others we'll get to that later not today but later on but the rapture takes place on the fourth seal because there's no combat beast there's only four combat be the lying the ox of man and the eagle all right well now we're in the Eagle Age right here we're in the Eagle age so there's no more combat beasts oh brother Brian said therefore the Raptor must take place on the fourth seal all right everybody know that we've been through it now for four weeks and in months actually so but the seals we see seal one two three and four types c1 times the first three ages seal two times two fourth now we got them lapped over because remember there is a lap over between all the ages all right God does does not just abruptly shut one down and start a new one he has a lap over all right even your messengers coming to lap over of the Church ages everybody got that right we've been through that forever all right because you mentioned you're comes right here right in between these ages the messenger comes brings his message to this age then they go in the ground another messenger comes up takes over preaches his message and we'll read where brother battle talking about the box but your third seal then is what the man and then the fourth seal is the age we're living in now which is the Eagle Age which you've got your line ox man and eagle you've got white red black and pale horses that are riding all right there's a spiritual aspect to this and then there's a natural happening mm all right so the first seal we type with justification we preached on that for a long time the second seal is sanctification which is read we preached on that for a while and then the Holy Ghost is the type of the third because there's only three there's only three listen there's only three manifestations of God in your new birth justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost but please remember one thing once the baby gets here you can't just put him up on a chair and say oh we got a human he'll die you gotta feed it and it it grows and it grows as it fed same thing in your spiritual life that's what a lot of Pentecostals did sure they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but what did they do they cabbage down the prophet of God said are they stopped the process of God moving on they said nope this is it we're done we're finished and so God just moved on and brought the messenger to the church aid in the last stage here all right everybody all right with that I know it's kind of kind of fast but but the fourth manifestation is what it is the three brother Bram tells us on the fourth seal that the fourth seal is white red and black mixed together to make this horse so justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost mix together makes the word manifested in a human being called a bride you ma'am it's alright and then because that's what you got to have you gotta have four stages to be with your Joel and we're going to read in Ezekiel and we're going to read in several places where there's four things that we have to do to bring the rest to get full restoration because I'm gonna read you a statement in a few minutes there must be a restoration before there's even a resurrection you can't bring a resurrection out of something impure you can't bring now sure we plant them in corruption but we have to raise them in in corruption therefore therefore something must be standing on the earth that's already incorruptible and man something's got to already be here and then because they're corruptible is waiting on the incorruptible and then to bring them back here so so by the Daniel don't don't get me don't get bug-eyed but I'm not worried about a rapture I don't even want to talk about a rapture hold brother we got to have a resurrection first without a resurrection they will never be a rapture that's why the rapture hasn't taken place it's because there's no resurrection here yet amen we got to get two dead Saints out of the ground we got to be the word manifested so much till the dead walk among us but right now we're in the corruptible part but we're also in the restoration part I will restore saith the Lord let's read that in Joel 2:24 because remember the four bugs eat it down so if four bugs eat it down there's got to be four manifestations of God to bring it back to what full fruition to get everything we need be glad you children of Lulla Church Bride of Christ in time people I'm not talking to dead people today if you're born again you're not dead now if you're not born again I'm talking to dead people and then be glad you children of Zion and rejoicing the Lord your God for if giving you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month former rain is what teaching rain brother branham come to teach us the Word of God the Elijah of the day but he did not see the latter rain he's part of the former the latter rain is the harvest now he saw it by prophetic but you and I are the recipient of that we're the manifestation we are not just part of the lettering we're the only latter rain there is go that's the harvest rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat the fat shall overflow Lord of Mercy we're not gonna be wanting anything with wine and oil which we were in the what was it the third field second scene which I'm but hurt not the all the wine a man the Holy Ghost and what the anointing that goes with it and I will restore to you the years that the locust eat number one cankerworm to caterpillar three palmer worm for my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat him plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that he had dealt one Dursley with you Lula Church and my people shall never be ashamed man you should never be ashamed of what brother branham bro you should never be ashamed of what God's reveal to us amen now let's go to John 12 let's read a few scriptures here just real real quick John 12 verse 23 says in jesus answered them saying the hour has come that the son of man keep that in your mind because we're going to talk about the Son of Man why he had to be here to bring a resurrection that's why the son of man had to come back in the end time to bring the sign to bring the resurrection to bring everything back up that's a son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die die remember there's got to be a death before there's a resurrection how can you resurrect life people you can't sure you can have a spiritual I'm talk about natural you can have a natural resurrection unless something's died and you can't have a spiritual resurrection to let something die your old self has got to die except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit now we're going to look we're going to look at that in a minute because when you plant a seed in the ground yes technically it does but it's just the outside cuz there's life inside that now alright hey man alright let's go to the let's go to the first quote we read it the other day I like this quote because look when brother Branham came we'll read it in a little while maybe if we have time it was a message of restoration to bring everything back right the prophets of bale had just knocked the altar down and rocks were layin trots rocks revelation was laying everywhere that's scattering it 450 line message preachers what's this brother branham said i'm going to send this is on the fifth seal I'm gonna set this box up here I've been doing this now this is for the just just a review we did this last Sunday or Sunday for last 94 laughs I'm gonna set this box up here to represent that no watch if God sends a certain spirit among them that's the only thing that they can work by Martin Luther couldn't sit here today sure by the Holy Ghost he could after a while understand what I'm saying but other than that he's laying in the grave saying the just shall live by faith that's the new birth look to us that's not the new birth now hey man that's not the new birth that won't even get you in the body that just forgives you you pass in you see how God has moved up but there was a box that Martin Luther said in and that was what what they can work by is the spirit that works among them now will prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals that's what that's what revealed all these things nobody ever knew this till brother Branham God giving the revelation to open the seals to me and you and remember the seals are not the Antichrist it's a revelation of Jesus Christ it is redemption in its highest form well sure it's good to know that Elias riders Antichrist but I was telling them in mobile this weekend but yeah but where did that white horse go it rode away the Red Horse rode away I want that thing to ride away I don't want to ride in me I want him to go away that will prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose and watch exactly the church respond to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else so today you are responding to the anointing and you can't do anything else but respond to the anointing of this hour which is to me it is the total opening and revealing of all the word you show that happening brother Browns day I doubt it I doubt it we're still here he said in the sixth seal he said it's gone from you it's not even for you you're not going to get it it's for us people this message is specifically for you and I sure there's a lot lending the grade there's a lot a lot of things got to happen but you and I the anointing of that box is a resurrection through a group called the bride and then it's to bring the dead back to the earth but how can we bring the dead back to the earth when we're dead we're dying physically we can only respond and that's what we're doing because Martin Luther's people couldn't respond with what's being taught today Wesley couldn't respond Pentecost definitely couldn't respond they just want somebody to stand up and speak in tongue I mean really come on me really if you should I'm speaking tongues of Pentecost was like oh that must be it no there's more than that there's that plus a man and this is the plus all right there by all rights a man okay good I like this awake crowd you respond a whole lot more number two the ones in the back ER asleep number two the fourth seal now we're going to work on back to four now I want you to notice the four of them notice the off mark of four of the spiritual matter mathematics God is 3 this is 4 but I've got already told us in Joel that took for death messengers knead it down and then brother Brown said it took for live messengers the line ox man and eagle to bring everything back up right right so it's an off mark what he's doing is he's telling you it looks like it's an off mark because of your three sevens and nines and all the things in Bible but see to me in earthly in our situation I love 4 because 4 is a restoration of man it's a restoration back to what God wanted this is for here is for first Antichrist white 2nd false prophet red third biker of heaven and earth and purgatory black which is right here fourth the beasts pale horse Satan kicked out of heaven that he talks about reading in Revelation 12 so he's telling the off number of white red black and pale which is what you got what Antichrist false prophet then you've got what Phi curve heaven and earth and then what have you got you got Satan coming down and Satan in this right when we leave Satan incarnate to be right when we leave when when he's kicked out of heaven we go to heaven he's kicked out of heaven sure he's kicked out of heaven inside of you today I hope I pray that he's been kicked out of your heaven inside because for you and I are supposed to be raised up living in heavenly places at the moment right now alright that okay so Antichrist false prophet but you know what the glorious thing is Satan is going to continue his ride after we're gone but he will be destroyed in a group of people because when death is destroyed the saints come back from that other dimension Satan has been cast out of everything that was weak everything I mean this thing everything he's been kicked out of this thing alright so now let's go to the next I'm gonna try to cover as much as I can today but not keep you remember this is remember remember how all the time we've we've put the Redemption Redemption Redemption so we must keep Redemption in our mind when we talk about the seals not that the Antichrist was this and that in the other we know that that was the seal that rode away but I want to know what the revelation was underneath that seal the revelation underneath that seal is my and your Redemption and then not just redeemed in soul so death has to be destroyed now if you're born again today death is destroyed in your soul but not in your spirit right your memory reason conscious affection imagination is your problem in my problem again one more time this flesh is not your problem this flesh only does what's motivated on the inside this same hand that used to hold the beer I'm sorry you used to hold a beer in this hand right here and I used to curse out of this mountain now God didn't throw my old body away and get me a new one what'd he do he changed this one but he didn't change this flesh he changed the motivator down inside but still I have problems you know why it's like brother Nell said he said I didn't like beer til I got saved and then every time somebody open the beer well you know who that is that ain't the devil in his soul doing that that's the devil anointing his spirit to try to do that amen so it's not your flesh so forget about your flesh sure your flesh is the product of sin but it's not sin you're gonna live in that body for an eternity that's a revelation that we don't understand living this body this body redeemed not another body because resurrection is not replacement Jesus didn't resurrect in another body but yet he stood there one day great revelation to me the other day I told you about great revelation to me my problem was is is how am I gonna stand in a corrupt body are you how are you gonna stand in a corrupt body and call the Dead Saints out of the ground Jesus stood in a corrupt body you saw his body was dying folks Jesus's body looked 50 but he was only 30 so something in his flesh was dying because he came into this world and then but he stood one day and he said Lazarus come forth I am the resurrection and the life and you know what Martha got so confused she said oh I know my brother will raise in the resurrection she throat that thing thousands of years ahead when he was standing right there beside of her could that be our problem folks the resurrection has got to be among us in us not benches and chairs and walls and tapes and it's got to be a live message we're not gonna take a tape recorder listen to me we're not gonna take a tape recorder out there in the in the graveyards and set it down and match play and expect the people to come out of the grave no it's gonna be somebody stand one day and say I believe everything that the Prophet said I believe everything that the Bible says and it all connects and then death has to be destroyed a resurrection has to take place this is on the fourth seal then a rapture takes place rapture is the last thing a rapture is what is a what it's a what does rapture me ecstasy it means the the pinnacle the point of the top point so that rapture takes place but how'd you get there oh no brother Mark I just appeared and there I was I was looking to know please when you were a baby you were a baby but then you grew up and that's why you grow up brother those priests in the statue of a perfect man that's got to be in place how you gonna get a resurrection without that thing in place because that man was standing there he was the perfect man standing on earth in a body that was corrupted that okay maybe that will help boost your faith a little bit because a lot of times you know what we say wait a minute you know what Satan says to us how you gonna get the dead out of the ground and you looked in the way you are yeah right right right Ray's going gray is gonna go I am the resurrection but you know what I didn't bother Jesus they didn't bother him they didn't bother him and say I am the resurrection and the life I'm sure he probably wasn't feeling good that day maybe he's been on a four-day journey he's probably a little tired and any wept remember afterwards hope but a rapture takes place on this seal so if something's got to happen to destroy death a resurrection takes place and then a rapture is is is just the trying to the culmination of everything that's happened will be the rapture so I'm not looking for the rapture please don't just look for the rapture and I like that I'll see you in the rapture that's okay but I want to see in a resurrection I want to see the Dead come back because they got to they got to come back here through the opening of these seals is what's going to bring the dead out of the ground and I believe that's what it was sent for what's it for a rapture a rapture is going to take place amen unavoidable but the things that lead up to it it's what you and I had lost down through the ages man had preached this was it and this was that listen even when Paul was on the earth talking about an out resurrection sitting in heavenly places to see the message preacher they go out and start preaching the resurrections already happened hello remember Paul had to rebuke them Paul had to rebuke him that's what's happening now folks that's what's happening now we got message preachers thinking what brother Brian said and they go out and preach it in this room sorry resurrections not going to happen without the perfect word being in place but now where is Satan oh he's in the bar he's in the whorehouse he said he got here before you did and he was sitting right here when y'all got here and he'll be sitting around here when you leave because he's got in your spirit realm and he's playing in your memory reason conscious effect listen if you're born again forget about you so it's going free ticket right but you got to feed that baby you got feed that baby and whether your flesh feels good or not your memory reason conscious affection imagination it's where your problem is so I'm not worried you know I went to my 40th class reunion last night Josh and Danny were there they were a year well a couple years back and forth but we had a 40 year anniversary and I told him I said I know we were going to have a meeting with all of us there I said because the haircare aisle at Walmart was empty never seen as much fake in my life I told them I said I know every one of these aids because we all graduated together but what's man doing though my point is man has trained I don't mind you put hair color don't bother me but man has tried to dress this thing up and that's okay to make it better you know I deliver a mail and I see these things you know it'll make your life 20 years younger feel like 20 again I just shove in the mailbox and then about two weeks later I see this pill bottle come and I put that pill bottle in a pill bottle in the same mailbox and that's okay I take vitamins and you know I take those things I need to quit eatin dhania Susan are looking good they're losing some weight that's good that's fine but remember remember bodily what is it bodily exercise profiteth little it didn't say didn't profit nothing is probably the little we don't want to destroy our flesh but look Satan's already doing that so don't worry about it but that spirit realm where the memory reason conscious effects an imagination is what God is inside if you're born again working its way through those senses but Satan has took the mind and through those senses that's where my memory reads and conscious infection because remember your affection is is always feel your love in that realm agape love is what's in your soul that's the love of God that's not to love God that's the love of God remember perfect love the prophet of God said was what was in that six dimension so that's what we're dealing with if you've got the new birth today you have perfect love in your soul but any other realm you deal with it's going to be filial love memory reason conscious in that spirit realm all right so the love of God's working this way out but you know what the love of this world if you love the world and the things of this world what the love of God is not in you the love of God now the love of God is what I got beloved which is right there on them on the pyramid there by all right with that okay but watch what Satan does though let's go to the national number three no getting very far no it is fully Satan on his throne offered it to God offered it to our Lord here you're sitting here with this beastly heart in him now here's the person the Beast incarnate devil nice home but we're on the fourth seal so we're right here at our time he makes his appearing here on earth under the false pretense oh my goodness under the false pretense of the true word he associates himself with the word listen he's not worried about the Baptist in the Methodist anymore he's got them this is where he's worried about and then he's worried about here this is where he's worried about he associates himself with the word sort of be so close to the what deceive that may deceive they're very late right excuse me no watch but look how he's going to be destroyed number four for sale now we had him come in last night with this great sword to kill we find out that he gets killed with the sword - that's a capital F the sword of the word you can't remember brother brems that you are no match for the devil you're not because you're weak in your memory reason conscious flex and imagination because he chose the mind God chose the heart and then your heart is either faith or doubt no gray area there but you've got a lot of gray area in that spirit realm and then sharp two-edged sword the sword of the word god's word sharp two-edged sword slays him puts him right down wait till them seven thunders uttered their voices and I believe that we have that group here that's hearing the Word of God I don't mean here in this building I mean here in this the people that are preaching the true message of the hour and the depth of the message the meat of the message and then not just herring dressed brother Ram didn't come to restore hair and dressing on he came to restore the word in its power power weight to limb seven thunders are the voices to that group who really can take the Word of God and hand it there it sliced it'll slice and cut they can close the heaven eating shouldn't what they want to whatever they want to now he's talking about the two prophets to a degree but he's also talking about you and I because remember the two prophets will not come to this earth until we're out of here so therefore a resurrection have had to take place for restoration a resurrection a rap from the Gentile Church and then the two prophets can come on the scene and do what they do but I believe right in that little space of time though you and I are going to be able to maybe tell a hurricane to go away I tell somebody the other day I said you know what I got a guy that all he had to do was stand up and say peace be still man can't even they've tried to blow them hurricane that them things are so huge but it's not huge to God if you have a hurricane in your life you say this thing's just too big you know what turned over to God let him stand on your boat and say peace be still hey man that all right that's how great he is but the last plague that hits us is spiritual death natural death people have been dying for me nzl thousands of years right people been dying physically but they're spiritually alive if they're born again all right okay so now look let's go go ahead and pull it up because spiritual death is the last thing that hits the church but I want you to realize something real quick though listen to me don't look at that in a natural death life leaves the body okay life leaves the body in a natural death it goes somewhere the body is put in the ground all right we'll read a scripture maybe in a few minutes if we have time for don't we maybe this afternoon where we we plant them in corruption you have to plant something before it can grow we plant them in corruption but we raise them in in corruption that's what Jesus said all right well that's what the scripture says when I say Jesus said he wrote the whole Bible is that okay when I said Jesus said it doesn't mean this red-letter because remember in the beginning was the word the Word was with God in the Word was God so Jesus is the word made manifest so if I say Jesus said it and it was in Galatians don't say no Paul wrote that thereby all right with that you put a human in the ground his life goes somewhere but if you put a seed in the ground a natural plant you put a seed in the ground what is it it has to have life in it but there has to be a death I'm getting back to what was some of them in ago there has to be a death of that outside shell coach there's life inside that all right but something has to die Jesus didn't accept the corn of wheat fall in the ground and die it abideth alone but what in other words if that one corn comes up it will produce a whole field and in another field and then another field and then that's what now we know that that was Jesus they had to we had to he had to be planted in the earth he was dead Jesus Christ in the first part of him was dead laying in the grave cold and dead but remember he was alive so he said step the corn wheat going the ground one that we know to that the corn wheat went in the ground around here in the fourth Age in the Dark Age remember right but it's to come back but not to go in the ground again hey listen we can't all be dead in a resurrection happens somebody's got to be alive because the dead in Christ shall rise first we'll get to that maybe next Sunday and we which are alive and remain shall not prevent so in other words we're prevent we're preventing and hindering them from getting here amen this whole thing hinges on enough to witnesses 144,000 even the Millennium Millenium can't start you said watch too much no God pressurized you for this time he puts you in a place where you can understand what's going on if you can't understand what's going on you need to be somewhere where you can understand what's going on so this is too late but if you plant that corn seed in the ground but you know what let me give you a little revelation now I would think that he had lost his rocker some of the family thinks he already lost him but that's okay ask but if he plants all this corn seed and then I go over there one morning and he's he's sitting in his chair looking down that row two days later he's still sitting there looking down that row you know what he's doing he's waiting for that seed to come up but you know what's happening ain't nothing happening where he can see it ain't nothing happening where you say it Louis what's happening is underneath in the earth there's life there's a process there's a death but in underneath there and then what does he see he sees the manifestation that there's already life and that's what's happening that he saw there's nothing happening don't be the one to stamp sets and looks in the garden and wait for the whole corn to come up you plant a seed if it's got life in it it'll come up so all that work though you can't see it until that little thing pops up several days later about that high and all of a sudden you see a manifestation of the life there was a lot of work brother out going on underneath that soil maybe you'll get that one day alright let's go to this right here but look we're not we're I'm not worried about physical death if you're born again you shouldn't be worried about physical death spiritual death is the last thing to strike the church you should all it's got to be them denomination they're already dead they're already there the way you worry about them because remember we hang on a lot about Eve having sex relation with the beast in the garden to cause the fall that did not cause the fall that didn't cause the fall Eve accepted it in her mind first then what happened is her body yielded to what that thing inside now remember remember she had to lie for guarding her soul her theophany was eternal according to the Prophet and I believe that remember Eve was in theophany and Adam and then they were separated I don't believe he gave her a lesser soul he gave her the soul of God so she didn't send in her soul she reasoned in her memory reason conscious affection imagination you know why you know why I know that happened go that's how the devil gets the menu not this but this will manifest what's inside and that's what happened so what this was both physical and spiritual Brennan's book words Regency first and anytime there's a physical and a spiritual death with E first and anytime I told you asked you this morning sisters to forgive me so I can mention that any time that a woman takes the wrong step I'm talking about crossing the bride now but anytime a woman takes a wrong step she has the first receive it in her mind some slicker has to persuade her hold on let me read it again some message preacher has to persuade her is a Baptist gonna as a Baptist preacher gonna come in here today and deceive you I hope not I hope not but anytime a woman takes the wrong steps she has to first receive it in her mind the first wound that was polluted was not her physical wound the first wound that was polluted was her fifth was her mind Amen right some slickers so first it hit Satan hit Eve's mind and then the will of her mind she doubted God's Word then come the actual ID and the only way that we can ever be born again now look if you want to know right here the prophets telling you anyway if you want to know brother Dale's been preaching on the new birth for a year or so this one quote should answer it right here because brother Ram says the only way that we can ever be born again if you believe brother Ram was a prophet he's telling us something I said if you believe brother Branham with the problem he's telling you something right here first in the womb of the mind receive the word and then the Spirit comes on top of that and brings it to life there you are that's what does it that's the real gospel teaching brother I believe it st. Paul standing here he teach the same thing I do in this hour so how do you get the new birth receive the word receive the word in the womb of your mind and then the Holy Spirit comes on top of that word and brings it to life that okay I'm just telling you what the Prophet said get mad at him if you man met him I'm just reading you a quote the only way never be born again now let's go number six cuz remember we still got to cover this everybody all right amen now we're coming down to the last plague last thing and I'm God said I'm tired of fooling now I'm gonna give the last plague now I want you to notice the lags last plague was death now we've had quakes and I picked this quote out and I thought it was kind of striking with all the things going on or quakes manhunt earthquakes in Hawaiian and typhoons in in Philippines and this whole world shaking and this big thing that just hit here you know they just one or two behind it so now we've had earthquakes we've had wars and rumors of wars this is 1953 we've had tidal waves as Jesus said would be the sea irori man's heart failing more heart trouble number one disease fear perplex of time distressed between the nation horseless carriages in the Broadway cars all these things fulfilled but the last plague is death not physically speaking but spiritually speaking death spiritually in the church you notice it was amongst the sons spiritual death the church has got more members than it ever had thriving better than it ever did and yet the weakest in the spirit that it ever was that's true that's just like what it was in Egypt remember all the plagues hit Egypt finally the last plague was death and without the token applied over the door you died firstborn you and I are the firstborn Jesus Christ with the firstborn but you know what we're joint heirs with the Church of the white firstborn all right so if you don't have the token applied then one of the Death Angel comes you die amen but remember to have blood over the door you got to have a lamb inside the house you gotta have a lamb inside the house then you ply the token you can't apply the token without a lamb in the house hey man Lamb of God you get you can apply you throw blood everywhere no you got to have a lamb and that lamb had to what died that lamb had to die and then you eat the lamb same way with the Word of God all right let's go to number seven the unveiling of God they spiritually die now this is a spiritual veil that was a natural valley stone method the veil of the temple all right this is a spiritual veil they walking right on in behind there you can tell them oh I know I know that but I see go ahead that's all right it only speaks you remember the last plagues in Egypt was death before the Exodus the last plague on earth is spiritual death before the Exodus then they'll be cremated and turned back to the dust hmm what when all the atomic stuff blows up they'll be cremated and turn back to the dust and the righteous will walk out upon their ashes but the last thing is spiritual death rejecting the word and the word went into the ground at Nicaea we know that for a fact brother I'm told us but remember the life went down in the roots it didn't kill the tree you can't kill the Tree of Life but you can kill the effects of the Tree of Life and that's what the problem is they've they've took away the the pom warm light a pillar and the other one they have taken away what fellowship and all these things so it's for it's going to do it take this down then for it's got to bring us back that's why we see steel one two three and four steel four is what we leave we get out of here all right but now five six and seven has something to do with it because we're Gentiles we get all of it Israel gets 144,000 they get 1260 days preached by two prophets that's it there's this specific that's a you know they come in you and I are Gentiles we're scattered that man then all right so the word wind of the roots but said I will restore now what happened was right here we may talk about a little bit this afternoon but right here what happened was Satan began to fool the whole world the whole world today is food by Satan they all agree on Father Son Holy Ghost baptism they all agree in the Trinity of God amen they all agree in eternal hell the oh the world the whole world Oh religious world agree agrees on that that's why it's going to be so hard what Satan has done he's attached itself to the word so that he looks like the word he looks like the word but they'll come a showdown because he can't stand all of it and you and I are gonna be the manifestation of all of it but he fooled everybody what not with corruption of the body Satan didn't come in and make a prostitute a prostitute what do you do that prostitute is motivated by what's inside of her we were we were looking at the what we look at what was the mayor of Joe or somebody was listening to the testimony of had the testimony of the woman that was the drunk and all what was her name Rosella now God didn't throw her body Wayne gave her a new one he cleaned that one up he didn't clean the body up itself he cleaned the motivating spirit that was inside that body and brother Brent said she went out in what she's testifying to the world had that God changed her that's the same way with you and I because the rest of the world you're corrupted in your mind first you have to accept it in your mind first that's why that even though that Satan is doing that though but remember the Bible always talks about hearing the word hearing the word hearing the word open the eyes of my heart Lord I want to see you but I want to hear you and then I want to hear what you got to say because look revelation 13:5 tells us this and they worship the dragon wood gate power into the Beast and they worship the Beast saying who is likened to the beast who is able to make war with him and it was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given in him to continue forty and two months and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name now this is supposed to be the most religious person in the world this is going to be the Antichrist that's going to lead a religious awakening hello a religious awakening where they're going to persecute us a little while but they're going to kill a hunt they're going to kill the foolish virgin for what they believe because it's outside of what they believe and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given unto him over all Kindred's and tongues and nations and all look all seven billion people on this earth that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world that's the only thing that will keep you amen that's the only thing it's going to keep you and I from falling into that trap that all right say ma'am first Timothy first Timothy said but she that liveth and pleasure is dead while she liveth seven billion people are Walking Dead all but all but the bride were the only people that are alive we're the only people that have life eternal life but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth hey listen the denomination's they love their denomination Catholics you know Catholics love their cat they love their Pope they die for him amen but she that liveth him pleasure is dead while she liveth they're all right I mean but I want to say something right here about this about this guy that we're talking about that's so powerful let's go to Isaiah 14 hours our fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nation's now this is the all-powerful devil Satan himself this is not talking about another person this done by him for thou hast said in that heart I will ascend into and I will exalt my throne above the stars of God and I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation tell you who he's that he's in the congregation in the sides of the north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider these saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake Kingdom that's what's got to happen to me in you you got to look and say is that the man because remember he's one he doesn't have any power I just read where he says power was given power was given power was given power was given we give Satan power once we take it away from him though Jesus which stood one dance did the Prince of this world's come has nothing to me now can you say that I want you to start confessing it I want us to start confessing that because you know what that statue of a man perfect man if you come to that that proves that Satan's been destroyed in you Allah can see brother branham because he was a complete grief he's in the grave wait no me and you what he preached is going to bring him out of the ground there's not gonna be clear tape recorder let's let's finish right here I got a few things that I wanted to bring it but I want there must be a restoration before a resurrection I will restore remember the promise of Joel I will restore now was reading this and I was thinking about you know Elijah when you do in first Kings to save time we won't read that remembering first kings are what happened the 450 prophets a bale what did they do they jumped up and down on that altar with their false teaching broke the altar down scattering the altar scattered worship got a little out of hand but did their but did their God show up no but they did tear the sanctuary down they did say you can cut your hair and they did say there was an eternal hell and they did say that you could do this and they did say you could do that brother Brown said it was a weakness behind the pulpit because we're sheep we have to be led have to be led we're sheep you better just believe that we all are we're sheep to be led by the chief Shepherd our problem is is we get out of the fold every once in a while but what did he restore cuz remember what he told him he told him he said in other words you've destroyed this so what did he do he took 12 he took all the stones and he put them back in place let me read that that's just too good not to read let me read that Bob will read it anyway that okay all right here we go first Kings 18 verse 29 I don't think they have this but listen to what I'm saying and it came to pass when midday was passed this is verse 29 if you want to pull it up that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that sound familiar this is the evening time later than you think then that that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded in other words silence and Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me now think of what the profit of guarding this last day did for us and put it in this scene come near unto me gathering the people together and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down he repaired all those false doctrines that had been up until the evening time they'd been false doctrine repaired all that false doctrine and Elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob remember you can't forget Israel because this message is going to Israel to what to restore them not back to temple worship but the worship of the true God and Elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be thy name now watch and with the stones what is a stone revelation and with Revelation he built an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order thereby right with that and cut the Bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels wine ox man and Eagle fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice it on the wood right and he said do it the second pool then he said do it the third pool he did it three times and the water ran we're out of bounds the altar and fill the trench also with water and he came to pass at the time of the even offering of the evening sacrifice that the lines of the Prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God and Israel and that I am thy servant and I've done all these things at thy word hear me O Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord got in that thou has turned their heart back he didn't say hearts he's quoting Malcolm or Malachi was actually quoting him remember we turn the heart back then the fire of the Lord fell why he had to restore he had to turn the heart back first then the five the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said Lord the Lord hears the God the Lord he is the God and then what do you do with the prophets a bale took him down to the river and slew every one of them listen prophets are really nice people until you cross them with the word amen so now let's read this one thing right here to set up for this afternoon let's go to Ezekiel 37 because I never really seen this - me and brother Matthew was talking about it this past weekend because remember we look at the off number for their bow right we look at the off number for but for his restoration all right man I tell you I thought I was getting asleep and cried this afternoon what are you sleeping for this morning you just got up this is life good staying up all night might be able to sleep the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord and sent me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bone and caused me to pass by them roundabout and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry but now watch and he said unto me son of man capital s son of man can these bones live I've looked through seven Church ages and I saw a lot of dry bones I saw a lot of dryness but I will restore and I answered O Lord thou knowest and again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and saying to them oh ye dry bones hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto these bones now he's talking to bones he's not talking to flyff he's talking to bones he's talking to bones behold that will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live each oh that's it we're done the bones just popped up and started breathing is that what happened no because you started with bones it's not good to have flesh without bones it's not good to have muscle without bones take the bones out man we're just we just fall into the like hamburger meat we just fall it right so you have to have bones the structure of your body is bones bones is what holds you together is what puts you in upright because you have all these other things and not be where you can stand because remember when we get finished this person stood nail a damn they won't be in a resurrection they won't be nobody laying down we put them in the ground laying down they're not gonna be coming through that door laying down they gonna be standing up a man I will cause breath in or you and you shall live and I will lay sin you upon you what sinew tendons that's what pulls everything together and we'll bring up flash upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live bones seen you skin life cuz watch and I will lay sinews upon you will bring up flash upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you you shall live and you shall know that i am the lord in other words when that thing stands on his feet ezekiel didn't do it the property god didn't do it but god almighty through the prophet it's telling them what's gonna happen that's what happened to you and I Amen God spoke to us in the end time straight I mean straight to us so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a thunder there was a noise and behold a shaking oh what it's thunder dude man when you hear a good thunder going off that same boom the whole house shake I hope God shakes your whole house today and the bones came together because remember the bones were even scattered he had to put the skeleton together I hope you're getting something here and when I beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came upon them and the skin covered them above they were still laying down there was no breath then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy not Son of God not son of David son of man and say to the wind thus saith the Lord God come from the four winds line arts man and Eagle come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so I prophesied listen this is the prophecy but you and I are going to live the reality of this so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceeding great army then he said unto me son of man capital s these bones are the whole house of Israel sure brother wait their toe he's talking about Israel are you gonna take you out of this yet were you just gonna say last for Israel no that's for me and you so I prophesied as he commanded the breath came into them and they lived put it on the feet sitting right on these tend to me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesy and saying to them watch this thus saith the Lord God behold o my people I will open your grave I will open your graves and cause you to come out of your graves and bring you into the Land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your graves o my people and brought you up out of your grave and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and I will place you in your own land then shall you know that I the LORD have spoken it and performed it saith the Lord now it's already been spoken right now he's performing it if you'll believe it let's stand our feet you got to believe listen we all wait we all we need to look here one more one more thing let them bring it up right here Hebrews four and twelve now this is our scripture for this day I believe for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit what we've been talking about now our problem is as we get all convoluted that he's talking about the soul and then we said no he's talking about the spirit and he was saying well my flesh is bad forget the flesh forget the flesh you're not gonna ever make that flesh better until you make the inside got better alright but look it took a prophet to come to separated and tell us the characteristics of the body spirit and soul and of the joints and marrow that's bone that's what is in your bone and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it took a prophet to come to divide that to show us can these dry bones live can this dead Pentecostal Turks live can this dead whatever you want to call it live yes it can live hear the word of the Lord musicians come hear the word of the Lord that's what hope that the whole thing of that Ezekiel was hearing the word of the Lord can these dry bones live somebody prophesied that they live like we saw it but he said he promised he said I'll bring you out of that grave and I'll put life in you comes I'll promise you one thing when they come out of that grave they ain't gonna have to dig their way out oh no it's gonna be a supernatural happening that nobody in the world is gonna know nobody in the world is gonna know except the bride of Jesus Christ is the only people that's gonna know why because she has a part in it if you don't have a part in it you don't know what's going on you don't know what's going on amen if you don't have a place for not if you're not the bride of Jesus Christ how in the world you're going to understand what the bridegroom said when he's not your bridegroom and then but when the bridegroom tells it to the bride I'm talking to you now you go do it let's sing a song god bless you till this afternoon we'll talk about the Son of Man this afternoon because the son of man has got to be here before there can be a resurrection but the son of man can't get here without a restoration amen let's sing a song amen I love that song worshiping if you need anything long treason for our wall that's what Lord God was here for for us to live man the nourishes God's own heart oh let the Word of God empower Holy One world where every road the Word of God will guide Word of God ever truth painted me treasure you train we have come with heart [Music] we were [Music]
