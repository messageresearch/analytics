come the coach we got water food and get all of it set in order so we'll make sure you do it that way okay excuse me anything else Marquis having stomach problems you know just remember that anybody else let's pray then we'll read our scripture from John three and then we'll read from John 14 and you're on 16 okay you have any father our Lord our Savior our own and all our Redeemer we thank you for all of those things that you've revealed unto us over all of the years about yourself and how you've made yourself known among listen we're going to come down to indicate that with things that we've seen you do among us and we cannot deny the fact that you're here because we wouldn't even try to do but we would like to see you more and we realize that we're standing in your way because you're wanting to do it so we ask you to help us to get out of the way where we can see you living in our hearts and life have your way as we reach your word and come and speak to us about these things in any questions Lord you be the answer to these things in you in that way then we don't have to worry forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us in Jesus name Amen there we go to John one I mean done use the three three first one there was a name it there were the man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unclean rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with and they gave him a great honor Denny well jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said to him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born to the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again I will pick up these two scriptures and tie together verse 26 John 14 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you now watch it he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance whatsoever I have say it alright now watch the next one as it goes over to the sixteenth chapter and verse 12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot here bear them now howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth what praise shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come then read satara further on the revelation fine he shall glorify me for he shall receive a man and show if I'm to you I might be see the door that is blessing to the reading of the word no I want you to keep those scriptures in mind because of what we were trying to cover their Wednesday night and we will review a little bit of it and all but I want you to keep those scriptures in mind that we read because as we read through hope back some this morning that brother Brown said that Jesus never said you to speak in tongues he never said to you a child she never said you'd do this annually he says you would receive the word and that would be the evidence of whether you're born together or not I mean then I tried to make myself plain about what I've said you know about this on the evidence and things and I firmly believe that the Bible really takes the profit bit you know when you receive the Holy Ghost that's the new birth the speaking and the tongues of doings you doing that's an act that's a an attribute of that that's a display of that he already got the Holy Ghost it's like they was in the upper room it says they are the tongues of fire settled each one of them all right now I don't believe that they set up their tongues of fire set on them and nobody move and then they run outside and everybody heard him speaking but that is the way did it happen that they were up stars when they receive the Holy Ghost and then when they went outside the people heard him speaking in you know their own tongue and the mystery has always been then in the hearing hearing not in a speakin as much Johannes based upon that alright let's see then that way I tried to show you that the disciples for three and a half years were tutors before holding those could follow man that's my money and he was the great one like a polish over there teaching that Jesus was the Christ but knowing nothing about the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know about x19 all right and see then that way you can cover it to that but then you know you don't do away with the fact that I said that on the day of Pentecost you got the Upper Room experience they take took three and a half years for them to get tutored to that point all right yes they were justified and sanctified but then on that time that they came out and spake those that were there only heard one sermon and they went through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost to receive eternal life all right so then we covered you can do that you can't believe all the way to receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost at one time I believed in that but I believe that the biggest portion won't do it better what that's right all right so that's just my statements and I gave you the quote and I gave it back that we're reading at the end where time we're gonna read said very few people will relieve all the way to even receive it in the Holy Ghost I know very few people he said will believe all the way of the receipt well that means the majority is going to stop somewhere and not go all the way to receiving the baptism of the holy no all right then we talked about what would be the you know the doing of that and I told you that I believe in this thing we covered that we went over it not the age of Luther not Wesley not you know this is even time going on that helps Azusa Street but the new birth table and suits are strict and that's what a lot of people don't want to believe but they didn't have run around said the baptism of the Holy Ghost exactly like the book of Acts now the Susur Street was not the Upper Room experience because they were not - - they were Trinitarians in Azusa Street but it was the same way as the 3000 outside we preached that to you for 47 years about the difference between the upper room experience people of 120 and the 3000 outside but now I firmly believe that you cannot receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost until you first hear the word now because faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word and how can you do that and it's like I still talk to you a little bit Larry the other day about it and some of the sermons that they're in the scriptures they were some trying some of the Apostles was trying to pray for the people in the book of Acts you get the baptismal to go and they have you called Peter or John or one of the other to come down and lay hands on them and they receive the Holy Ghost all right what was wrong I mean you had apostles trying to bring the new birth all the people and they couldn't receive it it just wasn't doing but when do you know that they were a little something little something I don't nobody was ever a little something that it caused the problem they couldn't receive it well then I believe that you must be taught the word the seat must be laid in to us Jesus preached the word to the disciples for three light years and then the Holy Ghost with the network and that was the Newmark all right now see then in that we believe in and I believe in three definite steps of grace our sages are we don't want to use the word works from the Prophet we gave you that where he said it's not works because it's not there's a work of the Holy Spirit yes in our lives but it's not works with no salvation don't my works but it comes in stage yes that's all right then I believe now in this age in time where we're at that to how the new work you must come to justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the how did you work all right now then I believe in each a each one of those having a sale for a stage if you do it at one time right at the altar all right you still come through you're gonna have to come through that you gonna have to be repented you're going to have to be sanctified and then you'll have to be filled with the Holy Spirit all right so that way I believe that it's all tied together and they shouldn't be any argument or question about what the the doings of the new birth it's the purpose of the work all right if we had to hurt the word how here we without a preacher and happy to preach unless the he be sent the covers into the point then that means all people that called us up preachers or not preachers now there might be preachers but they're not you know anything remember I gave it to you where brother rather said false prophets produced false birth he said but true prophets bring truth birthday all right that's what I believe is a definite time that you were justified never that time you were sanctified and definite time of the baptism I only know if you go through it at one time you still went through that but if it takes years to go through the process right so what they'll come on in right it's the Sun and if you're predestinated unto it you're gonna come to the right right if you're not you're not gonna come to that as this solves the problem there shouldn't be any any point of argument about the things all right and in doing that then see we covered the last as though the new birth being what the birth of the word so that's what it's been in every age if we are are the children Jesus was actually birthed by the word a birth means are coming forth into what the word birth means coming forth into as he actually came Jesus himself came forth into human flesh and was birthed out of a mother you know you know that and that was his part he didn't have to have the new birth because he was the birth he wasn't loud you didn't need a savior he was to say about honor receiving we've seen all of that then we got to talk about the evidence of the holy spirit and you know I was all over the news quite a few of these from the past of what we were talking about Wednesday night and then you know you can go back in and listen to it but Brunn around the he's States on Christ the minister of God revealed paragraph 233 these are not coming up on the screen then Christ mr. Vadra until 63 720 what is the new birth their brother Brandon what is the new word it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen see not you join the church you shook a hand you've done something different you said Acree you promised to live about color roofs but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ they where there's pastor priests where it might be it's Christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built to phone all right so what is the numeric right around it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it's not the revelation of Jesus Christ to brother Branham that won't burn you it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to using the matter alright now we're gonna make a statement I supposed to vote this afternoon pastor so you decide to throw me out if you like to but I'm like this I don't believe and I said a little bit about it Wednesday night Paul said follow me as I follow Christ all right now we're not going beyond brother branham Holly and I were talking about it discussing it we're not in the days and say like a lot of things we've gone beyond brother Brown now we're gonna take a change of the body that he did tonight all right we're going to manifest some things that he didn't make manifest but we're not going beyond him come run around never went beyond Paul other than the opening of the fundament of the same work all right now so there was a time that we were leaning upon following brother Branham right then we see that run around introduced the fivefold ministry she's supposed to take any carried on I didn't say these things he did all right whether you think I'm part of it or not that's none of my business forget it you just do what you want to huh but see there's a time thing we don't just say when we followed run around who said we follow Christ that was in Paul Christ that was in leader Christ that was in John Christ that was in brother Branham all right now we say we follow the Christ in the fivefold ministry to carry something right and I'm just as honest as I can be if I pass off today standing right here and I don't cabbage down on what talk you don't want to say in their searches are do it when the pastor teaches them up to a point then they don't never get them another pastor really officially they just kind of let somebody print you a little bit but if you don't line up with what brother so-and-so had talked he gets put out and they give him another one will heaven the hell something happens to make sure the tapes and the planes retire but what I thought that I believe run around common and we have walk run around the top to check it out with but take the message personally to you and continue home get you a pastor and rattle it behind that pastor and don't this one brother Valens a silent leader you're really like I told you the brother city code in California right here to follow the Lula finances that's where you messed up ain't no Lula thought they same thing you think your teeth and I'm gonna be around here to a change sure you yourself can't fine we know what rudder they'll talk if it's the truth of what run around talk that's fine but get you a faster and continue home to the change of the body they need to pull me out of the ground okay could it be done and you rally around me then me you both will be in the grande all right that's just the way I talk you want money and that's the way I believed it all right but I see I believe the new birth is exactly what run around see Christ revealed in you not in me whether or not I'm born again has nothing to do with your experience I this whether or not you're 49 is whether or not you see Jesus Christ written on the internet and Jesus Christ is the word then he goes on I gave it to you from Pat much the 1960 1204 leading the service paragraph 71 the only way you can ever be saved is my revelation you're not safe push out here I said but speaking in tongue I'll make that money that's what you do after the baby right you get the baby you socket life is there the baby then it Crouch then it speaks in tongues in each house but that's not the life the life is not the shout and speaking it's done that's a attribute of the lock all right so they can only be saved by revelation you can't be saved by anything else all right then read around says what now who message home what shall we do with Jesus called the Christ 1964 1:26 leading the service he said you say you talking about believe it he said the devil village he said Wesley shouted found daddy you know but he found that he didn't pay the call said speaking in tongues and you got it they didn't Christian side said the love you got fruits and spirit but they have they denied the divinity I'm Jesus Christ what is the evidence with that spirit that's in you then punctuate Everitt promise whether they man and god will confirm it now listen to things and God will confirm it he said that's exactly the way it was with Jesus Christ nothing exactly let love is Jesus Christ your experience all right didn't you call the fruits of the spirit he goes on to say the fruits of the spirit is wonderful but the kind of reach that fruits of the spirit that's right more than Jesus that drove them out of the temple honey then the only true evidence is your Christian is whether or not you can accept the word now I like the way he said it whether or not the spirit in you agrees then say agreed honey disagrees with the word me because that way then you continue it it does you see people come in the message and they stay a while and all they want something comes up and they're gone well label it is ugly and they leave blazing right no somebody corn was able to do right they believe oh yeah I believe everything right around said well where are you in the door oh well I don't believe it going to church well then that's forsaking the assembling of yourselves together and that's what Jesus citizen okay no problem that's right yeah but then we went on to cover what is the evidence of a believer that's taken from when your eyes were open they um 64 for 16 paragraph 126 but what is the evidence of a believer that will but believes that identified word of the hour it's always been that way they said it's always been that way the people get it frequent up and all kind of traditions and religious religions and denominations and educational work but God comes along with his word to confirm it for an hour that's the evidence when God confirms you all right if we don't come and we take a change of the body come on grace then evidently he was wrong I like what brother round said he said the bride people have heard of even say I don't need no vindication brother Branham with men decayed my father a vindicated Mason okay you weren't wonderful little Rama said the bride would vindicate somebody's gotta take the chain to the body that's why the people are look waiting for brother Branham to return right and in the return ministry since I because they're not certain about what they've got no they've gotta have some form to hold on to and I told you what I've said about no thing you can come back at breaks to us with salvation gonna be over with you don't get saved after he comes back they're gonna be 30 40 days they need to be here yet right but how long would it take him to straighten out all these doctrines Oh Nathe about the evidence of the Holy Ghost so we went on to the next one who were on broken sister 1964 he's covering the paragraph 66 through 68 that brother Brandon says what he said that he was talking real email about it and said they talked about it and he first thought that it was love and he said I would hold on to that he said that sounded pretty good so I just held that if a man's not love but one day the Lord in Ephesians straighten me out he said that the evidence of the Spirit with those who could receive the word mustnít neither love are speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word he goes on to down sentences so the genuine evidence the Holy Ghost he has never told me anything wrong never that's the Holy Ghost today is he who can believe the word then you can receive it but when the Holy Ghost is come the Jesus never said listen to Bryn Renner Jesus never said when the Holy Ghost has come you speak in tongues he never said when I wanna go says come you do any of those things he said you pay though these things of mine and show them to you and we'll show you things that is to come so there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost according to Jesus himself now that he don't change nobody this got their heart set on that I spoke in tongues when I got that and I'm not gonna argue with nobody to tell you he did I'm just gonna tell you to make sure cuz that's what the Bible said the Bible says make your calling and election sure that's what I've always said one thousand four ladies three more to go we hum towns to quote this I draw their seat guard all my life find out I had it then the Nazi guard and find out I didn't have it so you're looking at one feller the internet or wherever you look you look at one that seats thought every day I want to continual experience with my Savior matters yeah man I'm it sometimes it gets kind of dry because he doesn't train babies like we do he don't tell us sometimes he kind of lets us run a little bit over a woman you know I don't mean that wrongly now but he just had backs away from us with his presence but what does that matter am i Christians be called I shout no I have my Christian Carter speaking done no am i Christian with God I'd say everyday I feel this pressure if that's what's your face don't you're gonna find really Dale saving in the devil's diet and you're gonna need okay you're gonna get a date you don't feel like then when you come in you don't get a day when you don't feel like shopping you don't feel that crying you don't feel like you but what are you gonna do right you won't say you lost no I'm gonna say God said it I believe it and that's it alright so we went on with the questions of masters 1964 8:23 Heath and paragraph 2 12 when the Holy Ghost is come let's see the question what is the evidence that a person that's truly filled with only hood that was the question John 14:26 one would read when the Holy Ghost is coming show you these things the hill perfected man mates won't do it he is the work when he the Holy Ghost is come he will identify accepting you with a scripture and that is the true sign that the Holy Spirit is in you because it is the word me you don't have to prove nothing you let God prove it you stay with a word you have a brother Dale caller I'm sorry Lulu you've been work work work work we're not alone were you me we ain't got nothing but the work so we got work soon hi networks read at least we got something forgot to follow right where are you at 56 and salmon all over the land you know and let's don't get into the deep we still get into these time we might get confused now you know get in finish you born confuse your already confused let's tell you with the simple things now have another because we'll we'll work our way away from okay after 47 years of studying one man you were to know a little bit of that much profits I've talked about somebody went down bad and they said well I don't know where he said it I said hold on when I get my computer running come on computer my brain telling me and if my computer my brain is not right you tell me if you won't wait long enough for me to run up the computer to either that exact page number you just come and show me you know how was that my computer in my brain is working and I wouldn't afraid why for 40 years of steady tone I mean I have to 40 years lower what you gonna want food [Music] my niece he'd always get up everyone and she put her shoes on Mike Megan tell me to every woman you know and she was 30 years oh he's automatic he is he's mended 20 and always flirts you don't George me you like me but now this seriously seriously as we can be about it we're not down here in the end time to just play around we're right here to how a revelation of Jesus cried to were that we can stand the times the troubles and the problems and I know a lot of people you know and some of you listening out there on the internet and funny would differ but I've never preached that we going through tribulation no but I preached thought I believe what the prophets did the Bible said tribulation worketh patience they went through a pre tribulation and that's what he calls it pre tribulation two relations wrath of God the right of crisis not that but we've got a persecution ahead of us and I hope and pray that I'm wrong about the statements that even awesomer say we would be physically bereft people say that's only for the foolish virgins well okay then he says it right now so that's that's when you and them but I'm not I've never been adduced a preacher I've never been that I've been one up to the basis that if they come in here today to close the doors then we know for sure they're after right I mean that is one sign if they come in and try to close does that mean we bet we start up enough to your offices for something to happen all right so then we'll follow whatever God says and then read said we're not going through on the fire of a leaves fail to see usually known yoga life inside I'm not counting on giving my life for the gospel because that's what God wants then let God take care of what it is I've never been that Doomsday form but I believe what he's saying and the point of it is is what's going to happen he found if you're right then I'm going to glory that we didn't have to go through it all right I'm gonna lure II did we didn't have no persecution all right but if I'm right and believe that the Prophet said we do have some persecution to go through it your tongues don't be stuck to the Ruth you mouth when things start happening and you wind up in jail for what you preach I see are you gonna change them are you gonna say well how much the always coming even if I missed it because it you're saying that the foolish virgins on one going through that so if you're saying the foolish murder no one going through it and then you start going awry start going through it then we will be fully perfect is it sexual right see that's why I get into trouble I make every bank money you think we don't want to talk with me about that - my client will not be fine I mean why why not be you know and that's why we tell the devil when I pray for somebody if you don't show us how they didn't you nice I just wish the demons hanging around on the boy because if they didn't need it we still got it but if they did need it you it bro I talked to him you don't have talked to Bill no I never talked to them well maybe that's cuz you're too much happening you know you don't call fury no no we do naturally but you know what say if we are of the devil then we wouldn't talk to the devil because we are the devil we're talking to the devil at least it means he ain't got me yeah I like what the man said you know when he's going down the road and this man go inside a road they taught it it's the hey jokes it like you that depend of them did I'm over here he said ain't God yes don't you understand I'm telling I'm the devil over here he said I didn't know you're that far away from me so unless computers to their art let's get into the thought for the day because it is titled if we title the last when the birth of the work we're just time of this to finish up as the true evidence the true evidence of whether you're born again or not see can we be corrected if we can't be corrected they might talk about an evidence you can't receive correction and the Bible says were bastard that's made you it's not always told everybody tell me show me where I'm off to work there are lives we have problems with human for everybody in a different body in a different way of doing things review life you know but now in the word coming showing we're off to work so the true evidence is one who can receive the word keep on receiving the word never stop receiving the word and believe that word he never said you'd speak in tongue dream thing like that said when the Holy Ghost would come he would do that and even show you things the comment that's what we read every screw dammit alright so now watch when we get down to that in a minute what Brett around says about it well the point is though well let's read it right man okay number one that's fine let's read what brother round had to say that summer nature chain which is 140 of the church age book it works at all right so look what he says now you can begin to see why tongues is not the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Spirit it doesn't say in any age that he that had the tunnel they didn't say what the Spirit is safe don't say that now watch what he says it saved me that puts tongues interpretation thereof and prophecy so forth aside as an evidence the evidence is hearing what the spirits say the spirit is talking yes the spirit is teaching that exactly what Jesus said he would do when he came in John 14:26 he would teach you all things and bring to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you and that is just what happened that is how the Gospels were written right they don't like the Gospels right Matthew Mark Luke and John and then the Peter in all of the different room the things we call the gosh so look what he say how's he saying the apostle of the the gospel to written not i speaking in tongues not even by prophecy but by what by the spirit talking and telling you see you'll see in a minute maybe in this one but works it and you know it says that the ever church age it says the spirit he they hear what the Spirit has to say all right it's always been that way and watch what he said man and that is what happened that is how the Gospels were written these men had recalled through their by the Holy Ghost the very words that Jesus faith and look at even Peter I mean Oh Luke and what is you Luke and Mark is that right we're not original to something huh and Luke's it I don't want to sit have a perfect understanding he's ready so yeah here watch somebody else say it with the Holy Spirit and equipment if you understood me following me my point that is one of the Gospels are accurate they're perfect but the Spirit did not only bring all things to their minds we taught them further on the truth they already had but I don't see any be taught in federal Putin already had reading that's worse that is how Paul received this revelation Paul never went to the disciples to get it right he went myself right so that's what he saved all right Paul received his revelation he said concerning when I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after men for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it of man but by the revelation of Jesus Christ Galatians one level where he was talked about the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost all right going down now to skip the next paragraph you can read it the Queen put them around 140 or placed 141 come up to the next letter to talk to the right and to every age we hear the same truth even happen here they didn't hear what the Spirit says to the churches never speaking to other thoughts in truth but only a spirit filled man can hear the revelation for that age none of the can no sir they cannot become that is exactly what Paul said in first Corinthians two and six I mean in every age now listen you remember the other day when I was trying to explain that every type of baptism I would go there right now watch it in every age and every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the true believer I say in every age the evidence was the same now that should do away with Tom's interpretations of seeing visions or crying or shouting or anything whose evidence right come on solve it in your own mind look those are that the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and he is messy and poopy in the every age and every age is the age of the Holy Spirit for the believer so everybody concedes the same new birth which is eternal life coming into you that's the new murder no matter what age you see him it's that a never age is not the sign that the ditch it's whether or not the spirit in you with agreed with whoever sees this may not be hidden you too much than what you think about but what about those out there they'd never heard and get an opportunity to hear so they've been caller over life it was this or that or that or the other or whatever and now it's talk just believe the message leaving the message is fine if you have the new murder right but the new birth comes first because you cannot rapidly believe the message if you don't have the new birth right is that sensible that's right because he'll take of mine and show them believe I have scripture that's playing this that's blood but it's they're harmless the next which is page 164 the word always comes to the truth a spirit-filled that is the evidence that he's filled with I'm going to go that is what Jesus said would be the evidence he said and I will pray the father and he will send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever and even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive now we know what truth is my word is truth did you notice that Jesus said that the world could not receive the Holy Ghost well in this verse I just read it neither could they receive the words why because the spirit and the word are one if you have the Holy Spirit as the prophets the word would come to you you would receive it John 14:26 did you appreciate it that's why when Paul received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he stayed with Peter and them for just a little bit brother then he went to himself and when he came back he was preaching the same identical Jesus Christ that Peter James and John and him were pretty and they said as Peter quoted it that Paul he's gone beyond us and understanding that he says things that are hard to be understood though that people were rational with it so that was doing it back now like always told you where Paul was committing one of those or what Philip does my immediate percentage the resurrection fight you know where they got the doctor from sitting and listening to Paul yeah but the guys perverted coach Paul which preaches the resurrection of Jesus Christ into our hearts and lives by the new birth right and they come out and they do the natural well come on in any difference in we the people would appear you know went up the worship to the Millennium one under the bridge to Jefferson worth of millennium well they got it from the prostate but they perverted what he said about it yep unless the next district the truth at all times right right and what see you let's go never the last part of that month is underneath yeah now I want you to know very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues interpreting prophesy shouting are shouting and action he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the Word of God for your age evidence has to do with receiving that word ok yeah let's be plain I wouldn't ask you a question and it's goes out on the internet of those who ask the genuine I mean you continually will allow or where you get a why are you listening to me you're saying when we do that right hey I'm done covered if I could also sing what if you do right so we're not building on what we're building on the word why do you come here why did you leave the other churches to come here I never went out there I after you might have been like sister Trudy was where somebody upset some page okay and I go up to preach with a certain brother and that's how many thing you know but she wanted me to do which say you know warmer me because I had my website warmer and then stood a woman you know but at least that got her call she's set here today been here 27 years why hit here I mean you all a lot closer to a lot of other jerky why don't you go play I mean it must be the call for the word given in now I surely that must have to do something about it work right all right and it thrills me that we've had incidents tonight and half of the word our youth would go to youth camp and people would say we know where you go to church in because of their talking and that's very elementary you very proud were you proud of the youth we had very proudly these are fat and those that are coming up so you'd say well brother Dale y'all were just work work work what why do you know I'm just honest and you know I just want to follow along don't you let's see I don't have time but now this evidence - evidence whether or not the spirit in you agrees from the work right continually green color hat that stops a green you know it's not how its period don't need interpreting that's just plain line with you know you said we're brother they allege the people that left here I've never said the people that let you have to work you may don't get me to say they hear what you say you ain't never heard me say they left to work some of you had said they left to work but I never said they left work because that's everybody's responsibility where he's going what you're doing it's not to try to fail the church just to try to bring about a rat try it event it pretend about it morning we can get out of here all right see then we're here to that point and I've always told you this it comes to a basis that you go somewhere that you find more what we're preaching here let me know then with your song will go comes out I want to be changed don't treat a man all right see there's a reason for us to be in here and evidently something about the word that we believe now if I don't get to it in a minute brother Brennan said in the church Facebook that he not only taught them we covered it back dark you know he taught them further on the revelation all right let me review that just a minute we I've talked you from the beginning we're based on what college did Peter in under shop with what Jesus did right but then it come down that we're based upon what brother Branham said now there were signs that brother Anderson had to be corrected but he had to create yourself right and he took it and it was done that was fine all right but the meat of the message never changed all right and so by doing that then the spirit that is within us is continually agreeing with the word right and walking him the word to come to a place and said would even teach them things to come and then we covered that Pete Paul even that's how he received his message was by the Holy Spirit out on the backside of the desert and no man teaching him but reading the scroll but now he didn't get born again without somebody first telling me you say he got knocked down on the road to Damascus he did but you don't call that your salvation you have to watch now because remember there was a man sent over are told his eyes see the big city you say well just natural well I believe the whole experience somewhere came because of what somebody said about you because that is the numerical earth of the word even though he was a prophet and he could receive the word and grow in the word he still had to hear the word from somebody to get his start okay now then why is the trouble with people the message that they don't see this bread around ever Toby Keith I'm differ but he took us further into the revelation you agree see it the sealed Oakland the things like that to the Prophet that were not preached by the disciples the son of man was never mentioned in any of the writings other than Matthew Mark Luke and John that were recorded but you don't hear Paul Peter and they may even speak another son of man in their writings now come on get what I said I said it is in Matthew Mark Luke and John II thought they were corner alright because they didn't understand it then run around it not the way the seals broke to start talking about the son of man because he had not only the understanding of the son of man he had to vindication that the son of man would be the resurrection because that was where Jesus had it in the resurrection and the things that even the sick the faith would be the son of man well is he any problem with believing that brother brown could take us on into deeper depths of the word it would take us all the way to be a change of the body Paul could prophesy of it who couldn't make it medicine my brother branham prophesied of it then maybe deeper deaths in Paul but he didn't make it many things but you're not gonna make it - somebody has to vindicate this may seem to be true to vindicate this Bible is being true what's the problem we're trying to go into the message then and understand the message well oh we don't want to get it confused mine aren't confused we don't want to get out now only on brother y'all read only most equals already little bits on top right we'll get to it a little bit this afternoon like some of these doctors when they come the doctors what happened 90% of the people that come up with an extra doctor comes up with an extra wife any problem no did I say it like it huh huh let's tell the truth about it what you see what we want to do is make sure that we know what the true evidences aren't Muslim we're guilty number 3 of the motor industry which is message of God 1962 1014 that evening man this 13th verse now watch a lot of this it won't deal with exactly evidence it sincerely was showing you the word comes to the individual right the evidence we've done cover is whether or not they can come to the individual and the only way can come to the individual get for it to be revealed I don't care how much you can say brother Brown said the Bible said no man can call Jesus the Christ except my personal new birth you say you change that no idea and that's what the Bible saying that night without a personal revelation personally to you and getting understand so what is he saying that is 13th verse idea when the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth when the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth when they through the word he shall speak he shall not speak of himself now if you know speaker they say who's he talking about the first God's not speaking of himself he's actually speaking of Jesus he's trying to get you to see who that is alright then secondly he's not Jesus and not speaking to simply speaking of you right let me come on then we can cover a lot of form right your truth you tell me guide you into all truth what is the truth the word for your speak he shall not speak of himself but what did years he'll speak what he hears he would speak in other words he lead the one that will reveal the thing you see and the fourth chapter of Hebrews the Bible said that the Word of God is sharper more then activated sort a discerner of the thoughts of the mind the heart see what he is he will speak and he will show you things to come see what's going to do that the holy spirit who will come in the name of the lord chief he's going to do those things for you and i all right look at the next one future home 1964 head over to the paragraph 195 now that's what we were talking the other day the evidence of the Holy Ghost see the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you can receive the work not some system now that puts everything out right but how they clear understand now I check this to make sure but I knew it was we do these books that you do not have with Christ the mystery of God revealed in the first book it says understanding but when they came back to reprint the crash some history they watch them he said understand where the old one says understanding so evidently when they put it back in whatever they done through the computer system they couldn't understand which is the same word I'm just showing you in case you read your book and you see what they are not understanding brother they get that now I'm just tell me wine that it's dark they change that oh but how they clear understanding I mean how do you know the word is clear understand it once it vindicated set a clear understanding now you bring you what you how many of you want to say the rest of the evening to bring about the the adoptions to word it to brother Brandon we're talking about clear understanding having your mind unmodeled from life and people and walk in through the clear understanding of this message mark the evidence of the Holy Ghost is for you to have a clear understanding I don't offend out of it oh that is revealed to you is clear understanding whether it be water baptism one God to know eternal hell serpent seed etc it is clear understanding when it's revealed to you now man have muddled it all up with his interpretation because go back to what you say have a clear understanding go back to what we've been quoting how can you call Jesus Christ accepted me by the Holy Ghost how can you have a clear understanding this nation is not the holding up then we have a clear understanding this messy if the Holy Ghost don't use somebody to break it down for us you see what I'm talking about once we connect from the power of decision 1955 10 or 11 I like to go way up down because that way people say oh you know we own that home off we will only watch after the seal I like to take you back know maybe 55 you know God say these signs shall follow them that believe lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this is good land Joshua said it's a wonderful land Joshua and Caleb aren't you glad and this is a wonderful land I am a man Josh when Caleb brought back some initial evidence that they'd been over there somewhere now they brought back and everything right that's why people come in here try to preach this all kind of dr. right because they know for certainty they gonna get straight now I had a wonderful brother and I will call his name because they'll be left up to him to what he can do but her brother freaked something wrong here in this church and I was intended to talk to him and try to find you know get with it but I want to talk personal all right he found out through wait we didn't believe what do you say he called me up in the apologize what he said I said brother I think more of you than I ever had no but he didn't never say that he didn't agree with what was laying around earlier but it was the fact that he preached it here that we didn't agreement I think the world living penalty honor he wants to come to York straight then that's fine I don't need him after because we'd already straighten it out don't people who didn't believe it miss joseline Kayla brought back some initial evidence they take that over without some work I'm so glad than not that we got witnesses in the church tonight that's been somewhere and I'm talking the Lulla I'm glad we've got some in this church that's been some work and can tell us about it I love to hear your experience of what God's done with you I spent somewhere that's not something let's come back with the evidence that the Holy Ghost is just assigned tonight as it was the day it fell on pinnacle he said hallelujah as it did when it fell onto that pinnacle this for that matter artists time 1964 12 12 paragraph 158 the jesus said when the spirit of truth is come see he will bring these things that I have talked to your memory the word and he'll also show you studies to come there is the regal spirit filled Church now stave what who want only the things tonight stays with the word reflects the word God on earth see he doesn't need any theologian poses word is of no private interpretation the interprets is onward by vindicating and proving it it's the truth when the Methodist Church told you you couldn't receive the Holy Ghost by they did on the day of Pentecost and when I tell you that I look like they're dealing with a pineco did you pay any attention to it certainly not you went right along and back the Holy Ghost anyhow we will cover this doctrine when we get time to think about what - no no Holy Ghost doctrine and the first church we were in has that doctrine and I told the pastor us that I'm not trying to prove you whether I'm born in or not I'm just trying to show you brother Brown was right brother Brad said he met people to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost 50 years before him he said exactly like that in a comment well you know I told you about two brothers which that was one of them and another brother and then said in arguing with each other said they couldn't understand why we're around both no city couldn't understand why brother Branham said that statement well one of them believed that you didn't get nothing out of it and you just got converted the other one believed that when he got it the new birth you got to hit stuff I said there's somewhere in between you can guys they got to be a truth right cuz there's too much gap listen would you mind if I slain I explained that Pentecost the split experienced over 120 in the upper room two or three and I hear the other one coming by a certain one mansion and they like me it's gone I saw okay you worry about it the least I've been between them somewhere so you know what people are you just an intellectual because you can explain well if I'm an intellectual called I explain brother Brennan what are you making brother rounded explained it to start with all right what do you make it is he just an intellectual I'm gonna use profit yeah okay we're we're if we think it's net from the harvester I still got one more on my graph type of progress 158 we jump over perfect 177 and we'll try to quit okay what's now and we hurry up true when the spirit of truth is come he will teach you all things whatever I taught you oh my bearing all remembrance to you what I stayed to you bringing to you all remembrance he will show you things to come he will vindicate every word confirming the word with signs following everything that he promised that God promised in the Bible if you'll turn loose from ever Creed and everything else and hold on to the word God is obligated to take care of his word so when they did this the word indicates this thing I know that to be the truth because I've experienced it I preached to seal here in 1981 and 82 82 83 I had preached them in 79 didn't feel right I come on in there when I preached it I asked garnish the dog will you do something to show me I'm not gonna mention it nobody this is on record true you don't happen not gonna mention this to nobody at the end of the series when we get through that when I asked him and he got healed in the series not by us having to pray far but by the Lord just to live and we had a wonderful raise of hands to see people that were delivered but I believe the word will deliver I believe healing is in order I believe salvation that is the word is in it when it's not available so when it's revealed to us then it'll be good so what is the true have an inch the true evidence is whether or not spirit in you continually will agree with that word and let God vindicate it out that's right well we just don't see much vindication you realize you sitting here today is a vindication you want me to keep on preaching what I started while ago see everybody thinks that exalts main announcer you need to continue on that point why are you here you know to me that's an evidence other churches are ending up doing things splits and all combine and we're just growing and wondering where we're going what we don't do when the few people feeling up because they keep coming in man but could it be the fact that I stood here years ago and I said they'll come a time my wife didn't indicated even though the tapes Mac Mary got I said there'll be a time when those that went away will come back and I had personally brother dong kyun on my man and he went away but did he came back could I go tell him no no you gotta come back only so it would be Radley run out till whoops weirdness glad tell the people are you coming October Robert Carlin come on it's night nice time I talked to it that's it oh boy you done been claimed you might as well pack it up and come on oh he got so mad at me you were talking buddy don't you about how that he's so mad at us appear ain't gonna do it I still believe you'll be here but I'd ride down the road seen him iron enforcer just go back till he got come on told Joyce Danny would be here till June laughs then waited they hear it beep recently why can't we believe God has indicated his word how long can we stay in the trunk of her personal experience of what has happened being only the opening of the word what about what is the true evidence shouting you think about it now will shouting the thing like that holds you when the guns at you now would shouting then I'm not against it I believe in it I've even told you about smelling the presence of God when he'd be so close to it and I literally smelling most wonderful odor you've ever smelled in your life I had to speak to me personally singing see my angel reformed in my house three times I don't have to back up for nobody those are the truth they don't take for 40 years but listen if we don't continue on with the word we're going by the crisis brother now used to we'd get together Nate we'd hear about somebody preaching and everybody saying he's off the word he's off the mansion you like some guy we like to listen to go come find out 90% of town they were more on the word than one tendinous that's true we go find out every morning to work what's the art truth will take those out of here in ten mark truth will reserve us a place in glory for eternity in the Bride of Christ the part truth will not take a chain somebody's going to walk off this earth at least let me not get in the way plenty encourage you to seek God brother Dale you start seeking God and I'm not the ones that tell you to open up your mind to be blind man I don't say that that's what you do you don't mind a big blank and their spirits don't come in and yell okay it's gonna get you know you keep your mind on God pray for him to reveal the word to you cuz I retrieve evidence whether or not that spirit keeps on agreed and there's in those seals in 92 and 83 and so I've never chose to read preach verbally all of them back over but before I started it I like the quote the brother Rhetta says you can't understand the seals if you don't understand that you've seventy weeks but everybody says they understand 1971 but why can't you preach to see are they preach the seals and don't understand that you're 70 now they would what do you say so we had to go step by step and it still stands today what I said in 1974 and Daniel seventy weeks even to the basis that we could pass the year 20 2026 and it wouldn't change me I said they're not he said before where I say today we could go to the year we could go to the year 5000 and it wouldn't break by transmissions why because we enter determining teeth seven seven is 49 but 250th is eternity could we go be alive that happened right right but you know if that's what God saw that's what's gonna take place so if I go down don't write on my tombstone he died not believe so he at least prophesied of what would take place could I believe they'll be exchanged in a moment between the other night and that's just kind of one question and I get this is brother Dale you said Sunday one twin out of the cliff you know your 2012 that when our bodies are changed the world has got to follow could you please explain that our bodies came out of this earth when Jesus dropped his blood on this earth he cleansed and claimed this earth one day this earth will be made eternal honey then my body was laying in that her so my body's already been clean sand client and the show he was right he gave me the baptism and hold it up they put it in my soul to show me that I find he gave me the new birth see then that claims the rest of it toward I'm just waiting for a change when he won't consent to see our bodies were in this world and when Jesus claimed that but see we step ahead that's the key that's always been seemingly that people couldn't follow we step ahead of the world right we were to gain their soul here the world is renamed later right go through the clean sand claim back there I just got to follow if your body was in that earth you're not gonna give in your body but I've always tried to show you that you don't get a new body you gotta get off Mars or flipped over it's a clutter and come find that at all comes with one mass the weight of this body you want to be the new one who is this body regained have another brand America ho no future homes it talking about Jesus and said from this part of the earth I have regained his body and I will retain the rest I thought his body was part of the earth cassette till then I see and I see that that within us is the new birth how can he throw this away so one day he's going to change it and make it eternal why because it's already been clean some claim man you birth came in you see we won't quote the scriptures and we say when it says please that the whale call my Jesus would you know when he gave you the new birth these pleased to dwell in ya pleased to dwell in you relents it please the honor your word we're not looking for a new body is this body redeemed of the earth is reading about it's just waiting it's just waiting one of the matter if it's a meeting years from that would make a difference everybody got eight times in season nine ten they have time and I was not one day learn this woman I said those things and nothing said before I wouldn't want this thing to happen the way that he is to come up here to 2012 no I wouldn't want it I sure want it come on up quicker and I was believing it we come quicker but I would just show it it could be done well you don't want a God on his way to do away with all cops and shadows right and I'm glad that although we went to this the seventy three and a half maybe four and a half seventy sevens the eighties the 88 mm and not even think he's a Bible said it in the third day he would cut it play the dirt thousand you know what we're in the third passenger okay we started in that when he went up five to two thousand so then we will be sitting in the word waiting I'm going to make it Madison we don't need to vindicate or we got about ten minutes if I got quick call me it felt whatever what do you think the new Berkeley not sure able that I would never in any way discourage you from thinking that you're born again but I must quote the other side it would be the greatest thing in the world that could happen to you or me just to find out that we're not truly born again you know one told me to do something back so on one side it would be a same thing but on the other side of I wouldn't back up from trying to punch recruit for us to see the truth kind of true sophistical nobody knows it what's this seen in worship a moment now we I don't know why I said is what I going on but I think I'd be in the Bible study last night was on tithing and if any of you want a copy of what we talked about brother Joe in them I believe can take it down off with the thing and all the word that if you want that then you can do it you know we you know have some understanding we also have a good many quotes back turning them up a briefcase the way it's got a bunch if you want to be playful tree just running tithing in your in your Bible and you think timing is how to say this letter you think it's better paying 10% you know there's in the Old Testament I've got it out of the concordance with the scriptures to back it up in the Old Testament tithing amounted to twenty three point at one-third never sinned cuz they had tied on time and they took up ties for doing this and they took up ties and fed the widows north you said honey well Bible place and that in fact they would we say 10 percent brother brown flip any true Christian will pay path which then he said and we gave the quotes he said brother Bradley can a person go to heaven don't pay time he said I don't know but I'll tell you in his commandment then we talked about whether or not if you pay off the grocer you pay off the the you know the whole top the end or you pay after taxes well I just made one simple point that would say well I just pay after taxes okay and then you go down and you get the company you're working and you put down zero dependents where they'll take out a bunch of you is called taxes and you think you did not fail math with the end of the year when you file your income tax you put where would Bob be just as an example he put zero loan and then many listening one could reach the exit of six and you come up and you write a big over six on that income tax paper you don't get a lot of money back are you gonna take out a loan that we just talked are you gonna play tight on that and then we went through the one field you know and I know a man in this message this statement was made by somebody it has to be true about it but this man is back to it and went in the church been gone for good many years he come back told pastor that he wanted to start coming back to church he said you got to catch up on mobile that guy before you can be counted a member of our group Brown says these fellers taking the paw prints and things fleecing the people he said that same old Catholic pain the charge nobody misses a nice ice the play pace the play he said same spirit they Catholic Church said that's why I don't preach you um cotton only done it one time that was a day boy was telling this daddy that no way right here said what about money and his daddy came one day and I preached on comments but I preached on piling of your time in your toilet your life restraint together you might have to meet with us number 17 [Music] but yeah
