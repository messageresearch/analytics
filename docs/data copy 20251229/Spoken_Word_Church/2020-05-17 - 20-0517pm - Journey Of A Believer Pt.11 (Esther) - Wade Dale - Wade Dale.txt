and all your brothers and all your children for this helping with the social distancing and some of you having to sit downstairs it's not very comfortable sister Monica in them and sister Rachel in them have decided to taste or sitting downstairs today to allow some of the others to come up here in the sanctuary which is great I was gonna suggest that but I don't have to you're doing it on your own so god bless you for doing that if you see an older couple or an O or somebody that needs to sit up here go down there and trade with them it's like brother Armstead he's you know he said you sisters and honey and I don't mind if L switch back and forth cuz they were standing against the walls you know and he said this I'm gonna hurt a thing for you to swap places back and forth cuz you're doing it in honor of the Lord you're not doing it cause confusion alright also now remember July the 4th is on a Saturday July the 4th and the 5th that weekend July the 4th brother Andrew Glover will be with us and we'll be doing a youth service at that one that weekend we'll give you more details later in the month of July but that would be the 4th and the 5th of July and today for those of you that know we had a sister decided to die so we're gonna have a funeral today and this is a joyous time she's decided to die while she's still alive where we gonna put her in the icy grave today and she's gonna raise a newness of life but sister nyla has decided to be baptized and you know what the water will be there if anyone else would like to be it'd be a real good time for you to die so god bless you good to be in the house of the Lord first Corinthians we'll be making these announcements a little bit more as we go through so journey of a believer this is part 10 or 11 I can't keep up with it but we'll be talking a little bit about Esther but we're gonna go back through and read a little bit more about Abraham and Ruth I hope you understand it even you know you listen to what brother Dale has been speaking on we we we are called as the as Lewis was saying we're called into adoption that's our call our call is not to stay over there with Ruben and GAD and half tribe of Manasses all right we'll talk about that a little more to clarify that a little more today but our promise is is the placing in the land across Jordan that's our placing now they were in the part of the promised land that they were to get Luther had the baptism the Holy Ghost Wesley had the baptism Holy Ghost Pentecost had the baptism the Holy Ghost but they didn't go further into the word as we'll see now also in Esther that there was a lady named bash died and back style was his wife but she didn't want to go no further with it so he divorced her and married another girl so we thank God for these types and shadows and I hope you're really getting something out of some of these types and shadows that were I don't Bible is good to just read but it needs to be read with understanding it needs to be read with spiritual eyes like the Bible says in Revelations that God gives us I south to put on our eyes every Sunday and every Wednesday every time you press play every time you're talking about the Lord there's some eye south going on your eyes so that you can that you can see better so let's bow our heads you Heavenly Father thank you for this day thank you for protecting us Lord you you love us if you love us you told us you'd take care of us and I pray Lord that our honor and praise and it would all be back towards you Lord if it wasn't for you at Calvary we would never be here Lord and we thank you that you've sent a messenger in the end time to to bring these little nuggets out of the scripture that that was in your mind the whole time but man had got it so scrupled up until it took a prophet to come Lord with a mind of God and to tell us what this love letter means every time we open it up Lord it's written not to Esther not to Mordecai not to the different ones even Abraham and Isaac it's written to your bride it's written specifically for us in the end time who the end the world's come upon for us to be able to glean these things out Lord and to take a body change as becoming the Word of God father just bless us now and be with us heal the sick Lord we do have sick among us we pray that you touch them Lord keep their sickness away and as we say again Lord we pray that you just stayed this thing father that we'd get back to some kind of normalcy and Lord that you'll you'll they'll allow us to come back into the service to where we can have full services in the front Lord and be able to worship you father we pray this you just bind the enemy bless our pastor father be with the Deacons the elders all the different ones Lord that has anything to do with the church that we're we're trying to uphold Lord here today all the rules and the regulations we pray that you we would have patience Lord maybe that's what we need we need patience so we sent you sent this thing among us to see and to trust as you always said but Lord you said we would come out as pure gold because we're your children father just asked you to bless us and the further the service you be the active speaker Lord and may we be the participants in Jesus name we pray amen first Corinthians 10 that talks about I'm not gonna read all that but you me you look and you see that this the whole book of Corinthians is the book of Corrections or what's he doing he's telling he's telling the Corinthians that hey Moses was a messenger and Moses was given a group of people and had all kind of signs and wonders going on in their camp I mean they just God just babied them but watch what it says in verse 5 but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness what they didn't do what they were supposed to now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted need to be idolaters and all these different things let's read verse 11 though here's the whole summation now all these things happened unto them for example and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word like I said again thank you all for coming your ones downstairs for having patience and we're just going to move right along and let's see what the Lord has for us I I some I think it was my lovely wife back there was know why I was singing and saying Amen so loud the other day sitting in the back I'm just glad to be a church see y'all I think another day I read in Kings therefore David the Ark of the Covenant had been gone for months over in another place and here comes the ark back there pulling it there pulling it into ended Bethlehem into Jerusalem and David gets out that he gets so happy till his poor old wife rebukes him and he says I don't care and that basically what are you saying I don't care if the whole world sees me the Word of God is back where it's supposed to be so I say now the word of god is back where it's supposed to be so we should be happy there's not been a lot of amens I mean female amens in the sanctuary for a little while so now we can get all the good amens from the from the brothers and the sisters so we missed you and good to have you back and good that we can that we can fellowship hey listen we have no fellowship anywhere else do you have fellowship anywhere else I mean your regular family yeah you do every once in a while but you don't talk about God if they're not Christian but when you get among this family here then we can talk about the Word of God what God's done in our life and all the things that we've that we've saw that week before that we've read and and like brother Ryan said the other days and man thanks for all those nuggets well you know what somebody like brother Ryan though we'll go back and study them for months at a time and just keep and it just keeps unfolding that's what it should be for everybody that we take these little nuggets listen when God gives you a nugget remember it's eternal God can't give you any things not eternal in his word when he gives you a revelation that revelation is eternal then we'll never go away from you actually you build your character on that revelation you build your Christian journey on that revelation that God gives you maybe just one word maybe just one sentence maybe a whole message like we've been talking about in the Book of Ruth all the little nuggets and we see that we know one thing's for sure Ruth didn't walk through life going well now 6,000 years from now there's gonna be a group of people that they're gonna mimic my life and they're gonna use my life as a subject know she lived her life she lived her life as Ruth that's who she was samo with Esther Esther lived her life as Esther okay she didn't she didn't have the knowledge that she was not gonna be forgotten several thousand years later when we're sitting here reading about her today same way with Abraham I don't believe Abraham got up and said now in 2020 they're gonna still be talking about me he had no clue but God did tell him he said can i withhold anything from Abraham and his children can I withhold anything from no well if we're the children of Abraham by faith they God can't withhold anything from me and you he's gonna reveal itself to somebody you just gotta decide whether it's you or not mm and today we should decide that it's us we're the ones that he's going to reveal it to we're the ones that he has brought to this purpose and his brother Joe and I were talking about angels a few minutes ago and I've been studying a little bit on it myself and he brought some point see brother Branham had an angel I don't know why I'm going here but I'm gonna take this for a minute brother Brian had an angel remember that angel stepped out and appeared to him middle-eastern man said he was kind of big built by six foot tall said he stood there with his arms crossed and brother Brown was like who are you and he said look I am an angel set from the presence of the Lord to tell you these things now listen the difference in brother Branham and I says is he could he could step over into that dimension being a prophet but folks I'm gonna promise you one thing there's an angel just like that that walks with you every day of your life that stands over your bed at night and watches you sleep and make sure that when you get up and go to work that the traffic even though we may have to stop in it the traffic is not gonna bother you are you going to go to a place and you're gonna you're gonna try to go in this direction and what happens something happens and you have to go in another direction or you're five minutes late or five minutes early I'll never forget that that time that we were coming back from a fellowship meeting and we come through Dawsonville there and coming out of Dawsonville there's a crossroad and there's no there's no traffic light but they stopped on this way because we were on the major highway on 53 I guess it was and I was in the front and the van and Daddy was in the back in the van and they was probably probably between hearing the door distance between us as we're traveling down well make a long story short I go through that intersection at about 55 miles an hour and I see this light go through my rearview mirror and then they're caught then I call it going that way that had never stopped through that stop sign and if we would have been one second one way or the other brother Dale would have got side right in the driver's side or I would have got right in the driver's side the guy saw him hit his brakes when he realized what he'd done but brother Gary he went right between us and we're running fifty-five he's probably running forty or so you see what I mean one second 1001 and I would have been here or 1001 later and daddy would have been here you know what guardian angel he's over there going hey hold on man I'm gonna get it in between these two I'm gonna make it a miracle so they'll see what I'm doing I just if you don't believe that then that's okay but I believe we all brother Brown said we had angels all believers have angels so they're right there with us the whole time we just can't physically see them and you know sometimes you see a flash the lighter you see something that maybe them brother Collins passed away you know this last Monday and he was a rather large man and being a rather large man they said he had a heart attack and as soon as he had that heart attack he died on his feet they said he was dead before he hit the ground but the paramedics told sister Barbara his wife she was telling relaying it does that there's no way that big of a man died on his feet and didn't have bruising or scars on his body because of the way you would have fell because he was in the yard he was out in rocks Jim that rock that place is not like a real soft place it's dirt everywhere rocks everywhere stomps everywhere right but he laid down just like this right here turned his head sideways and that's where he died I said sister Barbara there's no I have no problem with that I said soon as he centers that happened I said his guardian angel reached and grabbed his head and just laid him down and then brother Joe told me he said you know that happened in the Bible member Stephen they stoned Stephen and he went to sleep in the arm to the angel hey man what a mighty God we serve hey give me my hands left-right we're not alone in this thing that's my we're not alone in this thing this journey that we're in is an anointed journey it is a journey that you are going to have to take because you're a child of God that's why with this journey of a believer I'm trying to take look in the Old Testament and you see these people in their journey where they don't realize everything that's going on but you and I realize everything that's going on when we see something in our life we go well that was because of and that was because of you know put whatever in it for your for your are you are you think of what brother Branham said have you ever had something happen in your life and you think of a quote or think of something that that happened in brother Browns life or you say well that happened to Esther or that happened to Ruth or that happened to whoever see you and I look at the knowledge that we have you look at that eagle anointing that's why this that's not just it's not just the line ox in the man you got to have that eagle anointing you got to be able to see higher it's the further we're not better people than those people were we're still sinners saved by grace but God has been gracious enough brother Ray to send us a message that explains what's going on and this whole world is falling apart people are scared to death and they keep wanting to hear the news and they keep wanting to read the paper and they keep want to see what the political realm is and see what this is listen you and I you and I we know the end of the whole story and we don't just know it by the Bible we had God sent a prophet that gave us clarity that he could see and he said watch Russia when she comes down after that oil watch the Vatican don't worry about communism he said you worry about Romanism he said it would be that purple curtain that you need to worry about not communist I'm not Russian who's gonna take over what we know what's gonna happen we know who's going to bail us out look there was another three trillion dollars and giving us another $1,200 stimulus package where's that money coming from they've had a secret meeting somewhere and the post is okay hang on I'll give you the money but remember the devil I'll give you the money but God has no stipulations when he gives you something he's a free giver but the devil always want something in return always want something so you just live your life folks go to work pray read your Bible pray for your pastor pray for the Deacons pray for each other and just go about your business wash your hands wear a mask if you want to that's okay with me I don't I don't but don't look at me because I don't okay don't look at me because I don't cuz really the only way your time you're supposed to wear a mask Benjamin is when you're sick if you're sick and listen if your snake don't come to church we've always said do come to church but this is a little bit different a little bit different time here I'll tell you what though I'll guarantee if you want me to come to your house and pray for you we'll be right there I won't have gloves on our masks either if you get scared what's fear fear hath torment this is tormenting the world that doesn't know what's next what tomorrow's news is but you and I know what tomorrow's news is we know how this thing's gonna wind down but Colonel I get you being up here in the front step here okay this were brother Colley says you're just a young brother Colley y'all pray for brother Colley pray for all the ones in brother Colley wanted to come to church day tomorrow brother Colley wanted to come to church he said I wanted to come but let's just let's just play this thing come you say well are you scared no I'm not scared he's what he's better from what from what is the affliction that he was that he was dealing with he's he's doing a lot better some Gardella healer cocktail the healer there's no man gonna heal us there's no virus gonna kill us and a preacher asked me yesterday we were taking up we were taking if we don't get to this that's okay we were taking a there's a lady that worked with you and her father-in-law was a preacher named Grady Sexton you remember Grady section well anyway he was there and we were taking the bees it was in it really easy it was in a recliner on their back porch so the Beast found that's a good place to be so we opened it up so he asked me he when I told him who you were he said did God bring this plague or this virus I said no and he just kind of looked at medicine no I said God can't create something like that I said no God can create a cure he already has the cure I said but he allowed it to happen and when I said that he didn't in June he just kind of went that's right I said he allowed it to happen because look brother I said God allows a lot of things to happen but he don't make them happen he allowed this to happen to show who's got it and who don't the show whose weak and who's strong listen you said while I'm weak okay you found a place Abraham found a place he was weak but then in other places he was strong you need to find your strength and then work on your weaknesses because remember like I said before only during hard times do people really rise up the cream really comes to the top the the the when the going gets tough the tough get going you understand what I'm saying so we've come to this hour that we need to this is kind of pencil sharpening time this is the time when we need to really look and see do we really got what we think we got right as we were talking about do you really know that you know that you know that you can walk into fiery furnace that you can walk right in the three Hebrew children did it with no baptism of the Holy Ghost they just believed that they said look either God's gonna take us to the house or he's gonna make a miracle out of this one of the two and he made a miracle that stood for centuries so we thank God for that let's look again at the journey of Abraham I want us to see that listen we're not here go ahead pull that up we're not here just and I want to say this and listen what I'm saying not just to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that that would that was your dark ages that was your when the corn of wheat had to fall in the ground and his brother Dale was talking about and I want to I want to make another point to help you with that you know when I walk out and look in the garden I see the two shoots coming up now that's not corn but every life all the life that's gonna make that corn is in them two shoes you cut them two shoots down you killed the plant so they're just as important as the cordon it's just this what it's the phase that's gotta go through its another phase it's got to go through its the husk it's got to go through you know we're farmers or even you just look outside and see plants ending in the ground you see there's nothing you know all of a sudden a little bud pops up then all of a sudden two shoots pop up every life that's gonna make anything on that tree or bush or rosebush or what is in them to shoot so that life was in Luther that life was in Wesley that life within Pentecost it was just the stages that it had to go through so you and I have come through those stages but we got to come to that fourth stage of placing our adoption because as we were talking about this morning in the son school class when you come to revelations 3:14 and he said it and the Bible tells us the beginning of the creation of God that was never required in any other age now what was the beginning of the creation God it was virgin born son of God the Son of man born 2,000 years ago the barn the way it was supposed to been born so now why is the same thing wise to say the beginning of creation of God in revelation 3:14 for the loudest and church age darkest hour but here we are to produce Jesus Christ again and then in that fourth stage that okay maturity the only way we can take this what's going on outside is being mature all right journey of Abraham remember went through justification sanctification we showed him going through the Holy Ghost the new birth placing or adoption then we saw the journey of Ruth what happened to Ruth Ruth come up to a place and she had to decide whether to go with Naomi which was the type of the old church the Jewish Church are to go back to her with her denominational sister orphan go back into the world or go back into her denomination all right well we're gonna see that's happened the same thing with Esther almost that we see there was something come on the scene there was another woman because remember a woman always types a church always brother branham said always in the Bible you can type a church with the women in the in the Bible or even he says go look outside he said they're typing what they are now blind wretched and miserable naked and don't know it go to Walmart you'll see blind rich admissible naked and don't know it or they wouldn't go outside they don't sell mirrors anymore I don't think it's not required that you look in them before you leave but that's just the way the world is that's the world but you and I watch how you and I walk through the same Walmart and everybody looks at us like we're crazy y'all sisters they looked at you look at you like you're crazy and the man you ain't got short shorts on and tattoos up one leg and you don't have you you know you tank top on with you girlfriend's name on the top on the shoulder that you don't even like anymore I love my mama but that's the way the world is look how blind that is though they think that's perfect they all gather together and that's all would you get your tattoo and we all get together and say man where'd you get that revelation from you see the difference birds of a feather and we're all white now we're all Eagles for those of you didn't go to the funeral that was wonderful because brother Mike brings in a point brother Dale brings on a point and the other brother raising the point and it was all different characteristics of the lamb as bill the tariff said that him just as meek as a lamb and the other than bringing in the Eagle and brother might bringing in his point and at all what it was the life of of Eugene Collins but it was totally fit in all the scripture that you could think about for a lamb and eagle and what brother mind could talk about being a soldier alright so can they say that about us because our journey to me is more important than their journey because we have to come to full maturity that's our that's our call it wasn't their call listen Abraham root Sarah they're all resting and they're all over in another dimension now waiting on us to finish this thing up but we're gonna finish it up by what by watching them cuz look this is what we're wanting right here we're ruining our reward our reward is not just by and by I'll die I'll fly away hallelujah all died I'm going know somebody's come and got to come to what a maturing of that capstone and take a body change so that's what you and I that's our commission we have no other commission but that so Ruth deciding she decided to go with with Naomi and think look how strong that was she said I'm a Moabite my god is different from yours but now whatever your God is that's going to be my god Naomi whatever you I'm gonna listen listen because remember the Ruth is a type of us they always a type of the old church what are we doing today we're looking back on the old Jewish heritage of the Old Testament cleaning out what Ruth is supposed to be bringing forth today everybody got that all right so it's Ruth deciding then Ruth serving she goes out feels she starts doing she starts coming to church she starts what she starts gleaning she starts putting up a little food Sundays and Wednesdays nice play whatever else you want to talk Bible study and I hold those things that's what Ruth was doing she wasn't just standing on the corner field said hey bring me some ice over I attitude sometime hey bring it to me no Ruth went out and what she caught the eye of the master she caught the eye of the king of the harvest she caught the eye of Boaz was like who's that girl because remember she wasn't in the lineage of G of the Jewish lineage she had no lineage she hadn't married into the Jewish family the husband died well there she comes up though under the protection of Naomi the old Jewish church and weaves her way through that as the old Jewish church is today I'm talking to you the old Jewish church is weaving us through these types and shadows Feast of Trumpets feasted all these different feast off we know that type Christ but you know what we can look at and see how it's part of us we're now brother Brown said feasting under the Feast of Tabernacles well you're not building booths out in this didn't you see that when you were over there well somebody saw in the when he went to Israel at the Feast of Tabernacles they made booths and then go sit in them outside well that's that's just a type that you and I are the in gathering we're coming into a place but you're bringing your you're bringing your booth with you you're bringing your booth and you're sitting you know you walk outside and you you take your booth to the world because what happens in the Jewish realm is you can walk out into a courtyard of somebody's house and there's all these boots well you know what they're doing all these feast is you when you're looking at them from if I'm looking at Lewis and Christine and they're doing one of the feast I'm seeing what they're doing so when you walk through the world folks that's why your written epistles Feast of Tabernacles feast of firstfruits all these things he's seen you that altar but you know what that all happened because of you he said what do you mean but the whole Bible was written for the bride the whole Bible was written to get us to a place to realize that who we are what we're doing here by what by these different journeys now remember these are not and we're not and never will be microwave journey one minute got Heat no it's a crock-pot so don't low if there was a real low it said on that one right I mean he's been in a long journey we've all been in a journey even if it's 20 years that's a long journey well that's what it is it's what God is just you he's walking us through all these things he's letting us go through but you know what he's doing he's protecting us you need to believe that God is protecting you that you do have a guardian angel it took a prophet to guard to tell you you've got a guardian angel I remember anti telling a story when she flipped her car over because she's running too fast going around the curb that wasn't God that was but God was in there didn't you tell the story it felt like she's in a bubble what was happening that guardian angel had wrapped around her and he was taking the bones if you don't believe that you can't be a Christian I believe that almost got shot in the head with a 36 he wouldn't have been here today your parts of him wouldn't either right here right here that close when that thing went off well you know what the guardian angel daddy was reaching down like this and I don't know if you ever felt it or not but it doesn't matter but that angel just pushed his head back I just booked folks I believe it more now than ever that there's something guiding you and you don't have to be a middle-eastern six foot tall guy with his arms folded walk into a lot in your room don't have to be that but you gotta be leave just like to believe that Abraham believe when he saw Melchizedek what'd he say my lord brother Dennis appreciate he knew the presence of the Lord you and I must realize the presence of the Lord when it comes now there's a lot of times it's my own presence it's a lot of times it's your own presence but there's a lot of times though that God will slide in there or that guardian angel will go hey move over a little bit they'll never tell you wrong now you may do wrong because listen let me get this straight we have more power than the angels that's what I did a Christian has more power than the Angels cuz we're right there with God but they are given to us to lead us and guide us and then we have to make the choice just like we talked about this morning with Cain and Abel Cain her choice everybody's got a choice Ruth had a choice she I didn't decide then she had to go out in that field as she worked from daylight to dark she didn't do you win just a half way Christian right she wasn't a half way Christian she went out there in that hot field and she gleaned and finally Boaz she caught the attention of boys and Boaz they will help if she's gonna be out there let's give her a little more I'm gonna tell you something folks you look at this congregation and you tell me now there's one or two how this thing has affected you economically it has not affected me at all I'm working six days a week are you are you some of you know a few of you maybe but I'm talking about in a whole I'm telling you if you do what God says God is obligated obligated to do what he said doesn't matter you maybe everybody goes through a little rough place but you pay your tithe you go to church you do the little things I'm just saying I can see who's blessed brother Dale's always known who ties players and who's not and all cuz you you know how you see that God hates God has listened brother Brown said take God at what at his word God you said right here and you know what that ain't blaspheming when you can take God back to his word brother Bryan said God loves for you to remind him of what he's already said now Lord you promised me that if I paid my tithes you'd pour out the windows of heaven and I wouldn't be wanting for anything that's just some one little simple thing I've seen people blessed and what need Christians but they paid their ties because they thought that was an obligation they should do well you know what God didn't say if you're Christian or if you're not he just said if you pay your tithe listen God knows your heart if you'll come to church and do the things you're supposed to do God will take care of you he's never seen what is righteous forsaken or his seed begging for bread so this thing is not affected me at all and it's not affected most of you there's a fee and that's okay that's life stuff but look at the end we just keep going and then we'll get to the end and we'll go man I didn't miss know that that I thought I'd miss him amen we're seeing right now stuff that we can do without let me walk down now that we can do without that we didn't need to start with but we thought we needed before all this happening just put it in here whatever I have mine you have yours but Ruth walks through and Ruth proves who she is she gets out in that field as she works and you know what God notices Boaz turns and said who is that and that's a whole that's Naomi's oh that's my kinfoke course naomi was the kinfolk but when he looked at Naomi he looks a little passionnel and he sees a really pretty Gentile girl and sees that she's doing all she can to sustain herself so guess what when Ruth comes to the threshing floor and the lord of the harvest is laying there and she lays at his feet not trying to you understand what I'm saying not trying to make favors with him trying to get on his good side she lays as his feet at his feet as a servant Naomi said this is what you need to do and the prophet of God said Boaz just took the veil of took his bail and laid it over he says just like God takes the veil of the Holy Ghost and he says okay I'll accept you remember same thing with with Abraham now Abram Abram Abram now you're Abraham and he gives him a sign of circumcision because he's what he sees Abraham's faith he sees Abraham's faith that Abraham has faithfully done these things that you and I have faithfully done these things it's not easy to do a lot of things that we do I remember sitting I'm standing yesterday with a couple days ago me and June we're we have two mirrors well we actually look in the mirror but we have two mirrors and Jews over doing her hair and and and she looks at me and she says you've got about three hairs is her you know doing this and I'm making a point got about three hairs like this and I just reached over and got the scissors and we just took them right off and I said honey I'm sorry you can't do that and I was I was making I was sorry that y'all have more of your sisters you know something gets that a place Julie something gets out of place on Gary you just go you know slip it right off bless his heart but but but let's see we can't do that for y'all y'all have to kind of put and that's what I'm talking about the sacrifice that you make as females as the sisters but now remember a female is the type of the bride so the same thing with us we're all female so there's things that we can do and cannot do we can't snip them more wild hairs off we have to deal with them right new but you see what I mean about us everything we do through the life is typing if you can't see God in your life you do get morning in today I want you to go with nyla and go to a grave and lay that old person down and raising newness of life you'll never feel the same again so then what did what did boy I say look Ruth you can't get yourself morning in I wished my kids I could just say I want to mourning him but we pray for him but no boy I said you stay right here I've got to go do something I've got to go do the right of redemption you can't do it because you're not even the lineage Ruth had nothing she could only get she was a hurling connection was Naomi the old Jewish Church that's our connection Christ came to the old Jewish Church she turned him down there for a Gentile bride could come in but now he's not gonna forget Naomi because but because of Naomi because of all this you and I become perfected the Gentile the old Gentile bride we become perfected by looking back at these ones that were in the Old Testament the old Jewish Church but God doesn't forget it because what happens Ruth is rewarded by getting Boaz there's Bowl a standing there saying hey I'll redeem Naomi because remember he redeemed Naomi and got Ruth and then they became intimate and had a baby and through seven Church ages that baby's been growing and we're going to take that baby and we're gonna hand them back over to the old Jewish Church which is Naomi we're gonna hand Jesus Christ right to them and say this is what you missed and they're gonna say where did you get those scars where did you get those scars he said in the house of my friends in the house of in the house of Naomi in the house of Abraham and all these different ones in the Old Testament all the Old Testament you got Azra the blushing prophet is brother Bob was talking about all these different prophets in the Old Testament I think brother Dale preached on it several times a long time ago they all had fathers look at David man after God's own heart he ruled a country that I was reading to read through Kings and Samuel and basically Samuel see that God David didn't just do things now he did slip up one time with Bathsheba but you watch him every time the Philistines would come up he'd go to God he'd go to that urine thumbing or take the epod and he'd go in and say God do I need to go now because remember God said go up you'll take him off then one day he said no David you need to wait a little while see there was something going on same way with me and you we were sharing and saying god I want to do no because you know what he'll do he'll say well that's what you want to do you're not gonna be successful but David if you'll wait a little while then David goes back a couple days later says God are we gonna win this battle he said going up remember the bold berry tree and all those different things he said wait right here well that's the type of me and you and our battles sometimes God you go to God and God will say go on man I'm with you you go out there and you slay that whatever but sometimes he'll say hold on just a minute things are not exactly right and there was David a man after God's own heart and then to do what he did well he didn't have the Holy Ghost to God him he wasn't he was going through but now remember here we go again you look at the story and without Bathsheba this beautiful lady with no clothes on on top of a roof that David desired who came through that Soloman came through that another type of Christ coming down and ruling and reigning so you can't figure it all out you just have to realize I want to make this so simple there is four journeys in your life justification sanctification the baptism Holy Ghost and then going on and furthering the Word of God getting rewarded or placing or adoption look at Abraham he takes his son up on the hill but what does he do there he knows one thing for sure he's getting ready to stab his only child and God says nope I know now you know what he was saying Abraham you should know now that you're bid that you've got it we're not angel come from they stopped him he had to take on some solid form we always think of angels being something that can pass through a wall but he took on some kind of solid form because you reached and grabbed Abraham's hand that's what's going to happen with us sometime we're going to meet we've always said we are what we're the son of man in the end time well you're meeting God in human flesh every time you look at your brothers and look at your sisters and they're really true born-again Christians you're seeing God in human flesh you're seeing the son of man if we're a collective body of the son of man then that's what you're looking at Abraham couldn't do that sure he looked at Melchizedek and he said I don't know who you are but that person that was inside of Melchizedek couldn't come inside Abraham but when you meet him when you meet God and get the baptism of the Holy Ghost then that is God in human flesh and then you can do what then you can meet somebody else and recognize brother Graham says what give me two minutes for somebody I'll tell you where they got the Holy Ghost or not two minutes that's not even a good conference not even a good question conversation two minutes but let's look at the four combat beasts the lion ox man and eagle we know what that is the line was the first three Church ages they are was the middle church age the man was the next to church ages which was Luther and Wesley and the Eagle is obviously our age that we're looking at is everybody okay with that amen so then you had rude we won't go through all the we know that what Ruth was Naomi was the old church orful was the denominational Church roots was the Gentile bride and Boaz type of Christ because we're going to bring some other characters in just a minute and I'm going to just touch a minute on Esther and then we'll close all right so Ruth chapter 2 was serving roofs chapter 3 was resting what Boaz had to go Christ had to go die to do the right of redemption but upon his death he turns around like I said before and he puts his feet on the ground out coming out of the tomb and he says this is mine I have come and I have captured death hell and the grave so at all what it takes me and you to believe that it takes me and then what's then what's God gonna do he's gonna reward us he's gonna reward us not by just giving us the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's gonna reward us by giving us more of that baptism of the Holy Ghost and a deeper walk with God not just a mindless walk with you look at people outside today they have no direction look at them they have no direction zero what are you gonna do I don't know what are you gonna do I don't know what are you gonna do and you know what they do they instead of going to God they go to pills and they go to alcohol and they go to all these different things that they go to and brother Brown said that that's what that satisfies the urge when what they're doing is is they're jumping right over Christ because he's standing there to give you a holy urge or holiness to live by and we're gonna see that in Esther in just a few minutes so everybody got that so far so good we're good so now let's look real quick I want to try to explain this a little bit more from last Wednesday now we look at the the two tribes and the half tribe we may not even get any extra we'll just do this right here any woman's clothes and we'll start on next Sunday but I want to get the characters down on extra so you can be thinking about it but look numbers 34 now let's just Moses now watch this is Moses the prophet of the day everybody got that say man this is Moses the prophet of the day that God has sent and listen God didn't send him to take him over or he would he took him over now Moses didn't know that but God knew he was gonna bring him right up to the border and he was gonna have to go off the scene and then Joshua was gonna take him across but before he left the scene say before brother Brian left the scene watch what he done I mean before Moses left the scene mm-hmm sorry and Moses commanded the children of Israel saying this is the land which you shall inherit by lot no watch which the LORD commanded to given to the nine tribes and a half drop all right for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers and the tribe of the children of GAD according to the house of their fathers have received their inheritance and half of the tribe of manasseh have seve they receive their inheritance hold it right there just for a second so they got their inheritance first but look at me it's not a placing they were given inheritance on this side while the Prophet was still alive it had to take the Holy Ghost I mean sorry Joshua to take them on the cross okay the two tribes in the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward toward the Sun rising it wasn't in a bad place is it the rising of the Sun then Joshua commanded watching then Joshua commanded this is the officer the people say pastor the host this is actually we didn't redo that one brooks/cole don't know that's another scripture that's Joshua one right there hold it right there stop so what did Moses do Moses said look you've come to me and I've given you this side all right let's pull that chart up now remember the chart we had last Sunday they got it right here and I'm like brother I'm like brother Bob these guys got little places not very big look at my NASA but monaster had to carry on half of each tribe over here so if you got justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptism the Holy Ghost had to carry on into here everybody got that you see what I'm coming man they had to carry on into here and then get a bigger portion no we get a bigger portion proper God tells us justification sanctification baptism hole goes Luther Wesley Pentecost and what do Pentecost - Pentecost was the bridge that got us across the river but remember just they had to go across Jordan and fight with the group of people what are you saying brother wait all that message that Moses had he didn't deliver it over here in the Promised Land but Joshua what did God say Joshua as I was with Moses so will I be with you so he had the mind of Moses in the people so when they crossed over half tribe went this all these went over and helped them fight it out what are you saying wait brother wait the Word of God is what's helping us fight the fight the thing out it's not people and it's not swords and shields and guns no it's the Holy Ghost we're going across we're taking justification sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost the Prophet goes off the scene when during the Pentecostal age later on after the end of the age all right guys I got that so now what is this that's where we are at right now because these came back across and took up their position you'll never forget justification you'll never forget sanctification and you'll never forget the baptism of Holy Ghost what got you started because they're standing right here right here it's where Moses is looking across and he said okay you get this but there's more there seems to be open there's trumpets to be open there's Daniel seven new weeks all the great mysteries of God over in here that they didn't get over here they'd be okay with that this is where we are folks we've got justifications that catch the bathroom the Holy Ghost but that justification won't get you anywhere today it just gets you started into the body right there sanctification but you understand what I mean justification under Luther he could still smoke a pipe and drink a beer and talk about God God was pleased with that because he was only commissioned to show the just shall live by faith that was the revelation but that revelation couldn't keep him in over here it was a combination of all these when the Pentecostals come then what happened the prophet of God comes on the scene and through the Holy Ghost now through the Holy Ghost Moses is gone when they cross over in here Moses never went over in this promised land the prophet of God said I must decrease that he can increase who he Joshua Jehovah Savior Josh away Christ is the one that took him across into this promised land they fought it out got their position and then Luther drops right back here Wesley drops back here Pentecost drops back here but when the bride is going to go up this whole all of us this is all is going to be taken up but they weren't given what these people got they were a portion apart prophet of God says a dip of the Holy Ghost you know listen if you get a dip of the Holy Ghost that's good enough for me at the moment I said it's the moment because if you get a dip with the Holy Ghost it's all of God yeah but what happens is is you see that they decided and asked Moses Moses is sure you can stay under your messenger hello you can stay under your messenger but there's more to come under your messenger you're to be the final voice to the final age that's over here that's not over here we've come through Luther Wesley Pentecost now we're in the white eagle age we're in the age of what literally literally this is where we're gonna live when this is all over and done with we know that for a thousand years where's the Oh Jerusalem and Bethlehem all this right in here this is where the new city is gonna push up and make that pyramid mountain but during the Millennium I believe during the Millennium we're gonna live round here they're not gonna build that temple over here in Moab right they're gonna build it right here and that's where we're gonna live for a thousand years why because we fought it out here on this battleground not that battleground on this battleground listen why do you think they love that little you know if that was a world map that wouldn't even be maybe that big why is the world hate that place coach the devil hates that place he knows if he can get us out of that land he's got us but what happens Israel goes back to the promised land and now we're gonna see a little girl named Esther that she's gonna go through a journey to she's gonna be she's gonna be living with a guy that has the kingdom from over here in India all the way into Turkey back that way 147 provinces this God the Medes and Persians they own the whole world but the whole world bowed when Astor asked one question this little bride I'm telling you there's many many sure there's some powerful angel there's Gabriel there's all these different ones but when you get on your knees and ask God for something there's silence in heaven you must know that that you as the bride watch you know what the king has complete power right whatever he says that's the way it goes but if you look down through time there's always a queen and she's right there beside of him and sometimes he might ask her he might say what do you think about doing this because what's gonna happen in this next part that we see is that the King's done made a decree the King made a decree he wrote in this Bible everybody's gonna die get a little head of myself but right man as appointment to die it's appointed unto man to die and then the judgment well we're gonna read in here maybe next Sunday that the king makes a decree and according to the Medes and Persians you can never take it back so you can never take the Word of God out and take the pieces out but there was a provision made in that word and Esther said I know you said what you said but Haman is the one that did this the devil he's tricked you into doing this and he said when I've said I've said what I've written I have written but the little Queen walks up one day and says if I found favor in your side getting my people defend their self and he writes in a decree he says Israel can take up arms and defend itself and that's what saved the natural story that's why they have the the day of Purim or the time of Purim in even in Jerusalem now it's because Esther helps save because Haman was gonna decree was destroy everyone every Jew you see that same devil he was in Haman it just when Dame Hammond died it moved into Hitler when Hitler died has moved into everybody in the country buddy in the world that Devils not dying he's just moving different places but we'll see in here and let's let's look at this everybody understand that that's very important because you see you see other position they got our position we have to go through this journey but we have to cross over and we have to possess the land we have to possess what virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and the capstone which is love that's our possession but Joshua in verse one says remember which Moses rember the words in verse 13 which Moses I servant see remember you're reminded how many quotes his brother Dale read today four or five how many quotes I read one or two you're reminded of what Moses has told us saying the Lord your God has given you rest and have given you this land can you glean that from what you're reading or when you press play that's your inheritance that's your land that's God speaking to you telling you what he's already give you right it wasn't that God came up one day and said well I'm just gonna give you on this side of Jordan Norton's there's a whole time Abraham wherever the sole of your feet goes you're going to get that land and sure they've been driven off by the ice and this eye and that eye and all the other eyes but they had to fight and what happened was they come right in your wive's your little ones your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses give you on this side but you shall pass before your brethren armed listen if you don't have justification sanctification and the baptism of Holy Ghost you are not armed you say well not just the Holy Ghost no you can have the Holy Ghost every day your life and die and go to hell but you can't be truly justified truly sanctified and truly filled with the Holy Ghost and die and go to hell because that's inside the soul man the baptism of the Holy Ghost can be an anointing that comes on you and you can be just as religious as the next person and inside of you the prophet of God said be just as black as said but like I said before if you say all right I know where I went through justification okay I know I went through sanctification I know the unclean spirit I know I'm not doing the things I used to do I know God filled me with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I've went further on with God into the placing in the promised land you can't you can't lose you can't then just have the Holy Ghost on your flesh are on your spirit if you go through truth listen the Bible says those who is justified he is already glorified alright everybody okay let's go through this one thing you know I want you to read if you wish the book of Esther mm-hmm but let's go to Esther and you don't have to do that just pull up one I got right here we're gonna go through the you scroll it up where it says Esther King because what's gonna happen is here's the other here's the players again didn't brother Brown said this relax of a boy mm okay so I wrote King King because the king is a king its King God's the king all right Esther is the top of the bride thanks ties the type of the church Mordecai's the type of the prophet the end time prophet and Haman is the type of the devil so we're gonna see the king of Soros he doesn't just have a little Kingdom he owns a hundred and twenty seven provinces from India to Turkey look at it on your map and he all I did own it but he ruled over every bit of that so he wasn't just a little rinky-dink king that was you know the mayor of guilt for Harlem but you watch what he does and you watch how this whole thing if you read your Bible because extra comes up and just to give you this background then we'll close right here it read even what Scofield says watch what Scofield I'm gonna read it right here real quick the significance of the book of Esther is that it testifies to the secret watch care of Jehovah over disbursed Israel all right now who are we we r type of we're type of it that type of Israel so we're a type of them the name of God does not occur one time but in no other book in the Bible is his providence more conspicuous now watch this if this ain't the time right now a mere rim that returned to Jerusalem if you'll understand this history they were dispersed they were driven out of Israel there was a small group stayed there but this group went way out somewhere where they're at now so watch but now look what's this doesn't it sound a lot loud to see the mass of the nation preferred the ease and lucrative life under Persian rule the mass of the nation preferred the easy and lucrative life under the Persian rule but God did not forsake them what was Laodicea easy rich have need of nothing and not us what he here does for Judah he is surely going to do for all the Covenant people so what's gonna happen is as Israel is in peril and there's this King that can you know there's this King that can back it up he's got an army he's got a hundred and twenty seven provinces and we're gonna look and see next Sunday let's go ahead and stand our feet and we'll bring them you and we'll get ready to go get ready to go have a burial but if you'll watch these you see a lot of 7s and threes and even bash time means beautiful you know how John looked at that church John looked at that church and he thought it was beautiful okay then you look and see that there were seven Chamberlain seven eunuchs that were attached to the king and number seven his name's carcass we're going somewhere with this alright and then bashed I refuses the Kings commandment sets up our own denomination then you've got a seventh messenger there are seven messengers under the king and they all know it none of them say anything except number seven ma'am you can't the only one that says anything he actually says hey King if you don't do something you're gonna have a problem later on so it's just it just continues down and even more to come means little man about five foot five five foot six little man and then you look at Esther whose first name was Hadassah which means Myrtle that was her Jewish name because remember she was hiding her name because they were kind of an outcast but she got a new name hmm she got a new name hey guy was the keeper of the women hey God means the word hold my boy it gets better and better but we'll talk about next Sunday sister Trudy called and said their water main pipe busted and their basement is flooded so we need to pray for them that that they'll get their water fixed and we know how that is the devil just tries his best to show his face but you know what he does this job but you know what God does his job too so we'll we'll pray for but God bless you it's a journey and answer and it's a long fight and it's not Chuck I said you may lose a battle but you're gonna win the war you may lose the battle every once in a while but the war's already won everything has already finished them it's over with and and we need to be more in touch brother I'm talks about spiritual happenings and he said spiritual people watch spiritual things so I think we're all being spiritual people we should watch even the little things like brother when he just died forgot his name thank you mom brother Collins she's only 78 brother Collins that's an inside joke brother Collins and you it's all that tragedy but then when you look and see that the paramedics have to go we don't know what happened I mean they know that his heart stopped they know that but Howard I mean you could see him laying

peaceful look on his face well you know heart and they said that you know that they thought it was a heart attack but they their it was something related to his heart because he has had her heart process but just went to bed not thinking anything and the next morning woke up it was in the presence of the Lord sister car mm sister Carl has told me she said he was playing them tapes and he was
