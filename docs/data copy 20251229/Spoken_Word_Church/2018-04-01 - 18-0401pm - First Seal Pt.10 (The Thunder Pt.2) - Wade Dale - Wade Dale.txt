can't go where worm and and the caterpillar we we know that's the for death bugs but we've been talking about the for life the for life guys so we are kind of meshing all this thing together so good to be in the house of the Lord we got your Bibles let's turn back to the Book of Revelations chapter 6 we'll finish up today this will be thunder part 2 I hope you enjoyed last Sunday that was just an eye-opener to me every time that we that we study the Word of God and it should be should be something to where we can see from Genesis to Revelation and be able to like brother Owen said 1 Selah kind of the entire Bible together and the reason we've seen about this yesterday and some this morning I don't think will be so long on seal 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 but seal one to me if you don't get on the right track it's like brother Lewis is coming out this morning brother Lewis not Lewis brother Lewis this morning about the and I really like that because remember in Daniel those Fork those kingdoms that were built that image that was built in Daniels started with a head of gold down to the feet i Staton right but God always starts at the foundation he starts at two feet gives you a good firm foundation then he builds up because what happens with that stone that stone doesn't roll down and hit the image in the head it hits him right down there where he has no foundation he hits him in that iron and clay which is the two softest metals of the whole thing so but to me that just brings the word back alive you know more and more as as we read this thing that it it brings us to a realization that is thinking about this just a few minutes ago we're the right people in the right place at the right time and man we're the right people at the right place at the right time so now something can happen now they you know it's been in the ages as like brother Dale saying they were and I read a quote where brother BAM said you know Wesley went so far Luther went so far denominated and died Wesley went so far denominating died every time you had somebody come up they denominated and died but this word here that we had cannot be denominated it will not be denominated sure they're making it everything in the book but it will not be denominated into a church like a Baptist or Methodist or anything like that where they say well this is it and then that's the way it is I'm gonna let God say this is it I'm all that God say that this is the right people at the right place at the right time and man it wasn't that way it has never been that way since Jesus was here he didn't have the right people on work at the right time no he didn't he didn't complete his kingdom amen we were the completion of the kingdom he was the head that got lost and then now if the heads come by then he's standing here just like he was by 2,000 years ago amen so let's turn to revelation 6 verse 1 this will be the ending up of the first seal just pray for us next week I'll get a little I get double duty next Sunday so I can get on the second sail pretty quick and hope you enjoyed the first seal I have really enjoyed it myself showing a lot of things that we can look at that that we haven't seen before and I think that's the way it should be amen brother Dale preached this in 1984 so it's not new to him but I'm sure these other things opened up since then till now that have that have helped it to enhance it just a little bit more a man not change the revelation but just to add to because those are adds add to your faith virtue add to your faith knowledge all right so now revelation 6 verse 1 let's bow our heads to Heavenly Father we pray that you'd be with the people today father as an active participant in this service you do the speaking you do the healing you Lord give us understanding because that's what we crave in this hour we crave understanding and revelation more than anything Lord all the things of life are good and okay jobs and money and horses and cows and bees and all the other things are okay but Lord you're the most important thing because without you all that's just going to pass away one day but your word will never pass away and you said you'd be here in your word the Word made flesh again in the end time and so I believe Lord that you're here as much as you were 2,000 years ago even now more in a multiple form because you said greater works will we do when you come back in a bride bless this day father thank you for this Easter time of Resurrection and looking outside and the things are blooming and or maybe we have a resurrection in our heart today that will see you Father and not look at the circumstances that's our problem is circumstances does not look at circumstances don't fear anything little bride because God is on the scene to take care of everything for us father forgive us of our sin bless this day take care of us be with the ones are on the highway there's many of them out today Lord for different things traveling be with them Lord on their way home strength Lord to get back home and and be with us again next week father we asked you just bless us be with the missionaries on the foreign fields people brother royal there with this easter service coming today father that you'd just be with him take care of him be with that church they're building there and at Mount Pinatubo that you'd just bless them father be with those people forgive us of our sins and many mistakes Lord we pray in Jesus name Amen got a report back from that they haven't finished a church we gave them the rest of the money to finish the church and some wasn't able to go we went ahead and sent the money for them to pretty much finish it they're going to dedicate it May the 30th but brother or else sent me I'm email just a few days ago that they're going to baptize I think this is right they're gonna baptize over a hundred people that's already lined up to be baptized they're going to dedicate over a hundred babies they've been busy they go they're going to do several other things and dedicate that building on May the 30th so so you know it and if that if that just one little thing helps then you did it you help those people get a safe place to stay and to have church service in a building so thank God for that so revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see I saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him he went forth conquering and to conquer keep those two words conquering and to conquer because I want to bring something to you in just a few minutes you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word but we're satisfied one thing's for sure like I said before we'll read it in just a little while there brother Branham when he was preaching the greatest sermon of his life he was preaching to people that probably wasn't even born yet for the culmination oh hey sister Jeanne Lord good to see you today good to see you she told me the other day today in the hallway she said you made it man I said no she said you haven't insulted men weeks I said today is not over with you I don't insult you I just pick on you sister and genie and I'm brother Larry we go back a long way they were they were a very I say this from my point of view they were a very wonderful family to be around when we first began the message because they believed the message what no junk when no playing they believed the message and that really was a we had you know went away fellowship wise to other places but but that foundation is always there so complement to you not a condemnation he it was good to be around a family that whole family there that that really helped with the Word of God amen it's good to have that first part of your of your journey same way with anybody growing up in Christianity that's why I tell people when you become a Christian get around Christian you will get around Christians if you become a real Christian because you don't want you know what are you gonna talk about hey how you gonna go back and you know I've been born again now since 1998 how can I go back to those people I run within the world and even have enough you can even have a hey how you doing conversation almost much less them our conversation our mindset would be totally different the man same with you you shake your head you know that's the truth you just can't talk their language well we talk a language that when Jesus walked on earth he spoke a language that nobody had ever understood and really up until today nobody has understood that language but now I believe by the voice of God speaking through a prophet to us that we now really hear the true voice of God the true trumpet the truth Thunder every what you want to call it we hear that in its totality because Martin Luther when when God said to just shall live by faith and said Martin Luther this is your message God was happy for Martin Luther to have that message and then extremely happy because he was the only one he picked in that age to bring that message and put a bride away right amen then another one came up but he will happy with that but now God was happy with that but just like I told you about the the analogy of the beekeeping some of you said they really enjoyed that Ryan sent me a pretty good a little email after church but you know some people are happy just having a couple of beehives um some people just happy being a Christian but you know I've always wanted more I've always wanted there's more of a I believe that that we see the first pull and we see it it was a pull that brought people's attention amen first pull second pull but now that third pull it can't be imitated it has to be the Word of God and it has to be somebody to respond to the pull and then because the first pull in second the people that came under those first pull in second pull they as soon as the Prophet left they went off back into denominations and I'm not saying they weren't Christians they just didn't see the light of what he was bringing but now when he said that third pole would not be imitated and it would not be a public show then it's got to be to a group of people that understand and listen we become a part of that pull a man just for us being on the earth the pull of all Christians should be let's get out of here that's the pull of all Christian not that we're good well we'll be around here in those thirty years uh you know my grandkids probably see Lord coming you better hope that because there's a death in between there somewhere right so let's just pray that God has got the right people on the earth the right message the right people to bring that message and we'll read it today where the prophet of God will tell us exactly what he wanted to see and he called it a thunder we're talking about the thunders but let's kind of go through now and start back at the beginning kind of got off my message a little last Sunday but let's pull up Redemption Redemption Redemption we still got to put that Redemption Redemption Redemption this is the breaking of the seals is not necessarily for your soul your soul is redeemed by the new birth by what Christ did at Calvary two days ago 2,000 years ago resurrected came back in a group of people Peter didn't jump up and say thank God for the first seal there wasn't one right his buddy John was there right John John not John the Baptist John the Revelator was in that hundred and twenty people he didn't jump up and say thank God for the first seal yet he was going to write about it several years later a man but they jumped up and said thank God for Jesus Christ they died at Calvary like brother Dale was saying this morning read that message that Peter Peter said that same Jesus that you crucified he pulled it right out of Matt three thousand he said you put him on a cross in other words he was saying - I put him on the cross he said has now become Lord what Lord he was saying he was Lord him of his life a man has not become Lord Jesus Christ that's why I told him he said repent and be baptized in the name of my Lord amen so what a powerful one message that that Peter brought that day but you know what he knew what he was talking about that's the whole thing he knew what he was talking about that's what you and I must do we might like to talk to people that know what they're talking about there's some people you can talk to for hours and you know know more than you did when you first started and then but now they some people that in 15 minutes can give you a good revelation amen because it's what you know from a revelation not from just your head knowledge but what we're looking at now is since we are born again since we are part of the family of God like brother Dale said this is something different it's something higher it's something even this this is not we're all all Christians start here but all Christians don't end up here the little three beekeeper woman likes to stay right here but you know you state you take the same principle and you get you know fifteen thousand hives out of the same three that she had but what you just what you just like brother Dan said you just cut you keep reading you keep studying you keep put yourself before God and let him take you up through that because look you can climb up that ladder brother I've seen you climb up that ladder and he said if you climb up it he said oh you get up here and he said right reach that's your perfect man you get up so high and if it's not God somebody hits you not shout somebody takes a little temperance that's why don't we always go to temper everybody we always go on our temperance temperance temperance why because we're all humans somebody say something to about your to you you know a little cross and you do get a little upset a man a man you do get a little upset but it's how you control it a man don't cultivate it but these seals to me will bring back full fellowship just like Adam now look if the new birth brings you back into that condition like brother Lewis or brother Dale one read the quote I know Elyse talked about this morning where when you get the new birth you're back into that condition like Adam was before the fall you're a son of God God is residing in your soul and then but what happened to Adam he didn't go on and he cut his fellowship off because of what iniquity that's what we're talking about the first thing we've been talking about is this mystery of iniquity all right now remember the first seal though it tells us when we start this seal and we start bringing it up and you don't have to bring up number one but you can bring up the mystery of iniquity for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way so remember if the eternal Word of God then you say well that was Paul and then in under we didn't we understand the mystery of iniquity is right here because we are still here hey man but now but by Mercy and truth iniquity is purged so by by Mercy and truth iniquity is purged by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil and that's what we're looking at with this first seal we must see as I've said last Sunday we must see that yes there as a thunder but there had to be lightning behind it there had to be a light Jesus Christ when he struck the earth when they put him at Calvary the Bible said it thundered and then when when man I'm gonna move real slow today because Kern's running the running the I told him I was gonna give him a little bob and weave turns back they're going like here but when Jesus Christ is on Calvary what there was a life there that's why hundred it didn't thunder when John and Henry and Jim and Joe was crucified why there was no lightning behind it but Jesus Christ was eternal life coming from an eternal condition to a natural condition and giving his life in a natural condition so that you and I could be saved I don't believe it's quit Thunder I don't believe it's quit I think it's just under just keeps rolling they just keeps root but there has to be a life behind it up I got a quote here I may read it or I make pass over where brother Brown said a lot of thunder but no lightning okay you can get a lot of rumbling you can you throw some dynamite out in the yard and people will swear it's thundering no it's a piece of dynamite it's not the right thing but when you hear that crack up in the sky when you hear that when that white thing pops the ground like that and then you hear the boom boom boom you know something happened so mercy and truth in other words what am I saying I'm saying that whatever has been happening in the ages there's a time now to where every one of these scriptures there was a part that everybody fulfilled right but not you and me know when you come to the headstone now Christ was the head I don't like that word was that's like I once said before brother Branham was a prophet no he wasn't he still is so Jesus was the head no he still is the headstone hey man so being the headstone to the church if he's back now in power where is he hey man he's working through a group of people I'll read that to you in a minute but the mystery of iniquity we know where the seed of Satan is they didn't know it before and like I was thinking about my brother Dale was talking this morning the reason they didn't have a problem the reason they went to the faith of the father so quick listen they had no denomination to deal with they had no they had nobody standing up saying you're wrong you gotta follow me but now that happened later on now they come right after that but on the day of Pentecost when God came down into 120 group of people they weren't they weren't saddled or shackled by false doctrine amen oh sure Caiaphas and himself we got Moses you know we got his quote book trust what to say now yeah we got brother Graham we got this quote they got that quote got this quote they were looking at the quote book in flesh and turned him down that's why this message is not popular if Jesus wasn't popular you and I are not gonna be popular every characteristic little headstone had if he's back I'm asking you that not me if the headstone is back we gotta act the same way he did but like Louise send us what he was tempted in many points right but without saying now what difference does that mean you if you got the same man inside of you right come on now really you got the same man standing on earth they said who can't condemn me of sin you say who are you making yourself nobody God's the one that said I could do God's one that said I'm gonna come down I'm gonna burn that old you out I'm gonna enter in and we are gonna live on this earth we just came the wrong way hey man I saw this wrong we just came the wrong way so when the mystery of iniquity has been made history this lifetime you gonna hear me say this not when they Nick when the mystery of iniquity has made been made history it's when God reveals to you you than you that what I just said it's the truth amen Christ died to give us all this and it's not since not a second person or a third person it comes to you that same Jesus who you crucified I'm gonna tell you today that same Jesus who you crucified God has raised him up and made him why Lord Jesus Christ and the only Jesus Christ they're gonna see is who you so to me the mystery of iniquity it's done away with when you realize who you are that's why they first seal that's why that went in opened to me it's one of the most important seals if he did not open then we know we're in a room now we're in the room of eternity we're not in the room of denomination we're not in the room of Baptist thinking and Methodist preaching in Pentecostal preaching we're in a new room we're in a place called the eighth day we're in a place called the headstone sure the bride never was in a church age but you and I are know they called out people that's going to leave here and another Church age come to develop art to bring anything else then let's tell them this morning Sunday School we got an over coming in the first age he did overcometh in the second age he that overcometh in the third age to number seven do you know there's a oh you better read revelation when the new city comes down amen let's read it it's powerful revelation 21:1 don't pull it up and I saw a new heaven a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth passed away there was no more sea and I joined saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband sorry brother Hal I'm having to read a real fast verse 7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things no limitation that's your age that's because really the only time we're gonna be the whole world in its totality is gonna be in the 8th day is when when the new city comes down hey man hello even even even the millennium is going to be time white drones going to be time until the Battle of Gog and Magog land God doesn't just burn bodies up he kills souls hey man this first burning were fixing the gifts just going to put them in the 5th dimension the next one of Gog and Magog God's gonna reign his own fire and listen the soul that sinneth he said don't you fear the man that can kill your body he said you better fear that guy that can take your soul and do away with it there's only one and that's the Creator the one that created it can take care of it that's why if you are part of the Creator but if you're not he'll take care of that soul cause all them demons are gonna be done away in the gog and magog oh we not gonna have to worry about that in the new city no that's why that a twin right there I wrote in my Bible long time ago I wrote number eight with a star beside it he said verse six it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end I will give unto him that's the thirsty fountain of the water of freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son I see it that's number eight that just slides us right over into turn now listen you and I sprite window better than this we're gonna see ours here I write day comes right here into this dimension Amen because we get a body change here right now others don't have to wait you see what a Christian has got to look forward to I said many times before and even in this first seal the mystery of iniquity shows me that I don't have to go through judgment I'm judged with Christ and if mercy and truth purges and done away with your iniquity and God's only one that can forgive sins amen he's the only one because says I can't remember that no more never to bring you back up again hey man you know what we don't believe that somewhere we think maybe that'll all get see that's the fear part that Satan says I still remember but I was thinking the other day you know sometimes I'm like brother Dale I'm little carnal one day I thought man I thought God standing here in eternity you know he's standing here like this Satan walks up and he goes you see what they're doing I thought this was some kind of message is supposed to bring all these people to some kind of you said something kind of you gonna change their bodies or something Oh God you know doc God don't go Oh Lord boo you aren't ready it's true let me see what I wrote about that he just looked over at Satan said just wait a minute yeah just wait a minute just wait a minute because I got to have the right people in the right place at the right time and when I do you will have nothing to do with it hey man I love that to me that's what the seal show us for redemption the full plan not just to save my soul but to change my body to make my even my spirit realm turn back to where before the fall where my memory is not of me being a sinner we've read it before many times let's read it now we talked about justification burl Ernie was talking about a revelation of true justification now that doesn't mean there was a false justification but the true just like like the Bible says the faithful and true witness not that Jesus was false but it rained true everything he had was the truth but look being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ whom God has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins are passed never to be remembered again we dig them up Satan give us a shovel just hand it back to him cuz remember brother we say and I believe to when Jesus walked through the world there was things went through his mind just like those two hours he listened he lived with Mary Magdalene and all them now Mary Magdalene was a prostitute he probably saw some things you understand what I'm talking about that was running through his mind maybe he saw Mary a few times you understand what I'm saying but he never entered and remember what the prophet of God said he said Satan can't come to him he can't come to you jesus never stepped out in his field hey man he just watch he just said no now you and I we got a problem with that because we don't do that hello everybody we don't do that even in our Christian condition even in our Christian condition what are these for to show us how to handle these things amen now the seals combined with that too because the seals for the redemption of this guy which everybody since the beginning of time knew they were gonna have to die even job though the skin worms destroy this body in my flesh shall see God hey man he had a revelation but he also that revelation man he was gonna say master revelation you and I got a break listen we put everything listen this we put everything on that's dying on all these symptoms I'm getting older I feel worse are this that I don't feel good I don't that's the symptom that's the symptom that we cultivate in our head but now everywhere God said hey hey he didn't say now you gonna get sick and die right tell me in the Bible where Jesus said here you're dead meat you sorry you're a goner now every time he walked up and somebody was dead they got a body change hey man Lazarus definitely got a body change he's stuck his nose was sunk in see we think all this and I think a priest it's a long time ago about the great mystery of the body change my heaven Abraham totally had a body change amen Lazarus totally out-of-body change everybody was raised from the dead everybody change amen so the body change is not something new it just what happens is is this body change by the revelation the opening of the word is going to carry us right into eternity where Lazarus died again Abraham died again each one of them died again but you and I today if you're still breathing and sucking air you got a chance some of us suck it more than others but you got a chance because you know what we do we bring them things up right there that's what I've been thinking all week we but we bring those sins back up and we just want we just collect them back again through what through our memory we reason oh whoa I don't know if that come on now that's our problem because look what the prophet of God tells us invisible Union number two what he tell us he said you're standing completely you never see in the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it how positive you want me to say this a little bit more you were accused of it by the accuser like I said you know God and Satan standing then Satan is going you see what the Diddy's didn't sisson you see that no but now we're down in this dimension going yes I did it but would say forgive me Lord listen let's don't be above where we're not going we're gonna walk a sinless life hello brother Brown said this thing will be sticky until we get changed but he and say we couldn't overcome it he never said we can't overcome it he said it'll be sticky until the change he never said you're gonna be this I said zombie Louise Lisa's in the back you never did it you were accused of it but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God that Genesis 1:26 man way back you know what we say way back brother Brian it ain't God ain't a second older than when he spoke that so it's not back there to him it's present you know what he's going he's standing there though looking at us and he's going do you now believe ain't know what Jesus stood there one day and finally he said do you now believe do you now believe what I'm saying hey man so that's what God's been doing he said hey do you now believe I've already done the work I've already proclaimed I've already proclaimed in the first part of the book Genesis 1:26 before there was ever flesh that spit all over myself before there was anything he said you're standing sinless you can control nature you have complete control over this earth you're standing there washed and your whole book of divorcement is put away and it's dead now see remember you can't marry if you're divorced right but you can marry if your husband's dead so your husband's gotta be dead not divorced me and man you gotta be dead and when it's dead you know what you freedom and I saw brother brand the other day and I'll look it up again because it really it's not exactly this way but he said if your husband dies you're just a virgin to the next man in other words if you're if you do what to Bible what God said in the word if your husband dies you're just as true a virgin to the next man you marry Wow how about that but that's the truth how you going to ever marry again cuz you call them a virgin I'm just telling you that I'm not doing marriage and divorce thing here today okay don't ruin all the but we're out the back of the rim absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God so it's not even in the mind of God so remember he's not thinking about our sins one day he and I love the quote I don't believe it was something somebody maybe been Dwight Moody said God is never going to come to the end and ask you what took you so long to be a Christian now right he knew how long oh he's going to say his enter into the joy of the Lord created to you what before the foundation of the world Amen it gives us confidence to live in this world it gives us confidence the Word of God does nothing else does you can read all these other books if you want to you can't put confidence in them because you know what in about five years some other person is gonna write a book that's gonna be against that book that you said that books right you remember all the things when they told us that eggs we're bad for you eggs bad for you give you cholesterol you know you and then they come out with one time they said well you don't have to refrigerate them now you do have to refrigerate them now eggs are good for you somebody on the egg board must've stuck in some money and said how about telling people eggs are kind of good for you you say what I'm saying but God never done God never say well I'll put that in there and say now that ain't gonna work for you let me take it out put another thing in now what he said is done we just got to go by the plan amen and he didn't have a plan right you know what if God didn't have a plan we couldn't understand him because we're humans we're lambs we need a plan we need a plan we need somebody tell us this is what's gonna happen amen that's just where I am Garside GPS way before GPS came in that's God's positioning system our gods predestinate seat it'll always land where it's supposed to they won't be none of this recalculating in God's in God show no no he don't recalculate that's what they mow tom-toms used to tell us the recalculating then you'd drive about thirty feet past it make a u-turn and go back not God's he is precise his GPS always will work he's always had wireless connection he's never needed a wire to connect to anybody so all that stuff that we're looking at now is is not something new no no God's been Wireless forever he's never had to plug in anything nope amen I'm not gonna charge you for that one one God all right let's get through this and God spake these words saying I am THE LORD thy God now look he thundered from heaven on Mount Sinai thundering lightning come to Mount Sinai remember the whole but man it was just all on fire and everything else what was he doing he was talking to his it was talking to Moses said you'll have no other God before me don't try it but they did amen that was a problem with Israel they said o Moses you go up and get it for us and we'll do whatever you say they lied they lied to begin with they started murmuring the minute he was gone and plural Aaron the prophet of the hour he got a bad revelation he said Moses that thing just popped out of the fire that's what he's saying I'm telling you that guy says and Moses that thing's gonna pop right out of fire and I'm sure Moses was like brother come back here give her a minute I won't take you behind the tent no one told you for just a minute no it made Moses mad and he throwed them plates down and started over again first seal number three they said now here's a white horse and white horses the power of charger man who sat on him was white horse with the Holy Ghost he's talking about now this is their revelation fourth in the early ages conquering that age for the kingdom of God he had to bow in his hand which meant like Cupid he shot the arrows of love into the hearts of the people the love of God and he conquered now that sounds very good but it isn't the truth no sir that isn't why it does mean righteous know we talked about the law of contrasts and put it on the board where there was a white righteous church on earth a man that wrote in those first three ages that's why the the people under day of Pentecost that was a white righteous church God was riding through those people hey man no false doctrine but Satan went in late I think I'll go down to the bar room and see if I can get me a bunch of pro-prosecution and drunks and that will know he said I like this because Satan remember Satan's a spiritual guy we got to remember one thing Satan is the most anointed person beside God amen so when he fills in an Ordnung he just goes I think oh uh move on in here get a little closer but then get look close right right but what exposes him the Word of God right here that horse rider rode all the way to march of 1963 when a prophet came on the scene and God said I've had enough I've had enough of this I'm fixing to bring your truth I'm fixing to bring you wanted to brother up stand there and say this is the greatest of my ministry is right now right why he knew that he was bringing all those doctrines right back to where they should be kicked over into the pits of hell and breath the right brought the right truth to the people see that's why when that first Hill opened that's why it's under we're reading just a minute realizing what means righteous the teachers taught us it was the Holy Spirit conquer in the first stage but the revelation by the Holy Spirit is not that way my revelation about Holy Spirit is Christ and the Holy Ghost is the same person and that one true Living God only in a different form so here stands Christ the lamb we know he was the lamb he's standing here with the books in his hand and there goes the white horse rider so remember brother Brown said when you see two people show up there's not Jesus in God sorry Mormons I'll call it out like it is sorry Mormons it wasn't Jesus and God came to John Smith or Joseph Smith hello hey I've read their book I've had to Mormons y'all told you the story I had two that were my secretaries they told me the whole thing Jesus and God appears to this person Mariah or whoever it is and when you know it's a lie to begin with that's a lot of begin with so you know what I don't have to read that amen they've changed it 1,500 times anyway so why would I read it I don't have to read it again you read this Bible one time and if you pick it up 40 years later you've got a really different amen it will never change face final resting place I love that what brother Brown said face final resting places in the Word of God so look my revelation only in a different form same person so here stands Christ the Lamb we know it was the Lamb me standing here with the book in his hand there goes two white horse rider so it wasn't the Holy Spirit in other words we wanted to take a person or a third person it was the person of God amen number four watch what he's saying to watch you breathe he said look trinitarianism is of the devil I say that that's at the Lord so you can forget everything else you won't do that was the voice of God telling me that trinitarianism is of the devil look where he come from they come from Nicean Council we talked about last week we're reading again when the Catholic Church becoming the rulership the word Trinity is not even mentioned in the entire book of the Bible and as far as three guards that's from Hell so where's this wild horse rider come from hell memory don't he don't have a name to the third to the third seal but his name always was death in other words there was a revelation there's one God that's exactly right now do you say well do you believe that all these people that trinitario of hell no sir I believe they're Christians God winked at their ignorance but watch that last quote but the hour is approaching brother were they are sincerely wrong amen look that comes a time brothers and sisters look it comes to an absolute sharp point and that's where we're at we're at that sharp point where that people can be sincere but they absolutely can be sincerely wrong revelations 2 verse 4 I want you to look real quick here nevertheless remember we read this last Sunday we're ready to kind of fast I'm gonna cut through it and read it a little bit faster nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love nice it's the first church age this is the fusion church age that's powerful big powerful church but watch nevertheless I have somewhat against they become has left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent that's pretty simple but you got to know where you fell to me that's what these seals are not to tell me that my soul ISM is bad if this already redeemed I don't say forget about it but let push that back my spirit realm is where I got a lot of problems and then not my flesh that middle guy and if we keep remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works do what I told you to begin with listen if I told you to have dominion over the fish of the sea in the foul the air that's what I want you to get back to it's all down here where I got a quote hang on a minute but this thou hast that they'll hate us now look the first age they hated the deeds of the Nicolaitans what is Niko laughing brother branson niko is what conquered the laity all right which i also hate now when god hates something he can't change his mind and say later on no i made a mistake cuz you now do the same thing like i you know but now lemon pie hate lemon pie sorry i just hate it and I'll hate it tomorrow but I've said things I hated that I didn't hate anymore alive but God can't do that gunk and say I hated it no I think I like him no he can't do that thank God we can go back to that though if he hated it then he hated it now and he hated it before the foundation of the world alright next please revelations 2 verse 12 now look I skip the pergamus because watch it took three ages that wild horse rider riding through the righteous people amen the Devils riding right there with them and to the Angel of Church of Pergamos which is your last year Third Age these things saith he which has two sharp sword with two edges I know thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is in other words the mystery of iniquity is history you ought to know where he's sitting that but watch and thou holdest fast my name now the third age they were still baptizing them Lord Jesus Christ alright and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou hast there them what your men going with the wrong crowd not mongers and drunks your your mingling with the wrong crowd because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and commit fornication so hast thou also them in your congregation in your pulpit hello somebody so hostile also them that hold the doctrine now remember it was a deed now it's the doctrine they're preaching it it's doctrine folk this is the doctrine we're going to talk about now the doctor of the Nicolaitans which thing I hate he hated it from the beginning and he's still hating it now and then that all right say man it's truth anyhow all right now watch this I'm gonna bring this note there's nothing for you to pull up I just kind of sketch this down because look if you go the wild horse rider said what conquering and to conquer now this is nothing on here that I just wrote this down in here remember you went out conquering into what does conquer do divides conquering divides right hey man you got a divide to conquer anyway because you got to have opposing forces amen we're all Christians we shouldn't fight each other we don't have certain about doctrine but anyway anyway anyway anyway nevermind but remember when brother Dan was talking about in Joel you know what the locust does if we're gonna go locust pummel worm cankerworm caterpillar he read it this morning what does the locust do the first thing the locust does is what eats to leave brother Brown said took away their fellowship divide our I wrote join us don't join them over there join us hey man that's what he says though the locusts we're gonna take the locust pom wearing all those and you can fit them right into this and also remember what happened with Cain and Abel amen the seals the sails to me broke all the way through the Bible you just gotta have an understanding of that because in Genesis 4 what what what was the problem with Cain killing Abel opposing forces hey man Cain tried to put his doctrine over on Abel and Abel says I don't want having nothing to do with it but now Cain thought he was just as righteous as Abel think about that first that white righteous Church they thought they were right they did not start there's no denomination ever started said well we're going to nominate and we're gonna deceive these people we're gonna be wrong they never do that they create a denomination to say we're right Shane still thinks he's right hey man so here it is that thing is riding right through it started and I started actually when Michael Inc and Lucifer fall amen and he come all the way down through Cain and Abel and there was a division and what happened Cain killed Abel not because he didn't like his brother Abel wouldn't agree with him God accepted able and then iniquity was found in Cain's heart amen that Alright say man that's the truth now let's read here let's see now just for a few minutes we got all them brother Louie's you want that spell on me you put the lid about halfway on okay I'll get you some time later so now let's look let's pick up the thought of the Thunder again from watch 1954 nope not that one remember we're putting that we're putting out at the very end you didn't put that at the very end okay all right look what's this Lauer grace Jeffersonville Indiana this is 1954 and the justice of law required blood and the blood of sheep wouldn't do it now remember before we get started these thunders all seven thunders uttered under the first seal there was no other thunder sound on number two number three number four brother Rams they all opened on the first seal when I first you open you know boom boom boom boom boom boom alright that's why that first seals so important hey once you get me in gosh said once you let me in your heart now let me get in a little bit further remember doors in doors brother branham said he said you let God in your house but they still a door here the door here the door here and the door here and you can say god you can't go in that door right there because remember brother Branham said the Holy Ghost was what a very timid person he will not override your free moral agency even as a Christian amen watch this so that the to me the thunders are still going because watch let me just put it to you this way God was in a place that seemed untouchable listen to me just for a minute listen to me don't forget much that God was in a place that man thought was untouchable I can't get there I can't get good enough to be like him I'm gonna have to get a new body because I don't have enough faith they got to change this buddy that's what they're saying amen I just can't I can't I can't you can't do anything we can't couldn't the wooden then free you York ain't cutting the wood and you can't do anything with him there just can't couldn't wooden all right but watch what God is trying to tell us now so in that first sale when that clap came like I said last Sunday God says Here I am I'm fixing to give you something that no one alive except myself had are you quiet now I'm fixing to give you something Martin Luther didn't have I'm gonna give you something Paul didn't have I'm gonna open this seal up and I'm gonna show you everything under cuz remember once he opened it it was there that lightning came and then that Thunder Here I am don't look for me in this one or this one or that one look for me right here this is where I'm at I'm in this message that this man is bringing he saw you put it all in one man just hang on a minute cuz watch this right here this will prove it one the blood of cattle wouldn't do it the blood of God himself had to do it remember do not do it forget Redemption the thunders have to be something that John was familiar with he was getting ready to ride him down he had no problem beginning to write them I was about to ride John was a born-again Christian standing on the earth with the Holy Ghost in his soul and God was showing him something and he said you lad what you see so in Revelations 10 comes down he said the seven thunders are the voice and I join began or started to write in other words he wasn't waiting he knew what he saw he knew what he saw and there's only one thing that we all have in common Redemption there's not one soul gonna go into eternity the Eternity that has not been redeemed not one nobody God was made flesh to live here on earth that great thundering person on top of Mount Sinai was here in flesh then then he cleansed the way well I love this then he cleansed away that he could come and live in your heart and now that same spirit that thundered from Mount Sinai is living in a human heart who's the Thunder what's the thunder let's keep reading no the next one what here's now Elijah 1959 this Angeles temple and we'd pass that this Angeles temple tonight would be packed out to the roof standing out yonder in the yard somewhere if we could only hear that voice of God speaking behind the thing remember those things went first the voice spoke last what he's saying about Mary he's talking to Elijah remember at Thunder the earthquake the lightning and all that but remember Elijah never moved till he heard the voice behind it hello we've had rushing winds and thunder and everything else but the hour is coming now that the voice of God speak and he proved that it's him it was him that sent the Thunder and they went after the Thunder instead of listening for the he sent the wind but they went after the wind instead of the boys that's the problem now we got a lot of wind in the pulpit number eight now look here's the position though you say well where is it it's with God it's up in heaviness with God God's only voice that can speak is this a sign of the end time sir look where the voices words the thunders not in heaven hello not in heaven so he's telling us where it's at not in heaven the thunders never started from the heaven they uttered from the earth I thought the Bible said it was silence in heaven we'll talk about that little head room number nine first seal watch this and then there's coming for seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right and I believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing what faith faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it he's telling us look he's saying we got everything we're right here oh it's wonderful to have all these working but you know what all those people had that working in her life dead I hate to say that but they are there God's finished with them they're done I'm the same way with us I mean that's no shame listen man there's no shame in dying lord have mercy oh please goodness gracious you know what the hardest part is when the Bible says die daily that's a lot harder than dying physically babe and everybody awake it's harder to die daily hey man I just got that sister Johnny that was good amen we can't have enough faith for the divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this earth and we'll find that after look and we'll find that after a while Lord will it words read right now that's for page two we're gonna read we're not gonna read all that one right now we're gonna save that one all right number 10 I'm still in the first seal then when the lamb took the book and broke that first seal God spoke from his eternal throne to say what that seal was to be revealed now who do you speak it through a man amen he didn't come from 14 different men at that time it came from one person a man because he was a prophet he was connected to God amen but when it's placed before John it was in assemble when John saw it it was still a mystery why it wasn't even revealed right then it cannot be revealed until one he said here at the end time but it come and assemble when the Thunder remember a loud clapping noise of a thunder is the voice of God amen brother brother Chris did a wonderful short job Wednesday night but I mean the voice of God anytime God speaks into this dimension something's got to happen something's got to move call this is eternity coming into this dimension hey man brother Bob was telling something I just want to lay this in even in the natural form when a when a sperm and an egg gets together they found out now under a microscope that a spark goes off they see this luck that's life light goes off us there's a there's a little spark Bob can tell you about a little because he's telling me about the other day that when the sperm and the egg connects and they get together like to make the baby that there's a little it's this little little spot of light hey man same here when God comes into the event this dimension there is something going to happen amen a clap of thunder they thought it was a thunder but it was God he understood it for it was revealed to him see it was a thunder and noticed the first Hill opened the first field when it was open in the symbol form it thundered Chris read this Wednesday night now what about when it opened in this reality form amen it's thunder that's it because remember look when these things open in their reality form who is he going to be Moses and Elijah the two prophets at Israel you talk about a thunder they don't have some lightning an end Thunder Amen but we're gonna be gone because it's already been revealed to us it's thundered as soon as the lamb struck back to seal and what did it reveal not all of itself not all of itself first it's with God next it's in a symbol then it's revealed three things see and you know what you say well why is God doing that listen like I said before I'm gonna say it again if this Bible could have been written any different for you to understand it God would have wrote it that way the way he wrote it and the wait listen I'm gonna be honest the way he wrote it and the way the true preachers of this message to preaching it that's the way God ordained it to me if you can't understand it it's your fault but somebody's gonna see it or he went to brought it down that line he brought it down a predestinate in lines that somebody is going to attach to that and hear it and say god that's the truth but truth like Citra had it here but see she only did it in a small form sure I mean you say well it wasn't small wood for the two boys but but man well we come to that when we say this ain't nothing but the truth that's when our body will change our body will change when we say this ain't nothing nothing but the truth because we got this truth going over here we got this - it's going over here we got this seemingly truth but there's got to be one there's only one way one truth first is with God Nexus in a symbol then it's revealed three things it's coming forth from the throne where's the throne of God where is the throne of God brother Lewis been for five services downstairs the kingdom of God is within you and even pilot in his in his worst form a demon pilot was a demon okay pilot want no Christian man he said I don't see no threaten this guy his kingdom he ain't he's no threat to my kingdom right he has no revelation what Jesus was fixing to do but if you had to put him to death he's kingdom wouldn't come hey man it's coming forth from the throne first it can't be seen hurt or nothing it's sealed up the lambs blood paid the price its thundered when he spoke it out and when he did a wild horse rider started out it was still with a symbol Amen that good now what's this one number eleven home for sale the last one is gonna be real good that's what we're gonna close on to be by five minutes now we had him coming last night with his great sword to kill this is the fourth seal he's showin back on the third seal we find out that he gets killed with the sword - the sword of the word I don't think and kill the devil short of the word God's words sharp two-edged sword slays him puts him right down wait till them seven thunders uttered their voices - that group who really can take the Word of God and hand it there remember when the sword came into brother Browns hand he said it fit perfect but room if you'll remember when he continued on with the vision what did he say he said it takes a strong skilled hand of faith to handle that sword because you know what Satan is a pretty good apple story he have a say he's got a sword he's going to be given one here and just in about numbers seal two or three he's gonna be given a word so he's got a sword but that sort of the word knows where to take it like he brother Rams head right to the heart of the devil all right to the heart of the enemy so now I'm telling you we have the people on earth not just storage 'men we have my mr. swordsman's now we have master swordsmen that knows what to do with the word of God and hand it their slice and cut what's this they can close the heavens he ain't talking about the two witnesses at that point he's talking about us they can close the heavens they can shut this or do that whatever they want to glory he will be slayed by the word that proceeds from his mouth it's sharper than a two-edged sword they could call for a hundred billion tons of flies if they wanted to amen whatever they say is going to happen because it's the Word of God coming from the mouth of God God always it's his word but he always uses man to work it hey man so it's not a one-man message not anymore all right let's watch the last one and we'll be done I love this or not here this is revelation of Jesus Christ now look now the voice of the throne notice in this throne before the throne was the seven stars the voice of the stars voices you see there was more in Revelations four here five we can find out and out of the throne proceeded lightnings thunders and voices not one voice voices plural now not seven men we know about that junk not one voice voices plural what was it God speaking to the church reflecting himself through the seven spirits when the true anointed of God speaks it's the voice of God to reject it is to remove the candlestick see voices the voice of the seven church age is over here in the corner the voice is speaking with what thunder and lightning keep rolling up now there's there's so much well we don't believe in saying hail in the pulpit oh mercy so bla huh we need men of God man who won't hold by now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can't preach to the people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to pulpit and preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon watch this now let your sermon be and it's the voice of God that'll bring reproach to them who reject it through who you keep going up we'll read this very last one and be finished right here alright here was voices oh how we need in lula georgia thousands of live voices the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around on the earth today without a white prophet without a blemish i'm just telling you what he said okay you believe it or not yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy the devil don't count how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much do you do this to shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on all my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil when these seals open satan has tried his best to make it everything but the truth because remember he's not oblivious of what's going on when that prophet was standing there that night in 1963 in the tabernacle satan was right there i don't think he sent one of his minions i don't think he sit in the second in command he felt the greatest anointing if the prophet of god said this is the greatest anointing I've ever worked under Satan was standing right beside him a man and what did he do just as soon as brother Graham brought that message Satan went out and said well I think it's this I think it's this I think it's this amen they made it everything in the world but Redemption they made it everything in the world that you can't do it you got a you got to go angle T you got to go to Jeffersonville or you got to go here I'm not just saying that I'm but they do say that we know I think brother Branham just real clear it's your life that thunders louder than anything any doctrine your life thunders louder than anything if you're consecrated to God Satan can touch your life that was a weak amen I know we're about done but amen amen that's the thunder they shanks the devil see we and this is my whole point let's tan we're gonna take communion too so if anybody needs the prayer if you want to come on up if you don't we'll get ready for the communion service okay yeah go ahead what we've all thought just like I said before is that God is so far out under he's so holy that we can't listen the very holy God listen to me the very holy God under the blood of bulls and goats said if you'll come up to this mountain I'll speak to you face-to-face what about under the blood of Jesus cry come boldly to the throne ask what you will that's the Thunder ask what you will and it'll be given unto you Satan can't do that now Satan will take it he'll go well let's just twist it and turn it over this way a little bit now God said this is where it is no this is where it's gonna be you know what like I said before he wrote this right here so that every one of us could have a body change he brought the message so we can all have a body saying Amen they're just wetting the right group of people on earth at the time because rapturing faith faith rapturing faith talked of denominations they'll tell you yeah we believe in the resurrection yeah it's gonna come some time like I said it's gonna come maybe 20-30 years now forty years you know what they're saying is I don't have enough in me to overcome in it right I don't have enough in me to overcome I'm just gonna have to die when I die hallelujah by my so my god listen the Bible says them it's appointed under man wants to die that's an appointment that I'm gonna meet us right you know what you make an appointment with the doctor hell or high water you're gonna be at that doctor's appointment right but the Bible says it's appointed unto us once tonight now I've already died one time I'll have died again but now still that's not gonna give you enough rapture faith to put you in a body change you still gotta believe more you still gotta believe that I will not be at that appointment some will someone you love the Lord but that Thunder is not something out there it's not a strange doctrine the strangest thing that's going to really break Satan's back is that he's gonna look at you and go you did this and this and this and this and this and this and this and you got the back game saying no I didn't know that nor didn't nor didn't yes you did yes you damn I'm gonna argue with the devil you know I'm gonna say I said your Creator standing beside you somewhere in another dimension talk to him because he's the one to say that about me not me I'm an I'm just telling you what I'm just telling you what my creator said and he's standing next to you somewhere over there in another dimension look over and ask him and he's gonna go what sin is you talking about amen Silas in heaven silence in heaven is there my kids I can't condemn my children I've already told them work where they begun from I sent them a prophet to tell them what they're doing here and where they come from and where they're going so we can't lose we can't lose doesn't matter doesn't matter anymore god bless you let's bow our heads just for a second new Lord Jesus thank you for this day we think of this you sure enough resurrected anew in our life we know you did it physically 2,000 years ago but that wasn't the end of it you went up a few days later and said I'll be right back and said the world will see me no more but you'll see me cuz I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world or do we take that promise and we hold on to it that you are in us already but that you've not finished your work that you keep working and you keep working on us and the things that we used to do Lord we don't do them anymore the things that used to bother us Lord they don't bother us anymore the fear that we had is just as brother Ernie says false evidence appearing real fa-a-a-r false evidence appearing real you you you when you came into this dimension after you'd already had a glorified condition first thing he said was fear not fear not fear not so Lord take the fear away from the people take the fear away from all of us Lord that we'll look at you what you've already said it's not some new doctrine it's not some new but my the prophet told us the seven thunders weren't written sure they're not written there in our heart we're written epistles you said known and read of all men so let that live out Lord let that thunder here in lula georgia and everywhere we go that our life will project you Lord and that we will have I meant to mention this thanks you for bringing to my remembrance Lord the property God told us said now we have Satan's answer his answer is no Satan I will not die no Satan I will not do what I used to do no Satan I will not take that fall to doctrine because I'm covered by the blood of Jesus Christ thank you Lord we ask you to be with us now in the further man the service there be any sick Lord you said you sent your word and healed them and deliver them from destruction so Lord even as we've seen people healed taking communion ourselves Lord that you would just heal us now father give us spiritual healing more than anything be with us this week Lord as many are traveling going different places on spring break Lord but may we never take a break from you may you always be in the forefront of our of our minds in our hearts Lord give us our daily bread today as we take the communion father forgive us of our sins and all the things that we excuse me the bad thoughts and all that we have Lord we know they're not so we know they didn't originate from the one inside we pray Lord that you just now bless us be with the pasture touch him Lord as he's gonna be away for a few days give him strength him mom just be with each one father Jesus name we pray amen let's take communion go ahead let's give her brother a good name [Applause] even when Adam and Eve sinned God never condemned Adam God never condemned Eve I'm quoting brother Brandon he walked right into their presence in their sinful condition he stood right there and talked to him cause he'd already covered him he'd already covered it's done before the world right hey man tell her brother how much you appreciate the word yeah let's just read their scripture and going into the communion so we'll go to first Corinthians 11:23 where I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you but the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup in the New Testament this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of men for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death till he come or for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the law but little man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged unlike this if we judge herself won't be judged they didn't stop there but when we are judged we do it we're judge guilty what does he do we're chasing to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest when I said in order when I come think about the communion we talk about the Easter the resurrection and the things I've just never been one to preach Easter messages or Thanksgiving messages I just try to bring what's on my heart but it's true this is Easter this is sunrise and this is the resurrection but it's talking about him not about me and you all in him what he's doing for you and for me he took our place what I said about Adam and Eve he didn't condemn him read your prophet he came the condemned the earth condemned the beasts condemned to fight but he never condemned Adam and Eve he walked right into their presence the code in his mind before the world he had already atoned as quick as he got into their presence and seeing what they were he took the animals made the atonement then he could walk right out there with him and he's been here ever since I love that statement I remember when I first heard him the Prophet said that God come down in the garden in City and never went back he came down with us to live never left that's a wonderful thing Union we come to the time of taking the communion code it's a wonderful situation and wonderful part that Paul is explaining the things he was chosen to do this because he would be able to take all the old testament the things and put it together and could come out and explain to communion what a wonderful opportunity the man would have to be chosen for that job but you don't want were the recipients never how you call that big word we're the ones who receive the benefits and in doing that then what a wonderful opportunity what it's better to understand you know is it better to understand and be able to know or is it better to walk and live into what you folks to be which one is it I'll take walking I'll take living I'll take being what I am and walking in the Lord what about you so we come to this time the Bible says they take tarried one for another so let's take a few moments suggest how silent prayer waiting and remembering each other before the Lord father as we come to this time then we think of the sick ones among us and believe in that a resurrection took place toward that you could come back and heal and deliver what an Easter what a time to walk in you reach down and touch the sick among us you said it you sent your word in healed us and deliver us from destruction so we thank you for all the things have your way forgive our sins cleanse us make us worthy to be able to protect of this communion we love you in Jesus name Amen [Music] the Bible said he took bread father we ask you to just bless this it was made for this purpose today we asked you to sanctify it because we know it's not your body it's only a representation with what a wonderful representation we're wonderful Balcon though the truth about you loving your grace we love you we thank you sanctify the food and the partakers and we may be all together as one in you in Jesus you may not think much about communion or why the issue why bad you know you didn't tell us like we did I don't throw off on nobody but we used to take the communion every three months take once over three months actually we didn't have a foot water we took the communion once every three months we'd order the book of the bag of food get it a little package we take that we have the communion what we had leftover we just put it back in the bag put it the preacher we can't fit for three months later you know we had the communion three months later we didn't follow nothing in the word toward it we divide the bread do this or try to oh you're not supposed to hold over I'm supposed to do those things you're supposed to keep it for it'll all be the fresh for the day to them they call this the word not the one off on nobody but this is telling the truth father we thank you for this wine is going through the process of aging and it's better every day the Lord because it it's the top of your blood we ask you to sanctify the blood or protectors that we may all be together in you and as we eat the little bread and we drink a little wine and tomorrow there'll be blood cells created from that so life is involved you know this represents your blood for each one of us see it would sanctify all of us together until we take we didn't believe in taking wine we were too holy you
