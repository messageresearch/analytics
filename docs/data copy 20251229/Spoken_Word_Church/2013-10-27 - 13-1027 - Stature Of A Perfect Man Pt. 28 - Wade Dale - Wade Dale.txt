========================================

okay this is probably the last one on knowledge we're gonna let bread around them give us some Insight on knowledge because we we see the first thing we we look at but looks the first thing I said was what was it that we were looking at um discernment what's the first thing he's what is what is discernment the judge that's what judging is so the knowledge and the statue of a perfect man is to be able to judge or discern right from wrong right okay okay hello hello it's not working let's see let's see if we can make it work just hang on just a second you know this technology hello hello oh well it'll pick it up on that it should okay all right let's read what brother Randall says about knowledge all right it says and then thirdly brother Brown says in the Statue of perfect man paragraph 160 and thirdly you add knowledge knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to God but knowledge to judge judge what right from wrong how do you judge it then if you've got Christian knowledge with your virtue and Faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong and if you can lay aside all your creeds and all your unbelief everything that you claim you've done then you have knowledge to believe that God cannot allow that every word man's being a word be word be alive but mine be true now you're getting knowledge that Supreme knowledge you don't have to have four degrees in some college or something like that to have it because all these virtues were given to you by God the place upon the foundation of your faith that you might come to the full statue of a real living man of God yes sir add knowledge because knowledge of his word you must believe it in this way such as you should believe today that accept that the days of miracles did not passed knowledge that what God Said God is able who perform Abraham believed that and with 100 years old he stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief look how ridiculous that word looked here's a man 100 years old looking for a baby could be born into his home by a woman 90 years old almost 50 years past Baron lived with her since she was a young girl and teenager and here he is his life stream was dead and Sarah's womb was dead all hope was gone as far as it was hope but yet against hope he believed in Hope because he had knowledge that God was able to keep everything that he promised now when you got it like that then add it to your face so here we go back to what we were talking about add to what you believe add to what your faith is knowledge all right when you get true birth you added to your faith when you can walk out here on the street live like a Christian act like a Christian be a Christian add that to your faith when you have knowledge you say well I don't know now whether this scripture is just right now here's Acts 2 38 then he goes through that because you haven't got knowledge enough to know of God yet that the Bible doesn't contradict itself leave it alone don't say no more about it see leave it alone but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory and let me say when you can see that the message of the hour is not contradictory all right like they're trying to say now that brother Brown was right here and around here well that's not Holy Ghost knowledge all right so that's the knowledge of man because I think that that you know these virtues have been impartiality but they've they're coming into full manifestation now um you know you you take now and you say now as far as long as we are that brother random was wrong here and right here and all these things and he he said this wrong whatever I you know you there's no excuse for that that's right see there was an excuse for Luther if you say excuse me Luther had a Luther had a knowledge but now remember his knowledge only took him so far in the word the judge shall live by faith but he was a trinitarian he was the Catholic but he baptized in the name father son Holy Ghost say God winged at that ignorance of the man but he had enough enough little bit of knowledge just a little bit of knowledge to say that just shall live by faith and God built his church on that then Wesley and then Pentecost and now we're coming into the full manifestation of the word we can't be saying that the prophet of the hour just brought part of the word that's what I said you know Wednesday night I I want to be able to know what brother Brown said after 1965. right amen and like brother Joe Canada he came in he said you know what he said I want to know what Jesus said after his Ascension yeah yeah same thing because before it is Ascension you get father son Holy Ghost baptisms you get all kind of isms and schisms even when he was here God in human flesh walking around they called him all kinds of things they said his Doctrine was wrong they said this just like they did Brother brown but after the Holy Ghost came back onto their Pentecost when Peter walks up what his first name Peter does say repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so I want to know what brother Rhymes that after 65 and what Jesus said after his Ascension because that to me is the perfection of a perfect man is knowing we have been given a message but take that message and then apply it in its pure form not partial in its pure form in the end time that's why brother Brown said we had to have the full restoration of the word because they had pieces here and pieces here but that knowledge in the Statue of a perfect man that knowledge now to get us to the Capstone Revelation has got to be the perfect knowledge of God it has to be the absolute Mind Of God because Paul said we have the mind of Christ in life we were preaching Wednesday night if you have the mind of Christ you are able to understand what he said because if you got his mind but what brother Brown was talking about he said we put our own Creeds into it what we bring our own knowledge in we bring our own thoughts and ideas and that's what they're doing in the message now they're bringing their own thoughts in surely they've got quotes Jesus had quotes remember you remember Nicodemus and gamalia they were conversing and remember Camellia or one of them said well you know wasn't there a guy come out here and led 100 and something in the desert or 70 or 80 or whatever how many amount it was then he come by and said he was a messiah and he led these people out in the desert and Camellia or one of them said hey if it be of God it'll approve itself in other words if it's not of God it'll be just like that well see they were they're showing that there was people I've always said there was there's many jesuses during Jesus time there wasn't just one man named Jesus but there was only one man named Jesus Christ all right because he was born Lord to Christ there was his identification Behold the Lamb of God it takes away the sin of the world now now probably John knew a bunch of Jesus's but there's no way he could say that about that person because that person was truly identified remember what they told John John whoever you see the spirit fall upon and remain John being a prophet he could see the Spirit fall on people prophesy like campus and then the spirit leaving well he knew that wasn't a messiah right but when that Spirit came on that River Jordan and it remained and and John saw the manifestation of what was going on he said there's one that's the one that's that's the Messiah and uh his name was Jesus Christ that identifies him with what we were talking about in that Genesis 1 that Christ in Genesis 1 26 has now come down into a man and he come to save us because we can't save ourself we had to have a man come save us all right but that's we're worldly knowledge and people's knowledge of of what brother Brown said listen knowledge of what he said not a revelation of what he said all right because truly every Doctrine in this message came out of the message it didn't come from James Dobson and they're not quoting these people out here they're quoting brother Branham so that's where the that's where the fallacies are coming from they put in their own idea into one quote or a series of quotes or a set of quotes that they see that it's over on this side they put their own idea to it that's not godly knowledge brother Brown says but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory well when you can see the message is not contradictory all right that you can say that and can see that by the revelation of God now watch what he says the whole word is wrote in mystery that's right the prophet's message is written in Mysteries he was probably the most misunderstood man that ever lived on the face of this earth right right besides Jesus Christ right I mean look what they've got I mean they're picking his life apart now so what big deal he's human he was a human man he had human desires he had wife he had children you know he could have he could have been a maybe I was working now he could have been a monk and just he that's what he wanted to do remember he went he said God I want to go up in the mountains be like Elijah grow me a beard and run out and say thus death the Lord and go back in he said no that's not what you were made for you were made to live among your people but the whole world word is wrote in Mysteries and only the knowledge of God okay I'm revealing only not the knowledge of man because that gets your ideas but only the knowledge of God can reveal it and then when you get in say punctuate every word of God with an amen then add that to your faith now look then add that to your faith not it per se added to it first you got to grow in Grace and knowledge and then somewhere you've got to come to that knowledge that's why this true whole the knowledge and the statue of a perfect man it's not just partial knowledge because Luther had partial knowledge and he wasn't adopted he didn't get up here he had his for the day but he wasn't a manifested Son of God like me like we need in the end time and only the knowledge of God can reveal it then when you get and say punctuate every word of God within amen then add that to your faith oh you're getting to be a pretty good man right now see you're coming up see what with with faith virtue than knowledge see how it's building this man there's no what's look at that you can see there's no way escaping it this is the way to become to the full statue of Christ yes sir to judge judge Wright judge whether it's right or wrong to believe God's word judge whether it's right or wrong whether I should serve a Creed or serve God judge whether it's right or wrong I should be born again or join a church then you begin judge Wright when the preacher says the days of Miracles the past the Bible says Jesus Christ same yesterday damn forever now what you're going to believe when you say I'll take God now you don't say that just to say it well I take it just from your heart but something in you something in you your faith pushes out there there you are your faith says I know he's the same because remember it's not wrong to listen to me now it's not wrong to question God's word Abraham questioned God's word he did he laughed at God right he said me and Sarah said me here take Hagar so there you know but you come to the end time now where our faith says I know he's the same I've witnessed him the same there's nothing can take it away from me I know he's real amen then add that to your faith see to me knowledge is not just whatever all of a sudden you're just going to get knowledge that's what I said before it's got to be a birth it's got to be something even up through the statue of a perfect man all the way up to to Divine love you're going to have to grow in Grace and knowledge you're not going to get it all dumped on you at once and sometimes you know you you uh you preach into a congregation and you see the eyebrows and their furl their eyebrows go down like this or they start scrambling through their Bible and like Daddy said about the brother that that when Daddy said to give ten thousand dollars you know the new brother you know we're sitting back there and said I'll give you ten thousand dollars if you can find where anybody would baptizing them follow us on Holy Ghost here we go do you know what he done he closes the Bible laid it down right because it's not there well see that was Holy Ghost knowledge talking to somebody with partial knowledge knowledge of a father son Holy Ghost baptism that he'd never heard anything else before all right so we come to him we got to come to a knowledge number one you do come to a knowledge that you're lost you come to knowledge that you're lost then you get Faith and that Faith what does it do it doesn't stop your knowledge it expands expands your knowledge it makes your knowledge greater right like I told you many times before when brother Harris was preaching and I'm looking at predestination of it has some I have some human questions one question in the word I was questioning how to put it together and it's just like I was watching brother Harris preach but all of a sudden it wasn't it wasn't words on page and it wasn't a book popped up but it was like a book comes up in front of me and it just starts doing this well when it starts unfolding it's not like it was written on there and I could read it it was what my intelligence I believe it was the Holy Ghost speaking to me showing me and it was running through my brain going back to the scriptures going back to the prophet's message we'll see to me that's Holy Ghost knowledge when you see that and you can put it in there and it lays right on top of each other then you know one thing for sure now it doesn't mean I knew everything about predestination either but he sure answered the question I had on predestination and then you know brother now preaching on foreign always just made it even greater to me that to me I tell you to me that's probably one of the greatest Mysteries that's been solved you can grow me or not if you want to that's one of the greatest Mysteries that's been solved in this church is bringing the the mystery of foreign been there the whole time been laying there the whole time we've been reading it we look and we even read we uh you know those who before knew he did pre-estimate we just keep reading right on through that those before then you take somebody that looks and says hey those he foreknew that's got to be first he did predestining so foreknowledge is first so if you take foreign knowledge foreknowledged to me satisfies every quote and every scripture that seems I said scenes in our head contradictory I said scenes contradictory it's not contradictory but there's got to be an answer brother Brown said if you've got a question got to put a man in the Pulpit to give you that answer all right yeah to me to me the revelation of predestination makes a late Pride the people who feel that they can be here that's correctness and to know when you realize it there's no right they take away all they take away all the attributes of God as far as a savior a redeemer coming here to give his life they take all that away so it's just like I've said it if I'm wrong or brother Dale's wrong then you know just let it stay that way because to me I'd rather know I've lost and that God found me and I responded it was my choice to respond I was I was you know what I was doing I was just playing my godship I was just playing my godship because brother Brown said God will not go override your free moral agency override God won't override your choice he's not gonna make you do anything if not then he's not just he's not a just God all right just like we were talking about wings tonight okay if you haven't heard Wednesday night service you need to listen to Wednesday night serving whether I preached it or not it just was a good it was something good that you can that you can sink your teeth into yeah what do you think what did they do I I you know I've heard him preach it but I've never heard of it what what what's their answer for Christ's dying for you if they think you come here with that Eternal seating what what's their answer for that the only thing I want to ask them I just want to ask them one thing I wanted to explain to me justification sanctification in the baptism Holy Ghost that's all I want to ask them I don't want to go into anything else explain to me how you get Justified explain to me how you get Sanctified explain to me how you get the Holy Ghost and you always love you colonel brother Brown said the unclean Spirit goes out it's sanctification where was that unclean spirit it was in you so God won't dwell in unclean see the guy it's just a two Soul message wrapped up in a different package they're saying you got two Natures in there two Souls right right and then God you what happens is this one dies and you realize this and always was there all right it's a new training then where's the Salvation issue I just I'm sorry I don't know well both of them don't dwell in their goodness no no no no no but anyway you know what though it's just like you said it's a fleshly manifestation they want to feel good like Trudy said if you have a partial knowledge of predestination your head can swell this big I always was this God I never this and I never was saved on any certain day and well you know what that Genesis 1 26 man never was saved on any certain day all right I think Genesis 126 and I know it shocked some of you because some of you I saw your face Wednesday night Genesis 1 26 don't need salvation right that is your salvation that's right it don't need it that man never fell did he that man never fell Christ Ever Fall if he fell then he needed Redemption I don't want to start preaching him all right this will be for a later sermon we'll we'll take it up a little bit in depth but that Genesis 126 that scripture to me just it satisfies everything predestination foreknowledge Redemption salvation because you have to watch what brother Brown says he says you always was eternal he's not looking at that person and saying you always was eternal because even in the churches book he said it's not the part in other words it's not the person I'm looking at that was predestinated eternally from God but the seed or word or may I say the Genesis 1 26 and 27 man the theophany of God that you have at the new birth not at your first birth at your new birth uh it wouldn't be a new birth if you didn't need it Nicodemus poor thing all he had to do was say I believe the message of the hour that seed would just come right to life but anyway but see that that's man's ideas with a bunch of clothes and brother Brown does give you quotes you always was your cologne you never were born only in a certain date yeah that Genesis 1 26 man never was there's not a day in that Genesis 1 26 man's life that he ever said one word to sin but you did down here that's why you had to come down here you bypass that we read last time not this past time but the time before who there's no kind of that you bypass that now what's bypassed me you went around it you didn't come straight from God's theophany form Jesus came straight from God's theophany form because he was always here he comes here he comes here born Lord the Christ you weren't born Christ right you become Christ at your new birth right that's right you weren't born Christ you were born in sand shaping iniquity I just like it that way if I'm wrong I just like it that way I'm just just leave it alone I once was and now I ain't you know I once was dead now I'm alive because Paul even said we were dead and trespassing sin dead now we're something live about something dead I was told by a person that Calgary just brought them to the realization that's what they're saying that's what they set out in out there where I was at they said that Calvary just brought you to a realization that you always was a son of God obviously not what I think they're trying to do is they're trying to say that number one I've heard people say that brother Branham changed his doctrine of the new birth he used to teach justification sanctification about them long ago but when the third pull came into manifestation excuse me the opening of the word that that brought us to a realization that we didn't need all that that we always was eternal and that we had it all the time but you know and that was after the seal that's what I've always said they said well that was before the sale after the sale well in 1964 whenever he preached when he preached after that one too and when did he preach to Future home it was a 64 right or two it was after the seal he said justification the world goes through justification just like you did the world goes through sanctification just like you did he said thank God he said I've come this far in other words and I'm still preaching the same three works of Grace right well now that's 1964 or 65. he's preaching us into the future home and still preaching on justification sanctification about them all goes now let me explain something real quick and we'll stop right here and we'll I think we've got enough of knowledge everybody kind of knows what's going on with knowledge but what I feel is they just got it out of order they just got it out of order it's just out of order I think the picture just like I said program didn't make that illustration just to say something funny they got the cow they got the grass and they got the tree now if you got the cow eating grass under the tree yeah you're doing great but if you got the cowing grass on top of the tree what their Revelation is is their Revelation is is that it all happened at your natural birth so they said you come here always eternal now we take the same quotes the same scriptures and everything else and apply it after the new new birth if I understand that because they're just saying the new birth brings you just to a knowledge that you always was when I look it does the new birth brings you to a knowledge that you always were right so as now I'm on this side of the Salvation issue okay I'm born again I'm over here I can look back and see that Genesis 1 26 man and know that that man is what's in me now and that's where I was that's my identification I heard from that theophany right I heard from that and then now I can look back and see absolutely I wasn't born on any certain day I never did begin first thing I always was eternal all those Quotes come right in line if you say now I have the new birth and then this happens to me and I receive the Life of Christ I've got I've got a stack of quote This Tall I have been pulling I just went in put new birth and then put in eternal life and put in Primo agency and I had like 3 600 quotes and I read through about half of them and I printed off the ones that we needed brother Brown never changed his view on having a free choice or a free Mole agency or free will he said you're still on free more Legacy today well now you can't change if you're on free moral agency today then it's your choice that does the language or nothing I'll just ask later okay but remember without Holy Ghost knowledge you'll make brother Brandon say it's all right to have polygamy it's too soft to you you got two Souls you got seven thunders of the virtues of God you've got brusia everything comes out of from 47 to 65. I'm familiar with the doctrine you're talking about and about the Statue of America they just say once you come to the realization you just seek the holy ghosts so what does that make you do sit down on your death and not do nothing right a lot of kids are out in the world that's why they live worldly lives that's why things happening in in our life if we get dilatory our life too we're not immune from a little bit of it right but when we do come to the knowledge of God that what he said in that message that these uh virtues are required so it's a requirement for us to get this up to even where the apostles work and for this Capstone to come down on us you must have Holy Ghost knowledge not man's knowledge this has nothing to do with man's knowledge we read it he said that's not worldly knowledge it's the knowledge of God and you know what if you don't understand something just say I don't understand it don't say I don't believe it because you know what when you say I don't believe it that puts a little barrier right there right you can't get any further than that just say look I don't understand that to this point and that's the best thing to do because you know what if you have a desire that you know at this point you're not understanding if you have that desire God will put a Man In a Pulpit he'll explain that answer he'll answer that question and then what you'll do is you'll move on to something else add to Europe very much
