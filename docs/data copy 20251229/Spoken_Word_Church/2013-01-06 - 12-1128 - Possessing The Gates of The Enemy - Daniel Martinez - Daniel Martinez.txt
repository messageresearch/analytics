our dear and precious Lord and Heavenly Father Lord with bowed hearts Lord Jesus and humility Lord God we come before you Lord God recognizing Lord Jesus that we in ourselves are nothing Lord God but you're everything you've been everything to us Lord Jesus and we recognize Lord God that as this day is coming upon us Lord God and judgments facing this whole world Lord God and Lord Jesus we know Lord God by the signs of the time Israel and turmoil out there and and and missiles raining upon Israel Lord and Lord Jesus we recognize Lord God that there's coming a Time Lord God when thus sayith the Lord will all come to pass Lord Jesus amen including that piece of Sandbar out there in California Lord Jesus that will probably go into the depths of the Sea Lord God and brother Brown explained that it'd be like the last days of Pompei and Lord Jesus we recognize when we look at history and we see what happened in Pompei we recognize Lord Jesus that people in mid stride were just pinned to the walls Lord God and died in in misery and Lord Jesus we recognize Lord God that is in this day in this age Lord Jesus Lord we have no hope outside of you Lord God that's right we recognize Lord Jesus that it's being in the holy spirit being in your presence Lord Jesus Lord you are our Salvation you are our shelter Lord God you are our Rock Lord God and Lord we look towards you Lord Jesus in humility Lord God we don't look at anything we are or any righteousness that we are Lord God but we look at the at what you paid for us at Calvary Lord Jesus we look at the truth that you provided for us in this day and age Lord God we believe Lord God In You Lord and we believe you in every way Lord Jesus we pray oh Lord God that you give us more of your Holy Ghost Lord Lord Jesus help us Lord God to meet the challenge of our hour and the challenge of our day Lord Jesus for we recognize Lord God that is the only way we can meet the challenge of our hour Lord God is to have your presence and your holy ghost in our lives Lord Jesus bless us each and everyone as we come to hear from your word Lord God get me out of the way Lord God and speak to your people what they you have for them to to know Lord in this day and hour Lord we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen Hal amen you know uh I was uh uh you know uh thinking about what to speak about and I was thinking about about a lot of things that brother B talked about and you know we realized that in this day and age we're standing in a day when the world's falling apart yes sir oh yeah amen you know you say everybody says you know well uh with with Mr Obama taking office again and all and we read some people say well it's a bad choice but you know what choices are there out there we know that we've chosen the right choice and that's Jesus Christ and his word has made a statement that this world's going to fall apart there's nothing we can do to save it we can put the right man we can put an Abraham Lincoln up there right now we can put we can put the the the right man in that place and it's still going to fall apart CU it's th sayith the Lord so we recognize you know that even though it seemed like to me a few months I mean a few years ago four years ago when uh when when Mr Obama took office the world was falling apart you know I saw the the I saw the news and I was watching I saw how the banks were just falling apart and I was afraid that there was going to be a run on the bank like there was in the first depression and they just closed the doors and say you don't got no money you know your money's gone you don't got no money reach out for your retirement you find out oh no we don't got no retirement you reach out for your cars and they say oh the bank's coming to repossess it uh you reach out for your home and they say your house is worth nothing now and that's about where it was going you know I and and and sure he did he did put debt upon debt upon debt you say well it's debt gathered up so high that we never end up paying for it all but you go back to what the prophet said and the prophet said if all staging in place so that the word of God will come to pass that the sellout of this United States will come to pass and it's it's probably already happened you know things happen behind the scene we don't even know it sometimes you you don't realize who's pulling the real levers here you know when when you come when it comes to politics you know you wonder sometimes cuz how can how can can all the banks fail how can all the how can gold go up SC Skyhigh in price how can and and make the gold in the Vatican worth so much more oh yeah how can the how can the whole world's economy start falling apart one after another and after another all the automobiles go uh uh companies way back in debt a uh the the the ones Fanny May Freddy Mack falling apart there where where it looks like they can't even loan loan a loan anymore to anybody who wants to buy a house you stand back and you say well what is it we start to see the the message of this hour has explained to us the world is going to fall apart and then when when it comes down to the bride she's she she should be lifting up her head for her Redemption dri nigh when she looks at the word of God coming to pass when she looks at thus sayith the Lord right I don't know if uh if uh if anybody shared with you the Google c yeah anybody told you about it or showed you the the the clip on it right I was looking at that and I saw that car driving through the streets driving first of all on a course right and then eventually driving on the streets the man sitting at the wheel but not touching the wheel not touching the brakes not touching the gas and it performed better than most people can drive better than I can drive sometimes ask my wife now so so she's a good backseat driver don't get me wrong so here we go so we find out that look what is it brother Brown said we're waiting for the roads right you don't need the roads no more it wasn't it wasn't installed in some special car right it was adapted to a Toyota right yeah you know adapted to a Toyota that means it could probably be adapted to any car any car that gots a gasoline pedal and and a steering wheel it can be adapted to it exactly you know so so it doesn't take a work of science anymore it's on the it's on the it's not only on the map it's being used it's being tested and laws are being passed like they said that laws were being passed in uh in Nevada for it to get on the highway already it's safe enough to get on the highway and drive down the road and you being another driver driving alongside it wouldn't be afraid of that car yeah right cuz it's that close to being better than most most drivers that might be texting on their phone yeah you know better than that cuz you could be texting on your phone and it's taking it's taking you just perfectly down the street or sleeping in your car maybe taking you down the street fine so what is it and they're saying well no we're not wanting you to get off the the steering wheel we want you to still have control but in reality you can turn your back and play a game of cards or whatever brother Brown saw happening there on that car car of the future that that he saw so what are we looking at we're looking at thus sayth the Lord coming to pass and when we stand back see thus sayith the Lord coming to pass y you know if we went back down to Egypt all right let me go back in a little scenario if you were in Egypt and you were sitting there and you heard that the Brethren come up and say Moses said for us to do this put the blood on the on the doorpost Y and and and and and we're going out of Egypt this day we're we're going we're going to apply the token and get out of Egypt this day where is if you were an Israelite in that day in that age if you were just imagine yourself right in that place you'd stand back and say you know what I'm going to do what Moses said because I believe it's thus said the Lord but what's the real sign the real sign that they were seeing is God again manifesting himself in our time in our time exactly the coming of a prophet is a sign Y is a sign of the end time the revealing of the truths that were hidden throughout all ages that you take a look at the Seven Seals and you see clear as a bow what God had hidden Through the Ages and the and the reformers could were tapping that but never could get to the fullness of you come and you read your scripture and you see it to coming to pass you see the revelation of it it's the coming of God almighty y manifesting himself through a message of this hour sir that would bring a truth hidden Through the Ages to be revealed in your day and age you're taking part of the third pool right amen you see I'm taking part of the third pool I'm taking a part of the Crea word well the Crea word the whole third pool was showing us showing us it's the revealing of the word right it's the revealing of the word to bring bring you to an understanding right right to be a faith people who could stand up and say look no I don't care what's happening around me I don't care of my infirmities I don't care of my sicknesses I don't care I believe God's word above what I feel I believe God's word above what I see what I can taste what's going on around me little dream I had just night before last actually I was there you know the the fancy little Leatherman Tool the the the one called The Wave which gots a uh blades on the outside where you can just flick them out fairly easy well in the dream I was there trying to hide this thing some trying to hide it like under a in between a bed or in between the mattress and the and the boards that are under the bed or something like that I was trying to hide it and and so so I I come out and I says you know they're they're confiscating all metals they're confiscating all metals M so I step out and they're going to they're about to go into my bedroom to search for these for all metal I say so you know what I says here have my ring I was trying to hide it but I decided to give it to you how could a Lea me be worth more than my wedding ring you know right you know but you know what when pressure is on like that right a simple little multi-tool would be worth more than your more than your wedding ring right right gold doesn't mean nothing to you anymore right you know if if they're taking all metal you walk into your kitchen you say you know what you'd like to hide a knife yeah a kitchen knife you'd like to hide that let them take the silverware let them take all those things but a kitchen knife would be worth more than you more to you than your wedding ring or your gold that you might have and in the dream they're saying okay they had me sitting at a table there and they said we Gord and remove all the gold out of your mouth I says the gold out of my mouth yeah he says we're we're having to confiscate all the gold first we're going to take all medals we're taking the goal first and I asked well what program are you part of and they says well we're in the program of the miners miners says we're mining for metal who are you Mining and you take it right out of your mouth I well that's just a dream and I've had dreams I've had dreams that I'm in Hitler's concentration camps you know I've had dreams dreams of of of of the pressures on right you know I don't doubt that the pressure is coming on right right but this bride isn't going to play is isn't going to go go down like the like like like hit Hitler's concentration camp this bride got something way more valuable it's a faith seed that we have possession of it's this message of this hour when it becomes a reality to you when you'll stti when you'll say like Abraham I don't I don't you know I I'll take what God's word says above what I'm feeling above what I'm my age is happening above what's happening in Sarah wom I don't care about all these things but I'll take God's word for a preeminence I'll take what he said as truth and you know what when you start looking at this message when you start looking at thus sayith the Lord and what God Said in this message of hour you'll be coming to a place where you'll say look I'll take this yeah as my possession right this is mine this nobody's going to take that away from me I've got I've got the Holy Ghost I got the token I've got what God reveal to this day in this day and age for a people amen you know I was talking to Brother D Brother Joseph the other uh yesterday evening and he mentioned to me you know uh we were talking about media you you know how everything's been put into into uh MP3 format and you can get the whole message on MP3 format and stuff like that and I said it's a media and he says you know your written word was a media at one time and somebody had to give their life to get this written down in a place where you can take your your GL reading glasses and read it you know or or or take your eyes and be able to read it somebody gave his life for that well you know what it's come to the place where you can just plug something in your ear and listen to thus sayth the Lord right amen and you can go to your internet you can go to a computer someplace and download any portion of thus sayith the Lord is com in our day and hour right and you stand back and you say well you know what uh they they may not say that that that that that it but you know it's come in appropriate time right remember that the scripture says in the days of of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound Glory right this is the day that the voice of the Prophet could be put on recording to where it can get out like that amen it would have never gotten out in this form right you know right you know quickly they could they could silence this one right but they can't silence the days of the voice of the seven things right right amen and the Bible also says faith cometh by what by hearing hearing of the word of God glory amen so where are we we we're double portion there we got a double portion where we can receive what God has given us in the first and second and third pole amen what God has given us in the revealing of his word right amen and the truth that's been given us in the Seven Seals we recognize that that cloud excuse me somebody said they had water up here you asked and said you didn't I'm sorry I had coffee I had coffee back there but it's not helping me up here now I can't get warned by a painted fire I can't satisfy my thirst back there all right well you know when we recognize that this seven seal this this Cloud mystery has come to question and a lot of things that brother brandham did in this in his in in his ministry they'll come up and and and try to disprove it in this day and age but you know what there comes a place in your life where you can say that was settled for me right you know it's just the same as if you come back and somebody starts to ask you did you really accept Jesus Christ did you really accept what he did for you at Calvary you say that was settle for me right you can't come back and make me question that for nothing exactly I know that he paid the price for Daniel Martinez he died at the calvary for my sins and there's no way that you can pull my sins out of Jesus Christ's Heart Right amen and present him before the devil or or before the the the Judgment seat of Christ you can't pull them out of God's heart so just that you can have that confidence that you know beyond any Shadow of Doubt that your sins were buried in Calvary right and ra and and your life was raised in him come on just that you have that confidence is the same kind of confidence that you can come back and say look I don't care how they criticize the message of this hour I know it's a fact and I know it's true and I know it's thus say the Lord and you can't pull that away from me you can't take that word from me because I know beyond any Shadow of Doubt that that's thus sayith the Lord and it's going to be holding true thank you brother amen it's going to be holding true until eternity passes and it's thus sayith the Lord right so how can you take away the Holy Ghost excuse MH right how can you take away what the Holy Ghost has done in your day and age that's how you can say look I I I it's settled for me I know the cloud even though they might tell you about the timing and all these things I know that in a fact it was Christ himself coming down in a representation of that third pole that was going to reveal the truths of the Seven Seals amen amen right I know that that storm in Colorado went back on itself just the same as God our lord Jesus called a storm to peace right right am on that yes sir and that storm on on the on the sea testimony on the sea I know for a fact that just the same as Jesus Christ walked up and said out of five fishes and a few loaves I know that it's for a fact that if we come into that point where we need something from God he'll multiply out of nothing something you need am amen believe it how can you come to that place how can you come to that Faith because Abraham went up that mountain and he he was going up to sacrifice his own son right and when he was walking up that mountain he didn't know how he was going to do it he was ready and determined to accomplish what God told him to do and he was going to kill Isaac he was going to kill Isaac and and burn him right there on the sacrifice he stacked the wood he put it in place he took his knife he was going to kill Isaac amen right and he said and he was and he knew for a fact that God would raise him out of those actions right but God decided I wasn't going he wasn't going to go that far he didn't let him go that far but we recognize we recognize that just the same way you come to the place where you say look I I've laid it all down already right right you've come to the place where you say look I've I've anchored my soul right in a Haven of Rest there's nothing going to question my heart about the truths that God has revealed to me in this day and age through the message of this hour right amen right what is it what is it what brings you to this place where you can say without any Shadow of Doubt I can believe look at what was it the third pole the Third P the squirrels the storm in Colorado the the the the tumor and sister media what is it where can you come to a place where almighty God can show you every aspect of his creation yeah every aspect of his his ability to bring back right you to an original form right where he can where he can can create a squirrel where he can speak to the storms where else can you see the truth of what we're going to need right under pressure how do you how do you you know sometimes it looks like you know if if pressure comes on you which I I believe the bride is not brother Brown explained the bride's not here to go through what the first church AG went through the bride's not going to go through the Lion's dens right the bride's not going to go over there and be he said you know they they they've already made uh a uh what do they call it a concentration in in in Alaska you know and and and and and and I I don't know how far that's come but I do know this the bride won't be part of that you say she'll be because it's come to a place where it's time where the scripture says the bride has made herself ready she's come to a faith where she believes God she believes his word and the word brother said there won't be one of them bomb fall no right before the bride's gone on the Rapture exactly where are we looking at you say well Israel is about to get angry enough to send an atonic bomb he said they won fall right you know so we stand here and we stand here looking at at what God's done in his work and we stand here looking at what what's our part to play here amen right amen here Lula what's your part to play how do I do it how do I get to the place where I'm I'm I'm I'm beyond any Shadow of Doubt a man of Faith like Abraham where I can stand back back and say look I don't care what the symptoms are but I believe what God said about it I believe what the word is right I believe what god mentioned to me I can believe what God's spoken to me through thus sayith the Lord the spoken word in this hour right you come to the place where you say look I may not know what I got to say but I do know this I do know that I've come to the place where I was baptized and I'm and and I was baptized I died my old Nature's gone and I've come to the place where I'm going to be a possessor of God's Own spirit amen amen I am I I I know beyond any Shadow of Doubt that his own life the token life his own life has come down to live in my heart right amen and my malice my jealousy my my my contrariness my my my contrary nature it's dead and it's been buried in Christ and I'm going to stand in the fullness of life and if you want to look at Jesus Christ well shake my hand because you're going to see Jesus Christ in me you may see Daniel Martinez outwardly but Christ lives in my heart and that's what happens to every believer they come to the place where they don't it's no longer their own life they've died and Christ lives in them Christ manifests out of them that's how you can stand back and you can walk up look my sister was was was suffering with a little flutter in her heart and she says you know what uh uh she says I I I I don't know what to do I'm going to go to the doctor so she goes to the doctor and and the doctor says you know what doctor says it's going to happen to you one of two ways says one of two ways says yes he says it's either going to get worse or it's going to get better anybody would have figured that one out I could have told her that but and I'm not even the doctor but she she says well she walked her away kind of discouraged saying oh no so they said this could kill me this fluttering in my heart could kill me and she she walked away real sad and she's listening to to a minister her pastor preaching uh and her pastor says says you know he says you don't let that devil uh tell you how how how you know what what's on you right you believe what God said about it right so she started thinking and she said you know what there's nothing can pull me out of the place where I know Jesus died for Meen exactly nothing can move me from there amen and she says you know what that same price that he paid at Calvary for my sins to to to to save me right is the same price he paid to heal me all right so she said you know what she says I believe that by his stripes I'm Healed and that's what the word says about it I don't believe this and just then the little thing started again and oh my gosh she started getting weak and all this stuff she said what am I going to do now she says I don't believe it and she stood there and she says I don't believe it I believe God's word about it am and she kept saying I believe God's word about it amen she says it just it just like a poof started getting smaller it was gone I said how'd that happen how'd that happen where did it come out it's the same Faith Abraham did he says contrary to anything I believe what you say about it Lord am I believe what you say about it what your word says about it every promise in this word is yours right and if you believe God and you believe what his word says it's what he said about it that's the truth right amen so what happens you say well Satan still came back sure but you know what if you can believe that Calvary is real if you can believe he died for your sins you can believe he healed you right right amen you say well I got a I got a broken bone that won't menend you know I'm still you know I can't walk straight I can't I can't straighten my finger you know I have those troubles I broke my finger with wrestling with a horse yeah you know what I keep putting it there I keep pressing and I says God's word says I'm okay amen right you know I'll keep pressing pressing pressing pressing to believe what God's word says about it amen and you say is it it's a finished work that God gave you at Calvary he paid for it yep you see grieve not the Holy Spirit wherein you were sealed until the day of your Redemption when you were sealed in what did he seal in right yeah did he seal in your infirmities no right no he sealed you in the way he sees you and he sees you perfect he sees you righteous he sees you holy he sees you standing for his word believing what he said about it Beyond any Shadow of Doubt right what is it we believe what God Said when you accepted his holy ghost it's no longer you anymore it's him working in you amen it's him doing the manifestation you know what I I can't I can't see how how we can just let the devil just have his way you know brother BR talks about assurance you know how do you where do you get Assurance yeah you know where do you get Assurance when you could look at Calvary and say look I I I know beyond any Shadow of Doubt that I'm a possessor of the spirit of God that raised up Jesus Christ from the grave am if you're a possessor of the spirit of God that raised up Jesus Christ from the grave you are a possessor of the earnest right the earnest this you will bring your body into subjection of what he said you were what he says you are and he says you're perfect in his eyes amen so what is it we start looking you know if the Devil comes up and he says you know what he says I I I uh I got a I got a bone to pick with you look he says you're born in sin you're shaped in iniquity and you came to the world speaking lies right Adam lost he lost the title Dean right I have the quick claim de yeah your body is mine yeah I've got rights to your body you will go to the Grave you will die yeah you have sinned you've come short of the glory of God and the righteous judge stands up there and he says you know what our Lord Jesus Christ stands there and he says you know what he says you're right the evidence is stacked up against my bride oh yeah the evidence is stacked up against my Believers the Believers that believe in me there's a lot of evidence stacked up against them but you know what I paid the price for them I suffered the consequences you don't have no right you tricked them into doing these things but you have no right because they gave their life to me and they died at Calvary with me and now their life is hidden in me amen say you got to kill me to get to them right and you can't kill me again cuz I already died right amen amen so what happens you stand here as a redeemed bride that no matter what the cost the price is paid for you don't have to say I have any righteousness cuz you don't have any righteousness it's his righteousness it's his righteousness that lays upon you his righteousness that lays in you it's his righteousness that's inside of you and it comes flowing out because you are in the character of his name you got the Life of Christ coming out of you amen and it's a privilege to speak to someone that's got the Life of Christ coming out of them they can say amen I believe that that's mine I can claim that that's my truth right exactly I believe this this is my inheritance this is my portion I can stand and say Beyond any Shadow of Doubt that God gave me these things God gave me his promises he gave me his word amen hallelujah so what happens Christ comes back and says devil you ain't got no part here right not in the bride you can go to those ones that say oh I got a good pasture I got claims because you know I got I they believe my my uh my eternal security they believe my they believe they believe my denomination they believe they believe that Grandma was a good woman you know they believe they may have he may have all that yeah but you know what when you believe in Jesus Christ yes and Beyond any Shadow of Doubt his life now lives in you glory he don't got no right to that the token being applied the token in display brother uh I watched a a little clip they made a while back I don't know if you've seen it here but they made a little clip and they showed a little uh like a play of Egypt and some kids that were uh one kid was there and it struck my heart he says the coming of a prophet he says the coming of a prophet he says the manifestation of God With Us Again through the coming of a prophet means so much to me Dad and Dad say know son he says you got better eyes than me help me get this blood around the doorpost help me get it down to the lentils help me get it I want to be sure this things covered completely I don't want a single spot to showing right and they says well he says what do I do with this Le he says Chuck it get rid of it get rid of the Le I said what's the whole story was telling you the coming of a prophet God again in our in the on the scene showing himself to us revealing himself to us brings a whole new light on the matter Hallelujah and that means brings you to a place where you say look Beyond any Shadow of Doubt I believe God Amen I believe that his word is promised to me it's the I'm the possessor of what he gave me amen see the coming of a prophet is not not just for him coming to the prophet was to bring to you into a reality of God himself manifesting himself wed to come and dwell in you and if you'll just let yourself die to the things of the world and and the and and and and and do exactly what acts 238 says yep amen just repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the Holy Ghost you for the promise is unto you and unto them that are far off all the way down to my grandkids there the promis is unto them amen and we can stand back and we can say you and your household like the Paul spoke to the to the Jailer and says you and your household can be saved right if you'll apply the token and believe that God himself will come down and dwell in them amen but we recognize that even though you know like that arrogant guy was saying in the courtroom he says you know what let the record show the judge says wait a minute it's your record that's condemning you you have no record here that can be of any kind of uh of of something you can bring ah but it's not by our record we're going by we're going by what was already paid at Calvary let his record show right that he paid the price for us right and we don't have to pay it because you know Satan you you tricked me into this right but my life in him you can't trick me into it again amen amen hallelujah you know we stand Justified not Justified on our own works but in his Works amen right we look at the truth of this day and age and we say look what a privilege what a privilege people we are right right how many thousands this whole world's falling apart how many millions of people are out there that can't see what you have seen right that's right that have not even heard of what you've heard seems like I was looking through uh history on Pentecost could you imagine they never even mentioned the prophet William brand how did he get these great campaigns that went out around the whole world seven times how did it get just swept under the rug it's not for the world it's not for the great big nerve centers it's not for the for the for the N it's for you the elected bride that was destined and I say destined if you really look at it it was a work of God that brought you to this place it's a work of God that actually turn you around to bring you here to hear the word of God for this hour because if I you know you could have just taken one more step and missed it totally one more step and you'd have never seen it but God was watching over you to make sure that you are destined to hear the word of God for your hour that's right amen hallelujah how many appreciate God how many appreciate what he's done in our day and AG amen but we look at it you say well you know what we shouldn't have elected on elected Obama because Obama believes that the gays should be getting married to each other you know and and they don't believe in the sanctity of marriage the scripture says that it's going to be like the days of we are in the days of Sodom it's got to go that way I don't care if Romney would have gotten in it was going to go that way because it's that time right but you know what it's also time for this bride to say look I want to fulfill just like the Google cars coming to come into effect I want to fulfill what God wants me to be in this word I want to be that Faith person I want to be that man that'll take God at his word and say look I don't care I believe what God said about it I believe there's a Rapture here I believe I'm a possessor of this Rapture I believe me and my household will be saved I believe God's word is true amen right amen I don't care what the what what what what's going on around me I don't care if the fire's falling already I stand believing God's word to say look the Holy Ghost said he'd keep me the Holy Ghost said he'd keep me in this time and he bring me to a rapturing faith right amen how is it because it's a happy time right you know it's a very solemn time y mhm you know what everybody that is entering into death doesn't go in there joking and having fun no no if I was on death row I'd be S sitting there saying oh Lord am I right am I ready say something I got to get right you know is there something if I'm sitting a death roll and the and the the guest Chambers waiting for me or The Gallows I'd be sitting there saying oh my gosh you know few I'll be looking at the clock saying oh a few more minutes yeah a few more hours you know what every one of us every one of us we rejoicing within saying Oh Praise the Lord that he's he's he's come and he's dwelling in us he's showing us these truths he's manifesting himself but you know what with judgment hanging over this whole world this world is falling apart brother Brown preached okay if this judgment hanging over us it's still a solemn time that we saying we got to go back to his word got to listen to those tapes got to see where we stand in the amen for it's a solemn time it's a real serious time it's nothing it's it's nothing to to to to take lightly right right you know what I you know truthfully I got a satellite dish okay satellite dish the only thing I use that crazy thing for is to watch the news I don't know what we're paying such a big bill for you know I could probably get the news some other way but you know what the truth is it's a solemn time you should be in the word right that's the that's every spare moment you have spend it SE seeking God's will for your life spend every moment of your waking hours saying look Lord what do you want me to do how do you want me to respond how do you want me to live where do you want me to be why do you want me to say to someone why do you want me to say to that over there is there someone else that you want that I'm touching that I'm holding that I work with that needs to know about this truth is there some way you want me to man show someone God's word is true really think about it it's solom it's just like being a death row right right but it's not our death right right it's their death row and you're trying to help amen amen glory let's go before the Lord in prayer stand to our Hallelujah we recognize thanks be to God Amen you know I was looking at the blood speaking K in the in the in in in the book in The Book of Genesis Cain's blood spoke
