first time you're a visitor and you get a welcome glad to have you you know you don't get one when you come because you're just part of us we don't have anything to join up with we don't have anything to do with just a little group of people that tries to serve the Lord and doing that we welcome you but then you come this afternoon you just part of us so that's the way things go the way we believe it okay good to have all of our visitors with us and thank the Lord for you coming okay if you'd like turning the scriptures let's go to Philippians 2 and we'll just read a little bit in the scriptures Philippians 2 now remember the Lord willing this coming Wednesday brother sheddy from India will be with us ministering viruses coming Wednesday then on the 30th will be brother yesiree animals that write the 30th of this month then then on August the 6th will be brother Quin from Ireland and on August the 9th will be brother I called him brother LAN LAN that's not his name but he's from the Philippines so in this time of the year because of the Routh meetings and things where they bring in a lot of the missionaries come in and have them count meeting tonight we just basically schedule services because that way we get to bring in these brothers and let a minister to you and you know to do and helping had to have some back that have been away and it's heard our moment ago that sister Monica was sick so remember her she was traveling back and and I'll remember all of these any other announcements I do they miss some some work but let's just pray and go right into the word of the Lord father we thank you for an opportunity of gathering today and we thank you for your love in your grace and your guidance and to us thank you for Calvary because that's the main part of our lives and we thank you for all of these things we ask you now that you would just come and be among us not as an recorder of our actions and lives and thoughts but yet that you would speak to us by your love in your grace because it's my we've gathered to hear and truly we believe faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of the Lord so we ask you to just have your way bless and guide each one in order to forgive our sins because we want to stay clean in you and just have your way open the eyes of our understanding to thy word that we may walk therein we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Philippians 2 if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels of Mercy enough there be any of these fulfill you my joy that you be like-minded and once like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind okay let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind I notice mine mine mine - keeps constantly stating it let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus now what did it do what it was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the - of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross now look what the mind of Christ caused to happen to Jesus Christ so what was do we expect it for ourselves alright wherefore God has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee shall should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and we'll do the life partner and that ever tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father and then you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've been talking lately about to the church and trying to bring out a few things of understanding and trying to see and comprehend God in his ways because that's what we're supposed to be doing you know we come to church to learn of God what is the purpose of coming we come to see each other well we got houses to do that in we come to do this we can go down to Walmart and see each other because 90 times you're going to see 90% of people in one Walmart somewhere across the United States they ever close them out it's going to be bad because it won't be nowhere to go but everybody runs to Walmart to visit but yet see we we are talking about the mind of God what about your God is your God real that's the question I've asked is he just a myth or is he a thought is he some idea that you have um you know you have the groups that believe that the good thoughts of mankind is God and the bad thoughts is the devil well let's just put you in a mind of thought but that will not clear up and give to me the understanding that I believe because the Bible speaks constantly of the mind of God well wouldn't it be nice to have mind of God then why not why couldn't we have the mind of God because on Corinthians 2 and 16 1st Corinthians he says we have the mind of Christ the ever born again believer now the mind is not this part of year we think this is mine we think this is called brain you know the mass we think that is the mind that the Bible is speaking of course it let this mind be in you alright we don't believe in taking a brain transplant right they say that will never be done I hope they don't I hope they do one of these days that I can get one it I can think better maybe but the mind see is the part of you that's doing that thinking right now and considering things and even your eyes doesn't work without your mind everything works from the mind but that's just your mechanical brain it's causing you to do things your mind is really what you are you know you are you what you're thinking your thinking is your mind that's you that's the part within you that's doing the thinking all right and see in that we know by having the new birth as we called it the born-again experience that Paul would be saying in the right order that the life that I now live after he's born again I live by the faith of the Son of God well then that way that is bringing into as he's talking about the mind as we read here let this mind that was in Christ being you well if that's not meaning in other words if the Bible means anything is telling you to let that happen or life is telling you to let that happen it means it can happen or else why would you say let this mind that was in Christ being you all right see then the mind is the part of you the thinking mechanism that causes it and that's what keeps you alive while you're asleep and all of the things through all of the great way that God made us to operate all right but I want the mind of Christ don't you well then we can have that mind of Christ by the new birth by born-again experience by accepting Jesus Christ as our Savior dying to ourselves and accepting him and believing his word then see he can give us a part of his own life which is not in this brain I wish that there was a way like I said I'm truthful that if they could take my brain and take it out and throw away the things I don't like and leave me the parts that are good I would be glad to do that because you know that would be our i but that wouldn't be it because if something else is motivating that something within us which is deeper than just our thinking just as our brain is recalled see then the mind as Paul was saying let this mind be in you and he said if that mind is in you what are you going to be over in the Corinthians you're going to be a new creature a new creation in Christ Jesus honor by accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior then he can come in and live in you and coming back out of you then would that not be the mind of Christ would that not be the new birth as we call it the baptism of the Holy Ghost whatever terminologies salvation whatever terminologies or words you'd like to be using see then you could understand that the Bible is really in simplicity explaining the fact that you and I need a new birth that's why Nicodemus see the first message Jesus preached in the world was what to Nicodemus right the first sermon the Lord Jesus preached was the nicotine what do you say you must be born again now Nicodemus couldn't understand that because he first he thought oh I got to go back to my mother and be born again he said you know he thought that was the way he was speaking and Jesus said if I explain earthly things to Europe you can't understand my simple language of saying you're surely not going to understand heavenly things but he was simply speaking of the fact that on the day of Pentecost in the Bible those disciples went to the upper room and they dwelled in that upper room and when they did the Holy Ghost fell upon them over there in the book of Acts and they came forth as new creatures in Christ Jesus having the mind of God now come on get what I'm saying having the mind of God not a brain transplant they wouldn't want it was that brain is just something that's transmitted it doesn't even do it see you don't see with your eyes you see from your heart as the Bible calls it the heart is the center of man are the mind of God or the mind for the person so that mind of trying to get your thoughts that looking at the mind see then you can see by God coming and living in you by the new birth then he can give you his own mind then Paul said it's not I live with the Christ that liveth in me the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God what about a great mind of great things at all of this world you've got all of the people of the world all the minds you've got all of them you know the Einsteins and the great brains of the world but where do they get their thinking from you got great brains of people in all of these countries you know that that are real very intelligent until it's almost um it's almost impossible for not do just about anything today can travel through outer space they can do all kind of things they can move objects they can do everything because that there is a god right okay so you say well I don't believe in God well then you're believing you're the god then you said well you're just crazy to believe in God well I don't want to believe in you and see if you can tell me there is no God you're greater than he is right so I certainly don't want to listen to you to think about you being God be that way I believe in the fact that God can give mankind he's wrong thinking it can give mankind his own word he can deliver and give understanding to us of all of the things that we have need of because he can give us his mind you can change our way of thinking is that a better way of saying it it can cause us to stop thinking wrong and start thinking right why because it works from the inside that's where most people have salvation as an outward experience they go to church they do this they pay tithe they they do this they do that they dress the clothes they do all kind of things they do everything to try to show where they are but then they don't really see Jesus Christ well why not I thought the whole purpose of mankind was to the fact that God could come and dwell with us and then take us to where he is I thought that was the goal of all mankind I thought everybody whether you believe your God is Buddha into Muslims whatever you think it is a totem pole or or any kind of a God why would you believe in a god if you're not going to believe that there's things for here after the old Indian with a happy hunting-grounds and the different thing that everybody's always believed in some other way you know of something after this world because I guess we finally figured it out we're all dying you know when you look at these young kids and boy they're happy they're joyous they're they're doing I mean they got the energies and and they're running and all like that but just give them a little time and they'll start feeling old the more time older you feel you know why because you're going to the grave well is that all a lot to just come into the world and live and be good even and do good is that all there is to it is there something beyond this world is there a life Hereafter and if there is not a lot Hereafter what good is alive we're living through if there's not something you're after why would we worry about what we're doing now and see what I'm trying to get you to see is what we need is we need to get born again and let that mind start working not up here and let it come in here and start controlling from the inside and then we find out the mind of crisis very simple then is to accept Jesus Christ the fact that what he done for us because if we believe in a god that's to you now that's not to me if we believe in a God surely what would be the purpose what would be our thoughts about God well I believe in Jesus I believe he exists amen what do you believe that Jesus was Almighty God now in the world today see most of the religious realm believe that Jesus was a second person or a third person where would you get that in the Bible there's no such thing in the Word of God jesus said unless you believe that I am he now is that scripture that unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sin come on the Bible says there is no other name under heaven given whereby men must be saved except in the name of Jesus Christ why wouldn't we want the opportunity to be able to accept Christ as our Savior why would we not desire to want to know about God I mean from a child I've always had that desire always had to desire me from a childhood to want to know about God let me know I'm not saying I was a goody-goody good little boy I ain't saying that I was just like the rest of you all right but yet it was the desire in my heart to want to know about God and in doing that I believe that brings him to us if you'd want to know about God why would he not come to you why would you not come to you when he wouldn't come to somebody else it didn't want nobody right to our desires of ourselves through our mind our being of what we are has a lot to do with the salvation to be given unto us why would we not desire to know more about God why would we not desire to want to know his name why would we not desire to want to know how really is or is your God just a myth or a thought or a spirit as we'll go by in the spirit of the scriptural say you know God is a spirit amen I agree with that but then it says he's a being then I go without Jesus have you seen me you saying about you see the Bible gives a correct answer to our thinking if we'll just open her eyes to listen because he made away why would he create us doesn't remember what we read there you go from Philippians to Colossians and read them together and you'll find that God has always wanted to dwell with us and to do and what was done through Jesus Christ was an example of what he wants us to be though we read there in the scripture that then put as I said put it with caution being in the form of God for means the word in Moorthy is where it's coming from the word form in which means to change or to bring something from part that you can't see bring it into the open to where you can see it was not that what Jesus Christ did not he come to reveal God did he not come to make known God to mankind we see then why wouldn't that want to be our desire you mean you have a salvation if you don't want to give to somebody else I've always told you that the day God gave me salvation I tried to give it away what about you you understand what I mean by that I I no wonder I don't want to give it away that I don't have it no I don't mean it that way I mean what I'm going to do I want you to have the salvation I have so don't worry about giving it out you're not going to run out of it what a little bit God has given me if I give it to somebody it angled to hinder him he can do what he still to his work you see let the mind that was in Christ the Christianity is not just a change of thought you know you go to church and you get in a new group then you go from that group to another group in this group to that group and there was this religion to that religion because you're just trying to find some thought that you can associate with no I'm talking about a living reality I'm talking about a point to work that there's not a question as to whether or not God is real did we talk about it you know the theories and ideas of mankind how that could always say you know that that they say well we were just a Polliwog and we laid over on one side and grow the leg you know and then through millions of years you v over on the other side and grew another leg and well you know I've always said on the theory of evolution talking to somebody just the other day about it why is it that there had been any changing in the last hundred years or 200 years or 500 years or thousand years basically you look the same as they did 2,000 years ago right 5,000 years ago we have a chain when growing new legs and growing on new parts we'll see that makes the theory silly because God created man the way he wanted him but he gave man everybody sitting here today has one thing that is a valuable part of your life and that's your mind the inward part I hope you have following me down to where am i the inward part of you is your mind not is that brain that's matter the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart well now you don't think with it something is heard come on you know what I mean something gizzard is a flexible part called a heart you don't think with the heart you think with the center part of you which is the real you your soul your being what you are that's what's causing you to think that's why the animal the he has all the parts that we have right the dog a cat they have the parts we have but they cannot now they can work to a certain degree and you can train them you can make them talk and but yet no it's not to make them any different they're an animal the human was made on a higher form but it is made in the image of God he was given a soul a part of you everybody sitting here today has that part of you that if you allow it it can lead you to God but if you don't allow it it'll lead you straight out into the world and the things of the world because that's just normal doing why don't you listen to that inward part of you talking sometimes in learners I've always told you we do a lot of pray and that's wonderful it's great to pray that's wonderful we should pray the Bible says pray without ceasing but now that doesn't mean that we go in a corner somewhere shut down and don't never do nothing but pray how do you pray without ceasing you keep your mind on God in a powerful attitude of your mind desiring to serve Him and that way you can pray without ceasing but you know what we do a lot of times we do too much talking with the mouth we need to shut up sit down and listen to see what God wants to tell us my prayer was me praying to him you might find out he wants to talk to you you mean God wants to talk to me you know the reason he don't talk to us because we don't answer the telephone you understand what I mean we've been without a telephone down our home phone for a month and then I said would be another month because everybody around there there's something happening they've just gone crazy and they don't know when they're going to get them fixed well you know what it's all crossed up messed up but you know eventually if they ever do get it back it'll talk and work why because it was made for that and God made you and I to be able to talk to us about that what's your purpose for being here what is life of man and what do you do it is for God to talk to you he wants to talk to us he wants to fellowship with us but we don't want to fellowship with him and he gave us the ability to contact him we used to when we first got a telephone in the Guild's valaria you know that's kind of backward woods country anyway but when we first got a telephone we and I know daughter you are not old enough team understand it and you wouldn't your life is it's all about we had eight people on one party line that's all we could get we could not get anything else we had eight people we you never picked up the phone that somebody wasn't on it because every one of them was connected together whoever 1:00 in the morning you might be able to pick up the phone and be able to call somebody because there was eight people with no way to get any other phone my point is what the line was always busy I kept picking up the phone one night and this boy and this girl was talking and they were just talking you know and they'd come and they will you say something i said something lies and you said i wouldn't put up with about an hour and finally i said hey boy it got real quiet I said son would you allow me to use the phone for just a minute then I said then when I get through you can call that girl and talk to her all night and tell her how much you love her and everything we know what a second I had to follow because they knew you know hey it wouldn't be easy it was open but you know God's never busy he talks to you and you don't realize it you realize he fellowships with you every day and you're thinking and you don't pay him no attention I never heard God talking to me you know why cause you're blabbering all the time don't you think you got it figured out and you're running the show and you're not doing it why don't you shut up and sit down to listen to him talk sometime you might find out he's real you might find out he can call ya but I just don't believe God talk to people the more where'd you get that idea from you never got it out of the Bible joy to be in the Bible that he don't want to talk to you I'll show you now where he wants to talk to you but it's the wrong way you get over the songs like we were the other day where he says my thoughts are not your thoughts that my ways are not your ways that my thoughts are so much higher than your thoughts until your thoughts are not even in the picture see that's what we want we want our thoughts to try to transmit to God to make him be what we wanted to be until accepting what he is and how he's trying to publish it with us what was the purpose of creation of mankind I mean come on are we're a little bit above the Polliwog deal you know a little bit about what we don't believe in Bobby why we've got Chris well if he created us what he created far come on if he created you what he creates you for he created you for fellowship you don't never I know people don't think like crazies I do I'm glad of it would be a bad world but you know when I wake up in the middle of the night I'm not one that I'll get up and walk through the house I'm not going to lay there all night I can't sleep on Drive I counted Shiva and then we come up with great things you know and we say well now we're not supposed to count sheep we're supposed to talk to the shepherd and I've been praying for four hours and hadn't heard a word get up walk through the house change your mind go get you something to drink and sit down and say Lord why did you wake me did you want somebody to talk to you don't ever to because you want somebody to talk to Lord he said you sound like that to God you believe in is real that's what I'm trying to get you to see that's exactly what I believe I believe that God that I believe in is real he's a lot more real than I am he created me so then he wants to fellowship with us talk to us communicate with us not surprised you know but I've never heard audible voices well some people hear him and some don't but what's the difference inaudible voice in an inward voice speaking to you he let the mind that was in Christ be in you we've covered it we'll make you a new creature a new creation it'll bring you to new thoughts and new ideas and in all new ways new life will also bring you to a place that you can realize how really is you never felt the presence of the Lord you've never had that contact maybe as other people maybe have but does that mean he's not real that's our problem we don't believe he's real like I said the other day then we tell our children about Santa Claus and they wind up know more about Santa Claus and they know about Jesus Christ of course in our days it was known more about Daniel Boone's than to know about Jesus Christ without energy these kids now don't food with Daniel Boone right and we know who Daniel Boone is you know hardly know who George Washington is but they know all about all of these Power Rangers and and great things and and all of them if you notice all of them is trying to deal in a supernatural realm well but the Christian wants to stay in some natural Ram when I think about him in a supernatural ring when I think about him as being real when I think about him as that he would like to place his mind the purpose of him coming was to give his life the purpose of Jesus Christ was to give his life in the Old Testament there was no way that that life could come and live in them David would cry out return unto me the joy of thy salvation but he turned right around and go to the bed with Bathsheba because he couldn't stay right he had nothing to be able to keep him under control he was living just in an animal flesh form because that's what we are without the new birth just another animal higher form yet when Jesus Christ came and paid the price and died released his life that it could come back upon you and I that would be able to give us an inward being bring us to an inward thoughts something that's real and give us his mind let us think histology you know we talked about Moses you realize that Moses caught the thought from God he went out and said let there be fleas and flies and frogs and cover the nation with him excuse me let the nation with his words from his mouth that God had spoke to his heart and truly we ought to be able to believe more than he did excuse me we ought to be able to think more about God and how real he is because there was no way that he could enter in to Moses the way had not been made he could not bring his mind he could enter his brain and talk to him but he couldn't bring his mind to the inward part of Moses that's why you didn't have the salvation back there like that but when Jesus Christ came he delivered up his own life that he could come back and live in you and I didn't truly then Paul's right he said to what the life that I now live I live by the faith why don't you try talking to God sometimes once you try fellowshipping with him you might find out he wants to talk to you you might find out this old boys not too silly to wake up in the middle of the night and say Lord what do you want you're trying to tell me something I've done that many times and there's people President didn't know woke up in the middle of the night and somebody get on my heart and I start praying for him come find out there's something going wrong somebody needed your priority somebody might need yours he said well then why don't God go ahead and do it why did Jesus stand there who was the Lord of the harvest right you agree he was the god of the harvest he said pray that the god of the harvest will send forth laborers and he was the god of the harvest what was he saying pray that I'll do what I said I'll do in the word but I'm allowing you to how something to do with it salvation is living for others it's not selfishness and that's like I said if you wait a minute you find out you get a good case of salvation you'll find out you want to give it away you understood what I've said in there a moment ago you want to give it to somebody else you want them to have the experience that you have within your hearts and don't worry about it you can't give it away you ain't going to run out don't worry about it the more you give away the more God is going to give to you what about it let the mind that was in Christ be in you it'll make you a new creature it'll bring in to you his thoughts and his ways and his doing and to change you from him to that a lot of people are afraid of religion because they're afraid it'll make them calls and do things what are you afraid of would you just get morning again forget the whole thing why aren't you afraid of God and religion well fanatics go crazy will tell me about all em out there's already gone crazy zit that wasn't talking about salvation right well we don't want to get too fanatical about religion why you mean you don't love him that much there's my final talk you mean you don't love him enough to want him to use you to talk to somebody else this is not all for the preacher to do not all for the Deacons to do or this isn't it out of the other it's for everybody you know pastors don't beget sheep sheep beget sheep right Shepherds they don't beget chief they just take care of the sheep the sheep's what to get sheep you understand who you have a part to do with it you got a job to do when you become a Christian whether you're male female child or whatever you are you have a mind coming in you that you want to tell somebody else about you want them to have the experience that you had it's what brother Dale I've just never had no experience like that maybe that much well maybe you were tried I'm silly kind of crazy but the Bible says try me that right he said see whether I'll do that scripture we talk about tithing or something like that you know what the Bible says try me said I'll pour out your windows in heaven I've told you of that one little point this that is I put this challenge before Christians ever since I've been ministering for almost 50 years now he said but I brother Dale I don't play tide what I want to know why because of all the promises that goes with it why would you want all the promise I've offered it to you you pay times one year from an honest and sincere point of just being right about it you pay your tithe one year at the end of that year if you're not better off financially than you was when you started come and tell me I'll give you ever time of it back I'll give you ever dime you paid the ear I'll give it back to you I made that challenge for 50 years I've never paid one dime because if you're honest you'll be even true you'll find out it'll work that's just being a Christian that's just a Christian to do that and live right and do right it's our obligation as a Christian to try to help others and see and do why because we have the mind of Christ come on brother hello musicians listen but you're saying the mind that was in Christ let it be in you see what it'll do sit down kids and just think about it you don't have to be odd and weird to be a Christian and when you tell me about it I'll tell you about it you young kid just be a Christian at schooling and live a Christian life and thoughts before others and just you know you don't have to be no holy possum look like this and walk around you know and everything I'll just be yourself but just be good and be
