========================================

start writing on them you need to orient them just like this like this horizontally horizon write your name on them and stick them over there in the corner Ernie they're just resting on time oh all right yeah go ahead write your name write your name on this thing okay write your name on it that way you'll have it and it'll be oriented correct other few things we need to write on it today first thing you need right on it is right on whatever side you can start on make sure because if you flip it over we're gonna be talking backwards so whatever are you gonna start put rapture and then you we're gonna orient this way okay rapture and going this way so this is going to be the last week to the Jews we're not gonna be here but this is where it's all going to wind up and happen and all okay this is a rapture so the rapture of the Gentile Church actually put rector of brought our Gentile bride because if you don't because right here the Jews take a rapture got it you take a raptor in the middlee so put rapture Gentile church or ever how you want to say bride you can't really say bride but you can't say bride okay because it is the bride using our bride anymore so you can put wrap through the bride if you want to are the catching away yeah and with this chart here if you still got this chart that we had one long long time ago it's right there see where brother Graham talks about unity that's the rapture raptured Saints right there okay that's gonna be us yeah you cut right through but yes you can do that that one identifying you as what's going up yeah my right right so we're gonna deal with this week right here everybody got that this is the week one building right here this is the last week and I think we proved already by the Bible by prophets message that there is one week left after the rapture because remember when we were looking at this chart we see the Gentile rapture the 1260 days the two prophets prophesied and then they take a rapture and there's no way to fulfill the 6-volt purpose in that first three and a half years and go back out that we've covered it and covered and covered it I hope you got that that's right that's the six fold purpose is in the Bible and it must be fulfilled so according to the six fold purpose it must be fulfilled there's got to be somebody here to fulfill it we're not here Buddhist virgins are nine right given a lot for the gospel during this time for the Jews this is their last week can't be last three-and-a-half years Daniel's 70th week everybody got that yes you heard what I said its 70th week there's one week left according to the Bible and the prophets message okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to walk through this week and show a lot of the Bible what's going to take place and I want you to write that down as we go through on your on your paper I'll stop right then before I want you to now what I want you to do is is over here in the very end right where that last mark is right here put year 2026 year 2026 right here at the end the 70th week the end of that 70th week but year 2026 and we're going to explain that but I want you to put that there alright and how we get that is is where that brother Branham said in 1977 would be the 70th Jubilee since the beginning of Jubilees according to Leviticus 25 8 now according to Leviticus 25 8 if you'll read your Bible and it's 49 years not 50 what do you know all right and we'll cover that butter let me read it to you laughing one left you here let's just wait because what he said in not paragraph 2 15 of the 17 to 13 he talks about 1977 God knows my heart I never noted till yesterday the 1977 is the Jubilee same amount of time right now to give Israel and everything it's a hen okay alright so now turn your paper over on the back and put 7 d + 49 earth set yeah 70 if you believe 70 plus 49 all right add that up well put 19 sets already put in 1977 plus 49 I'm in 1977 I'm thinking about 10 minutes ahead so let me buy cousin Betty 1977 plus 49 Kohi from brother I'm predicted he didn't prophesy he predicted these things would take place and the 1977 will be the 70th Jubilee okay making for one seventy times seven 490 all right here's where everybody goes haywire they talk to rapture is gonna take place in 77 but that's not like Robert said obviously it's not what he said cutting with Hillary but if you take 1977 and at 49 years because if you add 50 years you're going into the 71st you believe everybody got that 77 was the 70th few bellator how many of you remember how many times that we've looked at this study and laugh over how many times brother Brown talks about a lap oh man in 1970 Lisa's big lap over those Church ages laugh over and he said everything laps over God doesn't it doesn't a brother stop them and then begin something else right he said in the Bible that they go out in 400 years right how many years was it four and thirty God give them 30 years of grace so we've been living under 49 years or close to it now of grace since 1977 something did happen in 1977 that was the 7s Jubilee the getting ready to go home now it took us since then it took us almost the heck that length of time hey how long 20 26 from now 10 years just 10 years from now would be 2026 now I want to also warn you I'm not set in days I'm just telling you what we're going to do by the prophets message and we're going to plug some numbers in and see how they fit that all right sorry brother I think we might know thee not the day or hour but we couldn't know the ears cry and as the Wayne said and month so we go we might get close okay some 20 20 states and their brother Dale fries tips like I said in 1974 because you got a read from brother Brown said he said it's the 7 if you believe since the beginning of do you believe according Leviticus 25 8 a minute 25 8 is 7 7 is 49 because truly the millennium is the Jubilee to the Jews remember we went through the chart you still gotta go by these few beliefs the times to pass over the unleavened bread keep going trumpets Tabernacles Feast of Pentecost all the seven feasts that we talked about guys I'm gonna go weigh that with them because they're his feast all right and that's why we as Gentiles has been looking at this Daniel 70 weeks through a Gentile life but now since we've begun this study we've been trying to look to the Jewish I three way through a Jewish time we went through the calendar with a little wheel that yo most of these got who a wheel they chose to feast days all right well those feast days won't be done away with those these days to me they're markers they're a marker of time and they're set exactly the way they're supposed to be the lamb was to be killed it Passover right do you think you next day was unleavened bread first route then Pentecost Pentecost comes exactly 50 days after the resurrection whoa that was set two thousand years before Jesus was even on the earth it told you when he was coming back in the people right in the people it was already foretold on the day of Pentecost I want to pour out my spirit in Joel's about four months but it went on for that that's what I've been reading the book of Acts again and that's what Peter said Peter goes straight to Joel Joel says I pour out my spirit upon hopefully young men see dreams on them civilians know that he was in the Bible we just had not have her eyes opened enough to be able to see that and then we had a prophet come along and he explained it like I said before he caught all the loose ends together and put everything back together and that's who we're you know what some of you are watching some of that tub on the internet which is really good but they they have their they have their loose ends they have their loose ends but they do have tribute because what they're doing is very explaining you finally the way I understand it they're explaining it by that Jewish calendar and that's what the 70 ways that's the problem we've always had we've never looked at it as a Jewish time and we're just trying to plug in with brother and said yeah well his brother around and said we can see we're going to see later on that there was two or three schools of thoughts come out of the same book and most people in the message don't even read this book they said he made so many mistakes so they just don't read this book they just take what he said in 1963 well that's just compensable in the morning yeah it's just it's just horrible they took this message and broken into pieces yeah so but they're it's true but you have to look see I start on the front what that mean what that means Jewish so this is a Jewish book but the Gentile prophet remember had to bring the message because there's not a Jewish prophet only at this town they will be once that Jewish probably going to do what do you think they're gonna do over there then up him P prophets and I'm gonna go to Israel go went out that for a lot that he was wrong here but name this blue come straight please if you like she ever straight to lie down did John ever straight the last year the light brown the brother brown straighten out John the Baptist another he came to restore it's a restoration message so I promise you the fifth coming of lives is not going to get over there and go well now that probably missed it right here and he missed it here they won't believe him they'll have it right just like we have it right now okay so take your room thank you paper ditch paper but I tell them to do is make sure that you when you start one place make sure you put rapture of the church or rapture of the bride because remember now what's your terminology the church the nominal Church does not go through does not go interaction if I got that Baptist Methodist Pentecostal randomized that are in justification sanctification do not want a rapture right here that's where their food the devil's food them thinking that if they don't go in the rapture here but they're gonna go in the rapture over here they miss it completely remember they the Left Behind series there's a one rapture and then they get saved and there's another coming you know no no and there's not seven years of tribulation either okay only serve it's what we see now we're going to go through it real slow and I'll show you according to the Bible we'll see what what the Bible says about but make sure you mark one place and put rapture of bride our rapture of us as Regina Sam or Gentile rapture it's not a Jewish rapture now you can write right here you can write rapture of 144,000 don't put Jews rapture comes and I love Jews it's rapture of 144,000 because what are they gonna do they can prophesy twelve hundred and sixty days so this is the rapture right here all right then right here on this side put 2026 that's what we've been talking about that's 1977 plus 49 because if you put 77 plus 50 that's why I'm telling you we're going to try and get this thing down where we know one thing for sure we're going to know when the 70th week ends and all we got to do is back it up seven years all we gotta do is back it up seven years and we'll know when our rectory will say because if we if we have a mark we know that seventy weeks of Daniel begins 445 BC alright we've been over and over and over it 445 BC is when it begins there has to be an ending date somewhere okay there's been an ending date the date that it ends because seventy weeks are determined 490 years is all they're gonna get okay yeah now let's go back and talk about the lap over remember there's a lamp over you say well where's the lamp over over here God's calling Israel and a nice right man good job he's getting them ready put him back in the homeland and win 1947 48 47 right keep it on you charge did they fried the ground Ruth he put even you know tightest Jesus would kill maybe 30 times coming 80 70 well that it was over in the church ages God was still dealing with a little bit but after finally in eighty seventy then cut off because the scripture says it right all right so now right here brother Brandon being the Prophet knows not to start that you don't start to 70th week but the lap over time God is beginning to deal with you and me and the Jeebs getting back in the homeland so you know you can put 1947 or 48 right there cuz right here Jews returning this is what brother Brown degree right here Jews returning right here so you can put in 1948 49 right left so God's dealing you say is he dealing with him he's got to get him in her homeland before he can even deal with all right yes gotta get him in the homeland before he can deal with so that's when that raptures gonna take place though the Gentile church is going up right Joel she'll have these if you don't want really like I said before rapture name on them that way of taking when they're not upside down this way and put them over in that corner and keep them I'll try to keep mom from throwing them away cleaning them up don't actually just leave them over there and how I'm in a climbing cabinet somewhere that way I make sure thank you I just will they run all out first you know Yankee boys never never took a handkerchief with them they always wore the thing around their neck they had one blow over totally so they just let her go out to them cactus so anyway that's right that's right so anyway we haven't learned at least one thing wanna kevanna again can we get my go-to subject now so take this give-give Josephine but I want you to keep up with this and remember it's horizontal so we're gonna start filling this in from the rapture of the Gentile Church okay but right 2026 here because we got a backup seven years and start the 70th week then all right if 1977 brother Brown since 1977 was was the 70th Jubilee since the beginning of what is seventy seventy times seven 490 all right okay so God's giving us 49 years of grace but he is going to stop it one day especially this time all right but watch remember now if you go one more year you broke everything you went into your 71st Jubilee there's only seven sevens that was for nothing you got it so what's gonna happen is it's sure there's still time gonna go on in the Millennium but that 70th Jubilee I believe in 1977 like Roosevelt said God came down and started revealing himself to the Gentiles to the Jews impartial here's that one saying they're not gonna get their opponents till the two province at the ground but listen the new prophets have to be right here now even if you go past 2026 they've got to be able mature they ain't going to twelve your old Jew boy runs well don't hang that with Zhu Tao there's not gonna walk out though I start believing us it's gonna be on a tour person so that those two people are on the earth now God's got to be dealing with them you say well how do we know it really doesn't matter does they're nothing to us nothing they cannot start it though if I was them I'd be over here they have a church-going lazy bunch of people okay get out of the way cuz we got to get out of the way let's go back and come on this thing we're the only thing holding up the Jews take the rapture but remember you still got to look at these days it's alright 2026 over here and then we're going to back up and start you see what the Lord has for us like I said before it do not say I'm setting a date I'm not but I'm just throwing it out there so that we can see that it is closer they would think yes it is closer than we think okay and we'll look at it truly then now because 2026 means something even in the Jewish calendar 2026 means a lot it's been brought up a lot if you watch on the internet that Kingdom seven kingdoms son seven seven seven he does a real good job bringing that out so we'll look at it and what we'll do is we'll take just one brother brown brother Brown took what your eyes Smith Clarence Larkin he read all those people hey he's not the first one to come up with the Alpha knee Scofield in 1900 put it in his Bible that is Kaneesha theophany okay and aloe goddess and all that so we see that but remember he was trying to tarry class Marvin was Trent area your eyes met with Trinitarian they had their problems but it's got to come to a purity of the message where we brother Adam ties those loose ends back together and then it makes that beaut picture yeah I am so now let's go to revelations 11 and the first thing we're gonna write on our paper is ad right here in just second this is revelations 11 that was given to me a reed like into a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God now I got to finish early so I can go strap William up so don't let me go past about 20 after rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty two months what forty two times thirty twelve hundred and sixty half of seven three and a half years okay so he's fixin to tell us something here what 42 months 42 times thirty don't make me look a little ones down one's own bill there's only 30 day months in Jewish calendar 42 months times 30 is what twelve hundred and sixty days before some temple drop what and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days he just explained what he was talking about alright clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemy and female worth him he must be in he must in this manner be killed so write on your first part right here from the right to the church put 1260 days two prophets all right okay so I'm going 60 days to prophets prophesy 1260 day or what 42 months 42 Jewish months got it okay now got it these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of the prophecy none who shut who shut them for how long thank you he's already done it one time these things he'll do it again so it's got to be the spirit of Elijah on somebody and we know for a fact that the Jews say the Jews read Malachi 4 and they say before the great congrat from dead Lord I'm gonna send you Elijah the Prophet they know what lies has got to come before the Messiah comes they just missed that one and they're thinking he's the one that's why they set that cup of the line shut down every time they have their their meal they are not never come to have the meal with and they have the Passover whatever the end of their time their last feast is they said to cut down take a look out the door they look this way look this way they look for Elijah because they know he's gotta come walking into Jerusalem they go back and they put the cup up and say until next year or whatever that isn't in their Jewish language until next year so they know one thing for sure he'll I just got come and they read the Old Testament so if this from this this spirit of Elijah comes on a man and he says they won't rain for three and a half years until I called for it they don't know one thing's for sure he's got the spirit of Elijah he's just like the one in the Old Testament okay because remember the Jews are not reading New Testament they're in Old Testament those two prophets are going to be just like Paul's they're gonna bring that Old Testament alive to those Jews okay cuz remember the Jews don't believe Jesus was on the side right they're gonna have to teach 144,000 that Jesus was the Messiah and have power over waters to turn them to blood and everybody said well okay that was they think well inna know who turn the water to blood holds in that slip the card holding our River into blood so when that happens they're gonna go Moses's back most of their lives alright and smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will all they gotta do is one speaking and eleven then when they shall have finished their testimony the Beast that ascends it out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them okay somewhere in here is what we're looking at this is a trap for the hundred forty-four thousand because they're gonna be killed what their prophecy is over their prophecies over right here right here the prophecies done right and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which Pierce is called Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was crucified and they have the people in kindred and tongue of nations shall see their dead bodies through television CNN Fox News all those people they're gonna what see the nations shall see their dead body gotta be peek through photograph video all right three days and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put into graves why what they're gonna do all they men they rejoice they make merry send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt from the earth and after three and a half days the spirit alive from God entered into them and they stood up on their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither now that happened in Revelation 4:1 brother Branham said that's when the rapture of the bride revelations for one bride goes up he says cometh hither all right now he's saying the same thing come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them then there was a great earthquake tenth part of the city fell and the earthquake was slain of men seven thousand and the remnants were afraid and give glory to God of heaven the second wool was passed behold third woe cometh quickly now what is a third world third world war not the tribulation because while this is going on here is going to be tribulation thank you yeah that's when that's when all that swing well I don't know if that's one Russia bombed us because you gotta have to worry about one thing if one start throwing one bone nose is gonna throw in another one that's gonna happen right here so you can say they they don't bomb I still hear but now once the earthquake happens in in California all the nations are just gonna pile into the United States and take over because because it'll be such a destruction until we've seen hasn't yet you know and that's when Russia could come in and they always want help you know you know how help is you know let us help you but you're going to give us something in return so everybody got that till the third world war it's the third whoa brother Graham said the first well was the first world war ii but what was the second world war third whoa the third world war okay i would say it's gonna be the same people that killed the two witnesses and i would assume i think they'll gather them all together and then hey you know what that spirit knows how to kill and killed 6.8 million jews in just several years really two years there really wasn't the whole war if you don't remember what the whole four years of war at world war two that they will start killing jews and all they just come to develop the idea of putting them in a concentration camp and killing them okay so i believe they'll gather them together and kill them all at one time and then they'll come back to life and going Iraq whether all in one place we can't go anywhere about the Bible the Bible says them the world would be looking at those two witnesses they will kill okay so we can go by that but we're like you know most people say there's no there is no scripture that says 144,000 is gonna die or be killed going after but we know one thing's for sure they're not gonna be hearing about so you have to it's like Willy was talking about last night you got to read between the lines you got to know what the property gives us know what the Bible says and have the Holy Ghost to know how to Marion that all together that's my whole point with Daniel's telling you week we took we took this over here and we've took this over here and we've took this here they never know hardly anybody ever been able to marry all those together I mean Mary I mean make them fit together and and I think we're get close to doing that now you know we we preach Daniel 70 weeks just out of a lot of quotes and some dates but I think that we we missed a lot by not looking at it through a Jewish eye we have to look at it through a Jewish child colors to a Jewish people and it is to the Jews so this is a Jewish happening but if Israel is God's timepiece people watch brother Brown telling us he said watch Israel there the timepiece well what's the timepiece timepiece tells you when to go when to come when to leave when the total worry comes easy yes okay it's getting late let's look at the clock and see what time and hit well it's getting late let's look at the timepiece and see how close we are hey I got them so we got 1260 days now during this time let's read one thing before we go let's go - you don't have to go to Jeremiah cuz you're gonna hear this Jeremiah 30 everybody's heard of Jacob's trouble alright so here we go this is Jacob's trouble this is where the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying the speaketh the Lord God of Israel saying write the all the words that I've spoken unto thee in a book for lo the day come said the Lord that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and you that said Lord and I will cause them to return to the land that I give her the father's and they shall that's it no when is that that's now that's now right now this is this day this scripture for Bill are in 1948 or 49 and it's moved up closer and closer because all the Jews now that telling them if you have a Jewish origin back from like 50 generations they'll give you free citizenship you clion and boom you're old you're automatically you are a citizen of Israel as you put it that way and these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah for thus said the Lord we have heard a voice of trembling of fear and not of peace because remember this 1260 days that these new prophets calling the earth there's nothing to be hardly any peace anywhere okay that's why I'm saying the Bible says peace peace then sudden destruction that peace peace has got to be real close right in here when we leave there's got to be somebody to bring peace before this can be some destruction asking now and see whether Amanda travail with child wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail and all faces are turned into paleness alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of death of trouble but he shall be saved out of it who was getting up do ya ready go Jacob was a Jew he's going to be taken out of the first come to pass in that day saith the Lord of Hosts I will break his yoke from off my name and will burst out bonds and strangers you're no more served themselves of him if they shall serve what the Lord their God and David their King son of David this is showing you it's going into the Millennium son of David Jesus Christ not just talking about David David what's their literal King but they're there I mean their earthly King but their literal kings Jesus Christ typing David saying that the son of David was selling from right right here's where tell you and David their King who I will raise up unto them all right would you choose therefore fear and Valentine o my servant Jacob said the Lord neither be dismayed old Israel for lo I will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and Jacob shall return and show me what rest what is the millennium rest he's telling them right here what's going to happen and she'll be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid there's you millennium right there let's stop right there but we'll begin again see he says go make full and of all nations Drive scattered thee destroyed gone there's not going to be a nation on this earth in the millennium except the bride and 144,000 the nation of Israel there is not going to be a United States and a Russian on the China and among all nations whether I have scattered these bringing them back yeah well I'll not make a full end of these nothing to end them but I will correct thee in the Millennium the Jews are going to get their correction remember a lot of people will died under bulls and goats a lot of people died under things that were not exactly 100 percent true in the Millennium we're gonna be able to show them they didn't need to kill the goat they didn't need to kill around that the Lamb of God died and the temple is the person that's standing there not the literal building okay let's go Daniel next Sunday we're gonna be gone so I'm not sure
