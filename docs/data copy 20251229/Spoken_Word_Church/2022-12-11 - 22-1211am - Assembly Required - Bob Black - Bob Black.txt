========================================

good morning and God bless you we're getting close to the end of Hebrews chapter 10. so let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning Lord God and we're excited to be able to look into your world Lord and we I just asked Lord that you'll just open things up to us Lord and prepare our hearts for for the day's teaching Lord Jesus and granted Lord It's Judas Bieber by the way it is he studies Lord God and prepare us Lord Jesus grant that Lord in your name amen so in verse 18 of Hebrews chapter 10 it says now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the Holiness by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way the way that Christ prepared for us that he made for us where he said I am the way the truth and the life which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of faith so so many times Paul expresses to us that we should have oh oh thank you thank you brother that was weird I normally don't forget that but yeah so many times Paul expresses to us to have um the confidence to to draw near to come boldly to to Christ if we have a need um to draw with a with a true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast to profession of our faith without wavering for his faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works now verse 22 says let us draw near where the true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and so many times Paul will kind of repeats that that that that Christ's blood cleanses us and changes us and changed our our heart our conscience to to want to do evil to want to do to want to do the right thing to want to do to have different desires and that's what um as as we're kind of we're moving over into where Paul gets to that famous scripture that we need to assemble together and so you see where when your heart's changed your you where before you didn't want to assemble together now you want to assemble together before you didn't want the things we got now you want the things of God so we had an evil conscience now our heart has been sprinkled spring it's been cleaned up so that now we we you know even though some you stumble and follow the mess-ups to your your conscience is different so let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for his faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works Now isn't that an interesting word provoke let's kind of sit on that for a little bit to provoke you know a lot of times when you come to church we we do provoke one another and provoke is provoke is like motivate provoke means now I've got these two little pigeons that are telling us what the what are other words for provoke arouse irritate incite stir that it stir you up when you you know like like the Proverbs says like what we're like iron on iron sharper than one another when somebody says you should be coming to church you should be doing it we should pray more we you know it stirs you up it kind of maybe pokes at your your weak spot or whatever to annoy to stimulate to instigate to excite or Kindle or call forth that's what provoked now so Paul's saying let us consider one another and so many times as I was reading these quotes that we're going to get to in a moment about coming to church so many times brother Brown would kind of explain that you know we're not coming just to our goal is not to just come together as a club or something where we see one another but we have a higher purpose so that's what we're provoking one another to to consider our higher purpose that we're here not just to to we're here to serve a living God and to worship God and to and to grow we've got this our road map here behind us behind me on the board here and we're we're we're we're we're climbing towards something so that's what we provoke one another to provoke one another into love and to Good Works to do things for one another to do to do things that maybe we're lacking so provoke is is like motivation it means to motivators to spark to to pique interests just to stimulate so isn't that what the gospel the preaching of the Gospel does you come to church and you recognize your faults and the things that you're lacking in and you you uh I remember early on in my Christian experience you come to a good meeting and you go away wanting to pray more wanting to wanting to read your Bible more because it provokes you now coursing down to the next the next verse that we're going to get to is is after he's talking about provoking is to come to church now and that is not forsaken now let's consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is so even in that day some people would not assemble together it's a it's a it's a problem that has been constant all through the seven Church ages obviously because it was a problem even in that first church age but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching so so now if we look at what exhort means that also is another word to incite by argument or advice to urge strongly so I have somebody you know just just preaching that gospel with all their heart pouring their heart out or you know in the parking lot or when we go out to eat you know you need to do the things that are that the Bible speaks of to give warning or advice to make urgent appeal because you know this Christian Journey if you if you're going to open up a a box set or a puzzle or something that's going to say assembly is required but you're you're a walker your Christian walk assembly is required it's required to come together and well I've got a a an assortment of quotes that we'll kind of read through to to just kind of I want to share with you this morning the things that brother Branham said about coming to church and I think it'll even I was reading through and it just really opens some things up to me to realize how important it is to assemble together and brother Adam said so let's start through and kind of meditate on some of these things he said it's wrong to stay home from church it's wrong to stay home from church now now to keep in context the thing the things that Paul laid out for us that the what Christ did from the cross cleansed or it changed our conscience so now we want something different than what we used to want we're different and and we we're provoking an exhorting one another to good works because to be successful Christians these are the things that are required and the thing that's required of you to be a success is to be is to come to church so first of all it's wrong to stay home from church brother Raymond said and we would see Jesus he said if you loved God you'd be a church you've got to get back to the church back to the Bible back to Christ and Discerning the body of the Lord he's had a real born-again man or a woman that's got discernment of the Holy Ghost will find his place in church worshiping and crying out and doing all this in his life to try to bring Sinners so a real Born Again won't man or a woman is that's got deserved that knows what's right and wrong is going to be in church he said in Christ the mystery God revealed don't stay home if God is in your heart so now there's another we can list lay that out as a fact if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't don't feel that way don't then then I tell you it's time you've got to pray so we're exhorting and we're provoking now the fella said that brother Brown said in the position of a believer in Christ I can be a Christian and stay home just as well no you can't no so let's let's just kind of lay that out there you cannot be a Christian and stay home just as well if you want to be successful if you want to be a successful Christian you got to come to church you've got to meet together with the rest of the body he has blessed us together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and what Visions are he said we feel that every person is Duty bound to attend some church and belong to some church as a Christian many people say oh I stay home and read my Bible I'm just as well off no the Bible said we shouldn't forsake to assemble ourselves together we've got to do that we've got to stand together and all the churches he said and sir we would see Jesus don't sit home and criticize come see for yourself no that's a that's a weighty one especially in these days how easy it is to say well I'm not going to go to church because I don't like pull your list out I don't like something but come see for yourself search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that test them testify me said the Lord Jesus and God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him he said brother Neville gets to talk to you all the time so then when I'm down here maybe drop down I don't I don't want to be hypocrite enough and not out on a call or nothing just sit up there at the house and Church open down here I don't be hypocrite enough to be sitting up at the house when the church doors are open down there he said in what here is thou Elijah American people want entertainment they don't want the true Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ so therefore the radio and the television will give them more entertainment than the church can do it and they stay home all that comes out is the elect of God is still hungering and thirsting and calling and crying for the real thing of God now there's another sentence that if you really meditate on that he's talking about he's saying all that comes out is the elect of God that's still hungering and thirsting and calling and crying for the real thing of God so he's associating coming to church with being genuine with something in your heart drawing you to fellowship with God and with God's people watching his star he said and you out in radio land tonight I want you to think of that how can you stay home when there's a Revival in the city where the Lord God is manifesting himself a true Hungry Heart Wants to get close to God and they'll go to every move that they know that comes from God they'll search and seek and Hunger and thirst they long to see God come take the Bible and like the magi's did and read it and see if the scriptures Compares with what's being done then if it is you've got a right to Rejoice with exceeding great joy now you see what a real believer is going to come to church because you your call your your purpose is to worship God your purpose is to you know what you're here for and and and and back then they had a Revival unit where they they would come they would gather together and and see great signs and wonders but now we're entering into a bride Revival where the word is being opened up where the Mysteries are being unfolded and how much more should we want to gather together where the word is being made plain and here ye him he said God wants you to go to church and he wants to manifest something to you through his word through some move that he's making you fail to go you'll miss seeing something so again if you want to be a successful Christian you got to come to church in identification he said if you don't have a church you must see you'll die spiritually you'll just dwindle away I got this picture of this plant that's just if it doesn't have water the water of the word then it's just going to shrivel up and and and not not know what his purpose is and not have the the spirit of the Lord in his life and and you just start shriveling up in Fellowship he said mother used to tell me she said birds of a feather flock together well that's a whole lot of Truth to that you never see the crows and doves feeding together because their appetites are not the same their diets cannot be the same their talk isn't the same and so is the man that's out of fellowship with God has no desire to go to church or do right and those who are with God long for that Fellowship you just can't stand it and forsaking all brother Brandon said you can't go around hanging around and going to pool rooms and hanging away from church and staying home on Wednesday night to see some kind of a filthy television play or something like that and forsake your church and all like that and ever expect to see Christ you have to forsake those things to follow the Holy Spirit and questions and answers she said I was called in on something like this the other day a group in Arizona called my attention to that see a ministerial group said the only thing that we have against you brother Branham is one of the things the people that comes out here with you we can't get them to go to church anywhere I thought this was a really interesting quote because that seems to Bear record even today there's a lot of people around the message don't go to church it's not interesting the people that comes out with here here with you we can't get them to go to church anywhere and he blasted that as hard as he could why is that said they got children and everything they won't go to church and said well we told them they was welcome to come to our church now I know they put a pressure on you and want you to join but you don't have to join Put them kids in Sunday school somewhere and you go to church don't sit at home go fishing and hunting and things like that on Sunday you say well I'm not a legalist the way you'd better be in that manner for a while dishonoring the resurrection of Christ you go to church somewhere now you see you see as we read some of these quotes even brother Brown was so for going to church that he would even make it a point if if they're not preaching all the doctrine fully correct doctor you go to church go to church somewhere anyway anyway go to church somewhere until you find a good church where you can go but you go somewhere because that's a Christian's Duty is to fellowship with others and to show your light not not cover up your light the light that you have with a a like a covered under a bushel or something but you go and be a light somewhere because that's that's your your mandate as a Christian to shed show that light to others any questions and answers he said do you teach that the bride must not attend any other Church unless you are preaching or else otherwise the Tabernacle no I don't teach that I don't believe that I do not believe that we've got ministers sitting here that's scattered all around through the country and I believe they are part of that bride I believe that a man or a woman can go to church anywhere they want to go that teaches the word and I believe if they don't teach the whole word and you can't go to church any other place where they teach the whole word go where they teach half the word until you can get to where they teach the whole word go to church whatever you do do that I think maybe some as we meditate on these we see how easy it is to say too that we believe the message when you know you've got to if you want to know whether you believe the message you've got to get in the message because it'll it'll expose whether you really believe what brother Reynolds says or not you know so many people say they believe what brother Brown says and yet they don't go to church when he clearly said go you got to go to the church that's like my most basic foundational thing is to stay at your post of Duty go to church and every time the door is open you'll be there and trying to do God a service without it being God's will he said people think I don't even believe in people going to church why would they think that because that's that's what people even today believe people people think I don't even believe in people going to church that's a million miles from the truth we must assemble ourselves together and that much more as we see today approaching see we must we must come together in unity if I lived in a city and they had nothing but there but well some church I don't want to call you a name but just any church if they only believed one thing that Jesus was divine all the rest of it was wrong I'd go to that church that's a pretty bold statement isn't it they not believe anything right but that just Jesus was divine and he'd still go to that church if I can't get a whole loaf of bread I'll take a slice I'll go listen and Worship the Lord and show him that I'm doing my part I want him to know I'm alive I want everybody to know what side I'm on I think there's a clincher to the whole lesson this morning as I want everybody to know what side I'm on if you're not coming to church then it's debatable whose side you're on but I want everybody to know I'm on the Lord's Side [Applause] in the church losing the church choosing law for Grace brother Adam said and when men and women get to a place well I really ought to stay at home and see this good play tonight but I'll tell you they'll think I'm Baxley it if I don't go on down to church and you sit there and sleep anyhow you might as well stayed home and looked at something you'd enjoy more but when your joy becomes the Lord and the Lord is your joy you can't stay away from church then you're getting somewhere see he's not he's talking about not just coming to church because somebody gonna crack you upside the head if you don't or because you're trying to follow a rule book but when you love God so much you can't stay away then something real has happened and look what he said he said the church was in better shape 40 years ago for the coming of the Lord Jesus than it is tonight way better they were closer to God they had more God among them they had more Spirit among them than they got tonight it because he's talking about the heart condition where where's your heart at this morning because we get prepared for the for the Day sermons are you so in love with God that you just can't stay away from it because that's the main thing we won't we don't want rule followers we want your heart to be changed in spiritual adoption he said and it's possible get it now listen you can worship through knowledge you can go to church by knowledge that you should do it but going to church that way is worshiping in vain but when there's something happens down in your heart that makes you love God in such a way that you can't stay from the church that's the revelation God revealing that's the revelation when you can't stay away from church and God keeps his word he said and they go to church because they know it's a decent thing to do if that's all you go to church for you're just a hypocrite that's all you don't go to church for thinking it's a decent thing to do you go to church to worship God you go to meet God to thank him and to praise him and to worship him a house of worship now that's what we need I hope maybe that answers the question if anybody's debating in their mind well I don't see the purpose to going to church well there it is you go to church to meet God and to thank him and to worship and enter into his praises and to get fed and get your get your spiritual belly full to get it so that God can minister to you a man that's born of the spirit of God loves to go to church better than he loves to eat his dinner when he's hungry oh you think about that that you a real Christian is going to love coming to church more than they love going to Subway more than they love Zaxby's more than they love a good a good steak dinner calls this more than life to you the spiritual man on the inside has got to be fed if that man isn't fed he'll die the outward man isn't fed he'll die and so will the inward man and they haven't present water from the rock this is a lot crammed in here so if you can't see it I'll just I'll just read it he said Just Like A Love Affair if you was going with a girl because you knew it was a duty are you going with a boy when you were young mama wants me to go with this guy but I just can't stand him you don't get nothing of him coming to see you or if it's the same way about the girl to the boy or boy to the girl you go with her she bores you mama wants you to go with her because she's the type of girl that mama likes see it bores you there's no love affair if it bored you you go to sleep and you'll just get real tired and it because it's you're not in love with it but you don't care you don't want to clean up you don't want to go see her and it's why it's a horrible thing and when he's coming to see you Mike you just wish he'd hurry on go home you just wish he'd just hurry on up so you could go to Subway the thing that you love more than the than the word of God that's the same way it is when you why does he preach so long what about all this stuff and everything see you're not in love but when you really hang on to every word as the spirit gave you warning this morning hanging on to every word that might be what he has been talking to you about holding on it's eternal life every word of God it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance whether it's hot cold and different whether the people are fussing growling whatever they're doing is still a joy to hear the word of the Lord then you're in love then with Christ see you love to go to church program in Fellowship brother Raymond said well I knew they were very formal and different so I said you know Dr Brown the reason of it is they don't have the right thing in their heart if a man is right in his heart and the church bell rings he just can't stand still he's got to go that's all right it's life and death to it he must move and Bob and Gilead he said have you lost all the joy the gospel don't sound to you like it used to there's something wrong then if that love of God isn't above everything else that your heart when that church bell rings your heart just burns this morning aren't you just glad to be in church this morning when the church bell rings or something ringing in your heart that you got to get to church because you love God and the unpardonable sin he said he give me the Holy Spirit the things that I once hated I now love the sacrifice it used to be hard for me to go to church I love to go now to hear the people sing and shout and testify I used to hate it I love it now something has changed me then I have a New and Living Way something has anchored here you know in the church when brother Brown was preaching the church ages he made a statement that that God has made us Kings and Priests and priests in the Old Testament offer sacrifices well here in the New Testament you offer sacrifices and your sacrifices are the sacrifices of your time and of your money and you sacrifice to come to church because you love it and that's what a priest does a priest offers sacrifices you're offering sacrifices when you come to church it used to be hard for you to go to church but now you sacrifice because God has made you a priest and forsaking all he said you who have fallen away stay home on Wednesday nights and won't come over here to church watching televisions and other nights of church think you you really say if you have to come to church you have to force yourself to do it because you think it's a law you do it you ought to do it it's honorable to do it and if you don't love to do it there is something wrong there's a holy spirit that makes you love to serve God and forsaking all I think that's a duplicate quote and be not afraid he said the Revival is over and we here not long ago why the Revival was burning and now it seems like it's kind of hard to get the church filled up the pastors tell me that it's hard nowadays and the people won't go to church they'd rather stay home and watch television or something the Love Has Gone out of their heart and the unwelcome Christ he said you know people have things in common people who love the Lord they like to go to church because they have things in common we have common grounds for things we come here because we're all believers in this way of worship we believe in Divine Healing that's the reason you bring your sick here you don't go to places they don't believe in Divine Healing to get sealed healed you go to places where they believe in Divine Healing and we believe in worshiping the Lord in the spirit and that's why you come here is because we have its Fellowship in Pride he said oh Pharisees plenty of them oh you say I belong to church that's all right sure you do but what attitude do you take towards my Lord when he wants to come to you and bless you you won't do it oh no I don't believe in that kind of stuff that's the same group I'm talking about very religious but very Pharisee what did I say they was in the beginning actors quit acting religion get an old-fashioned experience every generation born again my Lord he longs to see you he's waiting for you takes the little place in the corner he never rebukes you for it he loves you you go to church once or twice a month you think you've done your duty oh if you only loved him you'd go every night and every day somewhere and talk with him if you loved him and why are people so tossed about he said let my neighbors gossip let this and that or the other be gone I go to church for one thing that's to stay in your presence I've moved in there Lord I'll never desire to leave again I'll Trust your word what you say there's where I want to be drop the veils around me Lord that I can only see Jesus Christ and live and walk and die in him there you are and as the musicians come forward he said in the voice of the sign We Believe that every Christian ought to have a home church that they go to every Christian ought to meet somewhere with believers and wherever you meet that's the church and he said and hear ye him when a Christian will stay home from church to see some silly play like that there's something happening in that person's life The Holy Spirits went out somewhere and he said in the uncertain sound we ought to worship all day Sunday that's the day set aside for that so now go to Sunday school in the morning somewhere and stay for church and it's always a sin to send your children to Sunday school you know that everyone knows that a sin to send your children to Sunday school take them how many loves to come to church this morning because you love God God bless you
