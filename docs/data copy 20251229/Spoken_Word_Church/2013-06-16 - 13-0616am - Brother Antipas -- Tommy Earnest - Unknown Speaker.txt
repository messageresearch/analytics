========================================

good to see everybody in the house of the Lord it was going to take a minute before the Sunday school class would be coming up and just hey that we had a real good time on our fishing trip and Father's Day and we say to all the fathers Happy Father's Day to you and we had a real good time all the fellowshipping together and playing and doing and everything you know and all and we we uh didn't get catch any fish because they didn't come and stop the thing which is a normal routine for them but they just didn't do it this time but we had enough so we we always take enough with us and everything but you know we do that but I was hoping that they would most of the Sunday school class would be up but we we've got a picture of one of the well the brothers caught up a world record we were wanting to show it to you as the record that the brother caught up oh my goodness you can see he's happy without it that was that was cooked you know I mean the head was taken off you know but it was uh just leave it up there as people are coming up and they can see that he did have a good doing but you can see we have good food too we do we we have some of the greatest Cooks around that the brothers can do and you know Zach will cook breakfast and waiting then we'll cook this one and that and Robbie take care of this and we have a lot of good times together and we appreciate the opportunity to be there together and doing that in in the Lord and we also have a little uh thing that brother Joe has run off that they called us about it the other day and it's in a paper down at Oakwood I think but they wanted to put in the paper kind of the the things you know to show uh some things of Father's Day around this area so they did put us in our uh you know in their Doom engine brother Joe has a copy of it but we just we appreciate that and appreciate all of the the fixings and the doings and some of you made cookies and slaw and stuff like that for us you know and and we we certainly didn't go hungry we had to do and appreciate Brother Gary Krantz having that big old tent because when the downpour came we we had to all get inside and sit down and we actually ate inside and of course I think Zach and Robbie had to cook our hot dogs outside you know in the rain but we did have a good time in it and very safe no problems kids had a good time playing and and we always appreciate each and every one of us so you that are coming on up and you can see that brother Tom caught the largest men are a fish that we did and we did find out something else that there is an old saying you know that smoke follows certain people well we did find that to be true because uh every word brother Chad would move the smoke would go his way so now you put on the other whether it's beautiful or ugliness which one it followers I think it was the red hair yeah myself I think that was what caused him to be able to get all of this smoke together but we got a baby dedication this morning before brother Tom comes out so if the Hamptons family will bring up the little one and we appreciate them being with us today and maybe some of them haven't been here I don't think that there's any other that hadn't been here before but you know we we certainly appreciate them and uh and all and uh I did I have baptized a few of these and my brother sent me words said you baptized me and dedicated me and said I want you to dedicate my baby so we'll just do that this morning and we just appreciate the Lord so let's just sing that bring them bring them in bring the little ones to Jesus bring them in bring them in all the Hamptons family all come together around and listen dedicate the little baby as we always say when we dedicate a baby you know it's something you turn them over to the Lord you give them to someone but you know everybody that Witnesses this whether it be parents you know grandparents or whatever everybody then is dedicating their sales that's the point of their dedication we say well we're just dedicating a baby now the whole family is dedicating themselves to the Lord to live in front of this child to give it an example that the Lord could be with it and help it and all like that so it's really our dedication and all of the church will stand together and we all together hear you and I we've seen many dedications and we just stand in honor of those and we dedicate unto the Lord you know these little children the prophet of God said get them to the Lord quick as possible you know because that way you can get the blessings of the Lord being with them and and being on them and and taking care of them so I hope I get the name right it's Nivia Nevaeh okay I put the lines under it but her name is Nevaeh Grace hantus that we appreciate people thinking enough of us to bring them and let us dedicate the baby thank you company everything will be off let's just all pray together dedicate this into it father we dedicate this from the baby Lord unto you because you put it into the world for us to raise and we maybe not be related to it but yet we are to be an example before that it can see you and want to follow you and then we dedicate it to you Lord because they brought the baby into us to be able to give the little one back to you that gave it up father now we take the little baby and ask you this then we turn it back to the family we say Lord that you would be with them as they ready to go to them that we certainly do appreciate it certainly appreciate them honoring us enough to bring them I think it's my question is that his name he said that you dedicated me to the Lord and baptized me said now I want him to dedicate my baby to the Lord so we appreciate it amen are you ready for the word brother Tom Ernest is going to minister unto us this morning and then they're leaving out right after the service and going down into Florida so remember them as they're traveling and all that the Lord would bless them and take care of them let's stand together and thus seeing as brother Tom Ernest most everybody knows he must see any announcement um okay wait and then we'll be gone next weekend Oklahoma or I all right brother Claude is out of the hospital they really had a a bad bout there and all and brother Bill Yachts Brother Richard told me this morning that he had had a bad week and they had to clean out his trach and tanks but he's doing a whole lot better so just keep praying for him as the Lord will bless him okay let's just saying is Open the Eyes of My Heart Is brother Tom Ernest comes to speak the word unto us amen Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord glad to have the girls and all of us we welcome them the other night the family's brother chatting them so you're a part of us shining in the light of your boring pour out your power and love as we sing Glory it always shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love and freezing home less foreign all right everybody say praise the Lord all right shake your neighbor's hand and take a seat for a few minutes they will read our scripture in a couple minutes we gotta got to defend ourselves just a minute here before we get into the word picture back up there again I'll give you a you know it's just amazing to me we had thousands of pictures taken at the camp and out of all of them that's the one y'all are going to get to see you know so are they yeah let's get the yeah there we are yeah let's see there's a lot of propaganda involved in this picture the rumor is going to go out that I actually caught that fish but I did see well I'm not going to say where it came from but since we're creating rumors this morning let me just continue after I prayed over that fish all of us ate on that one fish right there foreign baskets of fragments left over 12 baskets of fragments left over that was after my prayer so thank you very much for that you know we took I took hours I could have loaned them picked pictures other than that but I don't know I don't know it's called propaganda propaganda the Lord blessed you all this morning it was a it was I just want to say for us getting to come and you guys letting us come and and each one of you getting to know you better that was you brothers that were there just having time to sit around the fire and and hear some of your stories and taking time to analyze which ones were true and which ones were fabricated we're gonna have to sort that out for days to come I am sure in our own hearts and Minds which of you were exaggerating who exaggerates in this building anybody no no you know there was a man one time I don't know if y'all ever it used to be in a little book it was written by a man named Ernie fannler how many you know ever saw that little book he lived up in Minnesota and he actually was around brother Branham quite a bit and of course brother Brandon would get excited and he'd get under the anointing when he was preaching and Goliath had 14 inch fingers and there was exaggerations that to get points across well people are critical of that these days you know they expected brother Brandon to be able to tell every story exactly the same way every time and but anyway this brother early fandler was riding in the truck with him he tells this story and and as they're riding along brother Branham kept asking him don't you have something you would like to ask me brother Ernie and he was like no I'm good I got nothing and so they ride a while longer and brother random asked him again don't you have something you would like to ask me and he's no I'm fine I got no no questions well finally after the third time he says all right I'm just going to ask you then do you ever exaggerate did you understand why we'd be a little hesitant to ask that but brother Branham do you ever exaggerate and oh this is gonna shake your faith I'm sure but he's sure brother Ernie who doesn't exaggerate a little bit every once in a while that uh that is uh no that that was very very small fish but all right thank you Brothers again for having us I know for brother Chad and and his family there they they had had a wonderful time until we had a visit with brother Terence last night and the county went downhill from there so you know they had a really nice feel about Georgia until that happened and now now that that's behind us I'm gonna have to renew their faith in coming back ever again but I will I will work on that to get you all some more visitors again from Kansas but Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there I I don't really have a particular Father's Day message I was in Bartlesville on Mother's Day so just uh back when Mother's Day in May so we've certainly all been remembering brother Claude living so close I get to go down and fill in for him when he's not feeling well and so we've had a really large amount of fellowship with the church there and I appreciate that they're a good Bunch you know they love the word and we're thankful for them so but again to all of you that made the trip as as wonderful as it was you know I don't know why you Georgia people when something goes wrong you blame the visitors I don't understand that the little fish it was like we've been here four years and it never has rained before you know I mean you know there was even talk of if we didn't catch any more fish maybe cannibalism was set in so they were they were debating on who to eat first you know it came down to Kansas people I don't know why they yeah it's a rough crowd y'all got around here that's all I wanted to say about that but but I want to thank you it was a truly truly wonderful time let's read our you can stand together we'll read our scriptures and we'll let you settle down we're going to read in Revelations chapter 2. I enjoyed Wednesday night that was a true I was glad we got in and got to sit I enjoyed that and I told our brother here what a wonderful job he did on that and so if my notes aren't going well I'm just gonna pick his up and keep on from where he was at right up there on the board because that was really really well done and we're going to read the the message to the pertamian church age if you pick it up in Revelations chapter 2 and verse 12. I did a little bit of these thoughts back in Wichita just before we came so if you see the abbots dozing off then that's because they've already heard parts of this before so y'all poke them or whatever you do here in Georgia to wake them up Terence what do you all do when people fall asleep huh I know what normal deacons do but I wonder what you do just checking so just so we're prepared all right Revelations chapter two Lord's good to us any verse 12 and to the angel of the church in pergame is right these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges I know I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is and thou hold as fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days where an Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against you because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and we'll fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to either the hidden Manna and will give him a white stone and end the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth him amen let's pray Heavenly Father over the word we we bow our hearts and minds and souls over the word as our Prophet said in one place he said we stretch our souls across that word and and we measure our soul against that word Lord and and there's no gaps left in it and we thank you for that giving us the full word here in the end time revealing to us the the truth here for your elected lady help us today as we share in it talk about it Worship in It Whatever the people would have need of you are only the one that's mindful of that I can't know those things we can we can prepare as our as our brother Branham told us we can prepare ourselves prepare a message but only you Lord can can direct it to the hearts of the people we ask you to do that today in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen God bless you may be seated this morning brother Wade got me water somewhere it's in this oh man we use bottles at home just bottled water so but I thank you for that because I'm feeling a little dry after all that abuse I got early on there so all right the Lord is good to us we we just chose for a title this morning we are going to take it out of verse 13. um we just we're going to call this brother Antipas how many of you know I've been in church a long time we came in the message in 1969 has a young fellow there and raised up been preaching since 1979 and never had heard a lot spoke about Antipas brother anthopus who was my faithful martyr so now there might be a good reason for that and that is because we live in an age where the naysayers of this generation this great crop of unbelievers that once said they were Believers and they've rose up against this message they have come up with a a qualification for everything brother Branham said and that is that if you can't find a a historical piece of evidence or a newspaper article or or what they term as being third-party vindication then it probably brother Branham just made it up well isn't that a sad way to look at something that God has delivered in the end time that if we can't prove it by science or by history or by or by any other means natural man means that an example the bridge Vision you know brother I said I had a vision 16 men fell in the water as they were building the bridge that was really the initial Vision that he told that got them all up in arms because they have searched every newspaper every chronological historical document and tried to prove that 16 men didn't fall in the river well or in the water while it was being built I'm not really too concerned about historical documentation for that I like something our brother Jim at home says he says I don't care if 16 men fell in the water while they were building the bridge he said I don't even care if they built the bridge I still believe that it is true there comes a point in time where Faith takes over and you just believe it and here's a good example because history history there's no historical documentation that no writer can find I've searched all the the scholars that we could find there there's there's tradition about this brother Antipas that is mentioned here in Revelations 12 but they cannot find any birth records They don't know who his parents were they don't know where he came from they don't know what region he was he came into pergamia hit Orthodox history from about a thousand years after our Lord the Eastern Orthodox Church picked him up as one of their patron saints and said that John appointed him to be the Elder over pergamus but it's just all traditional history in fact as I was researching who this man was it says this the traditional and in Brackets it says possibly fictional Antipas you know possibly fictional how can a man that our Lord in addressing the pergament church he says our faithful brother Antipas a faithful martyr of that age man can look at it and say the traditional possibly fictional Antipas was reputed to be the bishop of the Christian church at pergamas I want you to know something I do not believe antipuss was fictional I don't care if they can't find this birth certificate I don't care if they can't find a tombstone marker that tells me where he was buried he actually wasn't buried because according to this tradition and I don't have any trouble believing in a little bit of tradition if it looks like it fits the word of God but the tradition was that he was roasted alive in a hollow life-sized Bull with a bonfire under its belly a big Iron bull that they had placed in front of the altar of one of their satanic evil gods and that he was roasted alive in this hollow bull giving his life for the word How could a man that Jesus himself the one who has the sharp two-edges sword in his hands says I want to talk about my faithful martyr antibis but man's mind will come down here and later in in generations to follow and say he was probably just a fictional character he was not a fictional character he called him by name come on brothers and sisters so according to the guidelines that everybody is putting on brother Branham Revelations chapter 2 and verse 13 did not even exist come on that's how they qualify it if we can't there's a new website out there called searching for vindication we can't believe anything unless we can find a historical document or or a historical reason that this happened or something to tell us that is true you know there's just a lot of things about this message that Faith takes over and you think how you gonna ever prove anything that we have right come on now I'm just I'm amazed at how weak their efforts become day after day how are you going to prove that he was out there in that field and left his gun on the seat of the truck and the bull came charging and it's the very question I asked that brother out there in Cloverdale I was texting him when he first came out with that with that from the pits of hell website that he's promoting now I asked him that I said how can we prove how can we give any kind of third party Vindication that that bull charged at brother Branham and and and as he was approaching he apologized for walking on his territory and and we had in that little example for the first time in many of our lives a true example of what real love can do when love is projected I believe it happened how are we gonna ever prove that you're not gonna prove that how are we going to prove those squirrels were created how are we going to prove that Jesus walked on the water come on you're not gonna prove any of it but we believe that it happened I I asked that brother that that publishes that website how can we possibly document this in such a way there's there's nobody out there but brother Brandon in the bowl but as he told that story I said brother there are millions of people millions in this message that have saw true love for the first time in their lives from that little example prove it oh my goodness but now everybody's good they're going to ask you can you show me that can you prove it well this is what happened with adamus he was he was just a faithful martyr there and there's no history nobody can find any history it was he was reputed to be the bishop of the Christian church at pergamus that he was martyred for his faith because of his consistent faithful witnessing in the face of all the satanic evil that was present there so that came about 1 000 years after our Lord was here that this that this his that's that's all we got on him John supposedly many this Eastern Orthodox Christian Church believes that that John appointed him as the bishop of but little else is factually known about Antipas from respective historical sources there's your key right there respective historical sources I do not need one respected historical source to tell me that this message is true I do not need one I don't I don't need I don't need to worry about dates I don't need to worry about when somebody was born they've developed a timeline now to show that brother Brown's timeline was all off on dates and who's interested in that I'm interested in Malachi 4 did not come to just give us a book of Visions to see fulfilled that was just pointers along the way he came to open the word how could I turn against this I'm standing there like Peter was after all those disciples had walked away from our Lord and he looks at the twelve he's got left and says why don't you go away also I'll tell you I'm standing there in Peter's shoes this morning I got nowhere else to go I have seen I believe this true report and I have Lord to whom can we go this is the words of eternal life amen this message is the word of eternal life to this age I have nowhere else to go right right and where are we gonna go but you got let's go back to where we were before yeah that was a lot of fun back then wasn't it yeah if that was so wonderful why are you here in fact if you can you can't turn back it the scripture tells us it's better off that you had never left because you're too full for the child of Hell than you were when you walked out Vindication but we're going to talk about this age this age and I want you to notice there in verse 13. twice he mentions a very important point and this was a message I took at home the other day I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is you know it's one thing to reinforce it but at once but on down he says I'll hold as fast as my name has not denied my faith even in those days where an octopus was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth where Satan dwelleth a a tremendously evil and I gave the brothers my quotes today I tried to do it he did I like the way they put those quotes up there I enjoyed following that the other night so number one let's go to number one I heard Brother Sam do it that way give me number one up there on the screen all right here we are here's number one look at paragraph 64 there man that's good I have to train our guys when we get back home you know brother Branham and Satan's eating there's the God of this world that I preached to you about last Sunday he is here today in deceit talking about our day now here he is today in deceit that treacherous hour oh yeah I thought it was I thought down at the end when everybody's in love with everybody and we're ready to go on the Rapture we're going to just be a wonderful bubble dance in time Brethren says that treacherous hour that tremendous time that we're living right now how many of y'all have ever used that statement that brother random made famous for us if I could live in any age I'd rather live in this age than he got how many of you ever done that I've done it a lot we don't he's going to explain why this is it's the most glorious time of all the ages because we're facing the great Millennium again we're facing the Eden again that's what makes it that tremendous time it's the most glorious time but right at this age all the deceit and every tactic that he's ever used and been able to deceive with he's gathered it all together and reinforced himself wow how many of you think it's a grand and glorious age now that we live in an age where the enemy Satan who is the God of this evil world has right at this age he's took all the deceit and every tactic every way that he has ever drawn away a man from the word he has done it in this age he's gathered it all together and reinforced himself that's Satan's Eden right there we live in an age where when those seals were open you go over there to the Book of Revelations you'll find two hundred thousand thousand demons are released from the river you Freight these and you're in my age how many of you feel like saying Thank You Lord now I mean hey wait a minute you said this was the most grand and glorious age and here we are living in this age and 200 000 000 demons that have been reserved since they fell from from before there was an earth when they were kicked out of heaven and Satan drew them out of Heaven they've been reserved for our day oh my think of it he's gathered it all together and there's the key he reinforced himself with what two hundred thousand thousand more demons that he didn't already have use of they've been held and reserved in that river Euphrates until our day and now they're released and they've come down like God he has he's come down like God and has put himself oh my in the place of God religious oh man religious can't quote the scripture and can tell you scripture just as Satan did to even the Garden of Eden but leave out one spot of it is all he has to do make that Gap where the poison doctrine of the devil can pour through like the thinking Mass filter we was talking about the other day paragraph 65 he said he would exalt himself above the most high he would Ascend above the clouds and the Stars he would sit there like God be above the most high and he has succeeded in carrying out his threats he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by the people how does he succeed by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of God's promised words to that age that's exactly how he's done it in every age he explained it away brother random goes on and gives us one little example look at that's exactly how he done it in the days of Noah he explained that it was impossible for it to rain from Heaven there's no rain up there his great scientific gospel that had to have some third-party Vindication behind it some kind of proof some kind of scientific proof there's men that have served in this message and preached it for 30 plus years now are standing up and all of a sudden they're telling you that cloud that happened out there in Arizona that wasn't a supernatural event that was some kind of a rocket that went off in California and that vapor trail came across there and Life Magazine took the picture that's after preaching this message for 30 plus years right what has he done the in the the scientific gospel that he preached in the Garden of Eden he could shoot the instruments to the Moon prove there's no moisture up there but God said there would come a rain but Satan succeeded and poisoned the mind of the people right how is this going to work how is he going to deceive with all these reinforcements and using every tactic he's ever used before he has poisoned the minds of the People by scientific research that it could not be done but it was done God said it would be done and it was done he did it don't you see where does the onslaught come from where where did where did we learn the greatest battle ever fought was going to be not a newspaper batacle battle is not a uh looking for an article to back us up battle it's in the mind of the people he's poisoned the minds of the people the scientific mind of the people right there's your example quote number two this is exactly what we just read out of Satan's Eden how can I overcome we see this age that we're living in there we are let me get a Hallelujah this is the grandest age of all ages this layout of the Sea of church ages of the grandest of all the church ages because of how I've talked to people I know I've talked to people I'd like to live when Jesus lived well you wouldn't have been no different back there than you are now hanging around him wasn't going to change any well if I did just if I could have just backed up 40 years and hung around brother Branham I'd have been a different man no you wouldn't come on I knew a lot of those guys that hung around brother Branham that's why after he was going off the scene they went ahead and had polygamous wives and everything else oh if I could have just just walked through if I could have hunted with him up there in Colorado if I could have just just been there the day the pillar of fire come down on the Ohio River I'd have been a different person you wouldn't be any different than you are now you can't pick another age that you would be different than you are right now because either the word catches your attention or it doesn't but it's the grandest of all the church ages because you want to know why this is the greatest age you could ever live in because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity oh my that's wonderful isn't it here's where we're living it's the grandest of all the ages but then and then it's the greatest sinful age man why'd you put me down here Lord come on you moaners and groaners you ready now oh Lord why'd you put me down here it's so hard so hard down here go tell that to Antipas my faithful martyr it's so hard down here it's more sin in this age than there's ever been and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any HC we'll come back to that and finish it in just a minute but go to number three we might come back to paragraph 45 there in just a minute here's how it's this is how it works do you realize old man this is way back in 56. you can see when it was blushing profit do you realize old men now y'all can qualify who's really talking to there sitting here this morning I don't know what age you are old they have tore that apart we all have heard Billy Paul's testimony brother Brown told me before I'm an old man so when I was reading this do you realize old man they have worried about whether brother Billy Paul is an old man or not they have took days of discussion what do you call an old man how old is old I hope you're not putting me in that category look at me you know I have trouble with this old man young man thing I used to go to a lot of Youth meetings and I kept lining up at them and they wouldn't give me a ticket to come in the door after a while my children were telling me dad that's not for you that's for us you know but I thought I still belong when I hear there's a youth Revival on I still want to go but you figure out what old is I'm not going to sit around and worry about brother Billy Paul what an old man means you won't be an old man when sharks are swimming here maybe he's already going to be on the other side and change back into his theophany body and be young when that happens I don't know how that fulfills right right I'm not worried about how that fulfills but you can find pages of debate online about what an old man is so all of you fellows there some of you that are gray and some of you that have none you can just decide if you fit that category or not do you realize old man when we were boys our boys has got 10 times the Temptation that we had not just twice as hard but ten times sister do you realize that your daughter has 10 times the Temptation you had when you was a girl what will her daughter have it'll be another 10 times over well look at the things the pictures the devils are painting oh how we need to pray that's still good advice I don't care if he said it in 1956 if the seals wasn't open yet or not we still need to pray because why it was 10 times worse for his generation and 10 times worse for his kids and now he's got grandkids and it's 10 times worse for them and you get 10 times 10 times 10 times 10. foreign I've met people but we just don't want to bring a child into this world because it's so evil what kind of faith faith in the word is that right right what kind of faith in the word is that the same God that kept me through my three times ten whenever that generation was we'll keep a new one that comes into the world I run into people man we're not gonna have no kids because this world's so evil right it's because you don't have confidence that God can keep you to the end that's why I can't believe he can keep your children and you know how you know he will we got a little thing that we learned a whole lot about and ain't got enough time to even begin talking about it called the token that we place over our children we've got a token here in the end time that came by a vehicle called the word and we apply that token over our children because each generation after ours is 10 times worse than we had it 10 times worse do you believe that well I just don't know about that well that's not even hard to figure out I'm 54 years old so you can decide I'm not old man if you're 54 and under you are a young man that's brother Tom's definition there was a question raised up fine young individual asked a question last night who is older brother Wayne or brother Terence the greatest offense came from that statement I don't need to tell you we're not going to worry about what an old man young man one of these days we're going to be all 18. how about that those who believe the word have a body coming he's talking about crow's feet the other night pimples talking about as we grow we get the pimples then we get the crow's feet and we get get all these marks on our face and you know I'm looking at just I don't know how to be honest I'm looking for something a little better than when I was 18. I mean it wasn't all that great at 18 either you know I mean come on if y'all are happy with that then hope for that okay but man I want to get on the other side and I want to be buff I never had no six-pack abs but if you see me on the other side look for a guy sporting a pack of six-pack abs I'm sure I have them they're just covered up you can't can't find them under there everybody I want to be like I was at 18. well I wasn't all that great at 18 either but the Lord knows he's we the good thing about getting over there we're going to know everybody anyway there ain't gonna be no that's the one thing you won't have when you get on the other side introductions then well you won't need who is that over there you're gonna know who that is brother man said we'll all know each other that's the kind of age that we're living in that's the kind I wanted you to see why is it the greatest age why right it's tremendous age that we're living in why it's because we're at the ending of time the blending in of Eternity that's why it's it's a it's a privilege to live in laodicea we don't sit around oh Lord why'd you put me down here in such an evil sin curse world it's so bad out there it is bad out there it's ten times worse than it was when our Prophet was here and his children had it 10 times worse over and now it's 10 times more that and now we got those thousand thousand two hundred thousand thousand demons released here in our age to make it two hundred thousand thousand times worse than it was before those seals were open that's how Bleak the picture is but not for us because we believe the word it doesn't matter there is going to be someone in this age that will fulfill first Thessalonians chapter 4. that's why it's a privilege to live here you know we got we got a friend me and brother Chad that he works for in there at home and and he always talks about when we're out working he'll talk about how all these southern gospel quartets when they're singing about heaven all they're talking about is streets of gold and mansions and and how easy it's going to be over there and how rich we're going to be and that's why they all want to go I just want to go home I want to get to my mansion come on he says it's like some kind of goodie bag that you get down at the end of The Journey gonna give you all these prizes for making it through you're going to be so happy to be there you don't care if you're living in a mansion or a straw Hut a matter amen amen I was talking about a little y'all remember that song walking on new shoes getting ready to move y'all remember that song the old southern gospel song new shoes it's all about getting to Heaven new shoes new robes streets of gold mansions jewels oh my I think why I want to go home I don't even want to go home because somebody talked about me last week yes you get a lot of people you know I just want to go home so bad no you don't really wanna I'm like Paul I'm not really Desiring to be unclothed but clothed upon right right I probably told you I don't know I might have mentioned this one time I used to watch as a kid I always like to analyze a little bit of everything I hear and I'd watch him old Saints get up and then you know there was people that were professional testifiers you all ever run into any of them it was almost like you could finish it for them because you knew what they were going to say next and they'd get up and they get to tell I just want to go home so bad broke down oh I want to see Jesus so bad they're crying and then they'll get six next next week they've come down with some big ailment and you know what we find on the pulpit of prayer request that they'll get better exactly yeah I'm sitting there thinking wait a minute hold on wait I'm confused last week he just wanted to go home so bad looks like the Lord's opening up an Avenue for that and but now that we're down to the crunch time we found out they didn't want to go home so bad after all so they got the people praying they go to the doctor and get them some stay longer pills come on what happened to wanting to go home so bad or you let somebody talk about you in the church and we get all down in the mouth don't we oh you should just heard what that brother said about me oh we cry and we get all broke up and all that's wrong it is don't talk about your brothers and sisters but that's usually when we get the most poor mouth in this when things are going rough when all this wrapped up magnified demonic age that we live in is coming against us we just want to go home Paul said you know I do want to go home but I'll tell you why I want to go home it's because I live in this age where that I can fulfill the word in this age that somebody is going to be alive and remain into the change of these bodies somebody is going to take their flight without having to die that's the privilege of living in laodicea that's the overcoming what is the final Triumph in this age a bride that will take her change without seeing death that is the Final Redemption what did the book of is it in James it says what is that Final Redemption the Redemption of our bodies when when our body that's the privilege of living in laodicea sure we got more onslaught of demonic power than we've ever had sure we got the homosexuals raging everywhere it's still a sin brothers and sisters there's no way to politically correct say that homosexuality is acceptable it's a sin it's created by the devil it's a it's a it's a perversion of mankind you hear Brother Brad I'm crying against it back in the 50s talking about San Francisco I was reading an article in now look at where it's come to how he's reinforced himself they're worrying about now whether we should let Boy Scouts in Boy Scouts when when would you have ever thought that boy scouts and homosexuality would ever be muttered in the same breath come on that's how it's gotten down you know it's how evil it is I want to go home not because you know they said when those children of Israel left Egypt there was the true children of Israel that came out those two million strong but you know they said there was some Vagabond Egyptians that also wanted to go along they weren't happy with how Pharaoh was running the country and so along with them that's why the scripture says there was a mixed multitude that came out with them it's because they weren't all Israelites they weren't all true Israel there were just some folks that didn't like the government sound like America don't it I don't want to go home because Obama's in control but that's a good reason come on I hope ain't no Obama fans here yeah man Obama I've always said he is the Abomination that makes a desolation you'll find him over there in the scripture Obama he was going to be the savior of the country and now his health care is coming in next year how many ready for that I'm just gonna go on and get sick so I can get me some Obamacare my goodness I hope not either that's how that's how weak our nation has become that they would put their faith in some kind of a governmental system that's going to do something for them there's only one hope my dear brothers and sisters and that is that we can live so close to this word is that when he comes and calls this word from the earth only he who now let us will let until he be taken out of the way who is that he brother Bradham said that's this bride until she is taken out of the way he calls for his word it's not that whoa I'm just so happy he's gonna call for Tom Earnest one of these days the only reason I'm going to get to go is because I'm a part of that word he calls his word back to himself and me being a part of that word I'm going to be changed and I'm going to be gone I sing in that song I'm gonna be gone in the twinkling of an eye I'm gonna be gone and won't have time to say goodbye I ain't worried about shooting up through the air and Graves open and all that kind of rigmarole that we learned the Rapture was going to be but there is a change coming my dear brothers and sisters it's a sinful evil adulterous age but right in the midst of it this is what I'm talking about Overcomers here was Antipas an overcomer look at verse 13 again where thou dwelleth even where Satan's seed is that's oh my overcoming right there where the man has his headquarters for you to see this word brothers and sisters it's as great of a Triumph as Antipas was crawling in that Iron Bowl he's the least you know I ran down the list of Martyrs you want to hear a list of Martyrs y'all probably heard a lot of this before but but let me who you know who the first one was Stephen he got the ball rolling didn't he we got the book of Acts there's lots we can say about Stephen we can preach whole sermons on Stephen but there was about 2 000 Christians was martyred during that time we know nothing about activists there's lots of history about these other men Andrew the brother of Peter you know he was crucified as well he was he was much like Peter who was also crucified but Andrew was crucified on an x-shaped cross he had the same anointing that Peter did he wouldn't let him crucify him in the regular position because he didn't feel worthy of that because that was how our Lord had been crucified and so they turned the cross into an x-shape and crucified him and it's known today as Andrew's cross you can find that in your history it's Peter of course was crucified he asked him to crucify him upside down at his own request so that James the son of Zebedee you'll find his his martyrdom in the book of Acts chapter 12 who was a Herod or one of those um Roman or or overseers of the land at that time he had James the son of Zebedee who was the elder brother of John he had him run through with the sword you'll find that in the book of Acts chapter 12. he that was around 44. A.D which was 10 years after Stephen had been stoned to death there and also earlier in the book of Acts Philip all of you know who Philip was in the Bible he was scourged thrown in prison they drug him out after that and they crucified him around 54 A.D 10 years Matthew however everybody always picks on Matthew because he was a tax collector even the tax collectors had it rough back in the early church around 60 A.D he was down in Ethiopia and they ran him through with a sword James the brother of Jesus this one really got to me James was 94 years old listen now here's a Christian 94 years old and they stoned him I got one question how many rocks is it going to take to finish off a 94 year old fella talking about an old man 94 years old they stoned him they finally had to take and he didn't die under the Stony this was one tough 94 year old he took the stoning and they finally had to to bash his brains out with what was a Fuller's Club they finally took a club to him at 94 right right let the poor fellow alone he got much longer to be with us anyway but there was such an anointing in that land he that was the brother of Jesus 94 years old Matthias you know who Matthias was he was the fellow over there that the apostles chose to take the place of Judas Iscariot and brother when I said we never heard nothing else from him he didn't have any part in the ministry but yet he went off he was he was stoned in Jerusalem and then they beheaded him after they stoned him Mark Mark The Book of Mark he was dragged to pieces in Alexandria in front of the Pagan idols of course we know that Paul was beheaded Jude the book of Jude crucified to the place called Odessa around 72 Adu Bartholomew one of the Apostles beaten and crucified down in India Thomas and he ministered in Parthia and in India and they thrust him through with the spear Luke all of us our beloved Luke they hanged him on an olive tree Barnabas in Cyprus they wasn't quite sure how he died but he got named among the martyrs Simon zelodi's you know him from the scriptures Down in Africa he ministered in Britain and Africa he was also crucified one of the most amazing ones is our own beloved John that wrote the Book of Revelations he made the list in Fox's book of Martyrs and he survived right come on come on they boiled him in a pot of oil trying to get the truth out of him they couldn't ball him in all and he survived but he still made the list of Martyrs come on we got to redefine martyrdom don't we maybe it's a guy that takes all you can put on him and he still keeps on licking and keeps on ticking maybe that's what a laodicean martyr is going to really look like is a man in the end time that can hold on to that word as John held on to the word and he can get bald and he can get beat and he can get skewered and he can take it all and he can stand up in the end and he can go over there and write one more book and he says love one another my dear brothers that's what a real martyr is in the end time I can take it go ahead and hit me because according to that that that that here of Jubilee there's gonna come a time where he's going to hit us for the last time and then we're going to hear that Jubilee trumping we're going to be out of here that's what a real martyr is is a man that can take it all and still hold his testimony and in the end after come on how many y'all been boiled I watched that that monster fish I caught get boiled in oil the other night I never had that we're all jumping back from that pot oil John was boiled in it and he came down to the end he says dearly beloved let us love one another that's a real martyr right there that's the sign of a true martyr that can take everything that the devil can lick out at him that can take it all and still stay in love with his brother that can take all the abuse that that the church members can Heap on him from time to time through misunderstanding or bad attitudes of their own and can still love that body can still love this word that's what a real martyr in the end time looks like I believe it back to that paragraph that quote number two that I gave him let's finish that one from a few minutes ago look at something brother Branham says talking about those early church age martyrs number two in paragraph 45 they're back there in the early ages look at how brother Branham looks at this back there in the early ages a Christian could for his profession profession of in a church of belonging to Christ he could be beheaded for it he could be killed and put out of his misery and go to meet God quickly but now come on you're fixing to find out this is a little better option than what we've got he says back then he could be killed and put out of his misery and go to meet God quickly but now the enemy has come in in the name of the church and it's so deceiving this is the great age of deception Christ said so the two Spirits would be so close until it would you see the very elected if it was possible see Christ spoke of an elected people for the last day it would deceive the very elected if it were possible so close let me show you how close it is the people so live people can live a clean holy life this is the deception of the age people can live a clean holy life not be sinful adulterers Drinkers and liars and gamblers they can live above that and still not have it still not with it oh that's a mystery ain't it right we thought all those were evidences of the Holy Ghost living a clean holy life not be sinful I love that message the other night how he went over here to this church age chart that we got on the wall here everybody's trying to figure out you know we just had brother Aaron McGarry at our main meetings and everybody he did such a wonderful job everybody's trying to figure out well it looks like from looking at this and we ain't gonna get the Holy Ghost till we get up here I love what our brother said you're not going to have any faith without the Holy Ghost you're not going to have it I'm not worried about whether I get it at the top or get it at the bottom so many teachings went out well you got to have faith before you can get virtues so you got to rise up one day say well I got faith now I'm ready to move on to virtue and then and then once I get Faith and virtue then I'm going to move over and then I'm going to give me some knowledge and until I get those three all sorted out I'm not going to get any Temperance I'm not going to get any patience funny every one of those guys that was building it like a step ladder they got it right up there and they couldn't get along with nobody yeah I've got all six now I'm ready for brotherly kindness and they didn't like none of us they had no friends they everybody was against them isn't it amazing that those who count so much on those virtues and getting those virtues always fail on brotherly kindness because they'll tell you if you don't see it like I see it you're just going to hell anyway how much brotherly kindness is there enough I appreciated that message you the night hey that little baby he ain't gonna learn to do nothing until he's born he's got to be born first and through that new birth you're going to receive that faith and without that new birth you're not gonna and without your love of this word and your bond in this word you ain't gonna have no brotherly kindness you might can stick in a few peacock feathers along the way and say look at my brotherly kindness peacock feathers right yeah but if you're still a black bird on the inside you're going to still be a blackbird it don't matter how much faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance you stick into your being that's you doing it brother Branham ask a simple question he preached a whole message and we got one quote in a minute how can I overcome you know what the answer was you can't that's right hey y'all I remember as a young man I want to read that I want to know how I can overcome you know what the answer to the message was you can't overcome he must overcome in you you cannot overcome just like we can't kill our old husband right man we had fun with that up at the camp meeting talking about that he let it die don't you see it everything we kill out is going to come back we can't put them down for the count right we can subdue our with our natural efforts with our with our New Year's resolutions how many of you ever had a few of those that fell by the wayside how many of you made a resolution yesterday that fell by the wayside already because you can do it how can I overcome that's what we're talking about this morning Overcomers in an age that is more wicked than any age has ever been and you'll be standing up there numbered among brother Antipas you'll be numbered right up there with him a true martyr amen of that age let's go to that one how can I overcome I love this got to give you a little taste of this and we're gonna let you go we're not going to keep you long what do you all usually go to 132 something like that yeah oh that's when you start again I'm sorry I forgot I forgot you all start at two o'clock I gotta get done here what happens if a guy ain't done by two o'clock y'all just run on through you ever done that yeah yeah not yet okay it won't happen today either so oh Overcomers of laodicea that's what we are brothers and sisters now what are we to overcome he had just read Revelations 3 21. what are we to overcome that's the normal question to ask here but that is not the ACT this is number five are we on the right one yeah no let's go to number five yeah there we go what are we to overcome this is out of the church age book what are we to overcome this is the normal question to ask but that's not the actual fault of this verse for oh I love this it is not so much what right remember this you want to overcome quit worrying about what you're supposed to overcome it is not so much what we are overcome but how we are to overcome that man now this is logical for does it matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome president you know most of us carry around a bucket list in our pocket you know what the bucket list is you got to do this for we're out of here I gotta do this I heard a man preaching one night me and my wife stopped in on a church it was the most gosh awful experience that I've just ever had he's sitting there and he's trying to tell us that there's three things we got to prove before we can get out of here three I'm thinking man I gotta prove nothing but go ahead tell me what I got to prove well number one we got to prove to the devil that we are the elect I'm thinking I don't know about that I probably already figured that out by now but amen this next one was we got to prove to God Who We Are I'm like wait a minute he knew me before the foundation of the world how am I going to stop and and then we got to prove well his whole message was simply when we get those vindications and those manifestations and the dead raised to life and the healings and the supernatural flowing among us then that's going to prove to the world Who We Are brothers and sisters that ain't going to prove nothing we've already had that and what is that proven if somebody died right here in the meeting I went back and prayed for and raised him from the dead that makes me no different than it than before the event happened that ain't gonna prove nothing there's no proof maybe God knows who we are I'm pretty sure the devil knows who we are and I and and before you're gonna get out of here you're gonna know who you are because when she recognizes who she is that's when we're going to be getting out of here that there's still proving there ain't nothing I'm gonna do to prove it to myself this is what brother Branham is saying we carry around a bucket list well I got to overcome this I got to quit this I gotta I gotta quit smoking I gotta quit drinking you know what I I just like the way brother Brown Put I smoke all I want to smoke right right I said that in my in the home church that I was staying in the basement of my niece and they got three little boys I was using that quote where I said man I just smoke all I'm just smoking all I want to smoke these days my niece's little boys ran up here after says Mama he'd been smoking in the basement what are we gonna do about that what we're gonna do brother Tom down there smoking in our basement oh man that's it how not what quit worrying about what you're gonna overcome what what what what attack is going to be next come on we get so worried about the attack putting a name on it we got to put a name on the next attack I can promise you there are reinforcements here in this age that every tactic and every deceit he's ever used you're going to get it used on your hair in the end time I don't know what form it's going to take in your life I don't know what form it'll take in my life but I am more than able through this word to meet that challenge I don't have to sit here and worry about what I'm going to overcome I just have to know how I'm going to overcome he went on it the next paragraph look at these scriptures that involve the Lord Jesus overcoming you know this very well overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in Matthew 4 Jesus is tempted to the devil he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by the word how to say it with me how did he overcome the personal Temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that correspond exactly to the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word amen Eve fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell in direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that's the only way to be an overcomer it's the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word Can't Fail oh brothers and sisters how do we how do we overcome by the word notice again how Jesus overcame the World Systems of religion when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day there it is badgered you feel bad I feel badgered more in the last couple of years than I've ever felt badger by the theologians of the day by those who need proof by those who need vindication I feel badgered by that they're picking on me I just want to get out of here these unbelievers keep picking on me that ain't why I want to go home I want to go home because I'm allowed to fulfill the word in my bay Oh my he constantly applied the word he spake only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of God and this last statement out of that church age book in his own personal life look at those next words contending with himself I could just fold it up and go home on that one how many ever contended with herself he was talking about looking at the worst enemy in the mirror the other night we save him every day in his own personal life contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word of God oh brothers and sisters well you know where your worst contention is in the mirror right contending with yourself well you just don't know that sister over there she just don't like me and I'm contending with that that ain't as much as contending with your own self that's nothing we let these little little things of Life bother us I mean I have a lot of trouble when I'm around by the way and I think well it's hard to contend with brother Wade but then he near as rough as continuing with myself that's right it's almost as bad but not quite you know ain't nothing in this world where your battle is right it's right here the greatest battle ever fought oh my brothers and sisters this word is here to do it I'm running out of time I I was going to go into Satan's seat one day we'll maybe get back here and do that brother Brandon said Satan's seed had had changed over to be to be pertimist it used to be in Babylon now it's permas and then he shifted his seat back again to Babylon but only this time it's not a natural Babylon over there in Iran or somewhere you know where it is it's mystery Babylon mystery Babylon that's where it is all brothers and sisters is it rough in this age sure it is is it bad sure it is are we going to have a squeeze sure we are right oh no it's going to be a mental squeeze really yeah really come on I have mental pressure right and we all got I I preached in a man's church one time the very next week I know brother Tommy said we're going to have persecution and tough times and trials but I've already I just want you to know I've already been mentally squeezed I cannot read those quotes about the squeeze and think brother Brandon was talking about a mental squeeze come on when he makes statements about you that have followed the pillar of fire you're going to have a rough time of it then he wasn't talking mental there's something coming I don't know how it's going to get put in I don't know if it's going to come under the reign of Obama or not I just don't know but there is coming a time where this but the promise is you go back to all of those quotes when he talked about that persecution and that stress you know what he almost always followed it up with watch that third pull then watch that word hold you then the way that it has held you now brothers and sisters we're going to go out of here continuing with ourselves more than anybody else and there is power in this word and contending with his own self he overcame by obedience to the word you got some stress in your life follow obedience to this word and it'll take care of that stress you having a problem it's not an outward problem it's right here inside of this building let's stand to our feet you love him this morning I believe Brothers it is a rough time sure it is Antipas right in where Satan's seed is right there in pergamas where the scripture calls it Satan's seat exactly but right in there are you glad you got this are you glad you're living in this age why don't I know y'all gonna know it wouldn't take nothing from a journey now y'all ever sing that I don't know if we got words for it we'll just sing it anyway make up words if you don't know you all know it wouldn't take nothing from a journey now amen I got to make it to Heaven somehow right right though the Devil tempt me though brother Wade drags me back I'm gonna make it somehow Journey now I'm gonna make it to Heaven somehow and he tries to turn me around well he is all for everything that's got a name foreign he's offered everything that's got a name let's pray together Heavenly Father it's been a great journey to be called in this age to be summoned in this age to serve you Lord it is a privilege we stand with our brother Antipas who is a martyr and right in the midst of where Satan's seat was and we stand here in this age Lord and we believe we believe we have no other proof we're going to make it other than
