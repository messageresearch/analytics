everybody in the house of the Lord glad to have brother drill Hughes with us and this three brothers come with him tonight so we're we're happy to have you with us and we say to you when you come to Lula Georgia you get a welcome on the first time so make sure you tell them you get a welcome but when you come to times you don't get a welcome because you're part of us all right you understand me you're part of us so that that's what we say we say welcome but now when you come you're part of us so just make yourself to home for the journal he's old he knows he's at home so that he's all right but glad to have each one of us leave we give tonight and just pray that you Lord would bless you and they will be trying to interpret a little bit darfur the ones that can't quite understand it so just you know look look at that and look up here to one that's gonna be ministering no lie so let's just go ahead and let our brother come forth brother Lewis and dis minister the word of the Lord unto us because that's what we come far we enjoy all the other thing when you're singing when you are worshiping when you're praying but we enjoy the word when it comes forward right and that's what it's supposed to do so let's just sing open the eyes of my heart as brother Lewis comes to bring the word of the Lord unto us opening eyes open Eli's of my I want to see I wanna see open the eyes of my heart [Music] what'd you say to see you too [Music] sorry [Music] Oh shiny to power as we say [Music] Oh Oh [Music] I want to see praise the Lord Jesus are you happy to be the house of God I trust that you are and I am happy to be back on the saddle weights as good beep to have me back it's good to be back but dick is good to see your face again yeah it's good to see everybody and you know I brought something I don't know where I put it I think I might have left it in there it's a bottle of water brother Darrell is so good to see you it's such a bad surprise and I trust everyone on your end is doing well praise the Lord and all the other brothers his kids good to see you all thank you brother you'd have anointed it there I appreciate everyone's prayers while we were gone and of course you know my father-in-law he he passed away and and he was sick and he lives in Canada so it was kind of a situation to where we knew that that he was gone we just didn't know when and so we just couldn't drive all the way up there 16 hour drive and then you know nothing happened then we'd come right back and maybe in the middle of us coming back then we have to go you know but so we just kind of had to stick around and the Lord had his head his way I believe I appreciate all the prayers that you made for us my wife I believe she's been strengthened by those prayers and so thank you thank you for that most of all I believe that what strengthened her is that you know of course the pastor there he talked to my father-in-law he wasn't a Christian but he talked to my father-in-law's a week before again and I know in the last two years the Lord has really been soft softening him up really been humbling him really been and he's been more humble more receptive to the word and so I believe God was doing the work in his life whether he said it he said it you know I believe God was doing something in here and so I trust that right now he's at rest and that's where we should believe in that we're gonna believe it either way he was good to the bride that's for sure it was good to us and he cooked for the church and things like that and he did it with all his heart and but I believe he's in he's at rest right now with my mother-in-law who was a believer so praise God I mean I thank you thank you all for your prayers amen praise the Lord and so we're just gonna go ahead and go straight to the word I don't want to take up too much time so let's just let's just read read Matthew chapter 3 and verse 2 Matthew chapter 3 verse 2 and then we'll read Matthew chapter 7 chapter 4 verse 17 it says Matthew 3 verse 1 it says in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and verse 2 it says and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand amen and then in Matthew chapter 4 verse 17 says from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand praise God let's just bow our heads this this evening our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus once again for the opportunity to minister your word Lord God we know father God that we are our lips aren't worthy Lord Jesus to even speak these great things father God but Lord you made us worthy Lord through your Holy Spirit Lord God father God and I just thank you Lord that that we have the opportunity Lord Jesus to be able to to minister to to your bride father God who you have purchased father God through your blood Lord Jesus and father we just ask that you to help us to just get aside Lord help out get all nervousness out and everything Lord Jesus and you have your way with us this evening Lord father God we invite your presence Lord in our midst father God because if you're not here Lord then we're here in vain Lord but we believe that you're here because your word declared it father where there's two or three gathered in your name there we'll be in are there myths so we're just confiding and believing that father God we love you and we pray that you'd meet every need amongst us Lord and father God have your way with us in your name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen praise God Saints you may be seated praise the Lord mm-hmm and just before before I forget I just want to ask you all Sunday we my wife put in a prayer request for her older sister her name is Nova and up in Canada and she's just just a special prayer request for her and her family and we just ask you all that you all just remember that it really God knows all about it just not at liberty right now to speak about the details but just pray for her and pray and pray that God would just work all that out as he desires I mean I believe God's doing something right now and so and so we just we would covet your prayers for that a man for her name is Nova just like the star Nova amen praise the Lord so thanks we want to we want to speak this morning or this deceiving a topic the mystery of the kingdom of God you just give it a title and back in March I gave a series of five-part series in the adult Sunday School downstairs and and so I felt led as I was going and you know just looking at some things I felt led to just come back and revisit this because not all of you were there and maybe may not have heard what was spoken and so this would give you opportunity to hear amen and have you've heard it then you're hear it again amen because I mean sometimes like I've said before sometimes we might hear something maybe a sunday-school brother Dale brother wait somebody might be preaching if and we may not get it right there and then but then but then three months down the road maybe another brother comes in or the same brother preaches the same thing in boom God gives you a rebel a amen so the word is the word Amen praise God that's the that's the key you know the word is the word and if it needs to be repeated Amen that means you need it that means you haven't gotten it the first time Amen because remember God is God speaking through us Amen if you believe in that fivefold ministry that God is using a thoughtful ministry in this hour then it's God working through that fivefold ministry Amen and it's God given you Amen God given me what I need amen praise God Amen so we want to we want to try to work with this PowerPoint presentation and I know last time we did a lot we did some some preaching and stumped on toes and I know I stumped on my own toes and but you know what we all needed it amen so I just hope that you know I just need we just need more of God in this hour right man thanks guys so tonight we're gonna try to bring it come down and just kind of do a little bit of teaching amen we'll see how the Lord leads amen so I titled this back there back at that time I said is the kingdom of God is it external or internal amen and well as we go along you know we'll we'll see what that means because a lot of people make the kingdom of God as an internal thing which I believe it but also sometimes make it external as well and they're they're they're gun ho about it being an external you know but we'll see we'll see what what it's all about let's go to the next slide amen now the phrase the kingdom of God started to be used at the time of John that's reason why we read that that that John the Baptist come and the phrase is used interchangeably with the phrases the Kingdom of Heaven or the kingdom and if you all want a copy of this PowerPoint presentation just so that you can have all these all these verse all these scriptures and all these quotes you're more than welcome to this is there's no copyright on this no copyright on the word I was in Nicaragua went down and I preached the word there on the mirror and I had the mirror and what brother came up to me and said I love that missus and he said he says their copyright on it I said no brother you take it there's no copyright on the word amen now it was first used in Matthew chapter 3 verse 2 and then in Matthew chapter 3 verse 1 which we already read so we'll go ahead and just keep going through and we'll circle and I'll try not to keep you all along this evening amen praise God next amen now the word key kingdom kingdom of God if you look at up in in the in in the the concordance it means royal power kingship Dominion rule not to be confused with an actual kingdom that's interesting but rather the right or authority to rule over a team right amen now that's that's key amen praise God so just remember that amen next slide and Matthew chapter 6 but this is where Jesus was talking about let's just read in Matthew chapter 6 verse 25 therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life when you shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body more than raiment amen behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet our heavenly Father feedeth them in other words they're not out there laboring and working and toiling like we do but yet our heavenly Father feeds them amen are you not much better than they Jesus s right which of you by taking thought or in other words by by thinking I can do a little bit more can add one cubit unto your stature right maybe you know playing basketball over but obviously you can't God's already determined they meant and verse 20 and why take ye thought for raiment amen in other words why take you thought for your clothes right consider the lilies of the field how they grow they told not neither do they spin have you ever looked at a flower outside or even blade of grass you know I heard something the brother branham's say something the other day is that we can send people to the outer space we can send rockets to the moon or outer space and they've got the signs for that but yet they have not been able to explain one blade of grass how a one blade of grass is made everything they can't make one amen so if God is God's tell Jesus telling us don't be concerned about these things because if Jesus is all you know he created the grass he created the flower look how beautiful they look we trampled on them Tom is no more we track I felt it was kind of loose we trampled on the things and yet we don't even think what is involved in these things amen and then Jesus tells us not to worry and says and yea I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these next wherefore if God so clothes the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow let's just skip down to verse 32 it says for after all these things do the Gentiles seek including including what we shall eat right so he was speaking to us right after all these things the Gentiles seek for your heavenly Father knows that all you have need of all these things right I'm so thankful that he does a man that he knows your needs he knows exactly what you have need of a man physically and spiritually and he always gives such food in due season amen just in time he's never late amen and then and then verse 33 but says but seek ye first the kingdom of God now Jesus could have said but seek ye the kingdom of God but he said seek ye first the kingdom of God in other words anything that you're going to be involved in anything that you're going to you know get get involved with right put God first God what is it that you want me to be to do with this how where do you want to go with this put him in first place he already knows about it but he wants you to recognize that if he put him before you he'll always fight your battles he'll always say men he'll always be there for you and seek you first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things food raiment all these things shall be added unto you right amen so I put this I put this here because as we're progressing through this with as in talking about the kingdom of God this is how important Jesus made the kingdom of God to be it's gotta be the first thing in your life amen it's got to be the first thing in your life amen amen so let's move on to the next verse our next slide now brother next slide my brother Brown says here in the smyrna church age here is where you have to believe again in the love and goodness and wisdom of god this too is needful remember he admonished take no thought for tomorrow what you shall eat or what ye shall put on for your father knoweth the things you have need of he who clothes the lily and feeds the sparrows shall do much more for you these physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life for a man's life consisteth not of the things he possesses but rather seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all material necessities will be added unto you amen next slide amen and well I won't read all this but said the people of God are not material minded they are Christ minded amen they do not seek the treasures that are below they seek those that are above amen praise God so let's move on like I said if you want a copy of this then you more than welcome to have one now Jesus this passage here in Luke chapter 18 verse 28 then Peter said lo we have left all and followed thee and Jesus replies to them and says and he said unto them verily I say unto you there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of God's sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting now you may think you may look at these scriptures you like how I read that since I was a little boy you know a little girl you know I've read these scriptures but if we if you pay attention and you start looking at what the kingdom of God really is you'll start seeing these scriptures in a different way because if you give up mom and dad if you give up your children even wife for the sake of the kingdom of God there's a big blessing for you amen there's a blessing and I stole for that God don't forget that amen because remember even job even joke did that right at the time you know he wasn't gonna give up God to do whatever his wife was asking them to you know curse God and die he said no you speak as a foolish woman he said but I'll stay with God and you know what God restored him restored his health and restored all his family back the Bible says that's powerful right I was in the Old Testament hey man praise God how much more under this this meant this dispensation of grace amen praise God next slide because you know sometimes Saints Satan wants to take our time you know and I gave an example downstairs I said you know sometimes I have I have just to just to bring it down home you might have a but you say Lord I want to go pray and then you if you have children in the house something happens the attention is diverted or your your wife needed something and then you get caught up in that and then all of a sudden it's it's midnight and you didn't get your prayer time and now you're sleepy seek ye first the kingdom of God amen praise God now so is the kingdom of God external what the kingdom of God is not let's talk about what the kingdom of God is not a minute in John chapter 6 says verse 14 says then those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did these are Jews they man said this is of a truth that profit that should come into the world when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone so the Jews we know that the Jews back then they were looking for a kingdom they wanted the glory days of Solomon to return the golden days of Solomon to return and they wanted somebody politically to come down the corridors of heaven and step in kay if it's a seat and stopped out the Romans and bring back rule again again the way they bathe they and they they thought that that's how the Messiah was going to come but Jesus didn't come to establish a physical Kingdom that wasn't his intention he will have a physical Kingdom but it's got to be internal first amen praise God let's get this move on to the next slide now these are other other other scriptures Luke 19 for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost and as they heard these things he added in spake a parable because he was not to Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear so they thought that the kingdom of God in their perception should immediately appear amen now let us skip that next slide in Luke chapter 17 verse 20 and says and when he and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation now this is a key verse amen now I'm putting it right here because there later all we're gonna refer to it again amen the kingdom of God what that means is the kingdom of God is not something that you see right verse 21 says neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within you now this is Jesus speaking about this even before him it come down as they're in the form of the Holy Ghost right the kingdom of God is within you he had not died yet when he went when he said those words right amen next let's see and when the acts 1 verse 6 when they therefore would come together they asked of him saying Lord will doubt this time restore again the kingdom to Israel he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive look how Jesus just kind of puts it back amen they're looking for something physical but Jesus is talking something spiritual verse 8 he says but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you so they're talking about a physical Kingdom he's talking about the Holy Ghost right and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria unto the uttermost parts of the earth so what is this kingdom of God that Jesus talking about right praise God let's go to the next next one amen John chapter 18 then this is when when when Jesus was before Pilate and just let's look let's look at this I'm sorry I'm doing a lot of reading but we come to the house of God and the word has to be preached right amen then Pilate entered into the judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto Him art thou the king of the Jews and look how Jesus replies to him jesus answered him say it out this thing of thyself or did others tell thee of me in other words do you have a revelation of Who I am or somebody just tell you about it and you're just repeating what they said it's pretty much what Jesus is saying amen verse 35 says Pilate answered am i a Jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what has thou done next jesus answered look up jesus answers in verse 36 my kingdom is not of this world amen if my kingdom were of this world then with my servants fight right that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence amen so then verse 37 Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this and was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness look at this on to the truth that he should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth in other words my subjects right my subjects every one that is of the truth in other words of that Kingdom heareth my voice amen now here there was Jesus standing in front of Pilate Pilate was hearing jesus's voice physically but yet he wasn't hearing it amen because look what look what Pilate replies Pilate saith unto Him what is truth in other words what is truth you know and the truth the kingdom was standing right in front of him and that's how close it is Saints that we could miss it the kingdom of God is so simple so so so so sometimes Jesus was right there bound maybe maybe blood and things come in all over they look so it how could that be truth how could that be the kingdom of God how could that be and you could miss it for a million miles amen it's so humble it's so it's so a simple because let me tell you Saints as you're growing more in the word amen as you're as you're feeding on the word amen I believe as I was telling my wife today God becomes more simple amen God doesn't become more complicated amen God is a simple God if you continue amen reading and feeding the word on the word amen the more you feed on the word the more simple he gets [Applause] but some people they're like I don't know I can't get into all those messages that brother Brenna preached and I can't I don't know about the statue the perfect medic why don't you try reading why don't you try reading and studying the stature of a man or reading the word a man and see yeah you see my goodness God is simple right when God really gives you a revelation hey man that's what brother Branham preached that message they may God revealed in simplicity hey man praise God next slide amen so we see that it's established that Jesus did not come to establish a physical Kingdom that was not his purpose but yet while the people were asking these things of him he's talking about a kingdom anyways something that you cannot see amen now brother Brown says here in the message the unity of one of one God in the one Church 1958 God's kingdom is not of this earth God's kingdom is in our hearts it's the spiritual Kingdom that we're born into it amen that's key we're born into it jesus said the kingdom of God comes but without not without violence believing meant without observation and the kingdom of God is within you all right the Holy Spirit God's kingdom moving in the man and governing and controlling him that's the kingdom that's the that's the kingdom that Jesus was telling Pilate and say if my subjects were of this kingdom there you know they would fight for me but because my subjects are not of that Kingdom they're not fighting for me man therefore the word had because the word had to be fulfilled right what if angels came and rescued Jesus from dying and things like that the word would not be fulfilled but God is so so once that word to be fulfilled amen they did that it had to be that way you see praise God so you're the subjects of this kingdom a man will hear his voice of the spiritual king right amen next slide now in Romans chapter 14 verse 17 for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost amen now I just want to say if we could just read just a few verses from Romans chapter 14 amen I'm not gonna read if you want all the details and things you can go back to those to those videos on that we did on Sunday school but just bringing it bringing it down just a little bit amen how many love the Lord Prisca this is still stains Saints is the kingdom of God external what the kingdom of God is not right amen because unfortunately a lot of people in the message have made it something external do's and don'ts and hair and all kinds of stuff we believe in those things but that's not that's not the message that's not what that's not what brother brother Brennan that wasn't the culmination of the message because the Pentecostals had that right the Pentecostals of your data happy women with their hair long and land and and decently dressed amen but God God had to restore that back amen to to the to us amen so that way the message could come forth their true message amen praise God so God wasn't forgetting about these things that's why we don't forget about the the physical things amen praise God but you know in order for you to do the physical you have to have it eternally first what is it what is it that you sisters have long hair but yet you talk about the whole church this is you have a long tongue you know you have long hair dragging all the way to the floor but you have a long tongue what is that you know you haven't been born again are you brothers you know doing what you know smoking cigarettes in your house and you're at church and doing things you know what is it that you need to be born again all right praise God so verse let's just start I just start at verse one Amen well I'll see we're all right him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations now I I looked up today I looked up that word disputations because Paula Paul clearly tells us say men that these things are not beneficial to unto us right amen doubtful disputations in it and and this is what this is what that means if this decides to come up i meant to print these out but anyways it means it means arguing's why and things like that right things that really are not sedimented that we don't we don't find in the word we find in the word where women should have long hair they should not wear this you're not wearing garment that pertains to a man a man should have short hair we see those things a men in the in the scripture but then sometimes we fuss and fight about things that we're not even in the word and yet you bring them as doctrine you become it's become doctrine in your life amen that's what that's what Paul was talking about doubtful disputations they meant something that you'd it's not really in the word it's just your own thing right praise God so that's what it says here it says it's the disputations is the word Diallo he's mas in greek and it says the thinking of them it means the thinking of a man deliberating with himself a thought in word reasoning purpose design a deliberating questioning about what is true hesitation doubting disputing arguing so that's the greek word for that for that disputations all right so let's continue for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs late night but not him inside inside Joe you just asked brother wait like let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not right and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for God hath received him right so at that time you know there was people that so this meat was sacrifice unto idols and things like that and there was Christians who who didn't you know who were bothered you know especially those who were newly born Christians they men were bothered about eating certain types of meats like pork and things like that especially because these were Jews you know Jews don't don't mess with pork but Paul is trying to bring them amen and trying to bring them to a balance right because Saints sometimes you know for there's clear things in our life that we should not do right a Christian that Holy Spirit will teach you those things right there's clear things we know especially those just take smoking you know smoking cigarettes you know you're hurting your your your health for one they men and I just don't see the Jesus sitting around smoking cigarettes right you know what would Jesus do like darn banjo right right it's a demon all right but then there's things amen that you might find that it's okay for you and and I may find it highway just want I don't have the faith to do that or vice versa right right you might you to you might be bad but to me it might not be bad or vice versa and this is what Paul is trying to bring out he says who art thou that judgest another man's servant to his own master he standeth or falleth yea he shall be Holden for God is able to make him stand now one man esteemeth one day above another another steam ahthe every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind right let's just take Christmas for example some people celebrate Christmas right they they think you know it's okay that's fun you know some people don't want to celebrate Christmas don't want to put up a Christmas tree and things like that that's fine to you be persuaded in your own mind as what Paul says because that is not a Salvation issue that you don't find in that and sitting anywhere in the scripture where that's a Salvation issue all right but I should not condemn you and neither should you condemn me if I don't put up your Christmas tree or Christmas tree right amen he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord and He that regardeth not the day to the Lord he does not regard it the both of them are serving the Lord right is that what Paul saying he that eateth eateth to the Lord for he giveth God thanks and he that eateth not to the Lord he doth not and giveth God things so why judge one another right let God be the doulton a judge of all those things right because you know what all that brings is just doubtful disputations things that will not cause us to grow more in the Lord all right all right now let's just skip down keep it going let's see for whether we live or keep going down all right verse 10 but why does thou judge thy brother or why does thou say that not thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ keep going verse 12 so then so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God all right and you can read the scriptures on your own Amen that is the book of Romans is so good let us not therefore judge one another any more but Judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brothers way so I look up the word stumbling-block and this is what it says an obstacle in the way which if one strikes his foot against he stumbles or Falls that over which a soul stumbles by which is caused to sin amen praise God so I've because when I first come into the message you know and I was around certain brothers they felt a Liberty to you know speak or say things or act a certain way that I didn't feel at liberty to do I didn't feel comfortable right but then sometimes you know and I felt like they were just being haughty about about it you know they have faith in to do that but I didn't have faith to do that go that way right but you let's let's just be careful for us not to be a stumbling block to one another right if I know that something is is offensive or is gonna cause a stumbling block to brother dick amen I just won't go there right right I gave an example of you know when I go when I go to overseas and there's a certain food that I might like they might be cooked in blood you know are there's a certain food that I lacked they do like it it's called blood sausage but you know what to a lot of Christians and it's it's a it's a it's a pig's gut that's stuffed with rice and meat and things like that and it's cooked in blood right it's really good I grew up eating that so but you know what st. if I'm a round of believers because there's lots of Christians that do won't eat that because of what the Bible says about blood right I will not eat it because of them especially if I am trying to win them for the Lord if I I want them to draw close to the Lord I will not do it I will I will I will not I will sacrifice my desire for this blood sausage in order to gain a soul right that's what Paul is talking about as I'm using the blood sausage as an example right praise God amen this is all part of the kingdom saying amen because let me tell you it's it's a it is external amen but but it's also internal as well they meant praise God now and look and look what Paul says here in Romans 14 14 I know em am persuaded by the Lord Jesus by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself let me tell you what Saints you know let's give the TV for example television within itself that box is not unclean right there's more harm in your cell phone then there isn't that TV and you carry that thing with you everywhere you're more harm in that but people are you can't have a TV you know but you know as you know between you and God but but you know there's more harming a computer in a cell phone the Internet has done more harm but you know what those things could be used for good and for bad right now we're streaming live we're using it for good right but at the same time it's being used for bad at this very moment that we're talking it's being used for bad so it's what depends on what you use it for something because Paul said I'm persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself nothing nothing unclean of it sir but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him it is unclean so if you think something is bad it's bad to you but don't bring it as a doctrine and say you say the whole church shouldn't do it and come on here without just brings doubtful disputations I'm just bringing it down home Saints praise God verse 15 but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walkest thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died alright let not then your good be evil spoken of alright well whatever you think is good for you that let it not be evil spoken us amen for the kingdom of God look in Romans 14:17 for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost that's that's true kingdom of God a praise guy so let's go to the back to the slideshow sorry I just had to come down a little bit home down down down to our level when so yeah brace guy they bring back the PowerPoint saying so I suggest Saints that brother and brother wait he's doing a series on the Romans right now downstairs and you know just look into the book of romans you reread that because paul brought such incredible balance in this script in the scriptures amen it was such a balanced person amen they would take all these all these things that we still you know you'd think people fifty years now that we've been in the message and all this legalism and all these things that people still involved in isn't wrong anything it's made more people rebellious has made young people leave the church it's made you know as not one souls to the head kingdom we are about sweating souls right it's not about it's not about you know the do's and don'ts amen give them the kingdom of God internally first and the do's and dont's they'll do they'll know what the do's and don'ts are they then you don't have to fuss and fight with your young with a young girl where does she want to wear pants or wear a skirt they'll know amen God will teach him praise God all right so next slide I appreciate the brothers in the back now we still got time praise God now brother Brown says you're God's God's blood bound promises makes us free from sin and shame and different from the rest of the world you don't have to dress different anybody can dress different you have to be on the inside different right where's God the life is on the inside not dressing wearing the kingdom of God is not meat and drink or wearing of apparel but it's the long-suffering goodness gentlest pages in the Holy Ghost so brother Branham agrees praise God NYX now look what brother bran says here we'll just start right here then we're going to come over on the Armenian side what did they get works that's the holiness groups works bless God I'll let my hair grow out the women and oh praise God I won't even wear a short-sleeved shirt the man will and so forth like that that has nothing to do with the kingdom amen that has nothing to do with Kingdom no sir you can let your hair grow long you can wear dresses whatever you want to or you can do this that or the other and it won't have nothing at all to do with it if that kingdom of God is not inside of you first place God next slide hallelujah how many love the Lord praise God now look you can visit the same quote you're not saved because of your clothes and well you know when we first come into into the message you know and you know you think oh man I gotta straighten up I start wearing my Allah and we think the whole we're doing alright you know we're doing it right and then we like on prayer we like on reading the word we like on study but we were our long dresses and we wear you rather be baby studying and stuff like that you know that you're better off doing that if so God would just have made some patterns of such if it was if it was if we were saved by our clothes and then brother Dale he'd be in the back as you're leaving and passing out the patterns so that you can come to church the next address just like that because let me tell you sites there's churches that do that I've been in them you know and you the spirit is different there's like no liberty amen you're saved because that God saved you by grace and you do these things just in appreciation amen common decency will tell you that you do those things in appreciation thanks God next slide alright so let's talk about and not far from the kingdom amen and now I was reading this today and I got the Lord showed me something here that it was was good well let's read mark chapter 12 this is uh Jesus says I'm one of the scribes came and haven't heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all and jesus answered him said the first of all the commandments is hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord now that is not the commandment in Exodus chapter 20 this is Deuteronomy chapter 6 alright because when you first look at this and you read it and you reread fast which we shouldn't we should read take our time reading the word amen and we think oh that's Ten Commandments right but God gave Israel all kinds of Commandments right and they're all scattered in different parts of Leviticus Deuteronomy and all in numbers and things and in verse in verse 30 and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment you'll find this in Deuteronomy Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 4 that's where you'll find that NIC next slide and look what Jesus says the second commandment is and the second is like because the the the scribe was asking him what is the first and the best of the most important commandment but remember when Jesus said if somebody asks you or somebody wants your your tunic you know give them your another part of his clothes and getting the whole thing Jesus always gives it a little extra yeah as you can see because he only asked for the first one just one commandment but Jesus gives them to another one he says and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbour as there is none other commandment greater than these and then you'll read that in in Leviticus I have it written down right here Leviticus Leviticus chapter 19 verse 18 if you read that scripture this is what it says thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people amen but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I am the Lord amen so so so and so let's continue reading and the scribe said unto him well master - said the truth for there is one God and there is none other but he so he agreed with what Jesus was talking about right and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is more than all hole burnt offerings and sacrifices in other words that's those two commandments are more important than any of the other things that God had already given the you know God would prefer that he do they do this instead of the sacrifices and all these things right and so and so and when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly in other words wisely he said unto Him thou art not far from the kingdom of God but was he in the kingdom of God that didn't put him in the kingdom of God right no he said they are not far from the kingdom of God so you can agree with the word he agreed with Jesus himself but that has nothing to do with a new birth that doesn't mean you're born again that doesn't mean because let me tell I wondered this scrubb we don't have any record that this scribe was in the upper room I don't know maybe he was maybe it was and I don't know I don't think so or them he maybe later on received the Lord I don't know more than likely he did it but I don't know but you see he but Jesus said you're not far from the kingdom you said you're not in the kingdom just because you agreed with me you can agree with Jesus you can agree with the pastor you can agree with with the with the minister all you but that has nothing to do with you being in the kingdom of God you need an experience with God amen so young people you come to church you could be here every single day of your life every Sunday not miss a service that has nothing to do with you having the kingdom of God inside of you how do you treat your mom and dad do you obey your parents because the Bible says so do you respect your parents I'm talking out to the young people or do we respect one another and then sometimes we lack respect for one another we treat each other so so loosely I mean somebody gets offended and then you know next that's that goes for me too next slide alright and this is a this is a brother branham was he he was in a nurse's office and the lady asked brother brandon says what denomination of church do you belong to you can read the whole thing if you want get a copy and I said oh I belong to the oldest denomination that there is and she said what denomination is that I said it's the one that was organized before the world ever was organized oh she said what I don't believe I know just that she said I belong to a certain church is that is that is it that organization next slide I said no ma'am that was only about two hundred years ago that organization but this organization started when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy when they seen the coming of a savior to redeem mankind and she just stopped rubbing my back and I was stooped a little over this way so the lady could rub and she was from near accordian down here and when we got to talking and she said sir I've always believed that if God ever was God he's still God today just like he was in the old days she said though my church flatly denies that but I believe that it is the truth she's agreeing with what brother Brandon was telling her right and Berggren says and I said you're not far from the kingdom of God John all right she said if he ever was a healer isn't he still here I said he most certainly is my amen praise God next but that didn't put her in the kingdom she wasn't in the king already that didn't put her in the king that's a novel read this one then we'll move on the day after our meeting in Phoenix there's a little lady came up and said brother brown since the meetings said I let my hair grow I said you're not far from the kingdom now but that didn't save her she said my sister had a wheelbarrow full of these shorts and things she was going to throw them in the garbage can and the next sister come along and got them and said she was finished with those things so I said that's alright I believe the church will come back on its feet someday if it keeps going on like that it'll get alright alright next next next alright next next these are other just examples of when brought their brother Baron told somebody you're not far from the king right so I'm bringing it down you know first seek you first the kingdom all right that's why I put that there first second you can be close to the kingdom but not in the kingdom you can be so close to the word but not have the word in you write the word has to go through a new birth right now so how do you enter into this kingdom hey man as we've read this many times well let's let's pay close attention to it there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou dost except God be with him right so they recognized that they need that jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto you in other words this is very important that you hear this Nicodemus except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God now we know that the kingdom of seeing is understanding the kingdom of God he cannot even understand the kingdom of God if you're not born again alright next Nicodemus saith unto Him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's and be born what a carnal question but that's as far as Nicodemus knew at the time right jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God wherever you see water you always see the spirit amen they go hand in hand that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit a man so if you're born of God your will be godly you're right amen you're God hey man if you're born of the flesh you're just the devil you're doing the things of the devil right Ray's guy Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again in other words don't be surprised that I'm telling you this now watch this because sometimes we read the scripture down here and we don't I don't never really paid attention but God showed me something here the wind bloweth where it listeth in other words when you see the wind blowing it goes wherever you want it right you can't control it right and now here's the sound thereof you can hear the wind blowing but Ken's not tell whence it cometh sometimes you can't tell where the wind comes from and whither it goes right so is every one that is born of the Spirit right I think about that sense because Saints to me to me this ties in directly with with the Bible where it says in Hebrews amen faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen right we're born again of faith right where the bram said that we're born again at faith but sometimes Saints you you can sometimes you cannot explain your new birth week in holic we can't explain what it is you know God has been working with us different ways and it's sometime something that's because Jesus even says is the wind blows were enlisted and then you cannot tell where it cometh where it go with him and so is every one that is born of the Spirit it's something that you cannot see something that you cannot hear amen but you know it's there because you see the effects of right that's the important eye that's the important part amen praise God you see the manifestations of that praise guy let's go to the next slide in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 26 oh let's get this done alright yeah than that next next next next next alright so how do you enter into this kingdom better yet how does this Kingdom enter into you right because that's what it's all about having the kingdom in us right but jesus said you know if my word about and you in you and I if I bought in you and you abide in me when you have the kingdom inside of you you automatically abiding in him amen praise God there is only one way brother Branham said in 1963 you are born into the kingdom of God how by the Holy Ghost that's God's witness he gives witness by the Word of God that we've passed from death unto life because we are in the kingdom of God amen you're born by the word amen no matter what it looks like here but better than in 1950 Oh God he says here jesus said except a man be born of water and spirit he cannot see the kingdom of God in other words he can't understand the kingdom of God until he's born again see you you have to accept it by faith you born again have faith right praise God you have to accept of it and when and then when he comes into you you understand it hey man that was 1950 praise God next slide that's why the scripture says Saints that the natural man does not understand that things of God because to him is craziness right yeah to him is you know I don't understand but if he gets the new birth amen and you're born by the water in the spirit which is the word right and Jesus said my words are spirit and life right if you're born by those things by that word if you're born again by that word you're going to understand more of the word you see how simple God is that's simple but we just make it so complicated and we try to make people do all kinds of things to be born again and get saved and all I had to do is get a revelation in that word it's your personal revelation amen oh Christ this to you and that's what brother Branham said amen question and answers 1959 brother man says verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God now you couldn't see the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God is the Holy Spirit you see what Jesus said you can see the wind bloweth and you'll go it listed but you cannot tell so is them that are born of the Spirit jesus said that see because the kingdom of God is the Holy Spirit you can't see that kingdom some standing here will not taste the debt till they see the kingdom coming in power he said then the kingdom of God the Bible said is within you it's within you the Holy Spirit and you can't see that with your eyes so see means to understand amen I mean you're still with me I appreciate your patience I appreciate you listening next amen all right now you remember when we read in Luke chapter 17 when Jesus said were it again and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation in other words it's something that cannot be seen nobody's gonna say there's the kingdom of God there's the kingdom of God usually that's what's that's the false thing [Laughter] because got something that's not how God works you know what Saints that cloud appeared amen only a little small portion here on earth knows that that cloud appeared on Jesus just a very my Newt but it was it was there was big but only on my new people my new portion of people know what that's all about aren't you thankful that you want God and God didn't send no fireworks with it or anything like that nothing explosive nothing a met it was so simple and so Amen that's how God does you know brother Branham said that Jesus was on earth and and only three quarters or more of the whole earth didn't even know that Messiah was on earth that's how God does things neither saw they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within them right and to think that the kingdom of God is working in a people right now in a multi-member broad Amen the bride of Jesus Christ and and and and people shooting birds at you and then and cursing you out and things like that if they just knew what they went lies within you they probably wouldn't do that I had a situation there in Canada when I was there in Canada where unfortunately I got upset God was driving in a median took over mm I got in the median to take over me is uh no not another interstate on a highway took over me and took over the car in front of me and I got up to the red light the next red light and I said hey buddy what's the rush and then I red light turned green and I just kept going no I shouldn't have done that because because my daughters were with me Christine was not with me at the moment so he got off the left turning less lane and he went to following me I said oh my and I was almost at my sister-in-law's house that at the next red light I was gonna turn left I said I better not because that's her subdivision so I better not she'll know he'll know where she lives and I don't want to do that so I just kept going or at that red light he got onto the on the right lane and he said what does it matter to you he started fussing at me and started screaming and I said listen listen listen bud I was trying to be as nice as I could listen but I got kids in the car I said you could have put them in danger and as I was saying that I saw in the backseat he had his wife with him on that next door his wife or his girlfriend driving a nice car he had and the backseat a little baby it can't be no more than two months old and driving like that I said looking you got a kid in the back and he said what does that matter to you I don't care it doesn't matter you know I just said learn I just closed my window back up and kept driving finally he got he got tired of following me and got in front of me and as they were passing me they they shot me the finger yeah number one I said I'm number they told me that was number one but you know what Saints if the world would just know who they were you know what lies within you and me they wouldn't do the things that they do I told Bella Bella was way bellows scared you know obviously and she I said I said Bella you see how the world is when they don't know God anyways so the kingdom of God is a mystery right Jesus declared that it was right look what it says here and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God it's a mystery they say he was talking to his disciples right now this is before they got the upper room experience the new birth hey weren't lady had the new birth but he said unto you is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them there are without all these things are done in parables in other words the day it's like Pilate they're they're listening but they don't listen they hear but they don't hear right Luke 8:10 until you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in parables that scene they may not see in here and they might not understand so so next slide Saints this is something that's done in secret it's a thing between you and God it's not anything as a public show or anything like that the kingdom of God is a mystery now reveals to it where cost is one well if I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God this is Paul speaking even the mystery which have been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his now has made manifest to his Saints right it's a mystery to the world but now it's made manifest to his Saints praise God to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory amen fact that God working in us amen dwelling in us live in his life through us doing miracles through us amen that's a mystery to the world but it's revealed manifest to his Saints amen next and then in Hebrews chapter 11 now faith is the so it's difficult to explain a new birth yet you know it's taking place right some of us can pinpoint you know some of us comprar but you know but we know that God is doing or has worked in our life I believe God you know did a work in my life amen because you know what this work that he's doing is drawing me closer to his word amen and if something is drawing you away from his word then it's not a new birth it wasn't a word birth amen Hebrews 11 says now faith is the substance substance you know like when you're when you're drinking a soup you know and with some substance some but sometimes you you you wanna a thick soup you know not something so water you want something thick with vegetables in it and stuff like that you know something there's something real right and you think faith is not I can't see faith but faith is the substance of things hoped for amen the faith the evidence of things not seen amen the faith in the word Amen that's birthing you from day to day amen for it for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear now I put quanta there and if you a couple of months ago I preached a message called when God saw the light and in that message I explained about quantum mechanics and what quanta is but pretty much what quanta is is for example you take this pulpit this pulpit is made of molecules right they can see molecules through the microscope and then and then as it molecules and then atoms makes up molecules right and then but but after atoms is what's called quanta now they know it's there but they can't explain see it right that's the reason why the Bible says here says with so that things which are seen were not not made of things which do appear the things that you see amen the work that you and bringing down spiritual the work that you see that God is doing anything is made of things amen it's taken it's taking up of made up of things that the world cannot see you can't even fully understand but yet God is a man making it manifest to you hey man how in the world is that God is gonna he was walking with us and then yet God is dwelling in us amen right so so that's what quanta is you know and but yet you know what quanta holds all these things together what holds the quanta the molecules and the atoms together is light remember in Genesis chapter one when the Bible says and God God made heavens and earth what is it and God said there let there be light right that was not the Sun in the moon because God is light right because later on we see later in that chapter that the Sun the Moon and stars came all right so all these things are held by God your new birth is held by God amen praise God yet you don't see it the world doesn't see it they don't understand that they think you're foolish they'll shoot birds at you and all kinds of stains but yeah a man you're held by his life a man his word praise God praise God I hope you understand what I'm trying to get to in James chapter 2 verse 5 hearken my below brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom so you say I'm weak in faith God calls you rich in faith I'm just gonna stay with what the word says you know why was he watching me like brother whether jewel says I can't make it I have such low faith but the Bible says you're rich in faith a man rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom are you aired of the kingdom the new birth in a man your era of the camera a man new birth in your soul which he had promised to them that love him and then next praise God we're almost done here Saints next slide know where the brown says here 1960 the kingdom of God's within you so you couldn't actually see it lest you see it operating but the only way you'll ever be able to understand it you've got to be born again to be born again you've been filled with God's Spirit then you're in Christ and when you're in Christ the Holy Spirit that wrote the Bible that manifested Christ is in you to recognize his own self I like ya amen he recognizes a that's an attribute of mind he or she belongs to me hey man praise God amen so the kingdom of God is made up of attributes that cannot be seen or understood by the natural man amen praise God next slide 1959 question answers the question looks at things that he doesn't see with his eyes for we look at the unseen see how do you look at it with your inside eyes you see it by faith see and now to prove that the whole Christian armor is of unseen qualities right what is a Christian armor somebody says seeing is believing that person would never be a Christian because the armor of the Christian is made up of this love did you ever see it could you go to the store and say I want a pound of love two pounds of love no they can't give you that the world can't produce that you can you've never seen it but you know it's there right did you ever see it you've seen it in action but you never seen love if you can pull your part of love out and let me see what it looks like see look love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness faith gentlest see the whole Christian armor is unseen with the natural eye that's why the world can't see it but it's understood by the heart there you are there you are amen so it's unseen but it's working in you right now you can't see it you can't eemarle probably even explain it fully but you know it's there amen now the kingdom of God is not in word but in power but I will come to you in 1st Corinthians 4 I will come to you shortly the Lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power amen that's the reason why the letter and word quote so the message could kill you if that power is not there to guide you to put these things together Thanks you could read the word you could read the message and you could put quotes and quotes together and have your own thing and it kill you if it's not led by revelation of the Holy Spirit brother Branham knew what he was talking about but yet they've come out with polygamy being the seventh the the the Seventh Seal he knew what he was talking about anyway but that's what that's why the letter will but if you get in that spirit that spirits already in you a man it will give it'll bring life to those things Saints amen so it needs to be in power amen that power that kingdom a man that power of the Holy Spirit right what is this power acts 1:8 but ye shall receive power and that's the word Dunamis in the Greek right which which means a war are changing of the soul working in sin the soul right after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you this is what Jesus was telling you this is hypose and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth but they already had power the God had given them power Jesus had given them power in Matthew chapter 10 but that's only on the externals that's why I'm saying sayings you can you can you know people can cast out devils heal the sick and all these different things those things can take place and still the person not being born again because they happened to the disciples and Judas was there and Jesus said that and I know I've chosen one of you I've chosen all of you and one of you is not just doesn't have a devil but is a devil Judas standing right there amongst him he was able to do all those things but that's XOC a power if you look at the word that's EXO sia which means a man which is external a man next but I tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God and that's talking to the disciples that power a man yeah he called it the kingdom of God and then another verse that we read earlier he called it the Holy Ghost amen now listen closely I'm trying to finish up what is the kingdom of God is within you the kingdom is the kingdom's in you and when the word comes in there what does this word begin it turns itself into power making it say just exactly what it says amen you stay with that word there it is see and it makes it power Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and next now God's kingdom is not of this world and when Christ was here he give us the program of this kingdom he gave us the program of God's kingdom of the father's kingdom which is his word all right now if you want to know how you get into that kingdom this words got it that's what we need a word of word birth the kingdom was set up on the day of Pentecost and when man wanted to know how to get into this kingdom Peter said repair every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of that kingdom well that's Kingdom the Holy Ghost because that's what puts them into the kingdom a man next all right now this is Genesis 1:26 see God is trying to bring this back to that recognize that that that was the condition that Adam was in it was perfect amen now we know that he died so his flesh was not was not redeemed a man was not a man who died right but he's still he had eternal life amen he had eternal life and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea or the fowl of the air and you see the creation is groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of God and you know last night I was reading with the kids and my wife in psalms chapter 8 where David is talking about what is man that he that he's God's given dominion to to have rule over the fish of the sea and over what is it that he he he made him a little lower than the angels and all this thing and I'm thinking you know what David's talking about that and he's talking about about how Adam was because I mean at that point you know Adam David didn't have control over the fish of the sea I don't have any control efficiency unless you you fish them out but I can't tell the fish to go here to go there to have full power I can't tell a bird to go here I want you to stay on my shoulder and don't fly away you can't do that unless you you know you can't rein certain birds to do that but a bird out here you couldn't do it but Adam had that power right I believe that a man in the Smyrna Church age unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can train because power apart from character is satanic right but power with character is fit to rule amen and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down and his Father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him as a reason in Revelations that he that overcometh shall he that overcometh this he ever overcometh that amen and even in China a later on in Revelation there's even like an eighth overcoming where he's given all things amen praise God so Saints that's the reason why this kingdom of God needs to be in you first because God ultimately wants us to have the mean just like Adam had dominion over the externals but because you know he was it was God right he was an amateur God right here on earth amen and that's the same thing that God wants to do with us amen we have dominion over our kingdom first this kingdom amen then God can give us a man he we are fit to rule a man the external Kingdom later right praise God in other words get the new birth in your life if you don't have that we'll take care of all these other things amen praise God next that's why these virtues need to be established in the believers life after that kingdom has come in the valley amen I love this picture amen because it's got building his kingdom right this is the statue of a perfect man with this represents a men ee the the believers life as well as well they men but you know what Peter talked about having these things in our life amen but that's not to save us statue a perfect man is not to save us it's after you're saved after you're born again then you add to your faith amen virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience add to your faith amen that's what Peter said so Peter must have known a man he knew that this had happened this was happening in his life a manner that he needed to talk about it so if it's in the word I believe it's important whoever said you don't need these virtues is lying to you because the Word of God talked about it and brother Brendan preached the whole service about it for you to say I don't need that my goodness cuz cuz Saints amen he is the head of it all right man he's the head of it all they mana and and and and and so that's what we're trying to reach st. st. but I believe that the amen you have everything in you already potential we just needed for it to manifest on the outside amen praise God next alright we're almost done we just got like two or three more slides and then we'll be done now if you read Daniel chapter 2 you notice there that God that this the Nebuchadnezzar had a dream right and this statue was built a man and then you see the gold the gold head which represents all these different empires and then even the bottom I own in the clay modern powers book brother BAM called it Romanism and Christianity a man at the end and you notice you see how that's Satan's Kingdom right Satan's Kingdom has no foundation Satan's Kingdom was built this way but God's kingdom was built from the feet up that's the reason why this kingdom amen when that rock came down if you read in Daniel chapter 2 when that rock came down amen from the mountain amen it struck the feet of the statue a man and it crumbled in pieces because it had no foundation no sure foundation it fakes it has a foundation but it's nothing sure hey you man now if our foundation is the Word of God and then next so Satan builds his kingdom with no sure foundation the head down to the feet that's why it falls apart Christ builds his kingdom from the feet to the head amen praise God next Daniel chapter 2 verse 35 then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broke into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors this is a man when that rocky now and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain that stone amen that smote the image became a great mountain amen and filled the whole earth praise God amen now I like this verse here in Daniel 2:44 in st. chapter I recommend you read this at home and in the days of these kings these physical kings that we're just in that statue shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom so they're saying no their kingdom but God said no his kingdom amen he's been setting enough which shall never be destroyed and the Kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and the it shall stand forever hallelujah amen praise God so the Saints we're bringing it from the spiritual internal bringing it to a physical sea now we're turning to physical God's gonna have a physical Kingdom hey man praise God but it's got to start in you first the other word cuz he wants people with character to rule and reign in this kingdom right next alright well if you read Daniel chapter 7 this the only Chatwood book in the in the Old Testament that you find the word Saints normally you see the but the word Saints in the New Testament this is the only chapter or only book that you see the word Saints I think it's two or three times that you see it in there talking about how the Saints were gonna possess this kingdom I was talking about you in this sense Daniel was seeing things amen that that's Amen I just put myself in that word next Amen now brother Brown says in the future home God already took up his abode potentially the kingdom of God is in the earth now right in the hearts of his Saints it's his attributes that he began in the beginning hey now his attributes as redeemed are you reading that what's he waiting to redeem the earth to set his attributes on it to really rain a man just like that just like Adam had to full reign over the earth they meant to fulfill exactly his predestinated planet do you see it brother Branham says and in Christ the mystery of God revealed then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of God is within you said the Bible Jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the Kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life bring it to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the wording God was one and the word and God is one of his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning in the Garden of Eden that's that's right there that's the plan of God right there raised God and that's what God is doing right now yet the world has no clue where Gerald the world has no clue what a privileged people we are such a man I'm so thankful to be part of that Redeemer amen next so Saints is the key them of God is is it external or is it internal but Dick said it it's both but it's got to be an internal first manifest on the exterior amen see it's both hallelujah has to begin internally within you in order to manifest externally that's the kingdom of God amen next the Saints I just want you all to read Matthew chapter 6 with me just a few verses Matthew of burden or the Lord's Prayer I'll read the first verse you can read this and so on after this manner therefore pray our Father which are in heaven hallowed be thy name kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and all together and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen praise God that's that's a powerful verse that right there is everything that we just talked about in that little verse and we read that right now we just repeat it and we know it but we're not thinking one thing about what Jesus was talking about that's the kingdom of God stands but it has to be established in you first in you so that it can manifest on the outside say me how many love the Lord praise God let's stand to our feet amen I appreciate your patience I normally don't do all that reading but but Saints I believe there's more of a teaching mmm this evening amen and if you need a copy if you want a copy of these of this PowerPoint presentation I'll be more than glad to give you a copy or support one of the
