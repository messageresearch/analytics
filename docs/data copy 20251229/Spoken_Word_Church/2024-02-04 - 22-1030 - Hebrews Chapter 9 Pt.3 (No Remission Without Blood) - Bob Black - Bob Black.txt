========================================

God bless you Saints good to be in the house of the Lord a beautiful day I love this fall weather it's good to be a Christian Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together with you today Lord and we just ask Lord that you'll come in Among Us this morning Lord Jesus and open up these scriptures Lord as we study these things out Lord bless us bless brother Wade as he's preparing bless our hearts Lord Jesus and help us Lord to be prepared to receive Lord in your name Amen in Hebrews we're we're uh I keep saying we're almost chapter 10 we really are um we're uh so Hebrews chapter 9: 21 just to kind of to uh talk about that for a few moments this morning says moreover he sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission you can't have remission without blood brother Ram would say and the law having a shadow back in 1954 he said if a man lives good enough if a man lives good enough he'd be God himself if he could live good enough I said look life lies in the blood cell and without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin innocent substitute has to take a guilty Sinner's place oh I want you to get this now notice an innocent substitute must take the guilty one's place and it happened in Eden that same way that when Adam sinned he cut off his fellowship with God the father and when he had sinned before he could stand before God God had to kill some sheep perhaps whatever it was and make it covering blood had to be offered in substance because the Bloods were life lead and God required life at sin so it ain't how good you live it's how good God Lives God is the one it it's God's life that paid the price in the water of Separation in 1955 brother R said now God telling Moses and Aaron as he was the prophet and priest Moses the prophet Aaron the priest he said now I want you to go out and get a heer a young heer which is all one color one complete color red red we always think looks of the red as danger red does signify danger or life or so forth but red in the scripture signifies Redemption through the blood Harlot Rahab when she put the Scarlet streak down and all through the Bible is a Scarlet Street Redemption comes through red through the shedding of the blood and without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin and how that God said go get this heer that's red all over not one spot of anything else but perfectly red but God looked through red and you know what color red is looking through red red through red makes white try it one time red through red produces white so when God looks through the blood of Jesus Christ to we who are Scarlet Red with sin and covered by the blood he sees us white as snow though your sins be red like Crimson they shall be white like snow in the water of Separation he said God looking through the blood he doesn't see you no more as a sinner he sees you redeemed you're redeemed because he's always sees you through Christ that's the reason we can be perfect not perfect in the sense of sinless we're perfect in the eyes of God when we're in Christ not not perfect in the sense of you're not going to make any mistakes through your your Christian Journey but perfect in the sense of God's looking through at you through his blood now that's the reason he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect Paul in the 10th chapter of Hebrews trying to explain the law having a shadow of good things to come not the very image of the things could never make the come or unto perfect because God was looking through animal blood but now he looks through the blood blood of his son Perfection come by Jesus Christ in the message Fellowship brother BR said then that's elaser after killing the hepher burning her while she was bleeding he made a public testimony dipping his fingers and striping seven times over the door that's seven times if we had time to go into it represents the seven Church Ages Every age every person every time must recognize the blood for without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin then before you could come into Fellowship he had to look up and recognize that something died in his stead and went on before him he said in in the message Fellowship every man today no matter how many churches you join how many pages you turn you've got to recognize that Christ died in your stead and went on before you making a way and through his blood you are a Sanctified vessel unto the Lord not your sanctification not laying in something you did but his his sanctification through him who gave himself for us died in our stead let that Faith go to work down in the heart one time and watch what takes place now there's there's something to meditate on let that go to work in your heart one time and watch what takes place and it's not something you have to do but just believe in Jesus Christ that he's looking at you through the blood all of you you don't have to take some man's Theory you got the word that's right now in the Bible if we we kind of meditate on this further if we go back in Leviticus chapter 4 and and Leviticus chapter 4 is where if you want to study that out a little bit further is where over and over he repeats the process if the priest has done anything wrong if the whole congregation's done anything wrong if the individual's done anything wrong if they've committed a sin of ignorance then blood will be offered and it goes through how that the the sacrifice is offered and they you lay your hands on that sacrifice and the blood is sprinkled seven times because you're you're you're having confidence and faith that you're you're trans what you're actually doing is transferring your sin to that animal to that innocent animal and you're taking the innocence of that animal and transferring it to you and now in the New Testament you're taking your your sin and transferring it to Christ and his innocence is transferred back to you oh you think how powerful that is that's that's something real now Leviticus chapter 4 if we just meditate on this scripture and go back and it says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel saying if a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of The Commandments of the Lord you you think about our sin of ignorance you didn't know nothing you were ignorant about the gospel until you heard the word preached and even sometimes you hear you hear the word preached wrong and and so you're ignorant of the way that it's really preached but then your eyes have Enlighten your eyes become enlightened and open and you realize that you've done you've done something wrong and you were ignorant before but now you realize your guilt is in and and plain plainly displayed before you and so you come you come with your sacrifice like they did in the Old Testament you come and you lay your hands on that sacrifice because you were ignorant before but now you realize what what what position you're in if a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of The Commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done and shall do against any of them if the priest that is Anointed do sin according to the sin of the people then let him bring for his sin which he ha sin a young bullet without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering it's got to be without blemish because he's your he's transferring his innocence to you and he shall bring the bulock under the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord and shall lay his hand upon the Bullock's head and kill the bulock before the Lord and the priest that is Anointed shall take of the Bullock's blood and bring it to the Tabernacle of the congregation and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord before the veil of the sanctuary seven times because speaking now just like every everything in the Old Testament is a type many things of the in the Old Testament type of the of the reality that we're living under now that now we're living under each Church age is sprinkled under the blood of Christ and every everyone that comes to Christ has to come by with faith in what Christ has done for us by shedding his blood and if you go down through Leviticus chapter 4 uh 4 he he it talks about the congregation the whole Congregation of the if the whole Congregation of Israel sin through ignorance and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly and they have done to see if it's if it's hidden from you you don't know but when the gospel is preached when the message is preached then your ignorance is taken away and you realize and they have done somewhat against any of The Commandments of the Lord concerning things which should not be done and are guilty when the sin which they have sinned against that is known then the congregation shall offer a young bullet for the sin and bring him before the Tabernacle of the congregation and the Elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bulock before the Lord you got to be identified with it you got you got to you put your hands on it except that that animal is that that sacrifice is dying for you that it's not just some ritual or something but you're involved in it and the bulock shall be killed before the Lord and the priest that is Anointed shall bring of the Bullock's blood to the Tabernacle of the congregation and the priest shall dip his finger and some of the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord even before the veil and and the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord even before the veil and he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the Lord that is in the Tabernacle the congregation and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering which is at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation you know many times they they stumbled at what the horns of the altar meant they they they couldn't find it until one day they they they uncovered an altar that had been buried or or lost for a while and there was these things on the on the corner and you know in the Scripture it talks about many times they would grab old to the horn to the altar when they got desperate you ever get into a place like that where you really get desperate that God would forgive you and that God will change change your life put something on the altar you can grab on to and he shall take all his fat from him and burn it upon the Altar and he shall do with the bulock as he did with the bullet for a sin offering so shall he do with this and the priest shall make an atonement for them now here's the main the main punch line the main kicker and it shall be forgiven them when you come and you've done everything that God's required and you put put your faith you put your put your faith towards his atoning sacrifice your sins are forgiven they're gone and you don't have to you thank God this morning you don't have to come drag a lamb into the church this morning or kill it outside but all you've got to do is put Faith put your faith in in Jesus Christ accepting that he died for you and so John first in first John chapter 1 he said this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin now there's a scripture that you can hang on to because that means he cleanses you from every sin no matter what you've done no matter what and and will you you could unroll The Scroll of all the most heinous crimes murderer molester whatever it is all covered in this scripture that he cleanseth you from all sin he can take all of that sin away all the if you've murdered your brother if you if you if you back talked if you if you gossiped if you if you've lied if you lied to your parents if you lied to your children confess it to Jesus Christ and it'll all be taken care of because his blood you got to you got to go through the the the process though you can't just just say ignore it you got to put your hands on that put your hands on that sacrifice accept what Christ has done and that's what uh Charles Spurgeon was saying when he preached a sermon he said has it suddenly come to the knowledge the knowledge of your sin of ignorance the knowledge of any person here that he has sinned as he thought he had not sinned has some fresh Light broken in upon you and revealed to you your Darkness did you come to this house depressed in spirit because you have discovered that you are guilty and must perish unless the mercy of God prevent you then Come Ye common people who have discovered your sin and bring your sacrifice that it is here already for you come and accept the sacrifice which God provides and let your sin be forever put away and brother R said and identify with Christ he said in the Old Testament when a man want to be identified at the house of God he took the most innocent thing he could find a lamb and he know the lamb was free from sin CU it know no sin and he went and took the lamb and put his hand upon his head and confessed his sin and by faith he transferred his sins on the lamb and the innocence of the Lamb back on him now there's there's kind of the gist of this now to to think about this is to meditate on this morning that you can your sins will be everything you've done all of your past will be transferred to Christ and his innocence will be transferred back to you if you believe it and then the lamb died because it was a sinner and the man lived by an Act of Faith of obeying what God Said but what did he do he went right back out of the temple with the same desire he had when he come in because when that blood cell is broken which the Life Starts in one blood cell and when that blood cell was broken the life of the Lamb would not coincide or come back into the human life because it was an animal life the man went out with the same desire he had so therefore he committed sins continually all the time again but there come a time when God made us an an example and he gave us the Lord Jesus and when a sinner puts his hands upon his precious head and confesses his sins and his sin is transformed or transferred from The Sinner to Jesus and the innocence of Jesus is transferred by the Holy Ghost back into that person he's a new creature in Christ Jesus that's where I want to be identified the Bible said he knowing no sin was made sin for us the reason he suffered was for our sins and it's no more than what is right right no more than our duties to look at these things and see that these desires that we have that God put in us to create in us to make us to want to be like him I I I hope maybe this this morning as you as we meditate on these scriptures you can see the effect of the blood that the effect of the blood is it takes away the sin curse it take it blots out all of your past but it also will transform your life to make you have new desires to make you want to be more like Christ Christ to make you begin to walk in his footsteps so that that same life is Manifest in you so that the essence of the Old Testament law is fulfilled in your life because you're changed now you got that you got that that blood covering where Christ when you make a mistake you get back up again because Christ is looking at you through the blood but it's changing your life all the while and if God be with us then where is all the Miracles brother Ram said he was God of the Old Testament he was God of the New Testament he's the same Nam God today yesterday today and forever and you know then down in your heart that a supernatural work has been done by a supernatural being when you once drank and smoked and lied and you women love the world so much you kept wearing your makeup and your long or short hair and doing other things you did and you find out that something happens and all the devils in Hell couldn't make you do it again something happened a miracle was performed what did he do changed your vile heart changed your desires changed your nature a supernatural word by a supernatural God made a creature of time to a creature of Eternity took the world out of you and put Christ in you the hope of glory and you're filled with his spirit and ready to meet him so that's what Paul's talking about when he said it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heaven should be purified Within I made a change last night and it's it's not here anyway what what does that mean it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these sometimes it's a little bit hard to understand what Paul's point is with these These Old Testament sacrifices of an animal but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these with the sacrifice of Christ himself these are purified with these but these these are purified with the sacrifice of Christ for Christ has not entered into the holy Place made with hands which other figures of the truth but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entered into entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the Judgment so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation you you notice how how everything that Paul says is just packed it's like a little sermon into itself could you imagine listening to to Paul speak these words and I'm sure many of them pondered about what what do you mean shall he appear the same second time and now we can look plainly back back through time and and understand these things now if we if we kind of break this down in all the different Bible translations the Aramaic Bible in plain English says in this way also the Messiah was offered one time and he slaughtered in his person the sins of the many but the second time he appears without our sins for the life of those who expect him so the first time Christ comes and is manifested in the flesh as the son of man he come to pay the price for our sins but the next time he's coming to get you and to bring you to himself in the Waymouth New Testament it says so the Christ also having been once offered in sacrifice in order that he might bear the sins of many will appear a second time separated from sin to those who are eagerly expecting him to make their salvation complete to make their salvation complete in other words not to just die for your sins and and to and to and to put into the mouths of the disciples the ability to preach the the the salvation of your soul but to bring full Redemption when Christ comes the second time he's going to he's going to make your salvation complete so that you can take a body change a new revised Standard Version it says so Christ having been offered once to Bear the sins of many will appear a second time not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him so let's go back to what Paul said so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation and brother R would say who's he going to appear to those that are looking for him he said now why didn't he why didn't he do those signs for the Gentiles and never was performed for him by him why Gentiles wasn't looking for no Messiah they were heathens we were our people Romans and so forth back there with a club on their back worshiping Idols they wasn't looking for no Messiah and Messiah only comes to those who are looking for him that's the only way to them that look for him will he appear the second time just those who are looking for him not just who who pertaining but those who are really looking for him and notice he never come to Gentile that that miracle was never performed before a gentile and the unchangeable God now we've had 2,000 years of scholarship and all kinds of things and now it's come evening time and now the Gentiles are looking for a coming Messiah so before it was the Jews looking for looking for and so he came to them and they rejected him but now the Gentiles are looking for him and so those are the ones that he comes to now if he's the same he appeared the same then to them two tribes he's got to appear the same way there and promise though and it is I Be not Afraid brother B said now when Jesus was on Earth he declared himself to be the Messiah and John declared there was a Messi sign sign following him and the Old Testament claimed there be a Messi sign and he proved that Messiah sign to the people that he was the Messiah how' they know he was a god Prophet Moses the one that they had followed said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like an eny we know that we're aware of that and amongst the Jews and Samaritans he showed this sign but of course he never amongst the Gentiles because we were heathens in those days our people the Gentiles Romans we wasn't looking for no Messiah and Messiah only appears to those looking for him that's the way those who wait for him he will appear the second time so it would behoove us tonight to be waiting for him and watching for him that we do not miss it when he comes and and what was the Holy Ghost given for brother R said I can hear the water splash Yonder on the Ohio River when I was a little boy old boy preacher about 22 years old singing that there and I heard looked up above me and I Heard a Voice said look up here here comes that big light hanging right Yonder Come moving down over me and said as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ you'll have a message that'll forun the second coming of Christ all right so now we know we know what we're looking for that as John the Baptist foran the first coming of Christ to die for our sins there would be another Forerunner to come to prepare the way for the second coming of Christ oh how could I believe it but it happened just the same and tonight Revival fires I love this quote I used to read this quote when I was when I was young this is this is amazing tonight Revival fires are burning around and around the world the great Ransom Church of God lifted herself out of that place and great campaigns of healing and signs and wonders and miracles showing forth the coming and so you'll see his coming you'll see him if you're looking for him the second time so we can see now I know I know for a lot of us sitting here this morning this maybe this is a is is dialing things way back going back to the very Foundation but sometimes you know you never know who who who doesn't quite uh see see things so um we're we're just kind of go slowing down a little bit to to tackle this you look at this pattern now John the Baptist John the Baptist went out and and he he identified Jesus there in the water this the coming of the son of man D baptized and this is the one I'm not even worthy to unlash his shoe and and those kind of things here he's coming and I'm going to baptize him and and that conversation with Jesus there in the water to introduce the son of man and then you got brother brandham there in the water baptizing a as as this the voice says your message is going to full run just like John the Baptist did and you see that pattern is repeating so now now you know we've there's been a lot of confusion all down through the years of what we should be looking for and the people get their eyes on the messager instead of the one that's coming but now I think we can see plainly if you're looking what what you're looking for you're looking for that for that gospel message to be preached that introduc that reveals this the son of man that reveals Christ in flesh again so John in chap chapter three he said they came to John and said uh unto him Rabbi he that was with thee Beyond Jordan to whom thou bearest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him John answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from Heaven ye yourselves bear me witness that I said I am not the Christ but I am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled and it see in in that same in the same way we're rejoicing at the bridegroom's voice that's even why you know they call it the voice of God the voice of God Recordings because we're hearing not the voice of a man but we're hearing the voice of God the message that we're hearing did not come from some man's idea but it's com straight from the Throne of God and we know that because it actually uh illuminates these scriptures that we pondered at for so many years about Malachi 4 and and Luke 17 and Revelation 10 and and all of these scriptures that have been probed at in Ephesians 4 and second Peter 1 and things that that even the nominations cannot can only can only can can can just probe at so John said he must increase but I must decrease what's increasing increase the revelation of Jesus Christ in that day the revelation of Jesus Christ in this day as the messenger decreased the understanding the word the the manifestation of Christ in the midst of his people increased so Jes Jesus said in Matthew chapter 17 as the musicians come and we'll close on on this I had a few more slides I was going to show the uh how the Jews are looking for Elijah and Elijah Elijah always uh he's he he he coincides what they're look when they look for the Messiah the Jews are looking for Elijah too CU they know when Elijah is going to come Messiah is coming so Matthew chapter 17 Jesus said when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man Sav Jesus only and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead the second time and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias has come already that seems like a perplexing thing to say that he's come already but he's going to come he's come already but he's look for him to come and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist but he's speaking of this two-fold coming of Elijah that's spoken of in Malachi 456 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord now John the Baptist didn't come before a great and Dreadful day of the Lord not like that great and Dreadful means like the world's going to burn when the furth heat and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children now here we got a two-fold coming of Elijah he shall turn the heart of the father and both of these he's got a the the the uh the understanding of the people had to be changed and I'm right at time so that they can be prepared for Christ to come on the scene he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children the Old Testament fathers back to the new to the understanding of the to to to receive Christ to the Pentecostal children and the Heart of the children back to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers lest he come and smite the Earth with a curse and I'm right at time so I got to stop God bless you [Applause] am
