========================================

all right good to be here today in the house of the Lord hope everybody have a good week and now a good day beginning of another we're in church y really excited about that here yeah that's good good day to be alive good day to be good day to be in church God give us Grace to be in church and to be in the right one right Church of the firstborn amen man amen not just a physical building Church of the first born that's right all right so now we're on the fifth seal and uh we got a few things to cover today and then uh next Sunday we'll lap over and start talking about the Sixth Seal um man where's this year gone July the who's next you were last is it Louis's turn or your turn no you did it before him didn't you Joe did it before him where is Joe uh he's with his granddaughter she wanted to go to her Church Catholic church so it's Louis's yeah I guess all right all right July the 16th we'll let Louis do that now put on your calendars on the 14th of July that com L July the 14th on a Friday night at brother Tim H Church we're doing a special service and I'm doing the service starts at 7:30 if anybody wants to come so July the 14th it was suppos have been today but we changed it he wanted to do it on a special night where a lot of the ministers from around there could come so and we can't do it on Saturday night because they're having a a baby shower I mean not baby shower Lord bless you having a wedding shower for Andrew Glover and is new bride to be so hope it's not a baby and it's not a baby shower if you anybody sees it's not a baby shower it is a wedding household shower wedding shower householder yes household shower that's correct all right so now let's read this in the fifth seal when he had opened the fifth seal now remember all the combat Beast are gone so in other words we brother Brown says the Holy Ghost leades the Earth well now we know for a fact that the Holy Ghost leaves the Earth as we're going to be talking about today about this afternoon about theophanes and stuff like that it's going to you got to take that onion peel and you got to peel it back and the Holy Ghost you got to run it through your Holy Ghost filter which can't be different from mine but you got to run it through that and then we have to see that this is a natural happening this is a spiritual happening right and it's definitely spiritual because it's in another dimension these people that is talking to are already dead they're over in another dimension right okay excuse me actually John was caught up into another dimension I believe to see all this so he he's in a vision so he's in another dimension in a vision watching what's going on so um uh this is a supernatural happening it but it's going to be a total natural happening once we leave so when when I say that the Holy Ghost left the Earth then don't think that that there's not any Holy Ghost left the Holy Ghost for the Gentiles right the Gentile part of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in there soul is gone no other Gentile be saved right here we're looking at this right here this now right here foreal yes that's when we take a Rapture that's when the word's made manifest and we take a Rapture which is we Gentile Nations not the I want to say Jewish but it it's really there's going to be Jews in here but what I'm saying is when I say that uh you know brother R talking about theophanies and he and you got to be careful and watch because we're going to talk about this afternoon brother R talks about two Li two lives not two lives two lives l i f e s two lives that we are U that we're dealing with here so we'll continue on that we don't have two lives we have two lives there's two life forms that are working u in the Earth but when he had opened the fifth seal the Holy Ghost is gone for the Gentile dispensation but now what happens the Holy Ghost comes right back down in the Jewish dispensation the 3 and 1/2 years are the 1260 days and I was going to write that down I got my pins up yonder so I'm going to still use the board today if that's all right I guess not y'all sleep can you hear me yeah yeah okay yes yeah thank you anyway what was I going to write 126 thank you thank you yeah thank you that's why I have backup brother I'm telling you cuz during that 1260 days what's going to happen here see we're going to narrow this thing down when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held which was what which was the 6 and2 million Jews that were killed under I and Hitler and going on back to Christ time okay is that all right okay all right now what started the ball rolling I was thinking day I need to bring this in but remember when when they said let his blood be on us and our children the Jews said crucify him let his blood be on us the people standing there in ad30 getting ready to crucify Jesus and our children so you got this that spoke all when they spoke that a thunder went off in heaven and that's what broke you all the seals BR yeah the seals broke down here but something broke this hadn't been written yet right this had not been written physically written John was had not been on patmas at the time that they said let his blood be on us and our children but God knew before the foundation of the world so he backed her up to his forn knowledge went ahead and wrote it knowing they were going to say it okay so that to me that makes pred ation and and poor knowledge and all that so simple is that he saw them stand one day and reject him let his blood be on us and our children so we already wrote it that's right okay cuz remember the children part is the on that's going to be giv white robes right right the children the CH they's blood be on us and our children but remember the prophet God told us that God blinded their eyes so they couldn't see the Messiah so that me and you could come in that Gap and that Danel 70 weeks of the of the seven Church ages okay that's how we came in but now so this is talking directly to the Jews but there is a supernatural spiritual Revelation in this that is far beyond just people killing and dying and saying they love the Lord and saying they do this okay so that's the onion peel the onion peel is yes there is a fifth seal Jew is going to be put into a place already now they're there right they're there now they weren't all they weren't there when John saw this so John is projected all the way to this end time right past the Rapture and what and he sees this all right and man has probed at this and many people talk about that being the the the Saints even brother vandom you can watch him he he leans a little bit toward that back in his earlier Ministry how long how long but he never says to avenge our blood right see that that's the difference cuz when cuz when brother Bram comes to the opening of the seals he says now I read this different now I read it different now he said avenge our blood it has nothing to do with the Christian a Christian would not say Lord when are you going to avenge me right no it was father forgive them they don't know what they're doing so that's not the spirit of Christ dwelling in the inside man right okay so that if you you look at these in the Bible there are certain keys that will tell you what the underlying meaning or the or the or the meaning that it's coming out of is that now we look but now look if we were to read this without any observation of the message or without the Holy Ghost you would think white robes you would think those would be s in people that's right right right we think and and many commentary if you read them go back oh these are the Saints these are the standing people cuz look white robes were given right not tra that's why the seals had to come to turn that thing around and line it back up to where it's supposed to go okay and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true dust thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth now what are they doing they must be able to see back out of that Dimension over into this Dimension good L will you July the what did I say 14 no 14th is when I'm going to 16th July 16th that's Sunday he teaches Sunday school okay if he's not here you you sing all way yeah you can say oh yeah no doubt no doubt you probably get a better response than I do from this grrip and the grip says amen we're listening and they cry with a loud voice saying how long the Lord holy and true now how long white robes were given under every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season what a couple thousand years right okay rest for a couple thousand years cuz remember we got whatever time we get out of here the 1260 days are going to be these people right here okay until there fellow servants which is who if he's talking to Jews then he's talking to Jews okay right if if the fellow are if you're talking about if Jews are there then you're talking about Jewish people right what I'm saying is there's no way this fifth seal is going to break in the United States of America remember Israel you look at them coming back now they got to come back to the Homeland right the only place they're going to be to hear those two prophets has got to be in Jerusalem yes right go what God say he said I'm not even going to talk to you outside of the your outside of your land that's why when they were dispersed God quit doing with them they were dispersed all over the place God didn't you know why cuz he said he wouldn't that's right he said you congregate back come back to Israel and that's what they're doing now that's why they're all coming back like the brother said I mean you don't you just got you don't even have to really hardly prove that you're you know you Jew way back 20 Generations just as long as you can prove that then they'll give you automatic citizenship you know they want the Jews to come back why because God's got to sift out 144,000 people okay so there's got to be they can't be you know all of all of Israel couldn't have 120,000 people in it there's got to be 144,000 that's going to accept the message out of all that couple of million people okay all right so until their fellow servants also and their Brethren their brothers that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled that's going to take the 1260 days to fulfill that right all right so now so I think we've got the idea there's no combat Beast this is looking into another dimension white robes were given to a group of people that said avenge our blood that really didn't have the what we say brother Brown talks about the right attitude they didn't have the right attitude right all right but God promised them that he'd never forget them he promised he'd never leave them he said I'm married to you whether I divorced you or not at one time you were married to me but now you're going to have to take a different position okay you might have to take a different place all right because only in that City inside that four wall City the new city the New Jerusalem is going to be that 144,000 and us right okay not counting your Apostles and Prophets cuz everybody else going to live outside the city right I was thinking the other day you know we were talking about I think we're talking about camping uh somebody asked about the area of the Earth well if There's 7 billion people living on the earth now and we're not crowded sure certain places are but if you dispersed everybody out you wouldn't be crowded but four fifths of this world is water right right and I don't think it's what it was back before the flood so it's going to go back to big land masses and and and like somebody asked who was it somebody asked here about um that be no more they said something about ocean who was it somebody asked it try2 2y2 son yeah she was she was worried about there not being any ocean cuz the Bible say there' be more sea I said the Bible didn't say it wouldn't be no more ocean the Bible said it wouldn't be no more sea why exactly the Mediterranean Sea is right there and here's Jerusalem well now if that City pushes up it's 1500 miles just to come incompass the city well there'll be any more seity they can't not be any more ocean God created whales that's right and God created sharks and all that that's in the water he can't do away with it that's right so there'll be a lot of oceans but there'll be a lot of land mass but you got to think we're just talking about a small minute group of people think about all the children that's been killed before the age of accountability from the dawn of time to today right man you talking about billions of people there's billions of children that's just going to be given eternal life because they're children they didn't grow up all the way to to uh to make a choice that's right besides all these other ones you know besides all the ones that come to adul so it's a glorious thing and I'm not worried about it cuz God you how big to make the Earth before this thing even got started he's not going to have to go I think I might need to make that just a little no it's perfect it's exactly what he said he saw it that's the way it's going to be and I just rest assured that I got my space in the city that's all I'm worried about I got my space in the city I got okay me and Jim going to walk around in that City and we're going to have a house all right and then you do the same thing why I got off on I don't have a clue anyway but look Watch What Happens though now I want to look at something else we we were talking last Sunday about this little word called Grace now the grace of God is that he gives eternal life that somebody doesn't want it right to me that's I can't fathom that because I'm looking on this side seeing that I have to accept Christ died for me I have to accept the word of God that's written for me and I have to accept the Holy Ghost I have to ask him to come into my life he has to accept me and look at all these things we go through but these people died Jews that's it but they said they had one testimony were God's people that's right God cuz they know the Old Testament even though 6 and2 million people that that were Jews that were killed by Amman and Hitler I would say that they weren't they might have been some Christians in there well they're going to go in the sixth Dimension because they're Christian but the rest part of the Jews were just they were just Jews they were just Jews they we are the children of God they didn't they didn't deny who they were well they're going to be given white robes well now to me it would be unfair see that's why I said man could never ever ever come up with grave that's right because it's unmerited favor we put a merit on every everything come on people we're human yes we do I'll do something for you if you'll do something for me I'll do this for you if you'll do this for me or if you do something for me I feel obligated to do something for you right I feel like I owe you something well God give them white robes and didn't owe nobody nothing and they're just going to pop up one day and I mean pop up they're going to be coming up out of that Dimension and God's going to give them eternal life and they're probably going to be shocked but you know what inside they're going to say hey we're God's people he told us what we were he told us we were the chosen people amen so I mean that's just to me it's uh it's it's the it's the Apex of Grace it's this when we're talking about this fifth sixth and seventh seal we're talking right here we're up in The Headstone that's right cuz you'll not know way with that look at that right there now them je when they were alive they didn't have none of that it's me and me and me all three of us together whatever you do you you and you fine but me me and me that's a Jew just the way the Jews are but they had no brotherly kindness those Jews you're talking about are the ones that just followed the law yes and the ones that even didn't follow the law cuz their only testimony brother Brown said was that they were Jews that's to me is the grace that's the grace of God by bloodline but now I agree one thing for sure if you were a a murderer or a wher or you know I'm talking about those 6 and a half million people that were killed during opman and Hitler remember they were in every Community around Germany Russia France the Jews were dispersed so they were out there doing business they were sure I'm sure that they they you know I maybe not all Orthodox when you when you look at Jews you think well well these Jews that looks just like us that don't care just like people don't care here right now I don't know about them that's not my business to know but maybe the ones that leaned a little more that did read the Torah but they remember one thing they denied the Messiah regardless of what level they were they denied that Jesus was Christ okay so high in the world the Bible says unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins that's right now they got to overcome that somewhere where right there where they overcome it that's right God said that's right I'm going to give them white robes it ain't none of your business it's not what you think it's not what I think I'm going to give them white Roes because you know why I'm going to give them white Roes I'm going to give them white Roes because you would have not got one if I hadn't blinded their eye am right you wouldn't have got yours if I hadn't done this that's right so guess what there's the grace and there's justification times two you see I got times two so this is justification here well what is baby form justification if we want to call it that forgiving you you P sins yeah throw them in the sea of God's gness right never to be remembered again he must going to have to do this to the same group of people to another group of people he's got to do it to the Jews cuz if he rememb sin that's the whole thing I want you to see if he remers sin he'd have to destroy it that's right he's just they even said he was judged dust thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth in other words all them that are alive back up there in the first three dimension aren't you going to judge them he says hey he never even answers that question he's like ain't none of your business I'm going to give you white robes right and I'm not going to have to sit and write white you're going to know why cuz you were Jews and I said I'd never forget you yeah right that's right so that's his promise that he made he never forgive them right right that's kind of their reward eyes BL that is correct right and that's what we have to see that and we have to see that the reason that they were blinded is so that you and I could come to full Redemption cuz see they don't come to full Redemption right that's right their body is not changed until they get a white r you understand what I'm saying right so they don't come to full Redemption but we because he blinded their eyes and we are able to see the gospel New and Old Testament in its fullness we take a body chain amen and that's our star I guess you might want to say they get their star because they're supposed to go to hell but God gives them eternal life and puts them in an eternal Earth to live eternally amen all right and and I am saying this is what this is me I am saying saying that you and I are be able to talk to these people yes and tell them explain to them listen you're not we are we're going to know all things because we're the children of God that theophany of God is the mind of God comes right to us they don't have the mind of God like we do right that's right people this is reserved for his children amen this is all reserved for his children right those are not his children amen oh yeah yeah well yeah they are his children you understand but they're not his progyny that he did not take that old nature away from them and put his nature in and they became God on the earth in human flesh like me and you exactly they had to die right give their life under horrible cruelty wait for a little time and then give an eternal life over later on past the U past I Resurrection our change our Rapture then they get white robes and somewhere in there you can't read it but somewhere in there they got to get a body change because as we'll look this afternoon we're going to all walk on this Earth in human bodies amen right human flesh bodies is what we're going to walk around on this Earth Eternal everybody they won't be one that's down here that's trying to no everybody will have eternal life Body Spirit and soul but I do believe that we will be that message of cheer that brother Dale's talking about that that brother Brown's talking about first that message of cheer is going to be what teach 6 and2 million Jews how they rejected God Amen the New Testament they never read it cuz they don't believe it so just you can take all these things just sit down somebody under a tree and drink some good sweet iced tea yeah it's going to be in the South we're going to live in the south be South Israel or something I don't know we going have some sweet tee he said he give you the desire of your heart sweet teeth doesn't matter if you don't that's okay but but white roads were given under every one of them and it was sent unto them that they should yet rest for a little season until their fellow fellow servant and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled and we know when is that going to be fulfilled that's going to be fulfilled after that 1260 days that the two prophets are going to preach to the 144,000 to to to get them now now look they get the Holy Ghost on the Earth right before they die okay they're not like this group right here totally right right but there are still going to be Jews that are going to be killed that's right for the testimony that they hell for being Jews and then the 12 cuz you got to remember so you got to take that out of the equation I mean you have to put that in there but during that time that's why I wrote that during that time you got this going on the fifth seal now let's look for a few minutes at the part that we need to get and now we got to take the onion peel and push it back a little bit further because this is talking about me and you this is us number one is Grace we all need Grace you say you need Grace I thought the Bible said that the headstone would come crying what Grace Grace unto it Amazing Grace amen now Grace is good but Amazing Grace and you think well Grace is good but you just put that word amazing in it makes everything you know so more much more clear because it's not that it's not that it is Amazing Grace Grace is just Grace but it's amazing to who who given to amen it's amazing to me that's why that uh one know um John Newton wrote that that struck him I mean Amazing Grace how sweet this now just grace Amazing Grace how sweet this right so we look now that too though that once we've come through this now what we have to do we went through justification sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost and the word Made Alive and we're getting ready for a Rapture now I told you we got to lap back over you got one 2 3 four then you got a Rapture no more Gentile five six and seven right right okay right but we' got a lap over we got to take these back over to here right for me you right cuz remember right here there's got to be something happening for a body chain right but remember just because you got the Holy Ghost just because you got the word just because you got even The Headstone that doesn't give you the right they have a body change on this side that on this side you understand them everybody with the Holy Ghost is going to get a body change everybody that's right even the ones giving eternal life is going to have a body change but they're going to get it layer that's right like the ones at the white throne and the foolish virgin and all that all right but you and I are going to have to bring this thing back over here cuz here we have to put three or four scriptures together we which are alive and remain so there's got to be an alive and remain over right here okay and if you're alive and remain that means death has been destroyed in your body right and you have been changed we which are alive and remain shall not hinder or prevent those which are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sign right dead in Christ shall rise first right here dead in Christ shall rise first well they're going to rise first I'm going to make a big one cuz that's a lot of them do mean this is the little one is us then we which are alive and rain will be changed why I said the next thing in order is not the Rapture right you can't have a Rapture without a resurrection first so we got to get the dead Saints out of the ground first first thing we got to do is is preach the gospel come to a position that Jesus stood one day and said I am the resurrection and life and Lazarus not Lazarus but Paul bring your people irenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley bring your people now I don't know if Paul's going to resurrect and come here I think he'll stay where he was at each one of them has a group of people like you know brother brandom's people were all from all over the world but most of them were from here so we they may gather here who cares it doesn't really matter but it's one thing for sure we're going to see the dead Among Us yes the ones that died Among Us I'll promise you we'll see them okay man we'll see them spiritually we'll see them because you're not going to I don't believe everybody's going to see them does that give us the Fai to the I think that gives us that last um you know you're in your your stretch you're in your race where the last guy grabbed the Baton that's the last you know we know it's coming once you see the dead among us then the word of God has been made so real the son of man is back in power the Resurrection is now not see now see the resurrection is a process we know the Rapture is a process I don't want you to get me wrong cuz somebody the other day was talking about the Rapture and said well it's a process it is a process but there's one day that it's going to culminate that's right there's one day we're going to take a Rapture that's right all right and we know the Rapture starts when you get to New Birth that's why I saying you you you say certain things to to people that are unlearned and they go well why why did you say the resurrection that brother B said the rapture is already taking place well I want to ask you a question do you feel any younger than you did 6 months ago in your soul you should but not in your natural body so we got to take that thinking though and flip it over right you know what it's a carnal mind it's our carnal mind that's our worst problem our caral mind is the enmity that's right that I'm getting old but I'm supposed to be in a raptor see the doubt see the doubt that comes in your mind don't tell me it don't yeah it comes in your mind man sometimes sometimes I doubt sometimes I worry no the person that stands with that faith has got to be standing there just like and when he speaks it's God people amen cuz God can only resurrect amen thousands hundreds of thousands of people from Paul's age all the way up to brother around so it's not going to be just well I hope it works today no no there's going to be a time that you come to that just going it's going to click right into motion it's not going to be one person it's going to be a many member body that's going to come to a place may not be but 12 who knows amen but the word preached in a church is going to bring the people to an expectation correct we're expecting it because what you're saying we must come under expectation but the whole problem with this whole message is is that we've had these doctrines over here we've had these doctrines over here we've had these ideas over here we've had these ideas over here right that's all Satan's got to do get you one word off that's right right you missed the mark That's What sin is but if we pull these things that's why that that I that I like um teaching because to me it answers my question I mean sure it was it's great to go on an anointing and just feel good and and you know people tell you about yourself and that's good that's okay but when somebody can answer a question of mind to me what that does is it keeps lining that thing up cuz remember I don't there was never in Jesus's mind he never doubted who he was amen never doubted who he was he knew who he was now he knew when he was a human when he had to eat and do his business and you know watch and do all the human thing but when he stand there and it's just like the brother said the other day in New Mexico which was really good you know Legion run out there that Legion he said we are many so it wasn't just one demon thousands of demons ain't that one man he had allowed all these things to come in him but when Jesus foot stepped on that land the Bible says when Jesus EX in other words exited the boat and when he stepped on that land see we we talk about the pop and making a possession and we talk about our Footprints is possession but when Jesus's foot stepped on that land what was he saying this place is now mine this place is mine you said well Jesus had went all way around the world yes he has he said when the gospel is preached to Every Nation it don't take but one person from North Korea to step into North Korea and he has possessed the land for the Lord Jesus Christ amen so when Jesus stepped his foot the first thing the demon does will come run into him and said why have you come to torment us before our time they knew who he was thou Son of God and the Pharisees call him a a devil and the devil calling him God why because it was a possession Jesus didn't it's like the brother said Jesus do and stand on the boat and he saw Legion and you know they said he'd tear chains RI things apart cut his you know nobody could contain this man and Jesus didn't see him obviously he was coming up on the boat and he was looking at him mhm Jesus didn't go I wonder if today I can I mean he's many you I'm one I I don't know no the Bible says he he got out of the boat he just got out of the boat and that's what you and I got to do go through the Earth get out of the boat that's right get out of the boat and go do what we're supposed to do that's our problem sometimes we hesitate those who hesitate wait but we don't want to hesitate okay so now let's get this one comment and I want you to think about chewing it for the rest of the week we're talking about Grace now see to me let me get this right to me what I'm going to talk about this afternoon is sure it's the grace of God but that's eternal life right which is total Grace but it's not Grace to him he don't need Grace that's right eternal life doesn't need Grace eternal life is Grace that's right all right but it's not only that because you and I and let me here I'm going to say something and you're going to have to think about it for a minute how hard is it for when Jesus said I go to my father and your father my God and your God I come from God and go to God and I'm going to send the Holy Ghost back and go into your soul all right he told us that right that's right he was adamant about that I'm going to come back and I'm going to enter in you and I'm going to make you my children okay that's right now why can't we believe it for them this is the hard part it's harder for me to understand how God's going to change my body because of what I live in and what I do in it than it is my soul cuz my soul can feed on the word of God and just pour it in and just get anointed and just feel good and then Monday morning man I don't know what I got that's right come on now really and the holy go and the Holy Ghost inside of you that theophany 18 years old 20 years old the 90y old woman that got eternal life from Brother R meeting man she was she was happy you know why she was happy cuz she lived in a 90y old body for a long time for 90 years so what I'm saying is is that this is to me if you want to say an easy and a hard this is the easy part right cuz once your Nature's dead and you get the new birth you're you're you're in Christ you're a new Creator new creature all things have become new you don't smoke cuss drink do all things you used to do everything's lined up I'll read it this afternoon everything's lined up that new nature is gone that's true all down Through the Ages they had that but they never pick a body CH never from Paul's age till now nobody has took a body change right right why it's all there all the word was there the word revealed the word revealed so first revelation for a body change is that fifth s that's not justification for your soul your soul should already be justified that's right what is Justified you're just God has counted you just will I do this God don't have a list no now see he does here because this is baby for justification you justify it here if you continue on you and you know 10 years you stay in just I doubt it cuz remember you get Justified your past sins are chopped off then your sins continue and they are a record made and you're a sinner you're a sinner and to you're right here right J Judas is carried got to right here and he was the son of prediction so you're not going to be any different you see what I'm talking about yes cuz justification cuts off your past sins yeah all that stuff you used to do you don't you don't it don't say you don't do them anymore this is where that comes in this right here is is they're cut off and never to be remembered the sheet that used to have words on it now what okay from here back right but from here forward starts a new chapter and you are condemned by that but now this justification we're talking about here these people are so Justified to God is going to chop off their past sins and give them eternal life but now he is not going to changed their body because they came to a position that's right he's changing their body because you give them the Holy Ghost somewhere down the road not in not on Earth not on the time they listen the time they were living that's right we got to talk about now the only way you can take a body change is living what we're talking about today that's right right see everybody else is dead Paul cannot take a body change until we until we get him out of the ground that's right right okay so we're talking about now that's right so we've got to come under a justification brother said there's a just there's a higher form of justification there's a higher form of sanctification this highest form of justification is it's the real you didn't do it the real you didn't do it we'll read this afternoon brother round he boy I I got one quote that I really lie but we we got time's over go go go but the fifth seal Sixth Seal and seventh seal Revelation is what's going to change our body 1 through four is a foundation that many people will come to but lot most [Music]
