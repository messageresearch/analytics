first Corinthians chapter 6 verse 15 here says know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall then take shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot god forbid what know you not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body for to say 'they shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit flee fornication every sin that is a that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body what know you know that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and you're not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods a man god bless you tonight be seated and the others they'll just pray for me many many different things to look at here but you know I'm so glad that I can say that I'm not my own you know I'm you know Paul writing about being a prisoner and you know brother Brown talks about Paul being in that in that prison and the end of that dungeon but you know sometimes what we if we to look and see those you know the the prison that that Paul was in when he was writing these things and talking about being the the bonds that he was in you know you know you think about a dark done you know a dungeon this dingy place you know you think of the the kind of conditions that they had to live in you don't know what kind of food they had if they had food you know many times when if you look in the Roman Empire and different things like that going to prison was really a death sentence going to a dungeon was a place they held you till they killed you I mean there wasn't there wasn't appeals and different things that we have today that was a holding place - they killed you and other things they done was they if they did have in other situations they did have you where you were working and you were bound in this situation that you were there till you died and there was no recourse but you were there to do a job just like the children of Israel were bound in bondage in in Egypt you know they wanted them to build the sculptures and the pyramids of different things you know but so there was a job that they had to do but that was a death sentence to them because they were laboring in that until they died and you know the thing is if you died well they just rolled your carcass out of the way and put somebody else in there doing the same job that you were doing they there was not a and so you know when he talks about being a prisoner of Jesus Christ you know you think about the conditions that he was in where brother Ram said you know he didn't look at the condition that he lived in but he thought about being a prisoner of Jesus Christ being bound to him and Brent said that you know he was bound by the fetters of love to the word because Christ was the word Christ is the word but you know you know I think about being a prisoner and you know having not nothing of your own because you're not your own you know many times people talk about going in being in prison or going into jail and you know people have this they develop this prison mentality and you know the one of the first things that they want you to do when you go to prison is they want you to learn how to do everything their way they want you to think their thoughts because everything has to be done their way you know I think it was Sing Sing many many years ago believe was the prison that was back in the 1800s and you know we've all you've heard the term called lockstep well you know they was everybody was chained together and everybody had to learn how to walk in unison well when you first went to prison you learned how to walk you walk the prison walk everybody learned how to walk lockstep because you were all chained together and you couldn't get know where everybody was and in unison and so that was the same thing you had to learn how to walk and that's the same thing we have to learn how to progress because it's the same thing you know learning how to deal with the things that God wants us how he wants us to live and everything but it's same being a prisoner being coming to being fully surrendered to God and you know are we look at many things here in the scripture because you know you know brother Brown talks about in the message of a prisoner he talks about Paul and you know Paul's life and the things that that he had to go through and you know he was he was such a such a high man and you know had such a background and all these things to end up to where he was and you know it's easy you can see what in the world's view of Paul's life Paul was such a high man and you know he had everything at his at his fingertips he had such great training and and background pedigree and all of those things that was exactly what he needed and you know even brother Branham says you know he could have been a priest he could have been a high priest you know there was many things that was laid out for Paul because he was walking in that Avenue but you know Paul turns around many years later and said I count all that is dunk you know I don't count any of this as anything because I want to be apprehended by Christ I want to be under under the control of God and talking about what the grace of God was to him to see the life that he had lived but to see the life that he had lived then because first the life that he had lived was not very was not very was not very good in the in the realms of the eternal in God's plan but you know he had had his own way of thinking about things but God had to bring him to the place where he could see what God wanted him to do that was such a much of a greater thing and this is a first quote here from the message influence and brother branham's talking about Uzziah the king and Isaiah and you know he talks about the king being such a humble man and you know yeah we know how the story is that he was such a humble man he was such a great King but you know one day because he felt he got to the place where he felt like he could do his own thing that he stepped into the role of a priest which he wasn't supposed to do but you know what he got so comfortable in what he was doing as being a king and you know he got lifted up in his self and brother branham says you know and he said we find out as long as the King felt that way God blessed him but when he got to a place that he wanted to not abide in his own calling and he wanted to take the calling of something else and he thought because that God had blessed him that he was all right he could do that but how sadly we make them mistakes how how bad you must absolutely be honest you must that you mustn't do nothing unless God has directed you to do it and proves it vindicates it and you must that it's God that's done it usually a man of God God has to run him down and catch the real man of God ain't those guys that wants a lot of something to do a whole lot with your hard your hard tell what the would do with it if they received it see but God usually has to catch his man like Moses and Paul and like that to run him down to get glory out of his life and let him become a prisoner to the Holy Spirit so many times you know it's you know brother Graham said one time when he was talking about the people coming to the house and and the different things and people need in prayer and people asking questions and I believe it was at the time the man came to the house and he was looking for the audio mission and you know he was talking about the Millennium was starting and you know it's down by the river and you know all those type things and brother brems says don't ever desire a ministry don't ever desire anything like this because you know it takes a special kind of man to do that and not it not everybody and you know many people that tried to step in other people's roles and do different things and come to find out you know you're not equipped for that God didn't call you to do that many times people want to do a greater thing than then God calls you to do but you know the greatest the greatest gift that we can give God is to do exactly what he wants us to do is for him to mold our lives and for him to get the glory out of these things because you know many times there's people that you know they want to do something but you know what it's not it's not either the time that God wants it done or it's not the way that God wants it done or you know they want to they want to bring glory to themselves they want people to look at them but you know what God doesn't need any of that God wants somebody that is that is so humble and so low that you know that they can just walk right past and nobody knows who they are or anything like it but God can use them to bless his people you know there's many times we you know you read and hear of the different testimonies and things of what brother Brent them his life and you know the different people that were close to brother Brennaman talked about how humble he was and and the things that he done and you know how he was able to do things and you know people say they never met anymore anybody more humble him and you know it brought something you know but it took time for God to mold his character he had to go through many things that you know and many times people people want to want to carry near the glory or the or the you know the glory for that but they don't want the character that has to come with that and you know and you know many people they they don't ever want to have to go through the hardships in the battles and the trials to get there they don't want to be molded into that but they want they want the recognition for it and you know you know that kind of brother Bram said you know power with without character is satanic and many times people want the power you know they want those things but they don't want to have to go through through the hardships in the trials but you know the thing is is if if you plan on you know if like I said he had to run them down he had to run he had to run these people down you know Paul didn't all had his own way of thinking Paul had his own way of going you know Moses had his own way of going and all these different but you know God had to bring them to the place that he wanted them to be you know and every one of them had to come to that same place and you know you and I many times people look at wondering why things happen in their lives and and things like that but it's God molding us into what he wants us to be you know because you know many times there's there's times that things happen in people's lives and you know the you know there's like the little cartoon drawing of the man you know he was digging and digging he's trying to reach trying to reach the the jewels of the gold or whatever and you know and he keeps digging and digging and digging he don't see that he's getting anywhere but you know he stops right before he reaches it you know you're saying that he's you know he's getting this spawned and he's getting depressed he's getting down and don't realize that he's just a little bit further he'll reach the goal and people are starting to get you know wit in a weak and weary and depressed and despondent about things but you know what the goal is right in front of us we're not that far away you know here is the goal in front of and many times people say well you know I don't see what God's doing well you know the thing is is you keep looking and you're finding you know why because many times people keep looking through their own eyes they're not looking too as of God they don't see it in the scripture they want to see what external but they don't they're not looking internal because you know you can't see if you don't look through the eyes of faith if you don't look through the Word of God you're not going to find it because you know we can all look in our lives and all find all the faults and failures we can all find all the all the things that we're wrong you know because you know everybody can look and see but you know do you see what God sees do you see what God sees because you know there's some times in our lives that the Satan always wants to bring up your past and all these different things your faults and failures and you know many times we see that in one another you know because Satan saying don't always bring up what you've done wrong he'll always bring up what somebody else has done wrong and you know what many times we have people that that you know they find everybody else's faults in figures why because God you know because Satan wants you to see what everybody else is doing wrong he starts seeing because you're looking at things that you don't need to see but you know they would guess because you know somebody will say something and and people get upset about it and it'll just eat eat away at you and you know it was like brother Perry Greene told told the story one time he was talking about brother Branham he saw about these brothers that had had done these certain things and had cheated people and had done different things and brother Brennan was relating this stuff to Brother green and brother green he just the more brother Branham told him the harder he got and you know he said he said the next time I sell those brothers he said I'm gonna get him a double anointing of Texas he was ready to fight him and brother brother Brandon said later on they were on a trip and he said you know he said if we had time we'd go over and see those brothers and brother Green was like what he said after all you said to me and told me all about them he said it doesn't matter what they do he said it's how I treat them he said I love them no matter what they do they said you don't treat them any different and you know hey brother Green said that was one of the time brenton kind of kind of rebuked him about his about his attitude about but he said you know what he said he was talking about pastoring toussaint tabernacle and brother branham's was telling him about you know all the you know some of the heartaches and problems that he would have and he told sister green you know brother brother green's been called to do this but you know he said God equipped him to do this called him out there and yet said he's gonna have a lot of problems and you know he said I got a revelation one day he said it's not whether people love me or not he said it's it's whether I love them or not he said why because you're gonna always gonna have disagreements you're always gonna have thoughts and figures you're not ever always going to agree but you know the thing is is you cannot stop loving people if you have the love of God then you know what it's shed abroad in our hearts that it covers everybody whether they do you wrong or not because you know what if you're a prisoner then you know what you don't have your own you're not your own because you know what you do away God's doing away with all of that and that's what God wants to do he wants to do away with that because you know what if if you have the Holy Ghost than you know what the old man is supposed to be dead the old man is supposed to have died off and you know what we still try to resurrect him but we still trying to lay to the old man but the old man's supposed to be gone you know if you're a prisoner then you know what it should be just Jesus Christ that we need to be a prisoner brother Brown goes on here and speaking of Paul being a prisoner and he said I can't see here where Paul was forgetting anything saying he was sorry he was a prisoner he was addressing himself I believe that Paul is he wrote this letter with that pen that he was it was with the Holy Spirit causing him to write that maybe even at 2:00 this night that he might pull out of context start that we might pull out to show why Paul did this because it's Scripture and scriptural is eternal but he said he was in jail but that wasn't what he was speaking of this servant of Christ and minister with he was speaking that he was a prisoner to the word of Jesus Christ because Christ is the word and continuing on here he says and he had ambition and to find out that's what that great ambition that he had been trained for spent all of his life maybe from the age eight to ten growing up until about having all the diplomas and everything but you know God met him on the road to Damascus he says and now all that he had had trained for for God had took it out of him see and what his objective was was his father had spent it had spent his money for and the ambitions of his father and mother was all had been taken away from him because that God had something else therefore he was a prisoner from his objective that he had in life and he had become a prisoner to Jesus Christ who was the word you know the thing is as we become a prisoner to be taken away from all that but be a prisoner to Jesus Christ and all the things that he has you know if we go through the scripture and we start looking at things if we all the things that that we have you know brother Bentham said if you go through this go through this to the message and not through the scripture and you look all the things that that is not ours you know many times people talk about you know this is mine and this amount we won't - look look at all the blessings and things that are utter in there but you know you've ever sit down and start thinking about what don't belong to you you know the things that that is not ours you know if you're a prisoner you know because brother branham said you know he said it's not my righteousness Paul said it wasn't his righteousness but it was the righteousness of God he said it's not my goodness but it's his goodness he said it's not Jesus said not my will be done but thy will be done he said it's not my desire he said but it's his desire what are all the different things that we go through the scripture he talks about all the things you know all the things that don't block you know because I don't have a desire of mom we're not supposed to have a desire of our own we're not supposed to have a will of our own you know it's not it's not our righteousness our goodness nothing that we have we have nothing because all of it is as dirty rags there's nothing good in it we have to put all that aside and look to God because you know we should be just like a prisoner you know you don't have anything even the things that you know to get up in the morning and all the things that you look at all the things that you think you've accomplished in life you know if it wasn't for the grace of God you wouldn't accomplished anything it's grace of God that's brought all this to us you know if you if you go to it you know just like if you go to a jail or to a prison you know they strip everything away from you they take everything away from you and you know what and they issue you what you have all you know you wear you wear their clothes you eat their food you dress the way they do and everything has to be done their way and you know the thing is as many times in our lives we want to go back to the way it was but we want to try to do it our own way and you know what we fail in trying to do that but God has given us away as brother Graham talks about you know we try to come up with a better way of thinking we think we have a way to accomplish something you know what and it's an utter failure but you know why because God because we don't wait on God just like when he talked about Moses Moses was a great man of God called him to do a great work but you know what he done it in the wrong time why because he had been told the word told him his mother told him had always been told that he was going to deliver the people of God because he was a part of them and you know what he never waited on God because he thought because of his schooling in his education in his training that he was the man for the job but he thought he could do it on his own and he said he took 40 years to put all that Egypt had in him and it took 40 years to get all of Egypt out of him and when the 40 years had passed and all of that had been beat out of him and had cleared out of him and he and he sat on the backside of the desert you know what he thought he was an utter failure and he couldn't do nothing he was worthless and he would never accomplish anything thence God said well now he's now he's in the right place that I can use him and then when God come down now after hearing all of his life said he said so it said on his mama's knee that he was been told he was the deliverer but you know what in the the midst of all of that there came a time that he stood in front of a pillar of fire and he saw that it was not being consumed there was a pillar of fire standing here before him and a voice speaking out of that telling him what he was going to do why he'd hurt all of his entire life and he stood there and he said oh I can't do it I can't do it while I'm not equipped but it was a saint but it was the same man that stood there and ended up with a dead Egyptian trying to do exactly what God wanted him to do it was the same man but you know what he had God to the place that he realized he couldn't do it on his own and when he got to that place then God could come on the scene and say well guess what you're not going to do it because I'm going in you I'm going with you to deliver the people you're going to do it the way that I want you to do it and all of the way through any time you know if Moses tried to do something his own way it was a failure but you know when he got to the place that he could listen to God and he come there and God told him said you deliver the people and even put the words in his mouth to say when he said I can't I can't speak I can't do it he said well that's all right he said I got somebody to do it for you he said I got a mouthpiece a name there and hey your brother's going to go with you but he went down there to deliver the people but you know he went down there but he hadn't he had thus saith the Lord at that time and when he had thus saith the Lord that he could speak the word and he could come to pass but he could do what God wanted him to do not before then you know many times people want to try to do something but you know if you don't do it the right way it's utter failure we come to the place you know if you get in the in them be a prisoner of God and do the things the way God wants it done it's glorious you know many times people have the have many things that come their way and they wonder why things happen the way they do and you know they get so beat up with with the things in life and you know you see people that you know that they never they never look at their condition and some people you know that's all they look at you know how you doing well everything's so bad you know I mean you can't get away from them fast enough you know everything everything out of their mouth is is is blue and sad and you know I mean you talked to people and I hope this not bad but I mean you know their life is like a country song I mean you know everything so bad and so terrible and I mean it you know it's just it's you know you just and you just can't stand to be around them you know you know you say you know if you gave them a million dollars they'd be complaining about how much they had to give to the government and it's like but you'd end up with it more than you had to start with but they don't see they don't see that they don't see that anything is half-full there's nothing great you know well you know it's a it's a beautiful day today yeah but it's gonna rain soon we're looking for the rain you can't stand to be around them they drive you nuts and you know there's some people you know it you know you talk to people and you look at their lives and you think man they are more I'd like to have their kind of life what do you see these people know that you're so around and all of a sudden you start talking to people and said well you know they have this kind of problem and they like got this going on and that going on and you know what sometimes you think boy if I had their life I wouldn't get out of bed but you know what they are the ones that jump up and you know what they are they are happy they don't let nothing get them down you know they keep going and you know you think about people are so amazing how people can can write and and do things and they're just so amazing how people were drawn to them and you know I was singing of there was a there was a lady by the name of Jenny Wilson she was a lady that way 1800 she wrote the song hold to God's unchanging hand and I was listening somebody tell her relate the story you know she did she ended up having a spinal condition that she lost the use of her legs around the age of three or four and she lived to be in her late 50s I guess or whatever but you know they were talking about how many thousands of songs that she had written and you know she was so happy and they said you know she never wrote about her condition in her songs you know you will never find a song of all the songs that she had written she never was down and out about anything you know she had she won because there was something that took place to her that you know because it was something that just rose up inside of her and you know she was she wrote one time about being in being in the wheelchair and and you know God coming and and bringing salvation her and searching her heart and she said there was no no greater day than the day that they carried her in a wheelchair out to the water that they could baptize her so she could identify herself with her Savior to the whole wide world and you know when she come up out of that water you know there was something that stirred up inside of her that was a wellspring that kept going forth and you know she just had to write because that was the only way she could express herself but you know she never was able to stop that flow that just kept coming out from her that just had to write songs because she just wrote poems everything why because there was something that was real to her they just out that flowed out from her and you know if it was something you know because you and I are the same way if God is the same God dwells inside of us that he should be and there should be a wellspring coming flowing forth that you know what it should just wash all of the trash out of us that we should not have a negative mouth we should not speak the devil's language we should be able to say the things that God said why because he's dwelling inside of us if we're a prisoner then you know what we think we have we should have a prisoner mentality one other thing that that prisoners have you know not only do they go and do all those things but you know what they they get to the place where you know they don't do anything unless they have permission you know they had that you know I used to be well you know they would come up there and the first thing they would do was you know they wouldn't do they wouldn't get out of bed they'd be asking he's supposed to do this whatever they didn't they didn't do nothing until they got permission to stay you know they didn't go drink water they didn't do nothing until they had permission you know if we had the same mentality that you know if we if we saw God for the things in our lives because if we were so in tune with God that that we sought him for the things that we had need of and the things that we ought to do then you know our lives would be so much greater we'd be so blessed because you know we wouldn't have the problems that we have we wouldn't we wouldn't fight some many problems you know sometimes we things come our way and then we do things and we ask the Lord why in the world we do that now if you rewind in your mind it's like well you know what we never did pray about that and now all of a sudden we wonder while we're in the mess we getting up with with a mess and then we're praying the Lord to deliver us as I know you got yourself in there let you stay there for a little bit and you know we have to struggle with things and and deal with things you know but there comes a time when God allows us to be delivered of it why because it's time for us to grow though you know we have to understand those things that what we've had to deal with that we can overcome you know it's just like trying to raise children you can you can tell them oh by the way Adam he always asked me what I'm gonna what I'm gonna preach on he keeps asking day way you're gonna preach oh we're gonna preach on that time I'm gonna preach on him I'm preaching on him I always that's what I tell him I'm gonna preach on you so why because you know what you know it's it's just like raising children God raising us God dwell you know dealing with us the same same kind of things but you know you can tell them what needs to be done and what you know how things ought to be and what's going to take place but you know what you you can't live that life for them you can't you have to let them experience you know many times you know we've had always think about brother Dale telling Josh it was Josh when he was little that the wood stove was hot you know hot hot but you know there's lots of times you know you you try to tell kids to leave things alone don't do this and you know after a while you got to let them find out for themselves you know because you know you can tell them don't do that well you know what it says you tell them don't they're heading for that I remember the first time I ever you know people people think it's a joke but I actually stuck my finger in a light socket one time you know I was I was messing with a light socket I didn't realize the power rizona I didn't know what it would do till I stuck my finger in there people don't leave that leave that stuff alone you don't know what you're doing no it looks it looks interesting looks cool I think I'll be all right the problem the problem was I completed the circuit and I got ahold of something I knew I had ahold of something and fortunately it did let me go but you know there's times you try to tell kids don't do stuff and you know you try to point them in the right direction but you know what the thing is is you got to let them go their own way you know they they're not going to do what you tell them to do and you many times you think of the the prodigal son you know and and all the things that he wanted to do and you know his dad tried to try to persuade him and tried to point him in the right direction but you know what he finally let him go his own way because he wasn't going learn he wasn't going he wasn't gonna follow he just says I will here you go you won't you want your money and you know you want to do your own thing well here you go and you know he had a great time for a while you know he had a great time and and he and he enjoyed himself and you know how do you lots of friends and all those type things until one day all of a sudden the money run out they said as soon as he run out of money then he run out of friends and you try to tell kids you know you got Fairweather friends in life that you know you can they'll come around and they'll treat you good for a while but you know what when the hard times come or things happen your way you know what you can't they can't be found they can't be trusted they can't be depended on you know many times you have people that come along and they want to be your friend they want to be so close to you they want to be your buddy they want to be everything to you but you know what you get around them for a little bit you come to find out there's a lot of things in their lives that's displeasing to the Lord and you know you'll find out those people want to come around and hang around you got to be real careful because they're trying to bring something to you the devil is bringing them around to get something to you you know because you know the first time the first time you have a problem in your life spell especially as me I can remember after we after as a teenager quit going to church and everything and and going to a public school and getting around people and you know what there was a lots of people that want to be your friend and want to be want to be good to you but you got to watch them because all of a sudden you start seeing spirits come up around you and you know it doesn't take a genius to see what's going on but you know sometimes we think well you know these are these are friends and you know we want to be part of the world and you know just like brother Billy Paul was talking to you know brother Brennan was telling brother Billy Paul about holding his arms out you know in the sign of the Cross and he told him said you know you got to go one way or the other he said you can't go one way and go the other hey you know you got to make your choice but he said you know I want to go this way he said I want to go taste the world I want to go see what it's like out there you know and you know people want it people want to enjoy some of that because you know they think it's great and on the outside but you know many times people think you know the grass is greener on the other side but you know after a while you find out they know grass over there there's nothing over there to be had but you go over there and you know then after a while you start looking you know and the next thing you know if you start fellowship and you start hanging out with these people you start having friends like that if you're not careful then you know what you end up with the same mentality that they have you know everybody you know this then you start doing the same things that they do you start living the same kind of life you start thinking the same thoughts that they do why because you're know you're known by the people that you associate with and you know here's here's this particle son you know he had it all great for a while until he ended up having to have him to slop hogs and he ended up with nothing and the Pigpen and the mire and all of the filth and everything that goes along with it he was down there and it said and then he come to his self and realized you know what there's people in the world that got it better than I've got it you know I had I had everything at once and now I have nothing and him down here in a mud hole and the other with these pigs and you know I had it so great but you know he decided he was gonna go home he wanted to go see his father he wanted to go back to where it was and he said he said father he said I have sinned and he said I've done everything wrong and and brought shame upon the family and everything but he said I want to come back and he said yeah I don't have to be your son he said I just want to come back and be able as one of the servants he said I just want to be down at the bottom he said but I just want to because you know what here I can be clean I can eat and I can have a decent life but you know what I don't want to live like that is out there and you know there's times people think you know you're trying to you're trying to shelter your kids and you're trying to protect them from something but you know what if you ever go out there and you see the things that's happened to people then when you see those things when you come back and you say well you know I was out in the world but I didn't do this and I didn't do that and didn't do this but you let me tell you what you get around those spirits and you may not smoke you may not drink you may not do a lot of things but I tell you what you know what you still fight those spirits why because when you've opened yourself up to those spirits and you know what you still bottle them things you still carry them around with you because you know there's lots of people that have allowed themselves to you know because they're not trying to battle and fight these Devils off they're not try to fight these spirits but they allow them to just get comfortable with them but the problem is is getting comfortable with them you know what you're still carrying something that doesn't that's I'm pleasing to God and you know you may have you may have a Christian life on the outside but you know what it still has to be what's down on the inside of a man but it still what's down on the inside of the soul because you know what you still have them things dealing in your spirit realm and people still have those mentality well I don't do this but you know what they still compromise with me but you know when this when the young man when he came back to his father you know his father welcomed him back you know he can't he came back and you know he was so humble that he wanted he didn't he didn't think that he desire you know that that he deserved what what his father gave him but you know he killed the fatted calf and all the different things you know you know the story of how he went through it and made merry and gave him the robe in the ring and all those different things and you know he was so happy that his son had come home you know what he didn't he didn't lose his place you know why because he was still a son he was still in the father's heart he still was a part of the father and you know what he came back to him and you know he still was gonna give him that why because he was a son he never lost that but you know he'd come back and realized you know how great he had it and what what the father had for him and then and then you see that the the older son had come and you know he wanted a while they having all the singing and the music and and all these different things and and you know he said well he's over because we're joyous because your brothers come home and he's standing there is like Oh you know you know have you read the scripture you know he says he said thy son thy son has been out doing all these different things and read and relish our --let's and all these everything's you're my son he didn't call him his brother you know hey didn't him have one anything have anything do with this brother because you know what I've been here the whole time I never done those things I have been right here and when have you killed a fatted calf for me when have you done all this for me look what look what I've done oh yeah just like this the story then you know Jesus was asking them you know when the the publican came in and the the scribe or whoever it was you know when he came in and they were praying and you know the one said Lord forgive me I'm a sinner you know and he smote his chest and you only had such repentance and the other one says well I thank you Lord that I'm not like him I'm not like him you know this guy over here he's like well you know what y'all have been more like him because you know if you had to look down the inside you just see that the man was was praying to God to be justified and you know God forgive him because like well I'm time to good because you know I'm just looking on the outside look how good I am and many times you know if we get to the place where we think we're better than somebody else so we have oh we have this we get lifted up just like you say I got lifted up and you know and then all of a sudden you know their sin in the camp just like Uzziah you know he got in place in you know they told him you shouldn't be doing that and you know what he got smoked with leprosy and he was he was a leper till he died but you know if we come to a place where we are more like Jesus you know if we come to that place Lord you know bind me Lord if we surrender ourselves because you know if it's the goodness of God that draws us if he draws us then you know that we come to him and like Lord I want to be free but I want to be bound to you I want to be bound to the I want to be bounded thus saith the Lord I want I want to be just as much as close to you as I can be I want to be bound to what you want me to be bound to I want to be just molded like you want me to be because if that's what we desire then that's what God can do but you know we have to do away with all of our ambitions and and all of these things but you know God is here to move all of those things from our lives to make us what we won't want him to be but you know you know the people that that have a lot of problems is is people that that go to you know you go to you go to prison and you know they're trying to put you in there and they try and tell you how everything's supposed to be and you know there's a border and there's a system for everything and ask to go in there and you know many times people go in there and and they don't want to do that they don't want to do the things that has to be done you know they only do so much and then they're out causing problems and you know they're trying to sneak around and get by with this and this and you know you know how they do and you know all about prison you know how they you know they always have stuff going on and different things like yeah we don't when you get called they got a place to put you you know they find out where you know what you've done to everything like that well you don't listen they just stick in solitary they got a little place where they put you in there and you know you got you got your little caught in your little blanket and they keep you in there and you're in there by yourself for a while and you stay in there till you get till you get ready and then they'll decide if they only look to you bring you out if you're gonna do what you need what needs to be done are you gonna follow the right kind of plan and you know it's just like brother Brown was talking about the one time the the sister that had gotten sick and you know brother branham had had told him that she was going to get well and then later on you know she died brother branham come to Lord said well you owe me an explanation why did you tell me that she was gonna live as she died and then you know God just let him sit under that for a while you know he just sat there for a while you know God didn't deal with him hey you know you know he said to just you know just kind of left out on his own for a while why because you know he coming there got his law attitude brought it in there well you know what God kind of put him in his own little solitary little cell over there and said well you just said under that for a while but you don't when he come back then he realized you know what God you don't owe me an explanation you don't owe me nothing and God told him said listen said a year ago that lady should have died she should have drowned in the river and they pulled her out and it was the goodness of God that saved her life and brought her back and she was able to repent and get right with God before she passed in too many times we won't we won't know what why God does things you know what God doesn't owe us an explanation you know why because his judgments are right his judgments are true they're pure they're correct and if God gives us something than you we oughta raise them so well thank God why because you allowed me to go through that and you know what's good for me and whether I see it or not I know that it's good you know there was a there was a man we told totally to a lady one time and you know she was all upset about things and and you know the man told her said well you know the Bible says that all things work together for the good so I don't know why I don't know what good comes out of it but I know that's what the Bible says the Bible says that all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord who are the called according to his purpose so you know what if that's what happens and you know what isn't there some kind of good in and if I don't see the good well I don't I'm not looking the right way but you know what God will show me the right way but show me that it's good but you know right now I know that it's good why because that's what the word says it's good whether I'm you know I can see it or not that doesn't have anything to do with it but Kendra but do we believe in believing holding into the word and being a prisoner being a prisoner be what God wants us to be can you can you be a prisoner I want to be a prisoner there's many things like I get into nut but I kind of keep it short but I just want to say I'm you know I won't want to be a prisoner I want I want to be molded the way he wants me to be molded you know there's so many things when you start when you start thinking of songs you know you know when you when you start thinking of a prisoner mentality when you start singing songs you know there's so many songs that that I that come to mind here I want to live the way he wants me to live you know there's a song I'm a prisoner of love I'm a slave to the master I'll exceedingly toll through the heat and the cold all the different songs that come to your mind when you when you think about that I'm not in my own I belong to Jesus he purchased me I'm all he's bought with a price the blood of Jesus I'm not my own I'm here when you start to think about those things and you start to see you know what because if you want to see the great things of God in your life you want to see then you know what all you've got to do is become a prisoner you've just got to come to a place where you realize that it's not you but it's him I want to be what he wants me to be I want I want him to take full control because you know what if he takes control then you know what it'll it'll go the way it needs to go as a song says something the water some through the floods some through great trials but all through the blood some through great sorrow but God gives a song in the night season and all the day long why because you know what it doesn't matter what God brings our way you know what if we're a prisoner then we know that it what God is leading us the right way but are we completely sold out to God's plan are we completely sold out it is is it that that God are we allowing the Holy Spirit to come and clean out everything in our lives that sound pleasing Lord just clean us up and just clear us out Lord and you clear our minds and our thinking Lord that it just thinks the thoughts of God Lord that we can just that we're just speaking us as brother Bob was talking about speaking the Oracles of God become an Oracle of God why because being being the voice because if the word comes in and the word goes out you know God didn't call us to just be vessels just just to just to be filled up but you know we're to be vessels ain't useful you know you just don't put a vessel in use just to fill it up and set it on a shelf but you know what we are to be the ones to go out to the world that's lost and die and let them see Jesus Christ to be poured out before the people that they can be seen who Jesus Christ yes it's not it's not just that we're going to be a vessel to be set on the Shelf where we can look pretty or anything but you know what it's to be a minister for us to you know and it's not just standing behind the pulpit administered but it's to go out and do what God has called us to do you know sometimes you know I think about you know brother Dale talks about people you know we don't have a lot of what we used to what we call prayer warriors years ago but you know there's so many times and you go back and you read people and you see things that's happened to people you know what people actually you know I think it's I think it's something that's totally lost in the church because people people have just gotten away from that and you know if you ever get back to that place and you know I think God if we ever get back to the place where we could actually just pray and just seek your face you know even the scripture says that he'll hear from heaven but all the things that God done with people all the different things you know that you know it's even when like how about the West revival and different things that's happened what wasn't even when people got right with God when people got a does burning desire within the heart and you know what they salt the face of God then you know what happened God came down and he met them and he ministered to them people say oh I want a revival well you know what the thing is the revival starts seeing you and we ever get to the place we get to the place we will let things that the world and all the things that that happened you know we got to live here but you know the thing is is many times if you if you ever desire to do something within you know what then the devil is coming there and he's gonna be mad he's gonna mess it up how are you going to try to do something for God he's there to mess it up and you think well you know I want to do this and I want to do that well you know what this to remember whatever you do the devil's there he's gonna fight you but you got to fight we got to fight there's a fight on our hands but you know what the thing is this greater is he that sent us then he that's in the world do you have that desire tonight I want I wanna I wanna I wanna so much like him the world can't tell us apart there's a that old song you know I want to be so much so I want to be more like him every day why because you know there's a time that you know it's not you know not just looking for the law the last one because you know what we don't know when that last one comes in but you know the thing is is the last one comes in but you know what every single person in the body of Christ has got to be in their place it's not just when the last one comes in but it's when every person in the body is in their position and I want to be one where I you know it's not somebody waiting on me I want to be the one that's in my place I want to be whatever it is I want to be where where is this if it's a dorm out in the house of God or whatever is I swear I want to be I want to be what God has me I want to be faithful to the calling that God's called me - it's not about big eyes and little use it's being faithful one because you know if you have if you have this if you have the Holy Ghost if you have the Spirit of God in you then you know what all your desire is is to is to be used of God to be a blessing to do what God wants you to do because you know what it's whatever little thing that you do you know you know sometimes you ministers know this you preach sometime and and you think well you know I don't know if that actually meant anything to anybody if it didn't it didn't go over you know you think well well you know I don't know who that was for and you think more well that was a sometimes there's a waste of time but you go through and you think well I don't know if if really anybody got that but you know I had a had a person send me a text a few weeks back they were listening one of my old messages and and they told me that I sent me a text and said I'm listening to your message this morning said everything you said was right for me it's exactly what I needed to hear you know that well thank God I'm so glad that you know whatever well however simple it is you know whatever said we you never know because you know this goes out over the airwaves and everything and you know scripture tells us the Word of God won't return to Him void but it's it'll accomplish what it's sent to do amen well god bless you this evening let you stand try not to be too long but I'm just happy to be what God wants me to be I don't know what let's sing that song I'm
