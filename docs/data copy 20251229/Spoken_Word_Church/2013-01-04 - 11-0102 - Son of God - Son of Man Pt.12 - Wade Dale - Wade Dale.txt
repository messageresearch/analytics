========================================

until the white Throne judgment right cuz there's going to be a judgment right what of what they did right a fish virgin cup of water in my name um anybody that's given eternal life that's got to happen at the white Throne judgment I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our lord I Die daily Paul is saying you still even though we come to a position which still have to Die daily right if after the manner of men I have fought with beast at Ephesus what an advantage is it me if the dead rise not let us eat drink for tomorrow we die in other words Paul is saying that there's not a resurrection MH we're in trouble right we don't see all things but we see Jesus right Paul said we which you know verse 51 he comes and shows right here what he's talking talking about but I show you a mystery we shall not sleep we should be changed all right verse 33 be not deceived evil Communications corrupt good manners await to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of God I speak this to your shame but some men will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come question thou fool well it be hard to say to somebody ask you a question y think I talk that th fool that which thou sest is not quickened except it die in other words what put it in the ground die come back up and that which thou sest thou sest not the body that shall be but bear grain it may chance of wheat or some other grain but God giveth it a body as it has pleased him into ever seed his own body All Flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of Flesh of man another flesh of Beast a fish and another Birds then he goes into Celestial and terrestrial bodies but what we're coming to the end of now is is we're showing this son of man had to come into human flesh because that's where we sin we sinned in human flesh and if God didn't come down and promis in Genesis 3:15 to do that God knew there was no man born of a man and a woman that could do it right cuz there would always be that sin part that separation between what brought you here and the spirit that you had or the soul that you have right but watch Paul in verse 42 all the way down he's explaining what's going to happen to us or what's happening to us but he's showing a key that verse 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep now it's like brother dick said Friday night we shall not all sleep now now Paul could say that while he was alive but now that Paul's dead he can't be we anymore cuz it says we which are alive and remain that has moved over to another group of people that's right right we shall all be changed now that's for real that everybody be changed but there's a group of people that's got to stand on the earth it's got to take a body change one day we can say all power in heaven Earth's been given unto us because we conquered death now down through the church ages that couldn't happen because when God was in this all and all this Jesus in Matthew when he ascended he saved that part for the end time because the Bible says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man right doing all those evil things and all the things like that but there's a time comes that this son of God is down he come back on the day of Pentecost sure it was God in human flesh you can't deny that right that's why the Bible says the son of man was standing in the midst of the golden Candlestick not a son of God a son of man was cuz it was human beings becoming God in human flesh right but there was a time when they had to do like Paul Paul said in other words gleaning out of all this he said The Last Enemy shall be destroyed is death for he hath put all things under his feet come back to verse 27 but when he saith all things are put under him it is Manifest that he has accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued during the church ages all things were not subdued cuz what's all the body right all part of it the body went down to I mean the the soul was eternal the body was still well they're rotting in the grave and most of them are dust now right and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also be subject all right so you and I have got to come to a place that nobody else came to and since Jesus said that statement in Matthew which was in ad about 33 till now nobody has caught the Revelation oh yeah they knew Jesus was God in human flesh the whole scripture tells you that but also in that they saw Paul said I don't see all things but I see Jesus he knew something had to come out of Jesus right Jesus Christ right all right something had to come from that man because in 51 see he catches a mystery and truly truly it was a mystery to Paul it might have been revealed in impartiality to Paul but the full mystery was not revealed to Paul or he would have took a change when he spoke that cuz this is the Eternal Word of God that's right okay but see as prophesying he's prophesying of the time coming that's right but we shall all be changed in a moment in the 20n of verse 52 but he's telling you in his in his um what what you say in his sermon or dissertation or whatever he was saying watch what he let's go back verse 51 here I am Paul all right I'm speaking to a group of people today and I'm speaking this same word behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed now that's a truth right M that's a truth right right when Paul in his own sermon by the Holy Ghost is bringing out the Revelation through Paul this is what's going to be kind of funny to you Paul spoke the Eternal Word of God right right this is what we're reading this is going to be forever settled that's right but what Paul was speaking he didn't understand yes I can see that right he didn't understand it all brother brandham let's go back brother brandom said I have to go back and listen to the tape that's right cuz I said some things that I didn't understand and a lot of times he'd be preaching and he'd say I just caught that or that was fresh right well guess what it's a man prophesying a prophet prophesying of a group of people now that's got to land on something or it's just Fain words right right that's right it's got to land on something it may not be for Paul may not be for brother Brandon but it's got to land on a group of people that literally says that's me right now you can all look toward that I'm sure Luther looked at that and said well that's me but there's a group of people that literally is going to have to be this made manifest but Paul in his preaching is showing cuz remember what we're going to watch what he says these three things got to happen before what he spoke before has to happen cuz when it said the last Trump Paul knew he wasn't the last Trump right he was the first truck right so he's saying what I'm saying is a man could stand up here and say something and it be a prophecy of a group of people and him actually just say it like he was going to walk right into it that's right that's right but listen to his conversation cuz what's going to happen but we shall all be changed comma not a period comma why he's continuing his talk in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and here's where Paul limited himself to making it he said at the last Trump the last message Paul knew he wasn't the last messenger remember brother Brown said he was trying to get the people to believe he preached Jesus Christ was coming back so real to the people they thought Jesus was coming right there right you know what brother Ryan said he said he preached so real he had to get them people to believe he wasn't talking about a resurrection remember there was people after Paul died that was preaching that the resurrection had already happened but he was talking about an out Resurrection what getting you out right getting you out of the world right that's right but Paul even limited his own self by what he spoke right at the last trunk and brother brandham did too cuz when brother brandham stood up and said he said if the great one is here he said I'm going to have to decrease he had to that's right he had to die that's right there's no way he could have stayed here when Christ was here there's no way so he limited himself right but see there's a group of people that's got so much not just words not just words in our mouth but this made live so there's no way that it limits this group of people that's right Luther could only see so much Luther wasn't in the last Trump so Paul is saying right here he's saying the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound what the message comes forth and then the message in you and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed mhm Paul has put a limit on himself and said it the last trunp for the trumpet shall sound now Paul was a trumpet Paul was an angel Paul was a messenger he wasn't the last one he was the first one right this gets back to so simple to where you say I can't do something you just limited yourself that's right I can't take a change all right then you can that's right that's right you cannot do it that's right I can't take the I can't be good enough to get the Holy Ghost that's exactly correct that's right but if you keep saying that you've limited yourself that's true right you got to look at what God said that's what we're doing here and that's really what Paul's doing Paul is speaking by inspiration remember Paul don't have a bible to read except the Old Testament that's true which he gleaned all this out of the Old Testament excuse me because really Paul is not the first to come up with that death is swallowed up in Victory mhm if you look in your Scofield bible Isaiah spoke it before he did let's go to Isaiah 25 well let's read this ver for this corruptible must put on incorruption now what Paul doing he's Paul is opening the door to show you how to do it but he's already shut the door on himself cuz he's not the last messenger for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when what when all that happens up above there this corruptible shall shall put on incorruption and this Mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written see we think Paul came up with all this like brother brandham coming up with theophany and logos no that was way before brother brandham scoffield wrote it in the early 1900s he talking about theophany and and logos and all Elohim all right now let's go to Isaiah 25 you got a SC your Bible you know where to go to Isaiah 258 excuse me Isaiah 258 he will swallow up death in Victory and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off our faith what he talking about Millennium talking about for us it's the U the manage supper see look at verse seven verse 6 and in this mountain that mountain right over there that mountain statue of a perfect man you can't see it on the video but statue of a perfect man see in that mountain in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make all people a feast of fat thing verse seven and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people what the carnal mind so Paul picks up this revelation it says death is swallowed up in Victory now go back to Paul verse 55 oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ now verse 55 is not the first time that was spoke go back to Hosea Hosea 13 that's going to be a Hard One to find somebody find it let me know I was going this way here it is I got it page 929 on here in your Scofield bible 13 verse 14 now look Paul picks up the Revelation though of Hosea I will Ransom them from the power of the Grave same thing Paul said I will redeem them from death oh death I will be thy plagues oh grave I will be thy destruction repentance shall be hid from my eyes so see Paul is Paul is bringing the Old Testament that's why that that there's power in that Old Testament don't do away with the Old Testament right that's where Paul got his writings cuz we we quote Paul oh Paul said Old Death words sure he said it but Paul was bringing it to a present day Revelation Hosea was a prophecy Paul was bringing it to where he was at and when he died it become a prophecy but see some of us are going to come through that and not feel the stand up it's like brother brandom said the prophet refers to the prophet before him previously that's exactly he could not Paul could not say anything different than what the Old Testament said but out of that Old Testament watch what he done he brought a present day Revelation in verse 51 52 53 54 but in 55 he reverts all the way back to what a prophet said in the Old Testament but Paul was telling them this is what's going to happen and this is the order and who's going to do it the word made flesh the son of man had to be come back the son of man wasn't in Paul's age right it was the spirit of God working through Paul it was a spirit of God working through all these people but in the end time and that's what we'll talk about next week is we'll talk about now bring it to really a present day truth that the son of man come back in power in the end time cuz it was promised that he would come back in power in the end time yes Matthew where it's where Jesus said all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth that little word in cuz right after that he tells them to go ye there teacher so they had the holy spirit in them that's where he had the power in their body in their soul see he knew they didn't have nobody has power in their flesh if you'll look at what Paul was talking about if we had time maybe we'll back up next Sunday Paul was told telling them that their Earthly body was worthless that's right they could not bring God forth from that human body because it said an Adam all die right but there's an appointment of death that somebody's going to miss I've always said it's so simple I have an appointment with a doctor Monday if I miss an appointment that's what you got to do you got to miss that appointment with death just appointed under the man wants to die just miss the appointment then you don't what you don't have that that's right okay all right let's go we'll finish it up next Sunday and then we'll start on something something else you
