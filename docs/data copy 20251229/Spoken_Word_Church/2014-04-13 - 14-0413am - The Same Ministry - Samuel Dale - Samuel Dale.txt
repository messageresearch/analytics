it okay uh let's turn to John 14 and read now we've kind of been in a series was for a while there and titled it the Masterpiece family and I hope you enjoyed hearing it as much as I did to try to preach it to you and and all and uh I would invite you to go back on the internet and listen to it because I tried to put in a lot of things and I've got a couple of messages two or three that I kind of tagged as I was coming along that will be related to that but it won't be the whole thing what do we got oh okay brother dick brother dick is is got trouble with his back so remember that and as we pray remember that point okay John 14 all right let's pray and remember brother dick on that part Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus for this day and your grace unto each and every one of us we

the service today and Lord just let your grace be sufficient as we speak about you Lord you come and honor your word we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us in Jesus name Amen brother K told me last Sunday he said I'm going to try to come back next week I said well if you do you have to put up with me because that was a you know fall in line okay John 14 now well familiar with us but we'll try to get a point in of something that I want you to see all right so let's read from John 14 1- 12 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know amen Thomas sayth unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus sayth unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me now if you'll go that and take that word way I remember in the Baptist Church that struck me one day and I run as much as I could then back through C concordances that we had and look at the things that it talks about the way the way the way throughout the Old Testament and the children of Israel would be in the way you know they would be traveling all right go back and study that watch now if ye had known me now watch him you should let's go back Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him now that's a great statement is it Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it suffice us Jesus Sith unto him have I been so long with you and yet hast thou not known me Phillip he that hath seen me hasth seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake verily verily I say unto thee he that believeth on me the works that I do do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now you could take any Scripture there and preach the rest of the afternoon up on those things but you know we we spend a lot of time time in emphasis is made when you're reading that 12th verse and trying and Mankind has tried to figure out what Jesus was saying when he said that uh Greater Works than these shall ye you do Greater Works all right and then we we try to figure that out well I ran some things on it but I won't bring too much but a lot of people think that the Greater Works is said the man would say to brother Brandon one day said uh preaching the gospel is the Greater Works well now we know that naturally speaking intellectual speeches is not preaching the gospel right right it's supposed to be in power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit or the the message coming to you the truth coming to you and you're trying to speak that and see a lot of people then would try to justify that point of not being able to come up with the works maybe that Jesus did so they just take it to the basis of of preaching the gospel right all right you know they've got a truth in what they're saying but not the truth all right cuz there's a truth to preaching the gospel am do you know that there's one thing we can do that Jesus could not do you believe that do you know what it is the one thing we can do that Jesus couldn't do no well now he can do anything he's God okay now you're listening but we'll read them in just a minute you know that Jesus could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost God has not come yet we've emphasized back through there a lot that the Old Testament Saints wonderful they had the anointing of God you know of God with them the presence of God but they did not have the new birth right in the Old Testament now because the Bible says because Jesus had not been crucified the Holy Ghost did not come the scripture said all right so then they only had an anointing upon them but not a new birth because that would be the kingdom that Jesus spoke of that was there and would come into being all right but see to do the Greater Works but see we can we can uh try to justify ourselves and when we do we show our own stupidity mainly and and doing it but we'll say well well well we can't do what Jesus done so we'll we just make it as preaching the gospel well brother random said it like this he said okay let's see you do the lesser works and then he would talk about the Greater Works right all right now I'm trying to put something together to make a picture of what Jesus is saying that we know we can't do anything greater than he done because he died for our sins there's nobody can do that so the original translation comes out to be more more not greater it means more it just means more of it why because where he was in one person back there even though he was God himself but being one person he was limited to that all right then when it come over into the church now it's spread about the world right so the bride can do the Greater Works and I believe that I tried my best to emphasize that to you to to help us to understand that see Jesus said in these works you shall you do all right you know we should believe in Divine Healing we should believe in praying for the sick we should pray for the sick and we should expect to see uh things take place all right because Jesus said it right that we do these things but now remember get the point we're not trying to do anything greater cuz he died for our sins there's nothing greater than that right but it means more because there just more of it around the world now what have I tried to emphasize to you in the uh message that we were bringing about the Masterpiece family that were the grain of wheat that goes into the ground would have to return again in the end time in other words to bring about a Rapture all right and see it would be in you and I right okay but it would not be just us alone because we can't leave out what's back here behind us in the ages and the the ministers and thing and then claim to be built on something see we're supposed to be built on the foundation Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ the KE Chief Cornerstone all right so then I've emphasized over and over to you Luther when he protested the Catholic Church they didn't get upset now listen what I'm saying it's when the people begin to take Luther's message right and protest the Catholic Church the Catholic Church got upset why because the people was doing it were just one by theel they just laughed him off that's right see then this message we believe is to be lived I believe every age had a message a messenger all right we put the emphasis on the messenger because thank God for the message that he brought all right if I'd have been in the days of Luther I would say the same thing thank God for the message that the messenger brought because it's the truth all right now but see something has got to be made real to you and I right and that's what Jesus was laying down the point because you can go through that John 14 in my father's house are many mansions you know many Souls many theophanies many people all then you could come on down to where he said that I go to prepare a place for you going on all the way to the Future home the statue of perfect man they going on all right but see it's got to be something personal now that's my whole point for for months and months and months is trying to get there for 40 something years CU this is what I was preaching in over 40 years ago that the bride would be the son of man 1969 the first message I preached that was the title The Bride would be the son of man in the end time and I believe that more today than I believed it in and I believe it was revealed in because it stood all these years in what I've tried to bring but see it's not just an end time people that's the son of man that's right you got to put all because in Revelations 1112 and 13 that's is one standing in the midst of the seven golden candles like unto the son of man which would take every age all the way through to make out what you're talking about and the prophet said she'd be the fullness of the godhead bodily but I just don't see it brother Dale but I guess that just aulls it don't it I mean the Bible said it the prophet said it cuz you don't believe it that aulls well that's pretty good isn't it I mean to think that one person could stand up and say I don't believe that and it just make it of no good well I don't give a hoot what you think that's right I believe 40 years ago I believed it and I still believe it more today than ever I thank God for the messenger I don't believe there anybody puts any more emphasis in the correct way about the prophet messenger cuz without him you and I wouldn't have nothing that's as plain as I can be it's not you that I'm following I'm following this message and I'm only following this message because this message brought Christ Paul said follow me as I follow Christ that don't make the messenger god right right we don't believe in that we don't believe in deities we believe in deity in the new birth I believe you have the new birth that's deity all right the prophet had the new birth that's deity right but outside of his gifts and things see that put him in a different category all right but the point that I'm trying to make is he said come on and do the lesser works well you know I'm honest I've tried to be I hope I am when Billy Graham was in where was it India or somewhere where he was at that time and you know they challenged him well you know he packed up and come home brother brandom said he should have called for somebody to come and stand there and called her hand he said maybe not the words but he said really he ordered done it himself cuz I believe God would have backed him up sir and he just stood there and said I don't have the signs and wonders in my Ministry but I believe it and I'm going to stand right here and declare Jesus Christ to you I believe God would have come on the scene well it's called what he believed all right and see why can't we be that way that's right to stand on what we believe right you know whether it's contrary what it is to anybody what does it make any difference I don't keep up with all this junk out in the world I'm not concerned with whether the Pope's coming to the United States next week or this week excuse me that that's going to be the great thing or the moon Tuesday supposed to go through all these stages that's all right but that ain't what I'm interested in I'm interested in God's word not whether Pope's coming or not it's what you and I can see and believe all right and see then I believe it that way yes but look what he said let's just get this if we don't get much we'll get this point go ahead brother uh I don't know who back C we get switched a lot of time it's on the message Jehovah Gyra 1961 3:12 and look what he says he said well Jesus said are greater than this you come do the works he done first then we'll talk about the greater and I will tell you what it is and going if you can do the works of Jesus then he's going to tell you what the Greater Works are right yes now see that's where people goes wrong I believe the ministry of Jesus Christ is in the world today if I didn't believe that I don't know what in the world I could believe and you tell me you don't believe it it's here like it was then I'll ask you to read one scripture for me you don't believe Jesus is here like he was in the days of the prophets you don't believe he was here he's here like he was in Jesus you don't believe he's here like he was in brother brandham I want you to read me one scripture I got a little message I'll come out of that with it but I'd like for you to read Hebrews 13:8 yes sir amen the same yesterday and maybe later on that's not exactly what it says when I just don't see it well what does that got to do with it amen that's right you realize the biggest portion of the world cannot see any form of you know the biggest portion cannot see any form of Christianity right and I don't mean because I can't see it people I mean there Buddha Hindu the world is populated today with all kind of they don't believe in Jesus Christ does that mean he didn't exist Does that mean that he's not here for you and I that's right because they believe it that way no but think about it I believe we've seen right here in this building the dead raised on on five or either six occasions we've seen the sick healed we've seen demons cast out we've seen all kind of things right here in this little building well I don't believe it cuz I don't see it well that's all right you know get up in the morning and say I don't believe a sun's coming up try it you know that's not going to hinder God he going to keep right on bringing it we've seen it here where the word has been spoken that rain would come and come the day we call for it you remember the day I stood here I said it won't rain until I call for it am came out here that day and I said it will rain now and the newspapers and Gainesville said it was the wetest September I believe August or September that they ever had on record I can stand and talk all day about the healings the signs and the things but what do we if we don't see something happen every day we get all excited I do too I want to see God manifest among us but I know also in the day and the time we're living it's a horrible thing Jesus face two denominations right Pharisees Sadducees and little herodians th in we Face 969 different they say one at 13,000 is what that Bishop guy said 13,000 different denominations there's about 25,000 different ones in the message right amen and that's probably a low number see no wonder but that's no excuse for you and I I don't make excuses I make statements of truth but we've seen God do amen you come do the works he done first we've seen him do it right yes look at the next now he said I'll tell you in other words what the greater is what does he say you come to do it works he done we'll talk about the greater I'll tell you what it is what is the Greater Works Jesus could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the one thing that God couldn't himself in human flesh could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost he could preach about it he could preach that it was coming he could preach what it would be when it would get here he expound cuz that's what he done all right you remember brother BR said John preached justification he said Jesus preached sanctification amen you need that quote who's going to preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost the only ones that can pre preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the ones that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in them right right amen all right see then the Greater Works it's not just to preach I said that a minute ago was you listening it's not to make an intellectual speech see that's what they were saying brother brandom we preach the gospel he said let's you do this first yeah well all right we went through we see God has been with us all these years all right and the preaching of the Gospel not just preaching a sermon not going to church and just talking about something or Mak an intellectual speech but to preach even brother random was adamant enough to say the Bible doesn't say teach it says preach the gospel was he doing way with teachers no what the teacher supposed to preach if I don't have something from God to come out you and tell you we're going to play a tape or somebody else is going to preach why because we're not to play this games that's right that's right I I come out here with something in mind for you to see amen that's going to be very helpful somewhere down the road look what he says Jesus could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost it hasn't come yet that's the Greater Works we're doing but do the same Works he did if there's not signs following the believer he must not be a believer that's right is that sensible right and the Baptist Church I argued with him over that word I said it says he that believeth in his baptized she'll be saved it does not say he that believes he said he that believeth which means it continue Keep On Believing that's right Keep On Believing it that's right is that a deep horrible thing to understand I'm talking about Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever look what he goes on to getting in the spirit 1961 almost the same thing but look what he says he's talking about the doing he says and you come here and do the lesser Works he said but ain't none of us can stand like he did or not why not no I can't say bring me 24 of your worst cases and I guarantee you healing for every one of them no I can't say that but I can sure lay my hands on you and pray for you and believe God to heal you amen right but that's maybe not for everybody brother around say he said it's not maybe for everybody to lay their hands on and feel the surge of God go through your body and see the person healed but that doesn't mean you don't have a work a part of it but look what he says here's a platform help yourself come up here and go down through this prayer line and and let the Holy Spirit move out in the audience there over you let me see you do them works and then go preach the gospel then you do do a greater works that's wonderful but you see you don't set in the place I'm in as I said about Billy Graham I'm not throwing off on him but what are you going to do here if some guy walks in with a gun I'm going to shoot you preacher unless you change what you believe or what if he comes in with a box in his hand and he says here's a snake let's see you handle it he said we don't play games brother no no we don't play games I shoot the snake no problems but you see I'm on the spot you're not you can get up and run you know what I've always said to you and I'm not arrogant hateful or mad at anybody or nothing just telling it like it is cuz way I've always been what if the Bible comes to truth it says that they come Brother Dean was on it the other day says they come and give you a sign and the sign comes to Pi why if somebody come in here and said okay there's a dead we're going to raise the dead and the dead raises what are you going to do but see you failing to get all the scripture he said and take you to another God you could roll 40 caskets in here of dead people and you say I'm going to prove to you the Trinity's right and the dead raised what are you going to do come on what are you going to do but I'm the guy that's hollered against that right I hope to the God's help that if the day ever comes that I'm challenged on what I believe about one God and the truth of this message that if I don't stand for it throw me out that door you don't have to vote me out throw me out of the door why because I'm not no good right I believe the same God is living today I believe in that we don't have to play games we're not a little side of the road church at this well we ain't seen God in a long time well you know why cause you're blind come on if you want a testimonial meeting we'll take the rest of the day when the doctor told me he'd take my knap off 30 years ago you know what that would have meant that day still legged I looked him in the face I said you won't take my kneecap off he just looked me back and laughed and he said I will it's wore out I still got it he's dead when are we going to believe church what do we need to believe medically proven that my blood type was changed from positive a positive to a negative medically proven by the same doctors what do we need you see I'm trying to show you we've had the works of God Among Us and the Greater Works the Greater Works is to to preach the gospel in the truth Amen Let the Holy Ghost bring it in the truth look what he said Jesus could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it did not yet come that's a Greater Works it certainly is the church is to preach the baptism of the Holy Spirit Jesus said it was coming but your church has it and saying we got it and it's for you see and was a greater that is true amen what is the Greater Works is to preach Jesus Christ alive today amen not just a message to go to church and sit down and be good I hollered this 40 years ago I'm still hollering it today we've seen God manifest himself that's right and we seen people come that tried to change our Doctrine and couldn't succeed in it why because oh yeah I know what I'm just stubborn but come and show me come and show me anybody on the internet whatever come and show me where I'm off the message but yeah we don't want that that's an arrogant hateful old person we don't want that we'd rather have somebody that sets dates and and preaches all these false doctrines and all these bad ideas but they got a sweetness about them oh I just love to hear him he's just sweet sweetness ain't going to do you no good when you're in Hell looking up now brother Dale you're trying to send me to hell no uhuh I don't have anything to do with it you got to do with it right would you see what I'm talking about do you realize the importance of what we talk about in the scriptures and Jesus declared in what we read that he was the father right if youve seen me you've seen the father why ask to see the father you're looking at him he said and he said if you don't believe me believe the works you know what they wanted him to raise the dead and heal the sick they wanted him to feed everybody right but they didn't want him when he be to say I my father one when are we going to start saying I my father one come on you know I remember one day when a man raised from the dead and he was standing there and believe was Mary or one of them was brother Bob was on Wednesday really enjoyed the message we seen God come behind and fulfill his word but one of them said you know talking to Jesus he said go tell my disciples I'll go before you into Jerusalem but said tell them and what did he say tell them tell them that I go to my father oh that's good but that ain't all the scripture he said tell them I go to my father and your father you know what we got the same father right amen he said unto my God and your God we got the same God that's right well I just don't see it that's John 20 and 17 if you want to the Bible said you believe to see didn't say you see to believe if you see it it's a scientific fact I just believe he's the same all right now listen here's the point I want to get if we have the new birth if we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost we can preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right if you're born again you can tell somebody how you got born again and you know yourself that for 40 something years I've always hollered one thing I'm a firm believer in justification yes sir amen sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I've always hollered and screamed against people that say I believe brother brandham was a prophet so that means I got to be saved well the devil beat you there he heard the prophet what about all of these in the message that swore by him when he was here where are they today click on the internet what is that thing believe the sign just go on click on your internet believe the sign and see how many preachers there are in this message that has turned against brother brandom big names boy they didn't do it while they was here they scared of it but see ain't here no more so they can say all they want to like we were talking this morning about certain brother had come in the kitchen his wife was speaking in tongues and he started laughing at her making fun of her I say he blasphemed the Holy Ghost do what you want to what else did he do right you mean laughing at somebody for speaking in tongues I've always told you don't make fun of nobody I don't care whether they're a Believer an unbeliever an idiot or whatever they are don't make fun of nobody that may be the Holy Ghost on that person to see what you'll do get off that get on your message okay thank you now if we have the same father if we have the same God what would be trouble of having the same Ministry amen amen right what's the problem same God same father what's the trouble we saying we have the same ministry that's you know but I just don't see it well I guess that means it is not in existence you ought to say as far as I'm concerned you remember brother brandham when they in Africa man wrote him said we don't want you over here we don't want you to come to Africa you know what he checked it out and found out it was one person yeah right but see when you put we it makes it look good that means there's a whole group of us just one what are we listen do you believe I'm just asking you the question simple question I'm always accused of being so deep and so out and all this that and the other I just ask you a simple question did Jesus Christ have a ministry right right right the sick was healed the dead was raised the demon were cast out the food was multiplied we had a fellowship meeting here or a meeting here one time a fellowship meeting and my Lord they piled in and somebody come to me and they said what in the world we going to do we can't even go buy stuff to feed this I said put it before the people there'll be plenty of it we fed twice as many as we normally fed and had food left come on I'm not bragging I'm telling the truth these things that I'm talking about is facts it's been here for all these years right right CU you see church I've taught you what I believe I believe around the world I don't believe no one person anymore has the message brother randam brought the message there's not another messenger of an eth day messenger or this kind of messenger or that kind of one there's not another Prophet to the Gentiles all right that's right but I believe that man had the ministry of Jesus Christ you agree but did it die when he died it's supposed to go in the bride and I've never Tau you that we're the only group that's got anything right but I've taught you and believe it that the ministry that was in brother brandom is in the bride around the world the ministry of Jesus Christ is in the bride around the world and if it's in a many membered body is not going to be in one little group we only have a part of that Ministry that's right but let's make our part right let's strive for whatever is in our part but when then when I'll read to you you know what most people say when you read to the same Ministry that Jesus Christ had is here yep yep I agree with that brother Dale same Ministry Jesus Christ is here it was in brother brandham well a got no problems I'll amen you but when you say it's not in anybody else I'm going to differ with you because if not then you're going to have all of God was he poured into Christ all Christ into brother Brown brother Brown died took it with him we ain't got nothing that's what people are saying right but listen look what he goes on to say look like brother R let's read a little bit I know we won't get finished on this but I'll do part of it look what he says on the message called the unconditional Covenant that God made with his people in 1954 now remember 1954 the seals were not opened right that 63 54 and look what he says E46 The Same Spirit that was on Jesus Christ has come back on his church doing the same signs the same wonders the same Holy Ghost the same power it's the Covenant that God has given to them listen Church why can't you believe the truth and listen brother Brown said he met people who had the Holy Ghost 50 years before him that had the same identical holy ghost that come on the day of Pentecost I sit with two brothers you know it one of them said I when I got born again I got every bit of this the whole stature of perfect man when I was born again the other one said when I got born again I never did even get in the pyramid I'm still down under here somewhere that's two preachers this message I said would y'all mind if I just try to stay in between yeah you know I said one of you going that way other going that do you mind if I just stay between well that was the topic came up you've heard me many times say where brother brandham they were quoting brother brandham where he's met with people with the same Holy Ghost I said you mind if I just Express something the day of Pentecost divided into two parts you got an upper room experience of 120 then when they were born again they were right here where it says holy spirit they did not get the headstone now come on brother R said the head St ain't come yet so forget itl when I said on the day of Pentecost when the 3,000 outside they wasn't born again up here because they had not heard the word all they heard was one sermon and they got born again brought around read read the statue of perfect man he said you're born again at Faith then you advert your knowledge temperature why can't you see that so in 1954 the man is talking about the ministry of Jesus Christ look just like that he was here when he was leading Christ the same way the same Ministry Christ had in his church the same Ministry Christ had is in his church tonight same signs same wonders Same Spirit same kind of works that Jesus did here on Earth the church has to do the same thing if it's not it's not the Seed of Abraham oh it's not the Church of Jesus Christ can't be but you a big man I've told you over and over big man said down at gil of dinner we was having said Luther and wesle and him uh said Pentecost said it was false said brother R said it was false I said uh brother brother R said it was the same Holy Ghost amen I said you know well I talked to him a little bit about it and tried to help him you know he come right here to church and preach that night and preach that ausa street was false but yet he couldn't preach ER I told him he did and I don't have no problems cuz I heard him say it and somebody that I don't hear say it I don't talk about but look what he's talking about the same Ministry that Jesus Christ had you realize that brother random said and I gave it to you the other day that ausa street the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism another great prophet he calls it do you need those quotes but around calls the Holy Ghost on the zeusa street the prophet I believe everything brother B said but there's a few things I don't know and you're dumb as a rock amen but listen Church when are we going to start believing it I think it's about time to quit playing around horb don't you like I told a brother at my house one time I said why don't you get in the message or get out I wouldn't be an arrogant his wife was standing there and said brother Dale you're right he needs to get in or get out well that's pretty good when your wife will speak against you but listen what about the next one the faith that was once delivered to the Saints 1955 501 the evening e50 you read all up and down that's why I give it to you it's just so it is with the church tonight the same faith that was once delivered to the Saints is being delivered today well that was in brother bandam you Lord no see you might as well forget it then if it was all in brother random and there's nothing for me and you eat drink and be married could forget it tomorrow you die right ain't going to be a pop out of the United States going to put you in the Rapture that's right it might be a pop out of the United States puts you in jail that's right we ain't going to put you in the Rapture it's only the reveal word Holy Ghost preached by ministers who know what they're doing with the gospel well you're just you was an intellectual now you're arrogant well find something else about me that you don't like but am I telling you the truth a dumb dogy told a man of Truth one time you know a rooster crow straighten the fell her out well call me what you want to but is it the truth that's all I'm asking you look it'll be light in the evening time the holy spirit's here with the same Ministry that was delivered to the by the Lord Jesus Christ to his Apostles and she comes through a Darkness but the clouds are clearing back the same holy spirit is coming down and revealing the same thing God bless you why can't we believe it same as with give to the apostles Brother Gary asked me years ago he said brother Dale you believe that the faith of the fathers is here I didn't think no four hours and try to study it over I said yes sir you asked me today do you believe the ministry of Jesus Christ is here I wholeheartedly agree with iten it's around the world in The Bride of Jesus Christ amen M the same Ministry he had all the gifts that was in Jesus Christ is in the church amen right do we believe that all God was you put in Christ all Christ in the church and take her back to the Garden of Eden do we believe those things all right same Holy Spirit revealing the same thing you know put it page 45 is it 45 Christ M God reveal the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word you know that Jesus said even my only life did not reveal that unto thee right he said Flesh and Blood he can't do it it takes a holy ghost to reveal it you know what you can walk on a revelation you don't have to worry about it you can walk on Revelation I told my wife in the garden one day something had happened would happen and she said it'll never happen I said it'll either happen or I won't preach again she said you just quit preaching if she' had told me that I'd probably told her the same thing you know I don't mean about the preaching but because it was an impossible thing but you know what it come to P well why can't we believe in a God that lives why serve a God that's dead that you go see him on a on a Sundays in the church like a little boy you know sh we're going into God's house he's in here no I thought he lived in her heart all right same Ministry go ahead with number three Abraham's Covenant confirmed 1961 210 paragraph e 63 but the spirit that was in him he sent back down to the church so the church when this Covenant is brought into its full strength okay this is before the seals broke he's talking about the ministry of Jesus Christ he he comes after the seals breaks and talks about the ministry of Jesus Christ and that's exactly right why because it's coming to full strength when the Covenant is confirmed with God the church the people that goes into this body here to be his bride will be exactly the same spirit that was upon Christ doing the same thing the same Ministry the same power and it'll come together to be the word by word the same confirming the Covenant why can't we believe it church I mean I'm sorry for my actions and reactions and my hatefulness and hollering and screaming at you but there's one thing about it brother Brown made this statement one day and I thought that's a good one I'll hold on to it he said if you make it real soft the people are think you're trying to pull something over on that's what he said he said just lay it out there if you going to believe in Hebrews 138 how are you going to believe it okay here I'm not too good here what are you going to believe look at the next one perseverance preach in 19 and 62 wait wa on four that be number excuse me three I've lost it here we go this is the Mighty God unveil I turned the pages too far okay number four the perseverance we'll go with that one because it's in in here but look what he says on perseverance 62 so the church now if the headstone comes in Luther's time now watch him if the headstone come in Luther's time look what a out of the way place it would have been so it didn't come in Luther's time the Holy Ghost came right look if it come in Wesley's time it's got it'll come in its own predestinated time but the church will be honed in such a condition until the church's ministry will be so close and be just exactly the same kind of ministry that Jesus had to make it all fit together in the Rapture amen think about it amen all right go to number four and let's just pick out one I invite you to do one thing when you go home some of you especially ministers and the thing and just run in same Ministry and read all the things you'll find 60 70 80 times right around speaks of the same Ministry all right I just picked these as some that would be so go ahead paragraph 159 roll it on up now this is after the seal break so now we're on the other side of it and now it's right to bring him back exactly like he was at the beginning his same Ministry the same Jesus the Same power the same Holy Ghost the same one that come down on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today from Glory under glory to glory and it's back to its original seed now you remember all we went through with the original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost those with the same signs same wonders same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same Sensations it's from Glory under glory and the next will be changed from this Glory into a body like his own glorious body and we shall see him Abraham all the same think about it look at number five look at modern events made clear by prophecy paragraph 263 when he begins to reveal himself into the seed form again now where's that at we've been ringing it down in the end time the same one that went into the ground come back to be the bride that's what he's saying am just the bride and the groom it's the same Flesh and Blood the same Ministry and the same things doing just exactly what he done why can't we believe it Church look at the next one number six which is a message called Luke 63428 now these are like I said are all after the seals BR so evidently had the same idea and there that bride is looking to the coming of the Lord Jesus which that secret secret coming of Christ she'll come and catch away his bride and in the night like a book I read of Romeo and Juliet one time how he come with a lad and got his bride out among them that's what Jesus will come someday and looking for that one is not looking to his Creeds but looking to Christ waiting for him to come with his heart centered go on up now blood relation to Isaac and thing what by the word working through the same thing carrying out the same Ministry he had the same Ministry that Jesus Christ had is in his bride because where's Hebrews 138 right if he's the same yesterday today and forever now brother Brown said it like this he said now he's a same he said I didn't say the church didn't change right go we're human beings and things you know and and you didn't have the full ministry of Christ in Luther and Wesley and them right we know that but you had the ministry of the hour that they lived that was all they was responsible for the same Ministry but do you believe it what do we doing Church what's the whole thing of going to church and trying to be good I thought we got out of that right come on we went to church and denominations and we sat around and talked about a God that used to be right now am I right that's right we what do they do now a God that used to be William brandham we you know what we back here in b m we talking about a truth cuz there was a God that used to be he was back there but we just didn't believe him to be alive now we're believeing the god of William brandom but I'm like Elisha you remember Elisha y the guy that said hey I want your robe y y remember Elijah passed his robe down to Elisha Elijah done eight four Miracles Elisha done eight right double portion but he comes the Jordan he goes in with Elijah Elijah's gone and he comes back and he takes that mantle and he smites the water and he said where be the god of Elijah that's right amen water is parted amen I've taught you that ever since since I've been around because that's not what we think Elisha wasn't doubting or trying to find read your commentaries even on that scripture read your origional translations on that scripture it give you some sense anyway Elisha wasn't saying well I don't know but where's the god of Elijah I don't see him no he smoked that water and he said PL language that water parted with Elijah right I've got his manle right he's gave me the double portion you remember that's what he got he said if he's in him he's in me part right that wasn't a question where be the god of Elijah that was a statement a statement of if God is with a he's here now amen if God was in Jesus Christ he's here now if God was in William Brown he's here now you see what we make ourselves unbelievers we make ourselves doubters and little sissified babies crying I don't see it if I could see it I'd believe it if you'd believe you could see it that's why I don't back up from nothing if that's arrogant and hateful leave me alone I'm happy this way cuz I stood for 40 something years and declared this message and declared it then and declaring it now prise God I'm not looking to try to find the god of Elijah I know where he's at he's in his bride around the world manifesting himself and you know being in the bride he can be right over there that denominational church too you know right you know Out Among the denominations now the dead are being raised the sick are being healed and we s around our own see nothing they got more than what we got you know why because of you and your unbelief remember Jesus was almighty God you agree but you know in the Bible it said he had to leave a city right that's right Jesus had to leave a city because their unbelief would not allow him to work that's right right right you see I don't make excuses I talk about facts come right here one day and ask this church I said pray for me I said for months now my blood pressure has been running they kept up with it at gent Motors kept telling me I got to go to the doctor I said well I got a physical coming up my blood pressure was running from 90 to 160 to 100 sometimes 110 to 150 I came here and I said Church let's pray I got a physical Monday and I want this blood

and he got through running all his test he said Sam he said your vision is perfect said it's 2020 I walked in there I couldn't see I walked out and I could see plain this could be went 8 years8 years I never wore gces you notice me now I'm standing up here a lot of time reading my glces is in my pocket I know that I know the the things I'm not a dummy I know you can do that and squinch your eyes and do everything and I'm just saying I'll be 74 in about 3 days and they're just amazed the doctors I go to they're amazed they're wanting to find something wrong with me this okay this cholesterols sugar everything whatever you're doing keep on doing it I said Thank you dog I go in there and I have me a good time I went in one day and one of them come walking in crutches you heard me tell about he's comeing in walking on crutches I said you need to find you a doctor he said that's my trouble Sam I went to a doctor and he operated they told me I had leukemia right I looked across the desk at the man because he didn't know at that time what it was and I am not making this a Doctrine for nobody this is me he said Sam you got leukemia I said I'll tell you before we start I don't take chemotherapy he said well Sam it's a whole lot better I said Doctor you're on that side of the table you're the doctor that prescribes it I'm on this side of the table that buries the people that's the way I talk to him I said I'll do anything you say but not that went over to a cancer specialist he walked in he said Sam got good news bad news is you got leukemia but said the good news he got the kind that don't kill you he said you'll die with it not of it they can't figure out my blood you know your white white Camp they can't figure it out it goes up to 22 supposed to be 4 point something to 10 point something mine goes up to 28 next time it's 16 they can't figure it out me and that doctor we have us a good time talking I tell him I said I know who's taking care of this old boy it's sure ain't you doc he's said no it cuz I ain't giving you nothing I go every 6 months to a Cancer speci and he looks at keep doing what she doing I said was there anything else you can help me with you know can you tell me something he said no evidently it's working you see church I believe in God and I believe in praying and I believe in calling out to him like brother Dan was talking about Wednesday I believe in confessing my healing not begging God to heal me that's not in scriptures for you to beg God it's in the scriptures for you to take What God Says and stand on it and say by Stripes I'm Healed you know I told a man as a man told me one time he said where the Bible there says command ye me and this man come on musicians this man he told me he said I've quit trying to cast out the devil said I'm working on commanding the Lord I said what Pentecostal preacher you know I said what he said I'm working on commanding the Lord said see there says command ye me I said that ain't what that means that means that you take him at his word I don't care if your wording says command you don't command God you take him at his word and you say by his stripes I'm Healed and when you do you're delivered he said I don't care what I'm commanding the Lord I never talk to that guy anymore why you don't command God that's right but you believe him amen that's it you say by Stripes I'm Healed right the doctor says you got this Say by Stripes I'm Healed just confess yourself into it if nothing else let me die saying by Stripes I'm Healed I sure ain't wanting to just say well I know you know these people that got cancer first off they start out by saying by Stripes I'm Healed by stripes I'm Healed I believe God healed me after a while they kind of break down and they'll start saying well now maybe I've got it but I'm still saying by Stripes I'm Healed they first said don't have it you know don't words you know and then they'll wind up saying well maybe maybe God wants me to have cancer where they can treat me and find some way to cure cancer come on folks you're breaking down you're trying to prop up something just say by Stripes I'm healed amen and if I die don't put it on my Tombstone I died with that that's right why because I believe the same God lives today that always lived I've had experiences with him that's beyond most mortal beings has had and I believe him I believe him sitting right there back years ago when out in the world I just told everybody I said well he's coming back I tell June I said boy he's going to have a rough road well you know what she's back L you know what I turned around and said the same thing about her she's coming back well you know but you see right before he came back I told my wife another thing I said he's not only coming back honey he's going to be standing in the pull pit preaching with me she said what I said that's where he coming he come to the Lord and got straightened up about 6 months later he come to me he said Daddy I want to talk to you I said you don't want to talk to me he said do you know what I'm talking about I said yes I know what you're talking about go ask your mom but you don't want to talk to me cuz I ain't calling you to preach you run until he runs you down boy most say my son's called a preach he's going to preach today I said run and when he runs you down you can't go no further then you get up and tell it and I'll back you up there's another 6 months he said Daddy it's finished I said okay I'll tell everybody you call to preach but I said Son God showed me you going to be standing in the pull pit with me when you were still lost and out in the world why cuz I believe in that kind of a God what's the matter amen what do we got let's stand 556 in spal book 566 anybody have a need the same that raised up Jesus from the dead well in you in you standing for brother dick all right he's standing in place of brother dick but brother Dick had to go home
