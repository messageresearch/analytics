that uh y'all pretty much took my sermon away from me this morning brother bob and and the reading of the in the in the reading of the scripture during the service so i guess i don't need to read it this morning so we're going to go to ezekiel 37 amen amen at verse one we got two passes of scriptures we're going to read and then you'll have your seats if you got to say amen amen and the bible says the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out into this carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man son of man unto you be ashamed and confound oh wait i'm sorry son of man can these bones live and i answered o lord god thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them o ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter unto you and ye shall live and i will lay sueth upon you and will bring a flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that i am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and i prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when i beheld low the soups and the flesh came upon them and the skin covered them above there was no breath in them then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain and they may live so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came upon them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off from part from our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord behold o my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you upon the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves o my people and brought you up out of your graves and ye shall and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and i shall place you in your own land then shall ye know that i i the lord have spoken it and performed it saith the lord amen and we're gonna jump over to first kings 18 read a few scriptures here i apologize for the long scripture reading but i just want to lay a foundation before i get started first kings 18. we're gonna start at verse 29 and we'll go on down you gotta say man and he answered i'm sorry 18 verse 29 and it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob and unto the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar was great which contained two measures of seed and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time and the water ran upon about the altar and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art that thou art god in israel and i am thy servant that i have done all these things at thy word hear me o lord hear me that these people may know that they'll thou art the lord god and that thou has turned their hearts back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stone in the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw they fell on their faces and they said lord god the lord he is the god and the lord he is the god amen this time we bow our heads lord jesus lord we just thank you lord for the lord just this opportunity lord once again lord to just lift up the name of jesus lord to give you praise lord and create an atmosphere lord of worship now lord we've read your word we pray that you quicken it lord move me out of the way oh god lord lord you speak to your people oh god lord you be the preacher this morning lord and you also be the hearer oh god in the name of jesus amen hey man you may be seated this morning i won't be before you long but this morning i want to preach on create an atmosphere for the supernatural and if i had to put a sub-topic to it it would be it's manifesting time and we see in the scriptures here in ezekiel that the lord asked ezekiel son of man can these bones live and we want to focus on the atmospheres this morning why did god ask ezekiel can these bones live if we if we want to know the answer to that we have to look at the atmosphere that was created before god ever spoke and asked that question to him and if we look at elijah we're gonna look at the same things this morning but god knew to ask ezekiel could these bones live why because he knew that whatever he put on the inside of him when that word came to him when the word came to his doorstep how he would respond to it same with same with elijah they they questioned god they asked you know they they they had their own image of the lord and they wanted to just forget about god so god elijah had faith in who his god was just like this day we should have faith in who god is [Applause] we look at the things that happened in brother branham's ministry and i don't know why but it seems like this day we don't think it could happen this day what brother branham spoke that though in the bible says that these very same works what happened that's what's going to have to take place this morning we're creating an atmosphere for the supernatural so elijah he had faith in who god was and he knew because he had a testimony because god had already shown him many times before that he was a god that would provide his every need that he was a god that would show up to prove his word god's word cannot fail the scripture says my word have i sent out and it shall not return to me void so elijah knew elijah knew that when he said that god was going to show up god had to do it god had to show up to perform his word so the scripture says that elijah began to prepare the to repair the altar so we know that this is an altar up here what do we do up here we worship we praise we create an atmosphere for god to move that's what we do so that same altar he began to repair it he began to it and you notice the scripture he did many impossible things fire can he he began to pour water not one not two but three times upon the altar because he knew that the fire of the lord was gonna come down but we know as humans that where there is that where something is in water fire cannot dwell upon it if you dread something and you try to set it on fire it won't catch on fire why because the two materials are not compatible so god loves to work in the impossible oh i'm trying not to get ahead of myself but god loves to work at the impossible he lets the situation in your life get so bad to where it seems like there's no hope when you don't know where that last dime's coming from or when you don't know where your meal is coming from then he shows up just to prove himself [Applause] so elijah created this impossible scenario and it wasn't just it wasn't just for elijah but it was the people who had strayed away from god and created an atmosphere of doubt surrounding what god would do when they seen time and time and time again how god had shown up to prove himself even at the red sea he showed up to prove himself he showed up to prove himself time and time again but still they got weary in their faith why they got weary in their faith so he begins to create this impossible scenario and god begin to move but notice a scripture says that elijah began basically to give worship to the lord in the midst of that he had already sent out a word he had already said what his god was going to do he wouldn't he didn't have to do nothing else but he created an atmosphere this morning today we need to create an atmosphere for the supernatural this morning the supernatural works aren't just in the scriptures supernatural works not just in brother branham they should happen right now brother branham said when the bride gets into position when the bride gets into position divine healings will take place the sick can be healed the dead will be raised we look all all through brother branham's ministry where people would come up in the prayer line and they would say well my loved one he's out in the world and i want them to be in church and what would happen as soon as they finish saying the prayer that loved one that they were praying for will walk through the door that would happen now that can happen now it's manifesting time it's time not to be playing church we should become what brother branham said we should be what the scriptures have told you what you are the scripture says now we are the sons of god and the scripture also says the works that i do you shall do also if any man believe on me the works that i do you shall do also it's manifest in time it's not time to be playing with the word the word have said what you are they have told you what you are but satan loves to make you doubt what you are he loves in the in the atmosphere of faith this morning there's an atmosphere of faith but in the in this myth there's an atmosphere of doubt also in this this morning in this presence there's an atmosphere of doubt why you ain't seen it in a while you ain't seen the move of god many people have walked away why because they were looking for the power everything that has happened this day people that have walked away from this word it happened in scripture when jesus began to talk to the people and tell them what was required of them they began to walk away why because they couldn't receive the word they couldn't understand it when he began to tell him that you can't you don't have no part with me if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood but he began to talk to him they couldn't take the word but when he was performing miracles it was a great crowd when it was a great crowd when he began to heal the sick raise the dead but when it came to the word they couldn't handle it i'm gonna take a few examples we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna go through the bible this morning can y'all get can y'all preach with me this morning i'm gonna go off i'm not even gon i'm not even gonna bother with this this morning i'ma just follow the leadership of the lord [Music] but let's let's let's let's take some scriptures in the bible let's look at zacharias this morning how many know the story of zechariah how many know he was john the baptist's father amen brother branham said that the eighth the bible says that the angel of the lord came to zachariah and it began to give him a word now brother branham said that why would zechariah doubt that word when he had examples he had examples of the word he had hannah he had sarah him being a prophet he knew the word he knew what had been taking place so he knew that it wasn't impossible for that thing to happen or for god to perform it but then you then months later you got married the same angel came to her with the same word but let's look at the atmospheres this morning zachariah had an atmosphere of doubt when it had been proven when it had been proven what god could do but mary had an atmosphere of faith in believing in something that would that never happened before it was impossible but notice they both asked the same exact question how can this thing be but the atmosphere see god knew who to come to he knew how to prove his word there was many virgins many virgins that he could have came to but you know that god always before they were ever before god ever moves on something he already knows the pre-context of the situation he knew that he knew mary's heart he knew he also knew zechariah would doubt the word he also knew he would doubt the word that's why he came back with the same scenario just to give us an example that that example is you can sit in the same church hear the same word and come out with two different outcomes but brother branham said here this little woman had to believe something that had never happened she probably searched the scriptures just to see is it possible but it was she wasn't searching with a doubt in her heart she believed the word even though she had no proof the scripture says faith you believing in something you cannot see she had no proof that it happened but yet she believed and it fulfilled god's word had to be proven at that moment because her faith began to believe in the supernatural that atmosphere was created the atmosphere was created in order for god to move this morning this day let's create an atmosphere for god to move this morning [Applause] the scripture says you speak to the mountain lord help me what did god tell him you got the power this gift i've given to you you got to operate it we've gotten too too weak we've gotten too i don't know what's going to relax we've gotten too relaxed with the word and lackadaisical and we the scripture says faith without works is dead god got to do everything for us now we can't believe him for a headache we can't believe him for nothing no more i don't know about y'all god has proven his word to me time and time and time and time and time again so i don't need nobody to preach me up i don't need nobody to try to sang me up his word has already been proven to me it's been quickened in my heart the word my word have i quickened in you that you would manifest this oh my god the problem is we can't believe because to us this is a god of history it's a god of history to us it can't happen no more we hear stories they're good stories good stories good to tell good to go along with your sermon but the faith that was once delivered to the saints is rare now that faith and that believing in the word even though they couldn't see it it's not here no more it's rare it's rare i don't know i don't know what's wrong brother branham said that we would manifest these things at the end time we we listen to the very same tapes but it's just tapes you are the word you are the word the bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt among us but remember jesus said remember that i am in the father the father in me i in you and whatever you ask in my name that will i do that will he do in the midst we listened to all the stories of the bible listen to what happened in brother branham's ministry what about now what about now raising from the dead sick being healed y'all looking at a modern day lazarus i was dead but now i live 2019. in the operating room for a simple procedure dead i don't know how long i was gone but i was dead went in on a tuesday morning brother wait i ain't wake up until friday afternoon dead but god raised me from the dead many testimonies i got a friend that i hadn't seen in a long time but his heart just completely gave out dead for 30 minutes i don't know if we got any nurses or doctors in here but the brain cannot take cannot go without oxygen for a certain amount of time correct how long is that ten minutes eight minutes the brain cannot go without oxygen for eight minutes he was dead for 30 minutes 30 made it to the hospital brought back no brain damage he was there to tell the testimony of what god did for him that can happen right now we're not serving the god of history the same works god will do today he will and can't perform it but you got to move into position and know who you are this morning [Music] the problem is we don't know who we are it's father's day our heavenly father the scripture said now we are the sons of god we are the sons and daughters of god at this morning [Applause] that word lives on the inside of you so whatever you say whatever you speak it has to move it has to operate psalms 82 says and i have told you ye are gods and then jesus reminded us he said does not the law say ye are gods the scriptures told you who you are but where's the manifestation of who you are huh where's the speaking speaking the world and living on it where is that at where is the where is the changing of an atmosphere just when you walk in the room where's that [Music] the atmosphere if you want god to do something for you you create an atmosphere for him to move but it ain't about how much you read the message it ain't about how much you read about it ain't even about how much you pray you know what it's about it's your belief it's your faith we look at these stories and brother branham he had the gift of divine healing but if y'all read the message anybody read it what would brother branham say do you believe do you have faith that's what he would ask him so god moved based off of the faith he proved himself off of your faith it wasn't about the prophet it was more so him trying to increase your faith if no faith is present god can still move and i'ma tell you later on he can still move but these supernatural things that we're that we come to church to be an expectation of it's not about who behind the pulpit preaching or who behind the pulpit singing it's about the atmosphere you bring it's about the liquor fire you bring it many times in the scripture let's take the children of israel because because i love using them the children of israel god had done many things for them time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again every time he did something they still had doubt in their heart at the red sea doubt in their heart when god had performed many many works in egypt still doubting their heart the pill of fire doubt in their heart open up the red sea doubt in their heart god still moving in the midst of doubt doubt don't stop god from moving you think because you think because you think you know more and it's it's oh well that ain't that's not logical god ain't logical at all ain't logical at all it ain't logical for that to happen if you if you read your bible there's many unlogical things i don't even know if that's a word unlogical things that happen a man ripped the jaws of a lion a little boy killed a bear and a lion a little boy slayed a giant who hands was bigger than him i don't know who used that example but he had 14 inch fingers he'll slap you and then come around the other side and unlogical but in the midst of that unlogical happening god moved even though the prophet hit god's prophet doubted the word god still moved just to just to shake the faith of the believer children of israel had known what god had done for him knew what god would do for them but still with doubt in the heart he still operated in his attributes they get down let's get let's take david and i preached this last sunday good lord just gave it to me take david david had conquered so many things god used him so many times and they're at zig lag and the enemy had completely overtaken took everything nobody died but they took everything and the scripture says that the people were sore they began to weep till they couldn't weep no more they begin to cry so they couldn't cry no more even david began to cry but then it says david encouraged himself in the lord he encouraged himself even though he lost two wives and children and in that atmosphere he asked lord shall i overtake and recover and the lord said surely you shall overtake and recover all he said you go back and reclaim what's yours and you ain't gonna lose nothing amen that scripture is to us whatever we've lost recover it and you won't lose it loved ones out in the world recovering them they're yours this morning they are yours let's make the word live this morning let's make the word live today so he went back and recovered all in the midst just to prove god to prove himself again and later on down the road he still had to prove himself to david again because david had to write i'll lift up mine eyes into the heels from which cometh my health when god when god had proven himself to david time and god used him to prove his word and he still doubted let's take john ryan it's another testament of faith wasn't divine healing faith he went to brother branham i can't see brother branham said do you believe he never he never said i can heal you your belief he said yes i believe he said well then you go confessing your healing john ryan i can see i can see i can see i can see and the atmosphere of doubt came at him you still can't see john you confessing what you confess and you can't see so he went back he that that doubt overtaking him and he went back brother branham i thought you said i could see i thought you said i was healed what did brother branham say what did he say i thought you believed spoken word do you believe this morning [Applause] he said i do i do believe he said well go confessing your healing so he went on again i can see i can see i can see i can see and he ended up going to a barbershop god took him to the lion's den where you had the doubting lions it wasn't courageous lions it was doubting lions i can see i can see i can see i can see i can see john you still saying you can see and you can't see yet you've been talking about this and you still ain't if god ain't done it for you yet he ain't gonna do it for you you might as well just stop you making a fool of yourself i can see i can see i can see all that doubt surrounding him he's still confessing the word that came to his door i can see i can see i can see i can see till his eyes popped up and he ran the word had to be proven in the midst of doubt [Applause] god don't just make his word happen he make the situation look like it ain't gonna happen then it happens i can see i can see in the midst of doubt good friends of john it can't happen it can't happen john you've been blind almost all your life you confessing this now you are old man what you need your vision for you too old like my old pastor say you got one foot in the grave and one foot on earth we're waiting on you to die in that atmosphere in the atmosphere zechariah created god shut his mouth a prophet he said i'ma shut your mouth until the word that i have spoken to you is fulfilled and if we look at that if we if we continue to look god created god made the situation worse elizabeth did get pregnant but john was dead hadn't moved in months but when the word came the word began to come and john met the word and the word was made flesh and the word came to elizabeth who's had an atmosphere of hurt and doubt because she did get pregnant but the baby had not moved imma take it a little deeper it didn't have a heartbeat he wasn't shouting yet another atmosphere elizabeth she knew that this was a child's truly sent from god and for the situation of the one child that i have that the lord finally bestowed upon me is dead that atmosphere surrounded her but the word came to her door and quickened quicken itself amen amen thy word have i quickened in you that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwelling you it will quicken your mortal body the word was quicken in john he received the holy ghost right then and there let me tell y'all something those same things have happened in my life i got a friend right now say he was driving home late at night from wherever and he said he ran out of gas and he only got one car for his family ran out of gas and he just in the atmosphere something came to him and said jesus turned water into wine and something said you got two water jugs in the back of your car so he said he took those two water jugs and the words had to be proven at that moment and he said lord you turn water into wine now i need you to turn this water in the gas and he said he put it in his car and drove all the way home and his car's still working the way it's supposed to [Music] i took that testimony last monday brother wade yes i had some money in my pocket but i needed to cash it first and i had to go to work and and go to i go to work at six o'clock in the morning banks don't open till nine brother wade i'm i'm i'm halfway between a quarter of a tank and e something said you preached last night about creating an atmosphere for the supernatural prove it amen so i said lord if you gave joshua the power to make the sun stand still you give me the power and to speak to this needle and tell it not to move until i put gas in it brother wade i drove all the way i lived 30 miles from my house drove all the way to work i had to drive five exits to get to the bank drove all the way to work to the bank back to work still ain't put gas in it needle still didn't move went to go grab lunch went to go grab lunch went to walmart the bank called me sir we shorted you on your stay drove all the way to the bank then finally drove to the gas station the needle was where i told it to stay [Applause] the atmosphere in believing the word let me tell you something the prophet said this is what he said he says what we need is the holy ghost it's a holy ghost an atmosphere where the power of god moving on one accord one place gathered together under the atmosphere of expecting god to do something god to move and do signs and wonders amen let's move ourselves into that bracket step up on faith move out of these three dimensions into the next one god called you to be supernatural [Music] but satan loves to bring an atmosphere in the midst of you because he knows if you just if you just get into position if you just get to know who you are he's already defeated if the bride can just recognize who she is if she can recognize the power in the host of angels that's surrounding her you are the pride of jesus christ an invincible army misses jesus you got a legions of angels surrounding you at your disposal your husband don't play about you your husband i'm sorry your husband will not let nothing happen to you i'm sorry for that slang saying y'all your husband don't play about you your husband got your back the same omnipotent power that god holds is at your disposal operating through the power of the holy ghost if god is with us where be his miracles you have the mind of christ if you are fulfilling scripture anybody fulfilling scripture this morning if you are fulfilling scripture and you are the word the word says let this mind be in you which was in christ jesus who thought it not robbery who thought it not robbery to be equal with god what's wrong with us today it's like the scripture saying we got a form of godliness but denying the power thereof there's power in the name of jesus and you carry that name so there's power in you if you believe in the supernatural you got the power you hold brother brandon said we have the title to our inheritance and if you believe the word i know my about i don't know about y'all bible you know y'all might hire y'all might have a new world version where they gender friendly and they don't want to hurt nobody feelings [Applause] i don't know about y'all but my bible says let me get dignified for this one [Applause] my bible says that my bible says that the word was made manifest so know about y'all but i can speak to the mountain and tell it to be cast into the sea and it can happen [Music] i don't know about y'all i can speak to limbs and they'll grow back i can speak to the dead they'll be raised my bible says that he was wounded for my transgressions bruised for my iniquities and the chastisement of my peace was upon him and by his stripes i was healed ain't no ears ain't no aim was you know what that means it's already done [Music] [Applause] i don't have to wait for it no more it's right now it's manifested in me now [Applause] whatever you desire whatever you have in need of it's right now you ain't got to wait for it i don't know why we as christians we think we got to become somebody else i hope i don't offend nobody if i do i'm sorry take it up with god i don't know why we as christians got to put on an atmosphere of impersonation and i i'm sorry if i offend anybody once again i don't think i don't know why we think if we become brother branham god will do something for you god will do something for you if brother bob brother aaron brother sam you ain't got to become brother branham those testimonies that's brother branham's where is your testimony the scripture says that we shall overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony where's your testimony at this morning what did god do for you huh what did god do for you there's pat satan just don't want you to get into position because when you do he knows he can't do nothing with you he that's why he tried to make you doubt whether you i don't know why you come i beat it i beat you a long time ago you remember what you did 20 years ago brother bob brother aaron you remember what you did you remember how you used to be and you thank god please with that now you know what you did last night and you call yourself a son of god he loves to whisper in your ear cause he knows he can't holler at you he know he can't yell at you so he'll come and whisper in your ear now you know what you was doing last night you shouldn't have been doing that you know what you was doing last night now you remember what how you remember how you used to be you remember what you used to be and you thank god love you you thank god love you you was a sinner god called you a sinner that's what he called you said you came into the world speaking lies and you think that god loves you you think that god love you when he do that he know that you got the power to destroy him at that moment but he makes you doubt what you have because he's already been defeated god already defeated him but he if he can get you to take your eyes off of what's on the inside of you he got you he knows god don't play about you that's why he don't come to him about you he knows how much confidence god has in you because if he didn't he would have never went to god about job god remember when you go through trials god has confidence in who you are he has confidence in the life that he's put on the inside of you he has confidence in you as a believer there's nothing impossible for you [Music] do y'all we read the same bible right doesn't the scripture say with god all things are possible and it also says that there's nothing impossible for god and then he told me that he lived on the inside of me so that means there's nothing impossible for me there's nothing impossible for you so you can speak a world and live on it amen you can speak to a sickness and it'll leave you can speak to demons and they will leave you can speak in whatever you speak you have [Music] god you put that power in my hands i don't know what to ask for god knew not to come and tell me ask what you will i said give me three billion right nine and give me ten later that'll be me but god knew the hearts of everybody we say we want that had it right experience oh it's just god didn't devastate it right if he would have did that for me he ain't gonna do it for you thank you sister not with that atmosphere not with the character that you have he knew he knew to do that for her because he knew her desire he knew her heart he already knew what she would ask for so when it came and the word came to her door and it wasn't a deep word the word ain't got to be deep for you to believe it ain't got to be the seals laid out before you the seventh thunders do you hear his voice it ain't got to be all that the word that came to her door was a story about squirrels can somebody say squirrels squirrels that simple word and she said ain't nothing but the truth that word brought the atmosphere of asking whatever you will brother brandon said something came up and said ask what you will whatever you want if you want a million dollars right now that's what i would ask for but god knew her heart he knew he works on both ends of the spectrum i read a quote with brother branham said yo you can't even believe without first god allowing it without first him working your faith you can't even believe without god working your faith she believed that little story in the presence of god came down ask what you will this morning i'ma say ask what you will ask what you will this morning if you create the atmosphere ask what you will whatever you have need of ask what you will it can take place this morning ask what you will speak to the mountains speak to your trials speak to your tribulation speak to the sickness [Applause] speak to your lover speak your loved ones through the door right now and the atmosphere came down and all she said was i want the salvation of my two boys and their hearts were pricked right there and they gave their lives to the lord this morning do you believe in the supernatural you believe that whatever you want right now this morning will happen do you got faith that didn't happen do you really believe do you really believe this morning can we

a need today let god take care of it he said give me your verdict [Music] so give him to him let god have him he can handle him way better than you can i promise you just put it on him because he

[Music] praise his name praise his name he's in the house [Applause] hey man let's give the lord a hand clapping praise again god bless you brother good job you sound kind of like a veteran god can do a lot in a very quick period of time and that's what we need we need young people they can go down that aisle about 25 times and still be able to go down that aisle 25 more times but thank god because it's an inspiration it's it's i was thinking the other day it is it's a supernatural thing that brother brown talks about the supernatural element of a mystery well we're the mystery amen so we have a supernatural element that the world can't they can't if you if we were all to get together and start talking about the word of god in this hour that we know and a stranger walks up what are you talking about why because you're in another atmosphere now if that guy in fact whoever that is if they go what was that again what you talking about this would you get that out yeah well then you're good but now they some people go whoa i don't want any of that well it's not for them not for everybody but that's okay it's for us it's for us just claimed it it's precious to us we don't everyone get rid of it we want to stun around we want to talk about it we want to we want to praise his name and that's what we come to do today and our brother he oh i believe that faith and he don't know it but i was talking to brother bob and we've been talking on faith but we're going to do some more on faith because i believe faith brother brown said faith is the key right faith is the key to unlock the door we got some doors that need to be unlocked so we need to have the key and that down at the bottom of the pyramid that's a big wive down there it says faith so we need to have faith faith for the time the prophet of god said i think we need faith for the time john wesley didn't need faith we get we then martin luther didn't need the faith we did they weren't they weren't having faith for a rapture that's right you and i are gonna have to have faith for a rapture we're gonna have to have faith for a body change we're gonna have to have faith for a resurrection faith and then brother branham now let me tell you something real quick brother brown said jesus walked in the world of perfect faith right yes read his life he said oh if i had perfect faith the bills would quit coming the car would stay full of gas i wouldn't have no worries at all brother branham said jesus walked in a world of perfect faith and look what happened to him for three and a half years they hated him they wanted to stone him they wanted to throw him off a cliff they called him a devil he probably was cast out of many different places he cried he wept over jerusalem it wasn't a fine party that he was in but brother brown said he walked in the world so i think that's what we're we're we're trying to get that perfect faith to where nothing you know nothing's going to harm us and we have no no jesus hung on a cross with perfect faith with nail holes in his hand and looked like a piece of hamburger meat but brother brown said he walked in the world of perfect faith what you know what he did he knew who he was as you were saying today we got to know who we are and stay focused on that who we are we are the son of man we are the word made flesh i've been reading that scripture well read it at y'all's church that we have made the word made flesh and the perfect faith then can be in us not that our bills are going to get paid not that all these things no but you know what you know who you are when you get up in the morning you know who you are when you go to bed you know who you are even when you go through a trial there you go you know who you are and you don't lose that i don't i don't have bad days and i'm not a dale i don't have good days and i'm and i'm not a dad no i'm a dad all the time because i was born in the family so you're a christian you're born into the family of god you're going to have trials and tribulation but you know what you're going to make it through we read the book the book says we win and i keep reading that book and i keep reading that book it's kind of like the tortoise and the hair right who wins the race the turtle always wins read the book 20 times or 100 times turtle always wins so the bride's always going to win we're going to find a way you know who it is it's jesus christ so let's bow our heads we're going to take a few moments out of a couple hours be back at two o'clock our brother will be preaching for us again the lord to give him strength and come back and be in the service expecting that we gonna get something else amen let's bow our heads still lord thank you for this day that you give us father just bless our brother and keep him strong lord we appreciate what he said father now i pray that it goes into our heart lord and becomes real that we do know who we are and what we're doing here lord now thank you

up [Music] [Applause] i am [Music] [Applause] [Music] when i wake up in the morning when i lay my hand here [Music] so so you
